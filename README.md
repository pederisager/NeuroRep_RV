# NeuroRep Replication Project

## Project description 

  Not every published finding turns out to be a robust and replicable effect, and it is therefore important to differentiate robust findings from chance findings, preferably before the latter have an unwarranted impact on scientific theories. However, given that the published record of findings in psychology is vast and largely unreplicated, the number of findings that merit replication likely exceeds what can be addressed with the resources we have available. Researchers thus have to choose which among many findings would be the most valuable to replicate. In order to make this process more efficient and transparen, we develop and test the feasibility of applying a general study selection procedure in social fMRI research. The selection procedure is based on quantifying the [replication value](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/2gurz) of replication targets. This repository contains all files related to our investigation of this study selection method, to be reported in a forthcoming paper. 

## Repository structure

The structure of this repository is based on the Psych-DS data specification (version 1.0.1). For details on the specification, see: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8o5jnWk0Iqp_J06PTu5NjBfVsdoPbBhstht6W0fFp0/edit?usp=sharing (draft in progress)

Because there is no validator app for the specification yet, we cannot at this time guarantee full compliance with the spec. Because the spec itself is under development, the structure of this repository may change as the spec gets updated. If so, we will log the current relevant version number of the spec in this document.
