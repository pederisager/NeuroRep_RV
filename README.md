# NeuroRep Replication Project
### Component 1: Selecting target study based on replication value.


## Project description 

This repository contains materials and data related to the first component of the NeuroRep project. The goal of this project component is to select a target study for replication based partly on quantitative estimates of the replication value of a large dataset of relevant studies within the social neuroscience literature. A subgoal is to empirically validate the replication value quantification procedure against the intuitive judgement of a sample of researchers within the field. 

### Goal A
Large dataset (“dataset A”) that researchers can use when deciding to browse options for replication. Minimally, this contains year, citation count (extract 2, and see if we can find a way to do google as well), sample size, altmetric score (extract, perhaps see if we can extract again at the end or project to update this).

### Goal B
Smaller dataset (“dataset B”) that is a (random?) sample of A, where we code more information, giving us an opportunity to compare the A-dataset formula with the B-dataset formula outcomes.

### Goal C
An even smaller dataset (“dataset C”) of about 10 papers that are drawn from top, middle and low range RV of [A or B]. Giving us an opportunity to compare this ranking to how researchers in the field of social neuroscience would rank these ten papers after reading their abstracts (with optionally some additional minimal info to ensure all ten abstracts contain the same information).


## Repository structure

The structure of this repository is based on the Psych-DS data specification (version 1.0.1). For details on the specification, see: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8o5jnWk0Iqp_J06PTu5NjBfVsdoPbBhstht6W0fFp0/edit?usp=sharing (draft in progress)

Because there is no validator app for the specification yet, we cannot at this time guarantee full compliance with the spec. Because the spec itself is under development, the structure of this repository may change as the spec gets updated. If so, we will log the current relevant version number of the spec in this document.
