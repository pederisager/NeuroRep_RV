NeuroRep Replication Project - Component 1
Selecting target study based on replication value.
##################################################

# Project description 

This repository contains materials and data related to the first component of the NeuroRep project. The goal of this project component is to select a target study for replication based partly on quantitative estimates of the replication value of a large dataset of relevant studies within the social neuroscience literature. A subgoal is to empirically validate the replication value quantification procedure against the intuitive judgement of a sample of researchers within the field. 
# Repository structure

The structure of this repository is based on the Psych-DS data specification (version 1.0.1). For details on the specification, see: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8o5jnWk0Iqp_J06PTu5NjBfVsdoPbBhstht6W0fFp0/edit?usp=sharing (draft in progress)

Because there is no validator app for the specification yet, we cannot at this time guarantee full compliance with the spec. Because the spec itself is under development, the structure of this repository may change as the spec gets updated. If so, we will log the current relevant version number of the spec in this document.
