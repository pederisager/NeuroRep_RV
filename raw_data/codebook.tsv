tcs	"Total Citation Score. CWTS citation counts - excluding self-citations, downloaded 2020-10-28"
mcs	"Mean Citation Score. Identical to ""tcs"" since scores are calculated for individual articles."
tncs	"Total Normalized Citation Score. CWTS citation impact of article relative to the primary cluster to which the article belongs. The score represents how many more times the article is cited relative to the average citation count of an article in its cluster. I.e. An article that is cited 10 times, and that Mean Normalized Citation Score. belongs to a cluster in which articles are cited 4 times on average, will receive a tncs score of 10/4=2.5"

mnjs	"Identical to ""tcs"" since scores are calculated for individual articles."
pp_top_perc	"Proportion of Journal Subject Categories to which the article belongs, in which the article is among the top ten percent most highly cited. For example, if an article belongs to 4 Journal Subject Categories, and is among the top ten most highly cited in 2 of those categories, it's pp_top_perc score would be 2/4=0.5."
pp_uncited	"Binary. Is ""tcs"" citation counts for the article equal to 0? 1=yes, 0=no"
prop_self_cits	"The proportion of the ""tcs"" citation counts that are self-citations"
int_cov	"From CWTS: This was developed as an indicator of the fit of applying research metrics in research evaluation procedures. The working hypothesis is that the higher the int_cov, the more relevant is the literature in WoS for the scholarly communication a paper belongs to, e.g. in a certain field (so int_cov is normally very high, up to >80% in life, natural, and biomedical sciences, and high in psychology and the cognitive sciences >70%). Vice versa, if the int_cov is low, the adequacy of research metrics is research assessment contexts is relatively poor (e.g., in law, political science, all of the humanities)."
p_oa	"Binary. Is the article open access? 1=yes, 0=no"
p_oa_gold	"Binary. Is the article gold open access? 1=yes, 0=no"

p_oa_green	"Binary. Is the article green open access? 1=yes, 0=no"
sample_size_orig	Sample size as coded by the original (BA student) coder.
