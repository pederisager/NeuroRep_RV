Abstract = {{Previous neuroimaging studies support the assumption of a strong link
   between perception and action, demonstrating that the motor system is
   involved when others' actions are observed. One question that is still
   open to debate is which aspects of observed actions engage the motor
   system. The present study tested whether motor activation corresponds to
   the difficulty of the observed action, using Fitts's law. This law
   postulates that the difficulty of any movement (ID) is a function of the
   distance to the target (A) and the target width (W). In an observation
   task, the ID of the observed action was manipulated orthogonally to W
   (by using five different As). The results revealed activity in the
   primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the basal
   ganglia in response to increasing ID levels, but not in response to
   different levels of A or W. Thus, activation in the motor system during
   action observation is not driven by perceptual parameters but by the
   motor difficulty of the observed action.}},

Title = {{Neural bases of human mate choice: Multiple value dimensions, sex

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-73}},
Abstract = {{Mate choice is an example of sophisticated daily decision making
   supported by multiple componential processes. In mate-choice literature,
   different characteristics of the value dimensions, including the sex
   difference in the value dimensions, and the involvement of
   self-assessment due to the mutual nature of the choice, have been
   suggested. We examined whether the brain-activation pattern during
   virtual mate choice would be congruent with these characteristics in
   terms of stimulus selectivity and activated brain regions. In measuring
   brain activity, young men and women were shown two pictures of either
   faces or behaviors, and they indicated which person they would choose
   either as a spouse or as a friend. Activation selective to spouse choice
   was observed face-selectively in men's amygdala and behavior-selectively
   in women's motor system. During both partner-choice conditions,
   behavior-selective activation was observed in the temporoparietal
   regions. Taking the available knowledge of these regions into account,
   these results are congruent with the suggested characteristics of value
   dimensions for physical attractiveness, parenting resources, and
   beneficial personality traits for a long-lasting relationship,
   respectively. The medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices
   were nonselectively activated during the partner choices, suggesting the
   involvement of a self-assessment process. The results thus provide
   neuroscientific support for the multi-component mate-choice mechanism.}},

   Low-frequency rTMS reduces implicit gender stereotypes}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{90-104}},
Abstract = {{By nature, stereotypes require processes of categorization or semantic
   association, including social information about groups of people. There
   is empirical evidence that the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) processes
   domain-general semantic information, and supports social knowledge. A
   recent study showed that inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (rTMS) to the ATL reduced racial stereotypes on an implicit
   association test (IAT). However, it was not determined whether this was
   caused by changes to specific social, or general semantic processing, or
   both. The current study addresses these theoretical issues. The design
   investigated the effect of rTMS to the left or right ATL, or a sham
   stimulation, on a social IAT (gender stereotypes), a non-social IAT
   (living versus non-living associations), and a non-semantic control
   (Stroop) task. The results showed that low-frequency rTMS to both left
   and right ATL significantly reduced D-scores on the gender IAT compared
   to the sham group; however, there were no differences on the non-social
   IAT or the Stroop. The findings show the ATL has a role in mediating
   stereotypes, and the decrease of bias after stimulation could be due to
   weakening of social stereotypical associations either within the ATL or
   via a network of brain regions connected with the ATL.}},

   self-referenced items}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{126-145}},
Abstract = {{Previous behavioral work suggests that processing information in
   relation to the self enhances subsequent item recognition. Neuroimaging
   evidence further suggests that regions along the cortical midline,
   particularly those of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), underlie this
   benefit. There has been little work to date, however, on the effects of
   self-referential encoding on source memory accuracy or whether the
   medial PFC might contribute to source memory for self-referenced
   materials. In the current study, we used fMRI to measure neural activity
   while participants studied and subsequently retrieved pictures of common
   objects superimposed on one of two background scenes (sources) under
   either self-reference or self-external encoding instructions. Both item
   recognition and source recognition were better for objects encoded
   self-referentially than self-externally. Neural activity predictive of
   source accuracy was observed in the medial PFC (Brodmann area 10) at the
   time of study for self-referentially but not self-externally encoded
   objects. The results of this experiment suggest that processing
   information in relation to the self leads to a mnemonic benefit for
   source level features, and that activity in the medial PFC contributes
   to this source memory benefit. This evidence expands the purported role
   that the medial PFC plays in self-referencing.}},

Title = {{Mental attributes and temporal brain dynamics during bargaining: EEG
   source localization and neuroinformatic mapping}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{159-177}},
Abstract = {{It was previously shown by fMRI studies that unfair offers during an
   ultimatum bargaining game activate regions in the brain associated with
   emotions and conflict, leading to decisions inconsistent with standard
   economic theory. The temporal dynamics of emotional processing and
   mental attributes were not clear due to the coarse temporal resolution
   in those studies (similar to 2 s). Here, the ultimatum game was studied
   by EEG recorded from the responders in 19 channels. EEG time series were
   first in-put to independent component analysis. An equivalent current
   dipole model was used to localize the sources of the independent
   components in EEGLAB. The Talairach coordinates of the dipoles were
   matched with references in the Brede neuroinformatics database. Dipole
   magnitudes, anatomical regions, and mental attributes were used to
   explain the rejection of the offers by applying multiple regression as a
   function of time in epochs with a median resolution of 250 ms. The
   results are consistent with previous studies regarding responder
   behavior and activated regions (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex, frontal
   gyrus, insular cortex). There are three main findings observed with the
   higher temporal resolution: (1) regression results from fine-scale
   temporal data showed activations not captured when the analysis was done
   by using time-averaged data; (2) temporal analysis detected the
   individual significant epochs and fluctuations (positive and negative
   correlations) in regions and for the associated mental attributes (e.g.,
   reward/harm perception, anger, unfairness); (3) there was a sequential
   activation of anterior cingulate cortex and insular cortex,
   respectively, leading to the rejection response. Overall, regression
   models could explain a large percentage (similar to 80\%) of
   out-of-sample behavioral responses. The results are promising for the
   prospect of using EEG and source localization techniques in
   neuroeconomics to study finer temporal dynamics of neural activation.}},

   fMRI study of VMPFC using the Iowa Gambling Task}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{178-190}},
Abstract = {{Some older adults without neurological disease exhibit impaired
   decision-making in risky, nontransparent situations, like the Iowa
   Gambling Task (IGT). The prefrontal cortices are particularly vulnerable
   to age-related decline, and numerous studies implicate the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in successful IGT performance. However, the
   relationship between IGT performance and VMPFC function in older adults
   has not yet been tested by fMRI. In the present study, older adults with
   seemingly no cognitive impairments performed the IGT and a non-gambling
   control task during fMRI. Group analyses indicate that in these older
   adults, regardless of IGT performance level, a right VMPFC subregion is
   activated during the IGT, while successful IGT performance is correlated
   with left VMPFC activation, suggesting that bilateral VMPFC during
   risky, nontransparent situations may contribute to successful
   decision-making in older adults. Individual subject analyses reveal
   substantial variation regarding the extent and location of VMPFC
   activation during the IGT, a finding not captured in the group analysis:
   There is no correlation between IGT performance and extent of activation
   in the right VMPFC, although there is such a correlation between left
   VMPFC activation and IGT performance.}},

Abstract = {{Aberrant subcortical-prefrontal connectivity may contribute to insula

   to examine functional `coupling' between the insula and prefrontal
   cortex in gSAD patients and healthy controls (HCs). During fMRI, 29 gSAD
   and 26 HC volunteers performed an Emotional Face Matching Task,
   involving the processing of fear, angry, and happy expressions. As
   expected, compared with HCs, gSAD patients exhibited greater bilateral
   anterior insula (aINS) reactivity for fear vs. happy faces; this group
   difference was less robust for angry vs. happy faces. PPI of insula
   connectivity when processing fearful faces revealed the gSAD group had
   less right aINS-dorsal anterior cingulate coupling compared to HCs.
   Findings indicate that aINS hyper-reactivity for fear faces in gSAD,

Abstract = {{Theory of Mind (ToM) undergoes changes at the behavioral level in
   pathological aging (Alzheimer's disease (AD)) and at the neural level in
   physiological aging. The aim was to determine if there are changes in
   ToM in the behavioral and neural domains in old subjects with high risk
   of switching from successful to unsuccessful neurocognitive aging.
   Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) syndrome were
   studied, since aMCI was proposed to fill the gap between normal aging
   and dementia. Sixteen aMCI patients (mean age 71 years) and fifteen
   healthy controls (mean age 67 years) with no differences in age or
   education were subjected to increasingly complex ToM tasks and to fMRI
   scanning while performing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RME),
   which attributes mental states by focusing on eye-gaze. aMCI subjects
   had worse performances in two second order false belief tasks,
   confirming the decay of ToM on the behavioral level. Despite a minor
   activation of some components (posterior end of the superior temporal
   sulcus and temporal pole) of the ToM neural circuit, no significant
   differences in the behavioral performances to the RME was found in aMCI
   compared to controls. Probably the preservation of the mirror neuron
   system (precentral gyrus-BA 6; Broca area - BA 44) and the stronger
   involvement of frontal areas (middle and medial frontal cortex and
   anterior cingulate cortex) supplemented the decay of part of the
   mentalizing neural circuit, preserving task performance.}},

Title = {{The expressions of strangers: Our identity-independent representation of
   facial expression}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that underlying the human system processing facial
   expressions are two types of representation of expression: one dependent
   on identity and the other independent of identity. We recently presented
   findings indicating that identity-dependent representations are encoded
   using a prototype-referenced scheme, in a manner notably similar to that
   proposed for facial identity. Could it be that identity-independent
   representations are encoded this way too? We investigated this by
   adapting participant to anti-expressions and asking them to categorize
   the expression aftereffect in a prototype probe that was either the same
   (congruent) or different (incongruent) identity to that of the adapter.
   To distinguish between encoding schemes, we measured how aftereffect
   magnitude changed in response to variations in the strength of adapters.
   The increase in aftereffect magnitude with adapter strength
   characteristic of prototype-referenced encoding was observed in both
   congruent and, crucially, incongruent conditions. We conclude that
   identity-independent representations of expression are indeed encoded
   using a prototype-referenced scheme. The striking similarity between the
   encoding of facial identity and both representations of expression
   raises the possibility that prototype-referenced encoding might be a
   common scheme for encoding the many types of information in faces needed
   to enable our complex social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive behavior often exploits generalizations from past experience by
   applying them judiciously in new situations. This requires a means of
   quantifying the relative importance of prior experience and current
   information, so they can be balanced optimally. In this study, we ask
   whether the brain generalizes in an optimal way. Specifically, we used
   Bayesian learning theory and fMRI to test whether neuronal responses
   reflect context-sensitive changes in ambiguity or uncertainty about
   experience-dependent beliefs. We found that the hippocampus expresses
   clear ambiguity-dependent responses that are associated with an
   augmented rate of learning. These findings suggest candidate neuronal
   systems that may be involved in aberrations of generalization, such as
   over-confidence.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is evidence that exact calculation recruits left
   hemisphere perisylvian language systems, recent work has shown that
   exact calculation can be retained despite severe damage to these
   networks. In this study, we sought to identify a ``core{''} network for
   calculation and hence to determine the extent to which left hemisphere
   language areas are part of this network. We examined performance on
   addition and subtraction problems in two modalities: one using
   conventional two-digit problems that can be easily encoded into
   language; the other using novel shape representations. With regard to
   numerical problems, our results revealed increased left fronto-temporal
   activity in addition, and increased parietal activity in subtraction,
   potentially reflecting retrieval of linguistically encoded information
   during addition. The shape problems elicited activations of occipital,
   parietal and dorsal temporal regions, reflecting visual reasoning
   processes. A core activation common to both calculation types involved
   the superior parietal lobule bilaterally, right temporal sub-gyral area,
   and left lateralized activations in inferior parietal (BA 40), frontal
   (BA 6/8/32) and occipital (BA 18) regions. The large bilateral parietal
   activation could be attributed to visuo-spatial processing in
   calculation. The inferior parietal region, and particularly the left
   angular gyrus, was part of the core calculation network. However, given
   its activation in both shape and number tasks, its role is unlikely to
   reflect linguistic processing per se. A possibility is that it serves to
   integrate right hemisphere visuo-spatial and left hemisphere linguistic
   and executive processing in calculation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In auditory-visual synaesthesia, all kinds of sound can induce

   Synaesthetes showed increased activation in the left inferior parietal

   binding and attention guidance. No significant group-differences could
   be detected in area V4, which is known to be related to colour vision

Abstract = {{Background: Cross-sectional studies report biased reactivity to facial
   expressions among shy children, anxious adolescents, and adults with
   social anxiety disorder (SAD). It remains unknown whether cerebral
   reactivity to facial expressions can predict longitudinally the
   development of SAD in adolescence and characterize the degree of social
   anxiety among the general population of adolescents. Methods: In a
   longitudinal study of 21 general population volunteers characterized for
   behavioral and genetic variables, N400 event-related potentials, and
   3-Tesla fMRI activations in response to happy/neutral/angry expressions
   were acquired at age 8-9 and 14-15, respectively. Results: By stepwise
   regression, N400 amplitudes acquired at age 8-9 predicted the number of
   DSM-IV SAD symptoms at age 14-15, with the sole, significant (P5.018)
   contribution of the ``anger'' condition. Factorial ANOVA revealed
   increased (Voxel-Level P(FWE) range:.02-. 0001) bilateral fMRI
   activations of several brain areas, including the amygdala, in response
   to facial expressions compared to a fixation cross. The number of
   symptoms of DSM-IV SAD was positively correlated with left amygdala
   response to angry (P(FWE) 5.036) and neutral (P(FWE) 5.025) facial
   expressions. Factorial ANOVA revealed that the 5-HTTLPR -S allele was
   associated with heightened left amygdala response to anger (P(FWE)
   5.05). Conclusions: Cerebral reactivity to facial expressions, anger
   especially, measured at different developmental stages by different
   techniques is associated with adolescence SAD. The 5-HTTLPR genotype
   affects the neural processing of interpersonal affective stimuli during

   striatum and septal area (SA) because of their role in maternal
   caregiving behavior in animals. Methods: Twenty romantic couples
   completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging session in which the
   female partner underwent a scan while her partner stood just outside the
   scanner and received unpleasant electric shocks. Results: Support giving
   (holding a partner's arm while they experienced physical pain), compared
   with other control conditions, led to significantly more activity in the
   ventral striatum, a reward-related region also involved in maternal
   behavior (p values < .05). Similar effects were observed for the SA, a
   region involved in both maternal behavior and fear attenuation. Greater
   activity in each of these regions during support giving was associated
   with greater self-reported support giving effectiveness and social
   connection (r values = 0.55-0.64, p values < .05). In addition, in line
   with the SA's role in fear attenuation (presumably to facilitate
   caregiving during stress), increased SA activity during support giving
   was associated with reduced left (r = -0.44, p < .05) and right (r =
   -0.42, p < .05) amygdala activity. Conclusions: Results suggest that
   support giving may be beneficial not only for the receiver but also for
   the giver. Implications for the possible stress-reducing effects of
   support giving are discussed.}},

Title = {{Altered age-related trajectories of amygdala-prefrontal circuitry in
   adolescents at clinical high risk for psychosis: A preliminary study}},

Abstract = {{Emotion processing deficits are prominent in schizophrenia and exist
   prior to the onset of overt psychosis. However, developmental
   trajectories of neural circuitry subserving emotion regulation and the
   role that they may play in illness onset have not yet been examined in
   patients at risk for psychosis. The present study employed a
   cross-sectional analysis to examine age-related functional activation in
   amygdala and prefrontal cortex, as well as functional connectivity
   between these regions, in adolescents at clinical high risk (CHR) for
   psychosis relative to typically developing adolescents. Participants
   (n=34) performed an emotion processing fMRI task, including emotion
   labeling, emotion matching, and non-emotional control conditions.
   Regression analyses were used to predict activation in the amygdala and
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) based on age, group, sex, and
   the interaction of age by group. CHR adolescents exhibited altered
   age-related variation in amygdala and vlPFC activation, relative to
   controls. Controls displayed decreased amygdala and increased vlPFC
   activation with age, while patients exhibited the opposite pattern
   (increased amygdala and decreased vlPFC activation), suggesting a
   failure of prefrontal cortex to regulate amygdala reactivity. Moreover,
   a psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed decreased
   amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity among CHR adolescents,
   consistent with disrupted brain connectivity as a vulnerability factor
   in schizophrenia. These results suggest that the at-risk syndrome is
   marked by abnormal development and functional connectivity of neural
   systems subserving emotion regulation. Longitudinal data are needed to
   confirm aberrant developmental trajectories intra-individually and to
   examine whether these abnormalities are predictive of conversion to
   psychosis, and of later deficits in socioemotional functioning. (C) 2011

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY}},

Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{37-45}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Context: Major depressive disorder is associated with impairments in
   processing emotional stimuli, and residual impairments are observed
   during remission, possibly indicating trait vulnerability. Stimuli with
   social context represent a distinct class of emotional stimuli, which in
   healthy volunteers are associated with specific neural substrates but
   have not previously been studied relative to vulnerability to
   depression.
   Objective: To explore whether individuals with remitted major depressive
   disorder had altered neuronal processing of social emotional stimuli.
   Design: Cross-sectional design using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, combined with a cognitive activation task.
   Setting: General community of greater Manchester, England.
   Participants: Twenty-five unmedicated participants fully remitted from
   major depressive disorder and 29 age-matched control subjects.
   Main Outcome Measures: Neuronal responses to positive and negative
   social interaction images vs valence-matched images with less overt
   social context.
   Results: Participants with remitted depression showed attenuated
   frontopolar response relative to controls for positive and negative
   images depicting social interactions. For negative social images,
   participants with remitted depression also showed reduced
   latero-orbitofrontal response relative to controls.
   Conclusions: In the absence of current symptoms, individuals with
   remitted major depressive disorder showed reduced frontopolar processing
   of stimuli showing social interactions, a reduction not seen for stimuli
   showing individual successes and failures and, therefore, not simply an
   effect of emotional valence. These results suggest a specific trait
   abnormality in social emotional processing associated with vulnerability
   to depression, which may have implications for understanding social
   cognition mechanisms and for developing effective psychological
   therapies.}},

Title = {{Effects of Acute Tryptophan Depletion on Prefrontal-Amygdala
   Connectivity While Viewing Facial Signals of Aggression}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{36-43}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Reduced levels of serotonin (5-HT) within prefrontal cortex
   (PFC)-amygdala circuits have long been implicated in impulsive
   aggression. However, whether lowering 5-HT alters the dynamic interplay
   between the PFC and the amygdala has not been directly tested in humans.
   It is known that manipulating 5-HT via acute tryptophan depletion (ATD)
   causes variable effects on brain responses to a variety of emotional
   stimuli, but it remains unclear whether ATD affects functional
   connectivity in neural networks involved in processing social signals of
   aggression (e.g., angry faces).
   Methods: Thirty healthy individuals were enrolled in a randomized,
   double-blind, placebo-controlled ATD study. On each treatment, brain
   responses to angry, sad, and neutral faces were measured with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Two methods
   (psycho-physiological-interaction in a general linear model and dynamic
   causal modeling) were used to assess the impact of ATD on the functional
   connectivity between PFC and amygdala.
   Results: Data from 19 subjects were available for the final analyses. A
   whole-brain psycho-physiological-interaction in a general linear model
   showed that ATD significantly modulated the connectivity between the
   amygdala and two PFC regions (ventral anterior cingulate cortex and
   ventrolateral PFC) when processing angry vs. neutral and angry vs. sad
   but not sad vs. neutral faces. Dynamic causal modeling corroborated and
   extended these findings by showing that 5-HT depletion reduced the
   influence of processing angry vs. neutral faces on circuits within PFC
   and on PFC-amygdala pathways.
   Conclusions: We provide strong support for neurobiological accounts
   positing that 5-HT significantly influences PFC-amygdala circuits
   implicated in aggression and other affective behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Object-directed action consists of aspects that range from low-level
   kinematic patterns to high-level action goals. Although previous studies
   have suggested that the human mirror neuron system (MNS) is involved in
   understanding or imitating an observed action, it is unclear precisely
   which levels of action representation are reflected in MNS activity. In
   this study, we used an imitation-matching task, which is previously used
   in behavioral experiments for infants, and fMRI to reveal the neural
   basis for imitation of multiple representations of observed actions. In
   our experiment, two video footages showing a pen being grasped and
   placed into one of two cups were sequentially presented. The
   participants judged whether an actor's action in the first movie was
   correctly imitated by an imitator in the second movie, regarding the
   following four aspects: action goal, a means of manipulation, an
   effector used, and movement trajectory. Although identical sets of
   stimuli were presented, different brain regions were activated,
   depending on the matching judgments made by subjects between the two
   actions. The current study indicates that distinct brain regions are
   involved in recognition of multiple aspects of transitive actions, which
   is largely consistent with a visuomotor circuit of action production by
   the observer.}},

Abstract = {{The therapeutic application of functional electrical stimulation (FES)
   has shown promising clinical results in the rehabilitation of
   post-stroke hemiplegia. It appears that the effect is optimal when the
   patterned electrical stimulation is used in close synchrony with
   voluntary movement, although the neural mechanisms that underlie the
   clinical successes reported with therapeutic FES are unknown. One
   possibility is that therapeutic FES takes advantage of the sensory
   consequences of an internal model. Here, we investigate fMRI cortical
   activity when FES is combined with voluntary effort (FESVOL) and we
   compare this activity to that produced when FES and voluntary activity
   (VOL) are performed alone. FESVOL revealed greater cerebellar activity
   compared with FES alone and reduced activity bilaterally in secondary
   somatosensory areas (SII) compared with VOL alone. Reduced activity was
   also observed for FESVOL compared with FES alone in the angular gyrus,
   middle frontal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus. These findings indicate
   that during the VOL condition the cerebellum predicts the sensory
   consequences of the movement and this reduces the subsequent activation
   in SII. The decreased SII activity may reflect a better match between
   the internal model and the actual sensory feedback. The greater
   cerebellar activity coupled with reduced angular gyrus activity in
   FESVOL compared with FES suggests that the cortex may interpret sensory
   information during the FES condition as an error-like signal due to the
   lack of a voluntary component in the movement. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (C)

Abstract = {{Background. The D-Amino acid oxidase activator (G72 or DAOA) is believed
   to play a key role in the regulation of central glutamatergic
   transmission which is seen to be altered in psychosis. It is thought to
   regulate D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), which metabolizes D-serine, a
   co-agonist of NMDA-type glutamate receptors and to be involved in
   dendritic arborization. Linkage, genetic association and expression
   studies have implicated the G72 gene in both schizophrenia and bipolar
   disorder. Aims. To examine the influence of G72 variation on brain
   function in the healthy population. Method. Fifty healthy volunteers
   were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging while
   performing a verbal fluency task. Regional brain activation and
   task-dependent functional connectivity during word generation was
   compared between different rs746187 genotypes. Results. G72 rs746187
   genotype had a significant effect on activation in the left postcentral
   and supramarginal gyri (FWE P < 0.05), and on the task-dependent
   functional coupling of this region with the retrosplenial cingulate
   gyrus (FWE P < 0.05). Conclusions. Our results may reflect an effect of
   G72 on glutamatergic transmission, mediated by an influence on D-amino
   acid oxidase activity, on brain areas particularly relevant to the
   hypoglutamatergic model of psychosis. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The familiarity to the subject of any potential stimuli presents one of
   the major difficulties for the investigation of the self; the separation
   of effects resulting from familiarity from self-effects being extremely
   problematic. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the neural
   distinction between self and familiarity by combining two sets of fMRI
   data with a meta-analysis. In the first fMRI experiment, regions
   responding to self/familiarity were investigated using the subject's own
   name and names of familiar others. These effects were confirmed and
   extended in a second fMRI experiment using the subject's own name and a
   stranger's name, as spoken by familiar and unfamiliar voices. Finally, a
   meta-analysis of self- and familiarity-related studies was conducted.
   Neural activity in the anterior brain regions, such as the anterior
   cingulate (ACC) and anterior insula (AI), was found to be specific for
   self-specific stimuli. In contrast, posterior brain regions, such as the
   posterior cingulate, were activated by familiar stimuli. Finally, the
   distinction between anterior and posterior regions for self and
   familiarity was confirmed by meta-analytic data. This study demonstrates
   a clear anteriorposterior cortical partition between self-specificity
   and familiarity. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral studies indicate that directional gaze and hand pointing are
   fundamental social signals that may capture spatial attention more
   powerfully than directional arrows. By using fMRI, we explored whether
   reflexive shifts of attention triggered by different distracters were
   influenced by the motor effector used for performing an overt response.
   In separate blocks, healthy participants performed a directional
   saccadic or a hand pointing movement. Color changes of a central black
   fixation point constituted the imperative instruction signal to make a
   leftward (red color) or a rightward (blue color) movement while ignoring
   distracting leftward or rightward oriented gaze, hand pointing, or
   arrow. Distracters that were directionally incongruent with the
   instruction cue impaired the saccadic and pointing-release RTs. The
   comparison of incongruent vs. congruent conditions showed an increase of
   BOLD signal in the frontal eye field (FEF), the intraparietal sulcus
   (IPS), and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) bilaterally. Importantly,
   a specific relationship between distracter and effector used for the
   response was found in these frontal and parietal regions. In particular,
   higher activity in the FEF, for distracting gaze was found mainly during
   the saccadic response task. In the same vein, higher activity in the
   left and right IPS regions was found for the distracting hand mainly in
   the hand pointing task. The results suggest that reflexive shifts of
   attention triggered by social signals are coded in the fronto-parietal
   cortex according to effector-specific mapping rules. Hum Brain Mapp,

Abstract = {{Heavy alcohol consumption during young adulthood is a risk factor for
   the development of serious alcohol use disorders. Research has shown
   that individual differences in subjective responses to alcohol may
   affect individuals' vulnerability to developing alcoholism. Studies
   comparing the subjective and objective response to alcohol between light
   and heavy drinkers (HDs), however, have yielded inconsistent results,
   and neural responses to alcohol in these groups have not been
   characterized. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
   randomized crossover alcohol challenge study comparing functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and subjective response to intravenously
   administered 6\% v/v ethanol to a target blood alcohol concentration of
   0.08\% or placebo between HDs and social drinkers (SDs). During the
   imaging, we presented emotional cues in order to measure how emotion
   modulated the effects of alcohol on the brain's reward circuitry. We
   found that, at equivalent blood alcohol concentrations, HDs reported
   lower subjective alcohol effects than SDs. Alcohol significantly
   activated the nucleus accumbens in SDs, but not in HDs. Self-reported
   ratings of intoxication correlated with striatal activation, suggesting
   that activation may reflect subjective experience of intoxication.
   Fearful faces significantly activated the amygdala in the SDs only, and
   this activation was attenuated by alcohol. This study shows that HDs not
   only experience reduced subjective effects of alcohol, but also
   demonstrate a blunted response to alcohol in the brain's reward system.
   Our findings indicate that reduced subjective and neural response to
   alcohol in HDs may be suggestive of either the development of tolerance
   to alcohol, or of pre-existing decreased sensitivity to alcohol's
   effects. Neuropsychopharmacology (2012) 37, 467-477;

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine measures of anatomical
   connectivity between the thalamus and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC)
   in schizophrenia and to assess their functional implications. We
   measured thalamocortical connectivity with diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) and probabilistic tractography in 15 patients with schizophrenia
   and 22 age-and sex-matched controls. The relationship between
   thalamocortical connectivity and prefrontal cortical
   blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional activity as well as
   behavioral performance during working memory was examined in a subsample
   of 9 patients and 18 controls. Compared with controls, schizophrenia
   patients showed reduced total connectivity of the thalamus to only one
   of six cortical regions, the LPFC. The size of the thalamic region with
   at least 25\% of model fibers reaching the LPFC was also reduced in
   patients compared with controls. The total thalamocortical connectivity
   to the LPFC predicted working memory task performance and also
   correlated with LPFC BOLD activation. Notably, the correlation with BOLD
   activation was accentuated in patients as compared with controls in the
   ventral LPFC. These results suggest that thalamocortical connectivity to
   the LPFC is altered in schizophrenia with functional consequences on

Abstract = {{The ability to use cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions is an
   adaptive skill in adulthood, but little is known about its development.
   Because reappraisal is thought to be supported by linearly developing
   prefrontal regions, one prediction is that reappraisal ability develops
   linearly. However, recent investigations into socio-emotional
   development suggest that there are non-linear patterns that uniquely
   affect adolescents. We compared older children (10-13), adolescents
   (14-17) and young adults (18-22) on a task that distinguishes negative
   emotional reactivity from reappraisal ability. Behaviorally, we observed
   no age differences in self-reported emotional reactivity, but linear and
   quadratic relationships between reappraisal ability and age. Neurally,
   we observed linear age-related increases in activation in the left
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, previously identified in adult
   reappraisal. We observed a quadratic pattern of activation with age in
   regions associated with social cognitive processes like mental state
   attribution (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex,
   anterior temporal cortex). In these regions, we observed relatively
   lower reactivity-related activation in adolescents, but higher
   reappraisal-related activation. This suggests that (i) engagement of the
   cognitive control components of reappraisal increases linearly with age
   and (ii) adolescents may not normally recruit regions associated with
   mental state attribution, but (iii) this can be reversed with
   reappraisal instructions.}},

Abstract = {{The way that parents express their emotions during interactions with
   their adolescent children is important for adolescent adjustment, and
   predicts adolescent emotional problems such as depression. In the
   current study, we assessed whether adolescent depressive symptoms were
   associated with neural activity during exposure to their mother's
   affective behavior. Thirty adolescents (18 females, mean age 17.35, s.d.
   0.43) participated in an fMRI task that used digitized video segments of
   their own mother's, as well as an unfamiliar mother's affective behavior
   as stimuli. Exposure to one's own (compared to an unfamiliar) mother's
   positive (compared to neutral) behavior was associated with activation
   in the anterior and posterior cingulate, precuneus and ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex. In contrast, exposure to positive behavior across own
   and an unfamiliar mother (controlling for neutral behavior) was
   associated with superior temporal sulcus, occipital pole, amygdala and
   striatum activity. Adolescent depressive symptoms were associated with
   reduced rostral anterior cingulate activity during exposure to one's own
   (compared to an unfamiliar) mother's positive behavior, and reduced
   striatal activity during exposure to positive behavior in general. This
   study represents an important step in furthering our understanding of
   the neural basis of affective processing in adolescents. Further, the
   results support a disruption of reward function in depression.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is marked by profound psychosocial and physiological
   changes. Although investigations into the interactions between these
   forces have begun to shed light on the neural correlates of affective
   processing during the transition to adolescence, relatively little is
   known about the relationship between pubertal development and emotion
   perception at the neural level. In the current longitudinal study, 45
   neurotypical participants were shown affective facial displays while
   undergoing fMRI, at ages 10 and 13. Neural responses to emotional
   expressions at both time points were then correlated with a self-report
   measure of pubertal development, revealing positive associations with
   activity in amygdala, thalamus and visual cortical areas at age 10 that
   increased in magnitude and extent by age 13. At the latter time point,
   pubertal development was additionally correlated with enhanced responses
   to faces in temporal pole, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
   dorsomedial PFC. Longitudinal comparisons revealed that the
   relationships between pubertal development and activity in the amygdala,
   hippocampus and temporal pole were significantly stronger during early
   adolescence than late childhood. These results suggest that pubertal
   development per se is linked to neural processing of socioemotional
   stimuli, particularly with respect to the integration of complex
   perceptual input and higher order cortical processing of affective
   content.}},

Abstract = {{The eyes provide important information for decoding the mental states of

   Participants from three age groups (early adolescents, mid adolescents
   and young adults) participated in the study and performed an adapted
   version of the `Reading the Mind in the Eyes task', in which photographs
   of the eye region of faces were presented. Behavioral results show that
   the ability to decode the feelings and thoughts of others from the eyes
   develops before early adolescence. For all ages, brain activity was
   found in the posterior superior temporal sulcus during reading the mind
   in the eyes relative to a control condition requiring age and gender
   judgments using the same eyes stimuli. Only early adolescents showed
   additional involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex, the inferior
   frontal gyrus and the temporal pole. The results are discussed in the

Abstract = {{Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to attribute thoughts, intentions
   and beliefs to others. This involves component processes, including
   cognitive perspective taking (cognitive ToM) and understanding emotions
   (affective ToM). This study assessed the distinction and overlap of
   neural processes involved in these respective components, and also
   investigated their development between adolescence and adulthood. While
   data suggest that ToM develops between adolescence and adulthood, these
   populations have not been compared on cognitive and affective ToM
   domains. Using fMRI with 15 adolescent (aged 11-16 years) and 15 adult
   (aged 24-40 years) males, we assessed neural responses during cartoon
   vignettes requiring cognitive ToM, affective ToM or physical causality
   comprehension (control). An additional aim was to explore relationships
   between fMRI data and self-reported empathy. Both cognitive and
   affective ToM conditions were associated with neural responses in the
   classic ToM network across both groups, although only affective ToM
   recruited medial/ventromedial PFC (mPFC/vmPFC). Adolescents additionally
   activated vmPFC more than did adults during affective ToM. The
   specificity of the mPFC/vmPFC response during affective ToM supports
   evidence from lesion studies suggesting that vmPFC may integrate
   affective information during ToM. Furthermore, the differential neural
   response in vmPFC between adult and adolescent groups indicates
   developmental changes in affective ToM processing.}},

Abstract = {{Involvement with friends carries many advantages for adolescents,
   including protection from the detrimental effects of being rejected by
   peers. However, little is known about the mechanisms through which
   friendships may serve their protective role at this age, or the
   potential benefit of these friendships as adolescents transition to
   adulthood. As such, this investigation tested whether friend involvement
   during adolescence related to less neural sensitivity to social threats
   during young adulthood. Twenty-one adolescents reported the amount of
   time they spent with friends outside of school using a daily diary. Two
   years later they underwent an fMRI scan, during which they were
   ostensibly excluded from an online ball-tossing game by two same-age
   peers. Findings from region of interest and whole brain analyses
   revealed that spending more time with friends during adolescence related
   to less activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior
   insula-regions previously linked with negative affect and pain
   processing-during an experience of peer rejection 2 years later. These
   findings are consistent with the notion that positive relationships
   during adolescence may relate to individuals being less sensitive to
   negative social experiences later on.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to consider anger from a cognitive
   neuroscience perspective. Five main claims are made: first, reactive
   aggression is the ultimate behavioral expression of anger and thus we
   can begin to understand anger by understanding reactive aggression.
   Second, neural systems implicated in reactive aggression (amygdala,
   hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray; the basic threat system) are
   critically implicated in anger. Factors such as exposure to extreme
   threat that increase the responsiveness of these systems, should be (and
   are in the context of posttraumatic stress disorder), associated with
   increased anger. Third, regions of frontal cortex implicated in
   regulating the basic threat system, when dysfunctional (e. g., in the
   context of lesions) should be associated with increased anger. Fourth,
   frustration occurs when an individual continues to do an action in the
   expectation of a reward but does not actually receive that reward, and
   is associated with anger. Individuals who show impairment in the ability
   to alter behavioral responding when actions no longer receive their
   expected rewards should be (and are in the context of psychopathy)
   associated with increased anger. Fifth, someone not doing what another
   person wants them to do (particularly if this thwarts the person's goal)
   is frustrating and consequently anger inducing. The response to such a
   frustrating social event relies on the neural architecture implicated in
   changing behavioral responses in nonsocial frustrating situations. (C)

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Symptoms of anhedonia, or deficits in the ability to experience positive
   affect, are increasingly recognized as an outcome of traumatic stress
   including in individuals with PTSD. However, little research has
   investigated negative affective responses to what would normally be
   considered pleasant events (e.g., receiving a compliment or gift,
   physical affection) in traumatized persons. We demonstrate not only
   self-reported decreased positive affect but also increased negative
   affect in response to positive events in 55 women with PTSD, in
   comparison with 35 women without PTSD, via their response to a Hedonic
   Deficit \& Interference Scale (HDIS). The HDIS demonstrated strong
   internal validity, convergent and incremental validity relative to other
   measures of anhedonia, and discriminant validity in relation to
   depression versus anxiety symptoms in this sample. In addition, in
   response to imagery of social versus non-social positive events, HDIS
   scores predicted self-report positive and negative affective responses.
   In a sub-sample of participants completing the imagery task while
   undergoing fMRI (n = 12), HDIS scores also predicted BOLD response
   within the left orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
   amygdala, and cerebellum. Future research and clinical directions are

Title = {{Experience and abstract reasoning in learning backward induction}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Abstract = {{Backward induction is a benchmark of game theoretic rationality, yet
   surprisingly little is known as to how humans discover and initially
   learn to apply this abstract solution concept in experimental settings.
   We use behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
   to study the way in which subjects playing in a sequential game of
   perfect information learn the optimal backward induction strategy for
   the game. Experimental data from our two studies support two main
   findings: First, subjects converge to a common process of recursive
   inference similar to the backward induction procedure for solving the
   game. The process is recursive because earlier insights and conclusions
   are used as inputs in later steps of the inference. This process is
   matched by a similar pattern in brain activation, which also proceeds
   backward, following the prediction error: brain activity initially codes
   the responses to losses in final positions; in later trials this
   activity shifts to the starting position. Second, the learning process
   is not exclusively cognitive, but instead combines experience-based
   learning and abstract reasoning. Critical experiences leading to the
   adoption of an improved solution strategy appear to be stimulated by
   brain activity in the reward system. This indicates that the negative
   affect induced by initial failures facilitates the switch to a different
   method of solving the problem. Abstract reasoning is combined with this
   response, and is expressed by activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex. Differences in brain activation match differences in performance
   between subjects who show different learning speeds.}},

   anterior insula}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Abstract = {{Decision neuroscience offers the potential for decomposing differences
   in behavior across individuals into components of valuation intimately
   tied to brain function. One application of this approach lies in novel
   conceptualizations of behavioral attributes that are aberrant in
   psychiatric disorders. We investigated the relationship between social
   anxiety and behavior in a novel socially determined risk task.
   Behaviorally, higher scores on a social phobia inventory (SPIN) among
   healthy participants were associated with an increase in risky
   responses. Furthermore, activity in a region of the dorsal anterior
   insula (dAI) scaled in proportion to SPIN score in risky versus
   non-risky choices. This region of the insula was functionally connected
   to areas in the intraparietal sulcus and anterior cingulate cortex that
   were related to decision-making across all participants. Overall, social
   anxiety was associated with decreased risk aversion in our task,
   consistent with previous results investigating risk taking in many
   everyday behaviors. Moreover, this difference was linked to the anterior
   insula, a region commonly implicated in risk attitudes and
   socio-emotional processes.}},

Title = {{Neural mechanisms of reading facial emotions in young and older adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The ability to read and appropriately respond to emotions in others is
   central for successful social interaction. Young and older adults are
   better at identifying positive than negative facial expressions and also
   expressions of young than older faces. Little, however, is known about
   the neural processes associated with reading different emotions,
   particularly in faces of different ages, in samples of young and older
   adults. During fMRI, young and older participants identified expressions
   in happy, neutral, and angry young and older faces. The results suggest
   a functional dissociation of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in reading facial emotions that is
   largely comparable in young and older adults: Both age groups showed
   greater vmPFC activity to happy compared to angry or neutral faces,
   which was positively correlated with expression identification for happy
   compared to angry faces. In contrast, both age groups showed greater
   activity in dmPFC to neutral or angry than happy faces which was
   negatively correlated with expression identification for neutral
   compared to happy faces. A similar region of dmPFC showed greater
   activity for older than young faces, but no brain-behavior correlations.
   Greater vmPFC activity in the present study may reflect greater
   affective processing involved in reading happy compared to neutral or
   angry faces. Greater dmPFC activity may reflect more cognitive control
   involved in decoding and/or regulating negative emotions associated with
   neutral or angry than happy, and older than young, faces.}},

   ventromedial prefrontal cortex}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Research has consistently shown that control is critical to
   psychological functioning, with perceived lack of control considered to
   play a crucial role in the manifestation of symptoms in psychiatric
   disorders. In a model of behavioral control based on non-human animal
   work, Maier et al. (2006) posited that the presence of control activates
   areas of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which in turn
   inhibit the normative stress response in the dorsal raphe nucleus and
   amygdala. To test Maier's model in humans, we investigated the effects
   of control over potent aversive stimuli by presenting video clips of
   snakes to 21 snake phobics who were otherwise healthy with no comorbid
   psychopathologies. Based on prior research documenting that disrupted
   neural processing during the anticipation of adverse events can be
   influenced by different forms of cognitive processing such as
   perceptions of control, analyses focused on the anticipatory activity
   preceding the videos. We found that phobics exhibited greater vmPFC
   activity during the anticipation of snake videos when they had control
   over whether the videos were presented as compared to when they had no
   control over the presentation of the videos. In addition, observed
   functional connectivity between the vmPFC and the amygdala is consistent
   with previous work documenting vmPFC inhibition of the amygdala. Our
   results provide evidence to support the extension of Maier's model of
   behavioral control to include anticipatory function in humans.}},

Title = {{Response bias modulates the speech motor system during syllable
   discrimination}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that the speech motor system may play a
   significant role in speech perception. Repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) applied to a speech region of premotor cortex impaired
   syllable identification, while stimulation of motor areas for different
   articulators selectively facilitated identification of phonemes relying
   on those articulators. However, in these experiments performance was not
   corrected for response bias. It is not currently known how response bias
   modulates activity in these networks. The present functional magnetic
   resonance imaging experiment was designed to produce specific,
   measureable changes in response bias in a speech perception task.
   Minimal consonant-vowel stimulus pairs were presented between volume
   acquisitions for same-different discrimination. Speech stimuli were
   embedded in Gaussian noise at the psychophysically determined threshold
   level. We manipulated bias by changing the ratio of same-to-different
   trials: 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1. Ratios were blocked by run and subjects
   were cued to the upcoming ratio at the beginning of each run. The
   stimuli were physically identical across runs. Response bias (criterion,
   C) was measured in individual subjects for each ratio condition. Group
   mean bias varied in the expected direction. We predicted that activation
   in frontal but not temporal brain regions would co-vary with bias.
   Group-level regression of bias scores on percent signal change revealed
   a fronto-parietal network of motor and sensory-motor brain regions that
   were sensitive to changes in response bias. We identified several pre-
   and post-central clusters in the left hemisphere that overlap well with
   TMS targets from the aforementioned studies. Importantly, activity in
   these regions covaried with response bias even while the perceptual
   targets remained constant. Thus, previous results suggesting that speech
   motor cortex participates directly in the perceptual analysis of speech
   should be called into question.}},

Abstract = {{Previous neuroimaging studies of scenarios such as the prisoner's
   dilemma and ultimatum game show how brain systems which evolved to
   process rewarding and aversive stimuli are activated differentially
   during adherence to and breaches of norms. One theory of how shared
   social norms evolve is that they arise from mutually rewarding
   conventions which, through repeated execution, acquire a normative value
   that sustains social cohesion even when individual self-interest is not
   served. The authors report an fMRI study of a 2-player coordination game
   in which players must coordinate on an arbitrary convention (a left or
   right button press) to obtain monetary rewards. Once this convention has
   been established, one of the participants is incentivized to deviate
   from the equilibrium with the offer of extra reward. During the period
   prior to decisions to violate the convention, activity was observed in
   regions associated with reward processing, such as the midbrain,
   caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex. Activations in advance of decisions
   to continue coordinating included the amygdala and anterior insula
   inferior frontal gyms. The data are discussed in the light of theories
   which propose the existence of multiple interacting value-based
   decision-making systems in the human brain.}},

Abstract = {{The dorsal striatum plays a key role in the learning and expression of
   instrumental reward associations that are acquired through direct
   experience. However, not all learning about instrumental actions require
   direct experience. Instead, humans and other animals are also capable of
   acquiring instrumental actions by observing the experiences of others.
   In this study, we investigated the extent to which human dorsal striatum
   is involved in observational as well as experiential instrumental reward
   learning. Human participants were scanned with fMRI while they observed
   a confederate over a live video performing an instrumental conditioning
   task to obtain liquid juice rewards. Participants also performed a
   similar instrumental task for their own rewards. Using a computational
   model-based analysis, we found reward prediction errors in the dorsal
   striatum not only during the experiential learning condition but also
   during observational learning. These results suggest a key role for the
   dorsal striatum in learning instrumental associations, even when those
   associations are acquired purely by observing others.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{235-245}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Empathy is a critical aspect of human emotion that influences the
   behavior of individuals as well as the functioning of society. Although
   empathy is fundamentally a subjective experience, no studies have yet
   examined the neural correlates of the self-reported experience of
   empathy. Furthermore, although behavioral research has linked empathy to
   prosocial behavior, no work has yet connected empathy-related neural
   activity to everyday, real-world helping behavior. Lastly, the
   widespread assumption that empathy is an automatic experience remains
   largely untested. It is also unknown whether differences in trait
   empathy reflect either variability in the automaticity of empathic
   responses or the capacity to feel empathy. In this study, 32
   participants completed a diary study of helping behavior followed by an
   fMRI session, assessing empathic responses to sad images under three
   conditions: watching naturally, under cognitive load, and while
   empathizing. Across conditions, higher levels of self-reported
   experienced empathy were associated with greater activity in medial PFC
   (MPFC). Activity in MPFC was also correlated with daily helping
   behavior. Self-report of empathic experience and activity in
   empathy-related areas, notably MPFC, were higher in the empathize
   condition than in the load condition, suggesting that empathy is not a
   fully automatic experience. Additionally, high trait empathy
   participants displayed greater experienced empathy and stronger MPFC
   responses than low trait empathy individuals under cognitive load,
   suggesting that empathy is more automatic for individuals high in trait
   empathy. These results underline the critical role that MPFC plays in
   the instantiation of empathic experience and consequent behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) is characterized by excessive
   fears of scrutiny and negative evaluation, but neural circuitry related
   to scrutiny in GSAD has been little studied. In this study, 16
   unmedicated adults with GSAD and 16 matched healthy comparison (HC)
   participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess
   neural response to viewed images of faces simulating movement into eye
   contact versus away from eye contact. GSAD patients were then treated
   for 8 weeks with paroxetine, and 15 patients were re-imaged. At
   baseline, GSAD patients had elevated neural response to eye contact in
   parahippocampal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus,
   posterior cingulate and middle occipital cortex. During paroxetine
   treatment, symptomatic improvement was associated with decreased neural
   response to eye contact in regions including inferior and middle frontal
   gyri, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, precuneus and inferior
   parietal lobule. Both the magnitude of GSAD symptom reduction with
   paroxetine treatment and the baseline comparison of GSAD vs. HCs were
   associated with neural processing of eye contact in distributed networks
   that included regions involved in self-referential processing. These
   findings demonstrate that eye contact in GSAD engages neurocircuitry
   consistent with the heightened self-conscious emotional states known to
   characterize GSAD patients during scrutiny. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland

Title = {{The Neural Correlates of Emotional Prosody Comprehension: Disentangling
   Simple from Complex Emotion}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Emotional prosody comprehension (EPC), the ability to
   interpret another person's feelings by listening to their tone of voice,
   is crucial for effective social communication. Previous studies
   assessing the neural correlates of EPC have found inconsistent results,
   particularly regarding the involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC). It remained unclear whether the involvement of the mPFC is
   linked to an increased demand in socio-cognitive components of EPC such
   as mental state attribution and if basic perceptual processing of EPC
   can be performed without the contribution of this region.
   Methods: fMRI was used to delineate neural activity during the
   perception of prosodic stimuli conveying simple and complex emotion.
   Emotional trials in general, as compared to neutral ones, activated a
   network comprising temporal and lateral frontal brain regions, while
   complex emotion trials specifically showed an additional involvement of
   the mPFC, premotor cortex, frontal operculum and left insula.
   Conclusion: These results indicate that the mPFC and premotor areas
   might be associated, but are not crucial to EPC. However, the mPFC
   supports socio-cognitive skills necessary to interpret complex emotion
   such as inferring mental states. Additionally, the premotor cortex
   involvement may reflect the participation of the mirror neuron system
   for prosody processing particularly of complex emotion.}},

   empathy. However, this overlap raises the question of whether it may
   reflect a unique distributed population of bimodal neurons or,
   alternatively, the activity of intermingled but independent populations.
   We used fMRI on 28 female volunteers and used multivariate pattern
   analysis techniques to probe for more fine-grain spatial representations
   of seen and felt pain. Using a whole-brain approach, we found that only
   in the anterior insula (bilaterally) the distribution of cortical
   activity evoked by seeing another person's hand in pain was spatially
   similar to that of pain felt on one's own hand. Subsequent region of
   interest analyses also implicated the middle insula (right hemisphere)
   and the middle cingulate cortex. Furthermore, for the anterior insula,
   the spatial distribution of activity associated with one's pain also
   replicates that of the perception of negative but painless stimuli. Our
   data show how the neural representations of aversive events affecting
   oneself are also recruited when the same events affect others, and
   provide the stronger evidence thus far of a unique distributed cortical
   ensemble coding for aversive events regardless of the subject who is
   affected.}},

Title = {{Graspable objects shape number processing}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{The field of numerical cognition represents an interesting case for
   action-based theories of cognition, since number is a special kind of
   abstract concept. Several studies have shown that within the parietal
   lobes adjacent neural regions code numerical magnitude and
   grasping-related information. This anatomical proximity between brain
   areas involved in number and sensorimotor processes may account for
   interactions between numerical magnitude and action. In particular,
   recent studies have demonstrated a causal role of action perception on
   numerical magnitude processing. If objects are represented in terms of
   actions (affordances), the causal role of action on number processing
   should extend to the case of objects affordances. This study
   investigates the relationship between numbers and objects affordances in
   two experiments, without (Experiment 1) or with (Experiment 2) the
   requirement of an action (i.e., participants were asked to hold an
   object in their hands during the task) . The task consisted in repeating
   a loud the odd or even digit within a pair depending on the type of the
   preceding or following object. Order of presentation (object number vs.
   number-object) , Object type (graspable vs. ungraspable), Object size
   (small vs. large) , and Numerical magnitude (small vs. large) were
   manipulated for each experiment. Experiment 1 showed a facilitation - in
   terms of quicker responses - for graspable over ungraspable objects
   preceded by numbers, and an effect of numerical magnitude after the
   presentation of graspable objects. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the
   action execution enhanced overall the sensitivity to numerical
   magnitude, and that at the same time it interfered with the effects of
   objects affordances on number processing. Overall, these findings
   demonstrate that numbers and graspable objects are strongly
   interrelated, supporting the view that abstract concepts may be grounded
   in the motor experience.}},

Title = {{Experience Influences Brain Mechanisms of Watching Dance}},
Journal = {{DANCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{352-377}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{The study of dance has been helpful to advance our understanding of how
   human brain networks of action observation are influenced by experience.
   However previous studies have not examined the effect of extensive
   visual experience alone: for example, an art critic or dance fan who has
   a rich experience of watching dance but negligible experience performing
   dance. To explore the effect of pure visual experience we performed a
   single experiment using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to
   compare the neural processing of dance actions in 3 groups: a) 14 ballet
   dancers, b) 10 experienced viewers, c) 12 novices without any extensive
   dance or viewing experience.
   Each of the 36 participants viewed short 2-second displays of ballet
   derived from motion capture of a professional ballerina. These displays
   represented the ballerina as only points of light at the major joints.
   We wished to study the action observation network broadly and thus
   included two different types of display and two different tasks for
   participants to perform. The two different displays were: a) brief
   movies of a ballet action and b) frames from the ballet movies with the
   points of lights connected by lines to show a ballet posture. The two
   different tasks were: a) passively observe the display and b) imagine
   performing the action depicted in the display. The two levels of display
   and task were combined factorially to produce four experimental
   conditions (observe movie, observe posture, motor image, of movie, motor
   imagery of posture). The set of stimuli used in the experiment are
   available for download after this paper.
   A random effects ANOVA was performed on brain activity and an effect of
   experience was obtained in seven different brain areas including: right
   Temporoparietal junction (TPF), left Retrosplenial Cortex (RSC), right
   Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1), bilateral Primary Motor Cortex (M1),
   right Orbitofrontal Cortex (OFC), right Temporal Pole (TP). The patterns
   of activation were plotted in each of these areas (TPF, RSC, S1, M1,
   OFC, TP) to investigate more closely how the effect of experience
   changed across these areas. For this analysis, novices were treated as
   baseline and the relative effect of experience examined in the dancer
   and experienced viewer groups.
   Interpretation of these results suggests that both visual and motor
   experience appear equivalent in producing more extensive early
   processing of dance actions in early stages of representation (TPF and
   RSC) and we hypothesise that this could be due to the involvement of
   autobiographical memory processes. The pattern of results found for
   dancers in S1 and M1 suggest that their perception of dance actions are
   enhanced by embodied processes. For example, the Si results are
   consistent with claims that this brain area shows mirror properties. The
   pattern of results found for the experienced viewers in OFC and TP
   suggests that their perception of dance actions are enhanced by
   cognitive processes. For example, involving aspects of social cognition
   and hedonic processing the experienced viewers find the motor imagery
   task more pleasant and have richer connections of dance to social
   memory. While aspects of our interpretation are speculative the core
   results clearly show common and distinct aspects of how viewing
   experience and physical experience shape brain responses to watching
   dance.}},

Abstract = {{Very little is known about the neurobiological correlates of reward
   processing during social decision-making in the developing brain and
   whether prior social and moral information (reputations) modulates
   reward responses in youth as has been demonstrated in adults. Moreover,
   although externalizing behavior problems in youth are associated with
   deficits in reward processing and social cognition, a real-life social
   interaction paradigm using functional neuroimaging (fMRI) has not yet
   been applied to probe reward processing in such youth. Functional
   neuroimaging was used to examine the neural correlates of reward-related
   decision-making during a trust task in two samples of age-matched 11 to
   16-year-old boys: with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) externalizing
   behavior problems. The task required subjects to decide whether to share
   or keep monetary rewards from partners they themselves identified during
   a real-life peer sociometric procedure as interpersonally aggressive or
   kind (vs. neutral). Results supported the notion that prior social and
   moral information (reputations) modulated reward responses in the
   adolescent brain. Moreover, boys with externalizing problems showed
   differential activation in the bilateral insula during the decision
   phase of the game as well as the caudate and anterior insula during the
   outcome phase of the game. Similar activation in adolescents in response
   to reward related stimuli as found in adults suggests some developmental
   continuity in corticostriatal circuits. Group differences are
   interpreted with caution given the small group sizes in the current
   study. Notwithstanding this limitation, the study provides preliminary
   evidence for anomalous reward responses in boys with externalizing
   behavior problems, thereby providing a possible biological correlate of
   well-established social-cognitive and reward-related theories of
   externalizing behavior disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the
   neurofunctional alterations in both acute and chronic post-traumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from the same stress experience.
   Methods: Brain responses to emotional trauma-related and neutral
   pictures with a symptom provocation task were measured using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four PTSD patients resulting
   from a mining accident and 14 controls exposed to the same accident
   without PTSD two months post-trauma were recruited. In the follow-up
   study 20 PTSD patients and 14 controls were also recruited after 24
   months post-trauma. Correlations were conducted in PTSD between altered
   fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals of areas extracted
   as regions of interest and three Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale
   (CAPS) subscores respectively.
   Results: In response to picture stimulus (traumatic negative pictures
   versus neutral pictures), the acute PTSD group showed greater activation
   in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyri, left precuneus, right
   fusiform and left parahippocampal gyrus than the chronic PTSD group (P <
   0.001, cluster size > 20 voxels). In the acute PTSD group, BOLD signals
   of either posterior cingulate gyrus correlated positively with CAPS
   intrusion subscores. There was also no significant correlation between
   BOLD signals of five regions mentioned above in the chronic PTSD group
   and three CAPS subscores.
   Discussion: These findings suggested that brain circuits affected in
   acute PTSD may be more extended than chronic PTSD. The reason may due to
   the formation of traumatic memory in the acute phase of PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{An impaired ability to appreciate other people's mental states is a
   well-established and stable cognitive deficit in schizophrenia, which
   might explain some aspects of patients' social dysfunction. Yet, despite
   a wealth of literature on this topic, the basic mechanisms underlying
   these impairments are still poorly understood, and their links with the
   clinical dimensions of schizophrenia remain unclear. The present study
   aimed to investigate the extent to which patients' impaired ability to
   appreciate other people's intentions (known as mentalizing) may be
   accounted for by abnormal interaction between the two types of
   information that contribute to this ability: (i) the sensory evidence
   conveyed by movement kinematics; and (ii) the observer's prior
   expectations. We hypothesized that this is not a generalized impairment,
   but one confined to certain types of intentions. To test this
   assumption, we designed four tasks in which participants were required
   to infer either: (i) basic intentions (i.e. the simple goal of a motor
   act); (ii) superordinate intentions (i.e. the general goal of a sequence
   of motor acts); (iii) social basic; or (iv) social superordinate
   intentions (i.e. simple or general goals achieved within the context of
   a reciprocal interaction). In each of these tasks, both prior
   expectations and sensory information were manipulated. We found that
   patients correctly inferred non-social, basic intentions, but
   experienced difficulties when inferring non-social superordinate
   intentions and both basic and superordinate social intentions. These
   poor performances were associated with two abnormal patterns of
   interaction between prior expectations and sensory evidence. In the
   non-social superordinate condition, patients relied heavily on their
   prior expectations, while disregarding sensory evidence. This pattern of
   interaction predicted the severity of `positive' symptoms. Social
   conditions prompted exactly the opposite pattern of interaction:
   patients exhibited weaker dependence on prior expectations while relying
   strongly on sensory evidence, and this predicted the severity of
   `negative' symptoms. We suggest both these patterns can be accounted for
   by a disturbance in the Bayesian inferential mechanism that integrates
   sensory evidence (conveyed by movement kinematics) into prior beliefs
   (about others' mental states and attitudes) to produce accurate
   inferences about other people's intentions.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies implicate superior temporal sulcus (STS) in the
   perception of human movement. More recent theories hold that STS is also
   involved in the understanding of human movement. However, almost no
   studies to date have associated STS function with observable variability
   in action understanding. The present study directly associated STS
   activity with performance on a challenging task requiring the
   interpretation of human movement. During functional MRI scanning,
   fourteen adults were asked to identify the direction (left or right) in
   which either a point-light walking figure or spinning wheel were moving.
   The task was made challenging by perturbing the dot trajectories to a
   level (determined via pretesting) where each participant achieved 72\%
   accuracy. The walking figure condition was associated with increased
   activity in a constellation of social information processing and
   biological motion areas, including STS, MT+/V5, right pars opercularis
   (inferior frontal gyrus), fusiform gyrus, and amygdala. Correctly
   answered walking figure trials were uniquely associated with increased
   activity in two right hemisphere STS clusters and right amygdala.
   Present findings provide some of the strongest evidence to date that STS
   plays a critical role in the successful interpretation of human
   movement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social interaction requires the ability to infer another person's mental
   state (Theory of Mind. TOM) and also executive functions. This fMRI
   study aimed to identify the cerebral correlates activated by ToM during
   a specific social interaction, the human-human competition. In this
   framework, we tested a conflict resolution task (Stroop) adapted to a
   virtual situation of competition. The participants were instructed to
   play in order to win either against a human-like competitor (human-human
   competition) or against a non-human competitor (human-machine
   competition). Only the human-human competition requires ToM as this type
   of competition is performed under social interaction. We identified
   first the classical network of executive regions activated by Stroop.
   Secondly, we identified the social (human-human) competition regions,
   represented by the bilateral superior and inferior frontal gyri, the
   anterior cingulate, the insula, the superior and anterior temporal, the
   hippocampus, the fusiform gyrus, the cuneus and the precuneus. Finally,
   we identified the executive regions that were modulated by the
   human-human competition, i.e., the executive control regions
   additionally activated when mentalizing in the context of social
   competition. They constituted a network predominant to the right and
   composed of the superior and middle frontal, anterior cingulate, insula
   and fusiform gyrus. We suggest that our experimental paradigm may be
   useful in exploration of the cerebral correlates of social adjustments
   in several situations such as psychiatric disorders presenting executive
   and social dysfunctions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Action observation engages higher motor areas, possibly reflecting an
   internal simulation. However, actions considered odd or unusual were
   found to trigger additional activity in the so-called theory of mind
   (ToM) network, pointing to deliberations on the actor's mental states.
   In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, the hypothesis was
   tested that an allocentric perspective on a normal action, and even more
   so the sight of the actor's face, suffices to evoke ToM activity.
   Subjects observed short videos of object manipulation filmed from either
   the egocentric or the allocentric perspective, the latter including the
   actor's face in half of the trials. On the basis of a regions of
   interest analysis using ToM coordinates, we found increased neural
   activity in several regions of the ToM network. First, perceiving
   actions from an allocentric compared with the egocentric perspective
   enhanced activity in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Second,
   the presence of the actor's face enhanced activation in the TPJ
   bilaterally, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC). Finally, the mPFC and PCC showed increased responses when
   the actor changed with respect to the preceding trial. These findings
   were further corroborated by zmap findings for the latter two contrasts.
   Together, findings indicate that observation of normal everyday actions
   can engage ToM areas and that an allocentric perspective, seeing the
   actor's face and seeing a face switch, are effective triggers. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{This paper introduces the idea of drawing upon the cognitive
   neuroscience literature to inform IS research (herein termed
   ``NeuroIS{''}). Recent advances in cognitive neuroscience are uncovering
   the neural bases of cognitive, emotional, and social processes, and they
   offer new insights into the complex interplay between IT and information
   processing, decision making, and behavior among people, organizations,
   and markets.
   The paper reviews the emerging cognitive neuroscience literature to
   propose a set of seven opportunities that IS researchers can use to
   inform IS phenomena, namely (1) localizing the neural correlates of IS
   constructs, (2) capturing hidden mental processes, (3) complementing
   existing sources of IS data with brain data, (4) identifying antecedents
   of IS constructs, (5) testing consequences of IS constructs, (6)
   inferring the temporal ordering among IS constructs, and (7) challenging
   assumptions and enhancing IS theories.
   The paper proposes a framework for exploring the potential of cognitive
   neuroscience for IS research and offers examples of potentially fertile
   intersections of cognitive neuroscience and IS research in the domains
   of design science and human-computer interaction. This is followed by an
   example NeuroIS study in the context of e-commerce adoption using fMRI,
   which spawns interesting new insights. The challenges of using
   functional neuroimaging tools are also discussed. The paper concludes
   that there is considerable potential for using cognitive neuroscience
   theories and functional brain imaging tools in IS research to enhance IS
   theories.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research has revealed not
   only important aspects of the neural basis of cognitive and perceptual
   functions, but also important information on the relation between
   high-level brain functions and physiology. One of the central
   outstanding questions, given the features of the blood oxygenation
   level-dependent (BOLD) signal, is whether and how autonomic nervous
   system (ANS) functions are related to changes in brain states as
   measured in the human brain. A straightforward way to address this
   question has been to acquire external measurements of ANS activity such
   as cardiac and respiratory data, and examine their relation to the BOLD
   signal. In this article, we describe two conceptual approaches to the
   treatment of ANS measures in the context of BOLD fMRI analysis. On the
   one hand, several research lines have treated ANS activity measures as
   noise, considering them as nothing but a confounding factor that reduces
   the power of fMRI analysis or its validity. Work in this line has
   developed powerful methods to remove ANS effects from the BOLD signal.
   On the other hand, a different line of work has made important progress
   in showing that ANS functions such as cardiac pulsation, heart rate
   variability and breathing rate could be considered as a theoretically
   meaningful component of the signal that is useful for understanding
   brain function. Work within this latter framework suggests that caution
   should be exercised when employing procedures to remove correlations
   between BOLD data and physiological measures. We discuss these two
   positions and the reasoning underlying them. Thereafter, we draw on the
   reviewed literature in presenting practical guidelines for treatment of
   ANS data, which are based on the premise that ANS data should be
   considered as theoretically meaningful information. This holds
   particularly when studying cortical systems involved in regulation,
   monitoring and/or generation of ANS activity, such as those involved in
   decision making, conflict resolution and the experience of emotion. (C)

Abstract = {{Long debated within the humanistic tradition, the concept of `self' has
   recently been embraced as a subject of investigation by cognitive
   neuroscience. Tracing parallels between ancient philosophical ideas and
   current-day scientific research on the `self', the author proposes that
   contemporary knowledge based on empirical neuroscientific evidence may
   inform novel perspectives on-and draw inspiration from-notions grounded
   in ancient intuitions and traditionally falling within humanistic fields
   of enquiry. Further, the author suggests that the `self', as a major
   object of philosophical and psychological enquiry, as well as a central
   component of human motivation, cognition, affect and social identity, is
   an inherently cross-disciplinary research topic, which, by virtue of its
   pervasive and defining presence in human existence, lends itself-and
   demands-to be approached both from scientific (objective) and
   phenomenological (subjective) vantage points. On this premise, the
   author proposes that the study of the `self' provides both

Abstract = {{Women show higher sensitivity than men to emotional and social cues and
   are therefore better in showing empathy with others and in deciphering
   other's intentions and mental states. These sex differences have been
   linked to hormonal levels. However, it remains unclear how hormones
   modulate neural mechanisms underlying empathic processes. To assess
   effects of chronic hormonal treatment, functional magnetic resonance
   imaging was used in a group of female-to-male transsexuals before and
   during androgen therapy and a group of female and male controls while
   they watched pictures portraying emotionally negative or neutral
   situations (emotional content) involving one or two persons (social
   relation). Before therapy, the medial superior frontal gyrus and left
   inferior frontal gyrus showed greater activations for emotional than
   neutral stimuli. The posterior superior temporal sulcus showed greater
   activations for emotional vs. neutral stimuli and for social relations
   relative to pictures of single persons. Long-term androgen
   administration reduced the pSTS activity in response to emotional
   stimuli as well as its response to social relation. More importantly,
   the functional connectivity among frontal, temporal and striatal regions
   was weakened while the connectivity among limbic regions was
   strengthened as the androgen level increased during hormone therapy.
   This pattern of change was similar to the sex difference observed
   between female vs. male controls. Thus, making a brain more male by the
   application of androgens not only reduced the activity of a core neural
   hub but also markedly altered the organization of the brain network
   supporting emotional and social cognitive processes related to empathy
   and mentalizing.}},

Abstract = {{Humor is enjoyable, yet few studies to date have reported that humor
   engages brain regions involved in reward processing (i.e., the
   mesolimbic reward system). Even fewer have investigated socially
   relevant, dynamic displays of real actors telling jokes. Instead, many
   studies have focused on responses to static cartoons or written jokes in
   isolation. In the present investigation, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine brain activation in response to
   video clips of comedians performing stand-up comedy, a more socially
   relevant task than reading jokes or cartoons in isolation. Participants
   watched video clips of eight stand-up comedians, half female/half male,
   that were prerated by a separate group of participants from the same
   population as eliciting either high or low levels of amusement, thereby
   allowing us to control for comedian attributes and comedic style. We
   found that high-funny clips elicited more activation in several brain
   regions involved with reward responses, including the nucleus accumbens,
   caudate, and putamen. A regression with participants' own ratings of
   humor revealed similar activity in reward areas as well as in regions
   involved in theory of mind. These findings indicate that dynamic social
   displays of humor do engage reward responses. The rewarding nature of
   humor may help explain why it is so valued socially.}},

Abstract = {{A computational model was developed to explain a pattern of results of
   fMRI activation in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) supporting visual
   working memory for multiobject scenes. The model is based on the
   hypothesis that dendrites of excitatory neurons are major computational
   elements in the cortical circuit. Dendrites enable formation of a
   competitive queue that exhibits a gradient of activity values for nodes
   encoding different objects, and this pattern is stored in working
   memory. In the model, brain imaging data are interpreted as a
   consequence of blood flow arising from dendritic processing. Computer
   simulations showed that the model successfully simulates data showing
   the involvement of inferior IPS in object individuation and spatial
   grouping through representation of objects' locations in space, along
   with the involvement of superior IPS in object identification through
   representation of a set of objects' features. The model exhibits a
   capacity limit due to the limited dynamic range for nodes and the
   operation of lateral inhibition among them. The capacity limit is fixed
   in the inferior IPS regardless of the objects' complexity, due to the
   normalization of lateral inhibition, and variable in the superior IPS,
   due to the different encoding demands for simple and complex shapes.
   Systematic variation in the strength of self-excitation enables an
   understanding of the individual differences in working memory capacity.
   The model offers several testable predictions regarding the neural basis
   of visual working memory.}},

Abstract = {{People are able to rapidly infer complex personality traits and mental
   states even from the most minimal person information. Research has shown
   that when observers view a natural scene containing people, they spend a
   disproportionate amount of their time looking at the social features
   (e.g., faces, bodies). Does this preference for social features merely
   reflect the biological salience of these features or are observers
   spontaneously attempting to make sense of complex social dynamics? Using
   functional neuroimaging, we investigated neural responses to social and
   nonsocial visual scenes in a large sample of participants (n = 48) who
   varied on an individual difference measure assessing empathy and
   mentalizing (i.e., empathizing). Compared with other scene categories,
   viewing natural social scenes activated regions associated with social
   cognition (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and temporal poles).
   Moreover, activity in these regions during social scene viewing was
   strongly correlated with individual differences in empathizing. These
   findings offer neural evidence that observers spontaneously engage in
   social cognition when viewing complex social material but that the
   degree to which people do so is mediated by individual differences in
   trait empathizing.}},

Abstract = {{The mother-infant bond provides the foundation for the infant's future
   mental health and adaptation and depends on the provision of
   species-typical maternal behaviors that are supported by neuroendocrine
   and motivation-affective neural systems. Animal research has
   demonstrated that natural variations in patterns of maternal care chart
   discrete profiles of maternal brain-behavior relationships that uniquely
   shape the infant's lifetime capacities for stress regulation and social
   affiliation. Such patterns of maternal care are mediated by the
   neuropeptide Oxytocin and by stress-and reward-related neural systems.
   Human studies have similarly shown that maternal synchrony-the
   coordination of maternal behavior with infant signals-and
   intrusiveness-the excessive expression of maternal behavior-describe
   distinct and stable maternal styles that bear long-term consequences for
   infant well-being. To integrate brain, hormones, and behavior in the
   study of maternal-infant bonding, we examined the fMRI responses of
   synchronous vs intrusive mothers to dynamic, ecologically valid infant
   videos and their correlations with plasma Oxytocin. In all, 23 mothers
   were videotaped at home interacting with their infants and plasma OT
   assayed. Sessions were micro-coded for synchrony and intrusiveness.
   Mothers were scanned while observing several own and standard
   infant-related vignettes. Synchronous mothers showed greater activations
   in the left nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and intrusive mothers exhibited
   higher activations in the right amygdala. Functional connectivity
   analysis revealed that among synchronous mothers, left NAcc and right
   amygdala were functionally correlated with emotion modulation,
   theory-of-mind, and empathy networks. Among intrusive mothers, left NAcc
   and right amygdala were functionally correlated with pro-action areas.
   Sorting points into neighborhood (SPIN) analysis demonstrated that in
   the synchronous group, left NAcc and right amygdala activations showed
   clearer organization across time, whereas among intrusive mothers,
   activations of these nuclei exhibited greater cross-time
   disorganization. Correlations between Oxytocin with left NAcc and right
   amygdala activations were found only in the synchronous group.
   Well-adapted parenting appears to be underlay by reward-related
   motivational mechanisms, temporal organization, and affiliation
   hormones, whereas anxious parenting is likely mediated by stress-related
   mechanisms and greater neural disorganization. Assessing the integration
   of motivation and social networks into unified neural activity that
   reflects variations in patterns of parental care may prove useful for
   the study of optimal vs high-risk parenting. Neuropsychopharmacology

Abstract = {{The ability to recognize emotional facial expressions is crucial to
   adequate social behavior. Previous studies have suggested deficits in
   emotion recognition in multiple sclerosis (MS). These deficits were
   accompanied by several confounders including cognitive or visual
   impairments, disease duration, and depression. In our study we used
   functional MRI (fMRI) to test for potential early adaptive changes in
   only mildly disabled MS patients performing an emotion recognition task
   including the facial expressions of the emotions anger, fear and
   disgust. Fifteen relapsing-remitting MS patients with a median Expanded
   Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 2 (range: 0-3.5) and 15 healthy
   controls (HC) matched for age, gender, and education underwent
   behavioral (BERT: behavioral emotion recognition test; BRB-N: Brief
   Repeatable Battery for neuropsychological tests, WCST: Wisconsin Card
   Sorting Test) and clinical assessments (BDI: Beck Depression Inventory).
   Conventional MRI at 3.0T served to assess whole-brain volume, white
   matter, gray matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and T2-lesion load; during
   fMRI, participants were confronted with neutral, scrambled, angry,
   disgusted, and fearful faces, and houses. In the absence of differences
   in cognitive performance and in the ability to accurately recognize
   distinct emotional facial expressions, MS patients demonstrated excess
   fMRI activations during facial recognition compared to HC. These
   differences concerned the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus
   for anger and disgust contrasted to neutral faces, and the occipital
   fusiform gyri and the anterior CC for neutral faces versus houses. This
   study provides first evidence for excess activation during processing of
   higher order visual stimuli of emotional content in the absence of
   emotional, visual or cognitive behavior abnormalities already in earlier
   stages of MS.}},

Abstract = {{Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined on a clinical basis
   by impairments in social interaction, verbal and non-verbal
   communication, and repetitive or stereotyped behaviours. Voxel based
   morphometry (VBM), a technique that gives a probabilistic measure of
   local grey matter (GM) and white matter concentration, has been used to
   study ASD patients: modifications in GM volume have been found in
   various brain regions, such as the corpus callosum, brainstem, amygdala,
   hippocampus and cerebellum. However, the findings are inconsistent with
   respect to the specific localisation and direction of GM modifications,
   and no paper has attempted to statistically summarise the results
   available in the literature.
   Methods The present study is a quantitative meta-analysis of the current
   VBM findings aimed at delineating the cortical regions with consistently
   increased or reduced GM concentrations. The activation likelihood
   estimation (ALE) was used, which is a quantitative voxel based
   meta-analysis method which can be used to estimate consistent
   activations across different imaging studies. Co-occurrence statistics
   of a PubMed query were generated, employing `autism spectrum disorder'
   as the neuroanatomical lexicon.
   Results Significant ALE values related to GM increases were observed
   bilaterally in the cerebellum, in the middle temporal gyrus, in the
   right anterior cingulate cortex, caudate head, insula, fusiform gyrus,
   precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, and in the left lingual gyrus.
   GM decreases were observed bilaterally in the cerebellar tonsil and
   inferior parietal lobule, in the right amygdala, insula, middle temporal
   gyrus, caudate tail and precuneus and in the left precentral gyrus.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale Impaired emotion processing in schizophrenia predicts broader
   social dysfunction and has been related to negative symptom severity and
   amygdala dysfunction. Pharmacological modulation of emotion-processing
   deficits and related neural abnormalities may provide useful phenotypes
   for pathophysiological investigation.
   Objectives We used an acute benzodiazepine challenge to identify and
   modulate potential emotion-processing abnormalities in 20 unaffected
   first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia, compared to 25
   control subjects without a family history of psychosis.
   Methods An oral 1 mg dose of the short-acting anxiolytic benzodiazepine
   alprazolam was administered in a balanced crossover placebo-controlled
   double-blind design, preceding identical 3 T fMRI sessions approximately
   1 week apart. Primary outcomes included fMRI activity in amygdala and
   related regions during two facial emotion-processing tasks: emotion
   identification and emotion memory.
   Results Family members exhibited abnormally strong alprazolam-induced
   reduction in amygdala and hippocampus activation during emotion
   identification, compared to equal reduction in both groups for the
   emotion memory task.
   Conclusions GABAergic modulation with alprazolam produced differential
   responses in family members vs. controls, perhaps by unmasking
   underlying amygdalar and/or GABAergic abnormalities. Such
   pharmacological fMRI paradigms could prove useful for developing drugs
   targeting specific neural circuits to treat or prevent schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{The hopelessness theory (HT) of depression is a diathesis-stress theory
   which construes cognitive vulnerability (CV) to depression. Neuroimaging
   studies examining depression have implicated the amygdala as an
   important potential locus of dysfunction in the processing of salient
   threatening stimuli. However, little is known about neural activation in
   the brain of subjects with CV to depression. Medication-free major
   depressive disorder (MDD) subjects (N=29), never depressed subjects with
   CV (N=26), and demographically matched never depressed healthy control
   (HC) subjects (N=31) were scanned using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) while performing an emotional matching task. The MDD
   subjects showed elevated left amygdala responses and reduced left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dIPFC) activation levels relative to HC
   subjects. Similarly, CV subjects had greater activity in the amygdala
   bilaterally and lesser activation in the dIPFC bilaterally, relative to
   HC subjects. The present findings raise the possibility that cognitive
   vulnerability to depression might be characterized by hypoactivation of
   the prefrontal cortex and hyperactivation of the amygdala in response to
   emotional stimuli; our observations might provide a potential
   interpretation to explain the abnormalities in neural networks mediating
   cognitive modulation of emotions in individuals with cognitive
   vulnerability to depression. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MIND AND BEHAVIOR}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{5-48}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{References to human dignity abound in contemporary political, legal, and
   ethical documents and practices, including a widening representation in
   bioethical contexts. Appeals to dignity characteristically involve some
   notion of equality (that all humans or persons have a special kind of
   worth captured by that term) and the idea that there is some range of
   actions which ought never to be directed at persons (e.g., torture).
   However, much of this contemporary use of dignity leaves the concept
   itself under-developed or poorly grounded. This sometimes conduces to a
   broadly skeptical view that dignity has any determinate content, or that
   it can be grounded independently of either religion or rationalism. I
   argue that dignity has substantial connections to modern biological
   views of human beings, and that the biological matrix for dignity should
   be explored to help remedy these shortcomings. I propose three major
   biological contexts for understanding dignity in a naturalistic fashion:
   reciprocity and punishment, in so far as both are implicated in the
   promotion of pro-social cooperative behavior among humans, and dignity
   as a communicative signal that also has power to promote cooperation.
   Each of these three components is explored in some detail by reference
   to a wide range of contemporary scientific literature. Finally, I make
   suggestions for how it might be possible to study dignity in a fully
   scientific way, by adapting methods and techniques already
   well-established in biological, physiological, and neuroscientific study
   of human cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{The expertise of others is a major social influence on our everyday
   decisions and actions. Many viewers of art, whether expert or naive, are
   convinced that the full esthetic apperciation of an artwork depends upon
   the assurance that the work is genuine rather than fake. Remberandt
   portraits provide an interesting image set for testing this idea, as
   there is a large number of them and recent scholarship has determined
   that quite a few fakes and copies exist. Use of this image set allowed
   us to separate the brain's response to images of genuine and fake
   pictures from the brain's response to external advice about the
   authenticity of the paintings. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, viewing of artworks assigned as ``copy,{''} rather than
   ``authentic,{''} evoked stronger responses in frontopolar cortex (FPC),
   and right precuneus, regardless of whether the portrait was actually
   genuine. Advice about authenticity had no direct effect on the cortical
   visual areas responsive to the paintings, but there was a significant
   psycho-physiological interaction between the FPC and the lateral
   occipital area, which suggests that these visual areas may be modlulated
   by FPC. We propose that the activation of brian networks rather than a
   single cortical area in the paradigm supports the art scholars' view
   that esthetic judgements are multi-faceted and multi-dimensional in
   nature.}},

Title = {{A combined robotic and cognitive training for locomotor rehabilitation:
   evidences of cerebral functional reorganization in two chronic traumatic
   brain injured patients}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that automated locomotor training can improve
   walking capabilities spinal cord-injured subjects but its effectiveness
   on brain damaged patients has not been well established. A possible
   explanation of the discordant results on the efficacy of robotic
   training in patients with cerebral lesions could be that these patients.
   besides stimulation of physiological motor patterns through passive leg
   movements, also need to train the cognitive aspects of motor control.
   Indeed another way to stimulated cerebral motor areas in paretic
   patients is to use the cognitive function of motor imagery. A promising
   possibility is thus to combine sensorimotor training with the use of
   motor imagery. The aim of this paper is to assess changes in brain
   activations after a combined sensorimotor and cognitive training for
   gait rehabilitation. The protocol consisted of the integrated use of a
   robotic gait orthosis prototype with locomotor imagery tasks. Assessment
   was conducted on two patients with chronic traumatic brain injury and
   major gait impairments, using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Physiatric functional scales were used to assess clinical outcomes.
   Results showed greater activation post-training in the sensorimotor and
   supplementary motor cortices, as well as enhanced functional
   connectivity within the motor network improvements in balance and, to a
   lesser extent, in gait outcomes were also found.}},

Title = {{Specificity of esthetic experience for artworks: an fMRI study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{In a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, where
   we investigated the neural correlates of esthetic experience, we found
   the observing canonical sculptures, relative to sculptures whose
   proportions had been modified, produced the activation of a network that
   included the lateral occipital gyrus, precuneus, prefrontal areas, and,
   most interestingly, the right anterior insula. We interpreted this
   latter activation as the neural signature underpinning hedonic response
   during esthetic experience. With the aim of exploring whether this
   specific hedonic response is also present during the observation of
   non-art biological stimuli, in the present fMRI study we compared the
   activations associated with viewing masterpieces of classical sculpture
   with those produced by the observation of pictures of young athletes.
   The two stimulus-categories were matched on various factors, including
   body postures, proportion, and expressed dynamism. The stimuli were
   presented in two conditions: observation and esthetic judgment. The two
   stimulus-categories produced a rather similar global activation pattern.
   Direct comparisons between sculpture and real-body images revealed,
   however, relevant differences, among which the activation of right
   antero-dorsal insula during sculptures viewing only. Along with our
   previous data, this finding suggests that the hedonic state associated
   with activation of right dorsal anterior insula underpins esthetic
   experience for artworks.}},

Abstract = {{Self-regulation of brain activity in humans based on real-time feedback
   of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) signal is emerging as a
   potentially powerful, new technique. Here, we assessed whether patients
   with Parkinson's disease (PD) are able to alter local brain activity to
   improve motor function. Five patients learned to increase activity in
   the supplementary motor complex over two fMRI sessions using motor
   imagery. They attained asmuchactivation in this target brain region as
   during a localizer procedure with overt movements. Concomitantly, they
   showed an improvement in motor speed (finger tapping) and clinical
   ratings of motor symptoms (37\% improvement of the motor scale of the
   Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). Activation during
   neurofeedback was also observed in other cortical motor areas and the
   basal ganglia, including the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus,
   which are connected to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and crucial
   nodes in the pathophysiology of PD. A PD control group of five patients,
   matched for clinical severity and medication, underwent the same
   procedure but did not receive feedback about their SMA activity. This
   group attained no control of SMA activation and showed no motor
   improvement. These findings demonstrate that self-modulation of
   cortico-subcortical motor circuits can be achieved by PD patients
   through neurofeedback and may result in clinical benefits that are not
   attainable by motor imagery alone.}},

Title = {{A Head View-Invariant Representation of Gaze Direction in Anterior

Journal = {{CURRENT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{1817-1821}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Humans show a remarkable ability to discriminate others' gaze direction,
   even though a given direction can be conveyed by many physically
   dissimilar configurations of different eye positions and head views. For
   example, eye contact can be signaled by a rightward glance in a
   left-turned head or by direct gaze in a front-facing head. Such acute
   gaze discrimination implies considerable perceptual invariance. Previous
   human research found that superior temporal sulcus (STS) responds
   preferentially to gaze shifts {[}1], but the underlying representation
   that supports such general responsiveness remains poorly understood.
   Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of human functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we tested whether STS contains a
   higher-order, head view-invariant code for gaze direction. The results
   revealed a finely graded gaze direction code in right anterior STS that
   was invariant to head view and physical image features. Further analyses
   revealed similar gaze effects in left anterior STS and precuneus. Our
   results suggest that anterior STS codes the direction of another's
   attention regardless of how this information is conveyed and demonstrate
   how high-level face areas carry out fine-grained, perceptually relevant
   discrimination through invariance to other face features.}},

Abstract = {{Although the role of IQ in developmental dyslexia remains ambiguous, the

   dyslexia that requires reading skill to be significantly below the level

   functional MRI (fMRI) to examine whether differences in brain activation
   during phonological processing that are characteristic of dyslexia were
   similar or dissimilar in children with poor reading ability who had high
   IQ scores (discrepant readers) and in children with poor reading ability
   who had low IQ scores (nondiscrepant readers). In two independent
   samples including a total of 131 children, using univariate and
   multivariate pattern analyses, we found that discrepant and
   nondiscrepant poor readers exhibited similar patterns of reduced
   activation in brain areas such as left parietotemporal and
   occipitotemporal regions. These results converge with behavioral
   evidence indicating that, regardless of IQ, poor readers have similar
   kinds of reading difficulties in relation to phonological processing.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Functional neuroimaging studies on schizophrenia have
   suggested abnormal task-related functional connectivity in patients with
   schizophrenia who have auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). However,
   little is known about intrinsic functional connectivity in these
   patients. Methods: Between January 2009 and February 2010, we studied
   patients with schizophrenia who had persistent and treatment-refractory
   AVHs in comparison with healthy controls. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we studied the functional connectivity of multiple
   resting state networks (RSNs) and their relation to symptom severity. We
   analyzed the data using a spatial group independent component analysis,
   and we used random-effects t tests to compare spatial components between
   groups. Results: There were 10 patients and 14 controls enrolled in this
   study. In total, 16 RSNs were identified, from which we selected 4
   networks of interest for further analyses. Within a speech-related
   network, patients showed increased connectivity in bilateral temporal
   regions and decreased connectivity in the cingulate cortex. Within 2
   additional RSNs associated with attention and executive control,
   respectively, patients exhibited abnormal connectivity in the precuneus
   and right lateral prefrontal areas. We found correlations between
   measures of AVH severity and functional connectivity of the left
   anterior cingulate, left superior temporal gyrus and right lateral
   prefrontal cortex. Limitations: The relatively small sample size, the
   patients' use of antipsychotic medication and the lack of a clinical
   control group have to be considered as potential limitations.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that disrupted intrinsic connectivity
   of a speech-related network could underlie persistent AVHs in patients
   with schizophrenia. In addition, the occurrence of hallucinatory
   symptoms seems to modulate RSNs associated with attention and executive
   control.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Several functional neuroimaging studies have reported
   regionally abnormal activation of the frontal cortex in individuals with
   borderline personality disorder (BPD) during cognitive and affective
   task performance. However, little is known about neural function in
   individuals with BPD during the resting state. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), this study investigated the functional
   connectivity of prefrontal and limbic networks in patients with BPD.
   Methods: Between January 2009 and March 2010, we investigated patients
   with BPD according to DSM-IV criteria and healthy controls by means of
   resting-state fMRI. The data were analyzed using a spatial group
   independent component analysis, and random effects t tests were used to
   compare spatial components between groups (p < 0.005, uncorrected).
   Results: There were 17 women with BPD and 17 female healthy controls
   enrolled in this study. Within a network comprising cortical midline
   regions ({''}default mode network{''}), patients with BPD showed an
   increase in functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex (FPC)
   and the left insula, whereas decreased connectivity was found in the
   left cuneus. Within a network comprising predominantly right lateral
   prefrontal and bilateral parietal regions, patients with BPD showed
   decreased connectivity of the left inferior parietal lobule and the
   right middle temporal cortex compared with healthy controls. Two
   networks comprising lateral prefrontal and cingulate regions did not
   exhibit significant between-group differences. We found correlations
   between functional connectivity of the FPC and measures of impulsivity
   as well as between connectivity of the insula/cuneus and dissociation
   tension. Limitations: Co-occurrent axis I disorders and medication use
   in this sample of patients with BPD have to be considered as potential
   limitations. Conclusion: These data suggest that abnormal functional
   connectivity of temporally coherent resting-state networks may underlie
   certain symptom clusters in patients with BPD.}},

   characterized by both the greater power of the delta and alpha2 rhythms
   mostly in the right hemisphere and widespread increase in the gamma2
   power as compared with the control task. Positive correlations between
   delta and gamma2 rhythms in baseline condition were revealed in the
   fronto-parietal cortex, and this relationship between low- and
   high-frequency oscillations while `divergent' task performing was found
   in the right posterior cortex. Special topographic patterns of delta and

Abstract = {{Recent advances have shown much in common between epilepsy and other

   resembles a transient vegetative or minimally conscious state. These
   disorders all converge on the ``consciousness system{''} the bilateral
   medial and lateral fronto-parietal association cortex and subcortical
   arousal systems. Epileptic unconsciousness has enormous clinical
   significance leading to accidental injuries, decreased work and school
   productivity, and social stigmatization. Ongoing research to better
   understand the mechanisms of impaired consciousness in epilepsy,
   including neuroimaging studies and fundamental animal models, will
   hopefully soon enable treatment trails to reduce epileptic
   unconsciousness and improve patient quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{In daily communication, we often use indirect speech to convey our
   intention. However, little is known about the brain mechanisms that
   underlie the comprehension of indirect speech. In this study, we
   conducted a functional MRI experiment using a scenario reading task to
   compare the neural activity induced by an indirect reply (a type of
   indirect speech) and a literal sentence. Participants read a short
   scenario consisting of three sentences. The first two sentences
   explained the situation of the protagonists, whereas the third sentence
   had an indirect, literal, or unconnected meaning. The indirect reply
   condition primarily activated the bilateral fronto-temporal networks
   (Brodmann's Areas (BA) 47 and 21) and the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex
   (dmPFC). In the literal sentence condition, only the left
   fronto-temporal network (BA 45 and 21) and the dmPFC (posterior region)
   were activated. In addition, we found greater activation resulting from
   comprehension of an indirect reply than from literal sentence
   comprehension in the dmPFC, the left middle frontal area (BA 9), the
   bilateral inferior frontal area (BA 9/47), and the right middle temporal
   area (BA 21). Our findings indicate that the right and left
   fronto-temporal networks play a crucial role in detecting contextual
   violations, whereas the medial frontal cortex is important for
   generating inferences to make sense of remarks within a context. (C)

Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{3689-3698}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated
   effective connectivity in brain networks supporting imitation. Despite
   extensive reports of regional functional specialization underlying
   action perception, action execution and imitation, our understanding of
   the potential contribution of subcortical sites is limited, as is our
   knowledge of how regions displaying functional specialization interact
   with each other on a system level. While in the scanner, participants
   performed a simple imitation paradigm with three conditions: Observe
   trials, in which participants passively viewed a human actor executing a
   sequence of four finger presses on a keypad; Imitate trials, in which
   participants imitated the actor's finger presses on a keyboard; and
   Execute trials, in which participants also executed finger presses but
   did so based on visuospatial cues in the absence of the actor's hand.
   Relative to the Execute condition, Imitate trials evoked significantly
   more activity in superior and inferior parietal lobules (SPL, IPL),
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and in a ventral aspect of
   dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Psychophysiological interaction (PPI)
   analysis, a means of assessing effective connectivity, revealed
   significant interactions with regions of cerebellar lobule VII from
   seeds both in the right pSTS and right SPL, such that activity in these
   sites was more highly correlated during imitation. A similar interaction
   was found between right pSTS and left IPL These results clarify the role
   of cortical regions supporting action observation, action execution and
   imitation, and highlight the role the cerebellum may play in
   facilitating both motor and nonmotor aspects of imitation. (C) 2011

Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article presents the first attempt to formalize the optimization of
   experimental design with the aim of comparing models of brain function
   based on neuroimaging data. We demonstrate our approach in the context
   of Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM), which relates experimental
   manipulations to observed network dynamics (via hidden neuronal states)
   and provides an inference framework for selecting among candidate
   models. Here, we show how to optimize the sensitivity of model selection
   by choosing among experimental designs according to their respective
   model selection accuracy. Using Bayesian decision theory, we (i) derive
   the Laplace-Chernoff risk for model selection, (ii) disclose its
   relationship with classical design optimality criteria and (iii) assess
   its sensitivity to basic modelling assumptions. We then evaluate the
   approach when identifying brain networks using DCM. Monte-Carlo
   simulations and empirical analyses of fMRI data from a simple bimanual
   motor task in humans serve to demonstrate the relationship between
   network identification and the optimal experimental design. For example,
   we show that deciding whether there is a feedback connection requires
   shorter epoch durations, relative to asking whether there is
   experimentally induced change in a connection that is known to be
   present. Finally, we discuss limitations and potential extensions of
   this work.}},

   Additionally, a control task illustrated the specificity of these
   age-related changes for social exclusion as distinct from expectancy
   violation more generally. During exclusion, activation in and functional
   connectivity between ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral
   anterior cingulate cortex increased with age. These effects were
   specific to social exclusion and did not exist for expectancy violation.
   Our results illustrate developmental changes from middle childhood
   through adolescence in both affective and regulatory brain regions
   during social exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Sentence comprehension is a complex process. Besides identifying the
   meaning of each word and processing the syntactic structure of a
   sentence, it requires the computation of thematic information, that is,
   information about who did what to whom. The present fMRI study
   investigated the neural basis for thematic reanalysis (reanalysis of the
   thematic roles initially assigned to noun phrases in a sentence) and its
   interplay with syntactic reanalysis (reanalysis of the underlying
   syntactic structure originally constructed for a sentence). Thematic
   reanalysis recruited a network consisting of Broca's area, that is, the
   left pars triangularis (LPT), and the left posterior superior temporal
   gyrus, whereas only LPT showed greater sensitivity to syntactic
   reanalysis. These data provide direct evidence for a functional
   neuroanatomical basis for two linguistically motivated reanalysis
   processes during sentence comprehension. Hum Brain Mapp 32:1775-1787,

Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that the inference of others' intentions from
   their observed actions is supported by two neural systems that perform
   complementary roles. The human putative mirror neuron system (pMNS) is
   thought to support automatic motor simulations of observed actions, with
   increased activity for previously experienced actions, whereas the
   mentalizing system provides reflective, non-intuitive reasoning of
   others' perspectives, particularly in the absence of prior experience.
   In the current fMRI study, we show how motor familiarity with an action
   and perceptual familiarity with the race of an actor uniquely modulate
   these two systems. Chinese participants were asked to infer the
   intentions of actors performing symbolic gestures, an important form of
   non-verbal communication that has been shown to activate both
   mentalizing and mirror neuron regions. Stimuli were manipulated along
   two dimensions: (1) actor's race (Caucasian vs. Chinese actors) and (2)
   participants' level of experience with the gestures (familiar or
   unfamiliar). We found that observing all gestures compared to observing
   still images was associated with increased activity in key regions of
   both the pMNS and mentalizing systems. In addition, observations of
   one's same race generated greater activity in the posterior pMNS-related
   regions and the insula than observations of a different race.
   Surprisingly, however, familiar gestures more strongly activated regions
   associated with mentalizing, while unfamiliar gestures more strongly
   activated the posterior region of the pMNS, a finding that is contrary
   to prior literature and demonstrates the powerful modulatory effects of
   both motor and perceptual familiarity on pMNS and mentalizing regions
   when asked to infer the intentions of intransitive gestures. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{Stress and alcohol context cues are each associated with alcohol-related
   behaviors, yet neural responses underlying these processes remain
   unclear. This study investigated the neural correlates of stress and
   alcohol context cue experiences and examined sex differences in these
   responses. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, brain responses
   were examined while 43 right-handed, socially drinking, healthy
   individuals (23 females) engaged in brief guided imagery of personalized
   stress, alcohol-cue, and neutral-relaxing scenarios. Stress and
   alcohol-cue exposure increased activity in the cortico-limbic-striatal
   circuit (P < 0.01, corrected), encompassing the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
   left anterior insula, striatum, and visuomotor regions (parietal and
   occipital lobe, and cerebellum). Activity in the left dorsal striatum
   increased during stress, while bilateral ventral striatum activity was
   evident during alcohol-cue exposure. Men displayed greater
   stress-related activations in the mPFC, rostral ACC, posterior insula,
   amygdala, and hippocampus than women, whereas women showed greater
   alcohol-cue-related activity in the superior and middle frontal gyrus
   (SFG/MFG) than men. Stress-induced anxiety was positively associated
   with activity in emotion-modulation regions, including the medial OFC,
   ventromedial PFC, left superior-mPFC, and rostral ACC in men, but in
   women with activation in the SFG/MFG, regions involved in cognitive
   processing. Alcohol craving was significantly associated with the
   striatum (encompassing dorsal, and ventral) in men, supporting its
   involvement in alcohol ``urge{''} in healthy men. These results indicate
   sex differences in neural processing of stress and alcohol-cue
   experiences and have implications for sex-specific vulnerabilities to
   stress-and alcohol-related psychiatric disorders. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Objective: While social phobia in adolescence predicts the illness in
   adulthood, no study has directly compared the neural responses in social
   phobia in adults and adolescents. The authors examined neural responses
   to facial expressions in adults and adolescents with social phobia to
   determine whether the neural correlates of adult social phobia during
   face processing also manifest in adolescent social phobia.
   Method: Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses were compared in
   39 medication-free participants with social phobia (25 adults and 14
   adolescents) and 39 healthy comparison subjects (23 adults and 16
   adolescents) matched on age, IQ, and gender. During fMRI scans,
   participants saw angry, fearful, and neutral expression stimuli while
   making a gender judgment.
   Results: Significant diagnosis-by-emotion interactions were observed
   within the amygdala and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, as has
   previously been hypothesized. In these regions, both the adolescent and
   adult social phobia patients showed significantly increased BOLD
   responses relative to their respective age-matched comparison subjects,
   and there was no evidence of age-related modulation of between-group
   differences. These enhanced responses occurred specifically when viewing
   angry (rostral anterior cingulate cortex) and fearful (amygdala and
   rostral anterior cingulate cortex) expressions but not when viewing
   neutral expressions. In addition, the severity of social phobia was
   significantly correlated with the enhanced rostral anterior cingulate
   cortex response in the adults.
   Conclusions: The neural correlates of adult social phobia during face
   processing also manifest in adolescents. Neural correlates that are
   observed in adult social phobia may represent the persistence of
   profiles established earlier in life rather than adaptive responses to
   such earlier perturbations or maturational changes. These
   cross-sectional observations might encourage longitudinal fMRI studies
   of adolescent social phobia.}},

   assigning values to stimuli under consideration, selecting an option by

   values and motor commands, little is known about the mechanisms through
   which stimulus values are compared, and the resulting decision is
   transmitted to motor systems. We investigated this process using human
   fMRI in a task where choices were indicated using the left or right
   hand. We found evidence consistent with the hypothesis that value
   signals are computed in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, they are
   passed to regions of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and intraparietal
   sulcus, implementing a comparison process, and the output of the
   comparator regions modulates activity in motor cortex to implement the

Abstract = {{Theoretical accounts suggest an increased and automatic neural
   processing of emotional, especially threat-related, facial expressions
   and emotional prosody. In line with this assumption, several functional
   imaging studies showed activation to threat-related faces and voices in
   subcortical and cortical brain areas during attentional distraction or
   unconscious stimulus processing. Furthermore, electrophysiological
   studies provided evidence for automatic early brain responses to
   emotional facial expressions and emotional prosody. However, there is
   increasing evidence that available cognitive resources modulate brain
   responses to emotional signals from faces and voices, even though
   conflicting findings may occur depending on contextual factors, specific
   emotions, sensory modality, and neuroscientific methods used. The
   current review summarizes these findings and suggests that further
   studies should combine information from different sensory modalities and
   neuroscientific methods such as functional neuroimaging and
   electrophysiology. Furthermore, it is concluded that the variable
   saliency and relevance of emotional social signals on the one hand and
   available cognitive resources on the other hand interact in a dynamic
   manner, making absolute boundaries of the automatic processing of
   emotional information from faces and voices unlikely.}},

   perception of emotional faces is specific to depression and anxiety
   disorders in a large community-based sample of out-patients.
   Method. An event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   paradigm was used including angry, fearful, sad, happy and neutral
   facial expressions. One hundred and eighty-two out-patients (59
   depressed, 57 anxiety and 66 co-morbid depression-anxiety) and 56
   healthy controls selected from the Netherlands Study of Depression and
   Anxiety (NESDA) were included in the present study. Whole-brain analyses
   were conducted. The temporal profile of amygdala activation was also
   investigated.
   Results. Facial expressions activated the amygdala and fusiform gyrus in
   depressed patients with or without anxiety and in healthy controls,
   relative to scrambled faces, but this was less evident in patients with
   anxiety disorders. The response shape of the amygdala did not differ
   between groups. Depressed patients showed dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (PFC) hyperactivation in response to happy faces compared to healthy
   controls.
   Conclusions. We suggest that stronger frontal activation to happy faces
   in depressed patients may reflect increased demands on effortful emotion
   regulation processes triggered by mood-incongruent stimuli. The lack of
   strong differences in neural activation to negative emotional faces,
   relative to healthy controls, may be characteristic of the
   mild-to-moderate severity of illness in this sample and may be
   indicative of a certain cognitive-emotional processing reserve.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Processing emotional facial expressions is of interest in
   eating disorders (EDs) as impairments in recognizing and understanding
   social cues might underlie the interpersonal difficulties experienced by
   these patients. Disgust and anger are of particular theoretical and
   clinical interest. The current study investigated the neural response to
   facial expressions of anger and disgust in bulimia nervosa (BN).
   Method. Participants were 12 medication-free women with BN in an acute
   episode (mean age 24 years), and 16 age-, gender-and IQ-matched healthy
   volunteers (HVs). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used
   to examine neural responses to angry and disgusted facial expressions.
   Results. Compared with HVs, patients with BN had a decreased neural
   response in the precuneus to facial expressions of both anger and
   disgust and a decreased neural response to angry facial expressions in
   the right amygdala.
   Conclusions. The neural response to emotional facial expressions in BN
   differs from that found in HVs. The precuneus response may be consistent
   with the application of mentalization theory to EDs, and the amygdala
   response with relevant ED theory. The findings are preliminary, but
   novel, and require replication in a larger sample.}},

Abstract = {{Phobic fear is accompanied by intense bodily responses modulated by the

   arousal is electrodermal activity. We evaluated the contributions of
   electrodermal activity to amygdala-parahippocampal regional cerebral
   blood flow (rCBF) during phobic memory encoding in subjects with spider
   or snake phobia. Recognition memory was increased for phobia-related
   slides and covaried with rCBF in the amygdala and the parahippocampal
   gyrus. The covariation between parahippocampal rCBF and recognition was
   related to electrodermal activity suggesting that parahippocampal memory
   processes were associated with sympathetic activity. Electrodermal
   activity further mediated the amygdala effect on parahippocampal
   activity. Memory encoding during phobic fear therefore seems contingent
   on amygdala's influence on arousal and parahippocampal activity.}},

   showed a positive correlation of the error rate with prefrontal

Abstract = {{Guilt is a central moral emotion due to its inherent link to norm
   violations, thereby affecting both individuals and society. Furthermore,
   the nature and specificity of guilt is still debated in psychology and
   philosophy, particularly with regard to the differential involvement of
   self-referential representations in guilt relative to shame. Here, using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy volunteers, we
   identified specific brain regions associated with guilt by comparison
   with the 2 most closely related emotions, shame and sadness. To induce
   high emotional intensity, we used an autobiographical memory paradigm
   where participants relived during fMRI scanning situations from their
   own past that were associated with strong feelings of guilt, shame, or
   sadness. Compared with the control emotions, guilt episodes specifically
   recruited a region of right orbitofrontal cortex, which was also highly
   correlated with individual propensity to experience guilt (Trait Guilt).
   Guilt-specific activity was also observed in the paracingulate
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, a critical ``Theory of Mind{''} region,
   which overlapped with brain areas of self-referential processing
   identified in an independent task. These results provide new insights on
   the unique nature of guilt as a ``self-conscious{''} moral emotion and
   the neural bases of antisocial disorders characterized by impaired guilt
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have shown that fusiform face area (FFA) activity increases with
   visual expertise. We present an fMRI study showing that faces from a
   social category made relevant by an experimental manipulation (members
   of an experimentally created in-group) preferentially recruited the FFA
   even when they were matched in exposure to face stimuli from a less
   significant social category (members of an experimentally created
   out-group). Faces were randomly assigned to groups and fully
   counterbalanced so that no perceptual cues allowed participants to
   visually distinguish category membership. The results revealed a pattern
   of in-group enhancement (not out-group disregard), such that the FFA was
   selectively engaged following the presentation of in-group compared with
   out-group or unaffiliated control faces even when the intergroup
   distinction was arbitrary, and exposure to in-group and out-group faces
   was equivalent and brief. In addition, individual differences in FFA
   activity for in-group versus out-group faces were correlated with
   recognition memory differences for in-group and out-group faces. The
   effects of group membership on the FFA were not affected by task
   instruction to respond to in-group or out-group members and were
   functionally dissociated from early visual processing in the primary
   visual cortex. This study provides evidence that the FFA is sensitive to
   top-down influences and may be involved in subordinate level (vs.
   superordinate level) encoding of stimuli in the absence of long-term
   exposure or explicit task instructions.}},

Abstract = {{In a social setting, seeing Sally look at a clock means something
   different to seeing her gaze longingly at a slice of chocolate cake. In
   both cases, her eyes and face might be turned rightward, but the
   information conveyed is markedly different, depending on the object of
   her gaze. Numerous studies have examined brain systems underlying the
   perception of gaze direction, but less is known about the neural basis
   of perceiving gaze shifts to specific objects. During fMRI, participants
   observed an actor look toward one of two objects, each occupying a
   distinct location. Video stimuli were sequenced to obtain repetition
   suppression (RS) for object identity, independent of spatial location.
   In a control condition, a spotlight highlighted one of the objects, but
   no actor was present. Observation of the human actor's gaze compared
   with the spotlight engaged frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices,
   consistent with a broad action observation network. RS for gazed object
   in the human condition was found in posterior intraparietal sulcus
   (pIPS). RS for highlighted object in the spotlight condition was found
   in middle occipital, inferior temporal, medial fusiform gyri, and
   superior parietal lobule. These results suggest that human pIPS is
   specifically sensitive to the type object that an observed actor looks
   at (tool vs. food), irrespective of the observed actor's gaze location
   (left vs. right). A general attention or lower-level object feature
   processing mechanism cannot account for the findings because a very
   different response pattern was seen in the spotlight control condition.
   Our results suggest that, in addition to spatial orienting, human pIPS
   has an important role in object-centered social orienting.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of the importance of social connection for survival, humans
   may have evolved a ``sociometer{''}-a mechanism that translates
   perceptions of rejection or acceptance into state self-esteem. Here, we
   explored the neural underpinnings of the sociometer by examining whether
   neural regions responsive to rejection or acceptance were associated
   with state self-esteem. Participants underwent fMRI while viewing
   feedback words ({''}interesting,{''} ``boring{''}) ostensibly chosen by
   another individual (confederate) to describe the participant's
   previously recorded interview. Participants rated their state
   self-esteem in response to each feedback word. Results demonstrated that
   greater activity in rejection-related neural regions (dorsal ACC,
   anterior insula) and mentalizing regions was associated with lower-state
   self-esteem. Additionally, participants whose self-esteem decreased from
   prescan to postscan versus those whose self-esteem did not showed
   greater medial prefrontal cortical activity, previously associated with
   self-referential processing, in response to negative feedback. Together,
   the results inform our understanding of the origin and nature of our
   feelings about ourselves.}},

Abstract = {{The previous task-based or resting perfusion studies in social anxiety
   disorder (SAD) patients have highlighted specific differences in brain
   response. Little is known about the changes in the local synchronization
   of spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOW) signals that occur in SAD during the resting
   state. We investigated altered neural activity in the resting state
   using a regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis on 20 SAD and 20 healthy
   controls (HC). Compared with HC, SAD patients exhibited decreased
   coherence (ReHo) in the bilateral angular gyrus and the left medial
   prefrontal cortex within the default mode network (DMN), suggesting
   functional impairment of the perception of socially relevant emotional
   state and self-related mental representations; and also in the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right inferior parietal gyrus within
   the central-executive network (CEN), reflecting the deficit of cognitive
   control of social anxiety. Significantly increased coherence (ReHo) was
   found in the left middle occipital gyrus, which would be consistent with
   their hypervigilance and hyperprosexia to the social communication even
   in the resting state. Our results might supply a novel way to look into
   neuro-pathophysiological mechanisms in SAD patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) patients have been found to have problems in
   social cognition, including the process of thinking about other people's
   thoughts and feelings, often referred to as Theory of Mind (ToM). We
   examined neural correlates relating to thinking about social
   relationships in 17 women in recovery from anorexia (RAN) and 17 healthy
   women (CON) using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task.
   The task consisted of short videos of moving shapes that subjects viewed
   either in the context of performing a sodal decision related to how the
   shapes interacted: ``People: All friends?{''} or in the context of
   performing a visuospatial task related to how the shapes moved after
   bumping into each other: ``Bumper cars: Same weight?{''}. The RAN
   participants showed reduced activation in the social cognition network,
   with the most robust differences in the right temporoparietal junction
   (RTPJ). There were no significant differences between the CON and RAN
   groups in regions more active during the visuospatial task. These neural
   correlates show differences in the processing of social knowledge in RAN
   subjects suggesting that biological impairments in social cognition may
   contribute to pathology in AN. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Functional lateralization of episodic memory processes in the frontal
   lobe is an area of intense study in the field of cognitive neuroimaging.
   Yet, to date there is insufficient knowledge of what role the
   interhemispheric structural connectivity plays in this lateralized
   organization. We analyzed functional and structural magnetic resonance
   imaging data from healthy adult volunteers who performed an associative
   encoding and retrieval task. We examined the relationship between
   functional voxel-based relative asymmetry of encoding and retrieval in
   the frontal lobes and the size of the anterior corpus callosum (antCC;
   corrected for brain size). The size of the antCC was strongly associated
   to the relative encoding-retrieval asymmetry in the ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex (BA 47). These findings show that the functional
   asymmetry of episodic memory processes in the frontal lobes is
   associated with the structural connectivity between the hemispheres. (C)

Abstract = {{Even a single night of total sleep deprivation(SD) can have dramatic
   effects on economic decision making. Here we tested the novel hypothesis
   that SD influences economic decisions by altering the valuation process.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging we identified value signals
   related to the anticipation and the experience of monetary and social
   rewards (attractive female faces) .We then derived decision value
   signals that were predictive of each participant's Willingness to
   exchange money for brief views of attractive faces in an independent
   market task. Strikingly, SD altered decision value signals
   inventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in proportion to the
   corresponding change in economic references. These changes in preference
   were independen to the effects of SD on attention and vigilance. Our
   results provide novel evidence that signals in VMPFC track the current
   state of the individual, and thus reflect not static but constructed

Number = {{42}},
Pages = {{15154-15162}},

Abstract = {{Temporal correlations between different brain regions in the
   resting-state BOLD signal are thought to reflect intrinsic functional
   brain connectivity (Biswal et al., 1995; Greicius et al., 2003; Fox et
   al., 2007). The functional networks identified are typically bilaterally
   distributed across the cerebral hemispheres, show similarity to known
   white matter connections (Greicius et al., 2009), and are seen even in
   anesthetized monkeys (Vincent et al., 2007). Yet it remains unclear how
   they arise. Here we tested two distinct possibilities: (1) functional
   networks arise largely from structural connectivity constraints, and
   generally require direct interactions between functionally coupled
   regions mediated by white-matter tracts; and (2) functional networks
   emerge flexibly with the development of normal cognition and behavior
   and can be realized in multiple structural architectures. We conducted
   resting-state fMRI in eight adult humans with complete agenesis of the
   corpus callosum (AgCC) and normal intelligence, and compared their data
   to those from eight healthy matched controls. We performed three main
   analyses: anatomical region-of-interest-based correlations to test
   homotopic functional connectivity, independent component analysis (ICA)
   to reveal functional networks with a data-driven approach, and ICA-based
   interhemispheric correlation analysis. Both groups showed equivalently
   strong homotopic BOLD correlation. Surprisingly, almost all of the
   group-level independent components identified in controls were observed
   in AgCC and were predominantly bilaterally symmetric. The results argue
   that a normal complement of resting-state networks and intact functional
   coupling between the hemispheres can emerge in the absence of the corpus
   callosum, favoring the second over the first possibility listed above.}},

Abstract = {{Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is recruited during visual
   working memory (WM) when relevant information must be maintained in the
   presence of distracting information. The mechanism by which DLPFC might
   ensure successful maintenance of the contents of WMis, however, unclear;
   it might enhance neural maintenance of memory targets or suppress
   processing of distracters. To adjudicate between these possibilities, we
   applied time-locked transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during
   functional MRI, an approach that permits causal assessment of a
   stimulated brain region's influence on connected brain regions, and
   evaluated how this influence may change under different task conditions.
   Participants performed a visual WM task requiring retention of visual
   stimuli (faces or houses) across a delay during which visual distracters
   could be present or absent. When distracters were present, they were
   always from the opposite stimulus category, so that targets and
   distracters were represented in distinct posterior cortical areas. We
   then measured whether DLPFC-TMS, administered in the delay at the time
   point when distracters could appear, would modulate posterior regions
   representing memory targets or distracters. We found that DLPFC-TMS
   influenced posterior areas only when distracters were present and,
   critically, that this influence consisted of increased activity in
   regions representing the current memory targets. DLPFC-TMS did not
   affect regions representing current distracters. These results provide a
   new line of causal evidence for a top-down DLPFC-based control mechanism
   that promotes successful maintenance of relevant information in WM in
   the presence of distraction.}},

Abstract = {{Working memory (WM) functioning declines in old age. Due to its impact
   on many higher-order cognitive functions, investigating whether training
   can modify WM performance has recently been of great interest. We
   examined the relationship between behavioral performance and neural
   activity following five weeks of intensive WM training in 23 healthy
   older adults (M = 63.7 years). 12 participants received adaptive
   training (i.e. individually adjusted task difficulty to bring
   individuals to their performance maximum), whereas the others served as
   active controls (i.e. fixed low-level practice). Brain activity was
   measured before and after training, using fMRI, while subjects performed
   a WM task under two difficulty conditions. Although there were no
   training-related changes in WM during scanning, neocortical brain
   activity decreased post training and these decreases were larger in the
   adaptive training group than in the controls under high WM load. This
   pattern suggests intervention-related increases in neural efficiency.
   Further, there were disproportionate gains in the adaptive training
   group in trained as well as in non-trained (i.e. attention, episodic
   memory) tasks assessed outside the scanner, indicating the efficacy of
   the training regimen. Critically, the degree of training-related changes
   in brain activity (i.e. neocortical decreases and subcortical increases)
   was related to the maximum gain score achieved during the intervention
   period. This relationship suggests that the decreased activity, but also
   specific activity increases, observed were functionally relevant. (C)

   Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study of Preschool Children and Adults}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Previous morphological studies indicated that development of the human
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) appears to continue into late adolescence.
   Although functional brain imaging studies have sought to determine the
   time course of functional development of the PFC, it is unclear whether
   the developmental change occurs after adolescence to adulthood and when
   it achieves a peak because of the narrow or discontinuous range in the
   participant's age. Moreover, previous functional studies have not
   focused on the anterior frontal region, that is, the frontopolar regions
   (BA9/10). Thus, the present study investigated the developmental change
   in frontopolar PFC activation associated with letter fluency task by
   using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), in subjects from preschool
   children to adults. We analyzed the relative concentration of hemoglobin
   (Delta Hb) in the prefrontal cortex measured during the activation task
   in 48 typically-developing children and adolescents and 22 healthy
   adults. Consistent with prior morphological studies, we found
   developmental change with age in the children/adolescents. Moreover, the
   average Delta oxy-Hb in adult males was significantly larger than that
   in child/adolescent males, but was not true for females. These data
   suggested that functional development of the PFC continues into late
   adolescence. Although the developmental change of the frontopolar PFC
   was independent of gender from childhood to adolescence, in adulthood a
   gender difference was shown.}},

Title = {{Predicting Decisions in Human Social Interactions Using Real-Time fMRI
   and Pattern Classification}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Negotiation and trade typically require a mutual interaction while
   simultaneously resting in uncertainty which decision the partner
   ultimately will make at the end of the process. Assessing already during
   the negotiation in which direction one's counterpart tends would provide
   a tremendous advantage. Recently, neuroimaging techniques combined with
   multivariate pattern classification of the acquired data have made it
   possible to discriminate subjective states of mind on the basis of their
   neuronal activation signature. However, to enable an online-assessment
   of the participant's mind state both approaches need to be extended to a
   real-time technique. By combining real-time functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and online pattern classification techniques,
   we show that it is possible to predict human behavior during social
   interaction before the interacting partner communicates a specific
   decision. Average accuracy reached approximately 70\% when we predicted
   online the decisions of volunteers playing the ultimatum game, a
   well-known paradigm in economic game theory. Our results demonstrate the
   successful online analysis of complex emotional and cognitive states
   using real-time fMRI, which will enable a major breakthrough for social
   fMRI by providing information about mental states of partners already
   during the mutual interaction. Interestingly, an additional whole brain
   classification across subjects confirmed the online results: anterior
   insula, ventral striatum, and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, known to act
   in emotional self-regulation and reward processing for adjustment of
   behavior, appeared to be strong determinants of later overt behavior in
   the ultimatum game. Using whole brain classification we were also able
   to discriminate between brain processes related to subjective emotional
   and motivational states and brain processes related to the evaluation of
   objective financial incentives.}},

Title = {{A Computational Model of the Development of Separate Representations of
   Facial Identity and Expression in the Primate Visual System}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Experimental studies have provided evidence that the visual processing
   areas of the primate brain represent facial identity and facial
   expression within different subpopulations of neurons. For example, in
   non-human primates there is evidence that cells within the inferior
   temporal gyrus (TE) respond primarily to facial identity, while cells
   within the superior temporal sulcus (STS) respond to facial expression.
   More recently, it has been found that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of
   non-human primates contains some cells that respond exclusively to
   changes in facial identity, while other cells respond exclusively to
   facial expression. How might the primate visual system develop
   physically separate representations of facial identity and expression
   given that the visual system is always exposed to simultaneous
   combinations of facial identity and expression during learning? In this
   paper, a biologically plausible neural network model, VisNet, of the
   ventral visual pathway is trained on a set of carefully-designed cartoon
   faces with different identities and expressions. The VisNet model
   architecture is composed of a hierarchical series of four
   Self-Organising Maps (SOMs), with associative learning in the
   feedforward synaptic connections between successive layers. During
   learning, the network develops separate clusters of cells that respond
   exclusively to either facial identity or facial expression. We interpret
   the performance of the network in terms of the learning properties of
   SOMs, which are able to exploit the statistical indendependence between
   facial identity and expression.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforcements and punishments facilitate adaptive behavior in diverse

   the basal ganglia and its dopaminergic projections. Here, we show that

   gray matter of nearly every subdivision of the human brain. Humans
   played either matching-pennies or rock-paper-scissors games against
   computerized opponents while being scanned using fMRI. Multivoxel
   pattern analysis was used to decode previous choices and their outcomes,
   and to predict upcoming choices. Whereas choices were decodable from a
   confined set of brain structures, their outcomes were decodable from
   nearly all cortical and subcortical structures. In addition, signals
   related to both reinforcements and punishments were recovered reliably
   in many areas and displayed patterns not consistent with salience-based
   explanations. Thus, reinforcement and punishment might play global
   modulatory roles in the entire brain.}},

   schizophrenia: study protocol of a multi-center RCT}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Insight is impaired in a majority of people with
   schizophrenia. Impaired insight is associated with poorer outcomes of
   the disorder. Based on existing literature, we developed a model that
   explains which processes may possibly play a role in impaired insight.
   This model was the starting point of the development of REFLEX: a brief
   psychosocial intervention to improve insight in schizophrenia. REFLEX is
   a 12-sessions group training, consisting of three modules of four
   sessions each. Modules in this intervention are: ``coping with
   stigma{''}, ``you and your personal narrative{''}, and ``you in the
   present{''}.
   Methods/Design: REFLEX is currently evaluated in a multicenter
   randomized controlled trial. Eight mental health institutions in the
   Netherlands participate in this evaluation. Patients are randomly
   assigned to either REFLEX or an active control condition, existing of
   cognitive remediation exercises in a group. In a subgroup of patients,
   fMRI scans are made before and after training in order to assess
   potential haemodynamic changes associated with the effects of the
   training.
   Discussion: REFLEX is one of the few interventions aiming specifically
   to improving insight in schizophrenia and has potential value for
   improving insight. Targeting insight in schizophrenia is a complex task,
   that comes with several methodological issues. These issues are
   addressed in the discussion of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Impaired social cognition is a cardinal feature of Autism
   Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Schizophrenia (SZ). However, the functional
   neuroanatomy of social cognition in either disorder remains unclear due
   to variability in primary literature. Additionally, it is not known
   whether deficits in ASD and SZ arise from similar or disease-specific
   disruption of the social cognition network.
   Objective: To identify regions most robustly implicated in social
   cognition processing in SZ and ASD.
   Data Sources: Systematic review of English language articles using
   MEDLINE (1995-2010) and reference lists.
   Study Selection: Studies were required to use fMRI to compare ASD or SZ
   subjects to a matched healthy control group, provide coordinates in
   standard stereotactic space, and employ standardized facial emotion
   recognition (FER) or theory of mind (TOM) paradigms.
   Data Extraction: Activation foci from studies meeting inclusion criteria
   (n = 33) were subjected to a quantitative voxel-based meta-analysis
   using activation likelihood estimation, and encompassed 146 subjects
   with ASD, 336 SZ patients and 492 healthy controls.
   Results: Both SZ and ASD showed medial prefrontal hypoactivation, which
   was more pronounced in ASD, while ventrolateral prefrontal dysfunction
   was associated mostly with SZ. Amygdala hypoactivation was observed in
   SZ patients during FER and in ASD during more complex ToM tasks. Both
   disorders were associated with hypoactivation within the Superior
   Temporal Sulcus (STS) during ToM tasks, but activation in these regions
   was increased in ASD during affect processing. Disease-specific
   differences were noted in somatosensory engagement, which was increased
   in SZ and decreased in ASD. Reduced thalamic activation was uniquely
   seen in SZ.
   Conclusions: Reduced frontolimbic and STS engagement emerged as a shared
   feature of social cognition deficits in SZ and ASD. However, there were
   disease-and stimulus-specific differences. These findings may aid future
   studies on SZ and ASD and facilitate the formulation of new hypotheses
   regarding their pathophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{The perception of facial affect engages a distributed cortical network.
   We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal
   modeling to characterize effective connectivity during explicit
   (conscious) categorization of affective stimuli in the human brain.
   Specifically, we examined the modulation of connectivity from posterior
   regions of the face-processing network to the lateral ventral prefrontal
   cortex (VPFC) during affective categorization and we tested for a
   potential role of the amygdala (AMG) in mediating this modulation. We
   found that explicit processing of facial affect led to prominent
   modulation (increase) in the effective connectivity from the inferior
   occipital gyrus (IOG) to the VPFC, while there was less evidence for
   modulation of the afferent connections from fusiform gyrus and AMG to
   VPFC. More specifically, the forward connection from IOG to the VPFC
   exhibited a selective increase under anger (as opposed to fear or
   sadness). Furthermore, Bayesian model comparison suggested that the
   modulation of afferent connections to the VPFC was mediated directly by
   facial affect, as opposed to an indirect modulation mediated by the AMG.
   Our results thus suggest that affective information is conveyed to the
   VPFC along multiple parallel pathways and that AMG activity is not
   sufficient to account for the gating of information transfer to the VPFC
   during explicit emotional processing.}},

Abstract = {{We used positron emission tomography to identify brain regions involved
   in the processing of emotions induced by social reputation from others.
   During positron emission tomographic scanning, individuals were
   presented with either a positive or a negative social reputation
   combined with face photographs of persons whom the individuals either
   liked or disliked. Behavioral results revealed that a positive
   reputation led to a higher pleasantness score than a negative
   reputation. Imaging data demonstrated that the orbitofrontal cortex was
   activated with positive reputations relative to negative reputations,
   and that the amygdala was activated with negative reputations relative
   to positive reputations. These findings suggest that pleasant and
   unpleasant emotions induced by positive and negative social reputations
   from others are associated with activity in different brain regions.

Abstract = {{The communicative theory of emotions postulates that emotions are
   communications both within the brain and between individuals. Basic
   emotions owe their evolutionary origins to social mammals, and they
   enable human beings to use repertoires of mental resources appropriate
   to recurring and distinctive kinds of events. These emotions also enable
   them to cooperate with other individuals, to compete with them, and to
   disengage from them. The human system of emotions has also grafted onto
   basic emotions propositional contents about the cause of the emotion,
   the self, and other matters. Complex emotions always contain such
   contents, whereas basic emotions can be experienced without them. This
   article explains the role of basic emotions in social relationships,
   their effects on reasoning, and their pathology in psychological
   illness, such as depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE) is a phenomenon in which
   a reader's response to a sentence is made faster when there is congruity

   action-related sentences in several languages. However, all these were
   SVO (verb-object) languages, in which verbs are placed before object
   nouns; this order is reversed in SOV languages. Moreover, those studies
   investigated hand responses. This study assessed the existence of the
   ACE in Japanese, an SOV language, and in foot responses. 24 female
   participants judged the sensibility of Japanese sentences that described
   actions and responded with either their foot or hand as an effector.
   Reaction times were significantly faster when there was congruity
   between the effector described in the sentences and the effector
   actually used for the response. However, sentence dependency was also
   found in the foot responses.}},

Abstract = {{Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been characterized by excessive
   default-network activation and connectivity with the subgenual
   cingulate. These hyper-connectivities are often interpreted as
   reflecting rumination, where MDDs perseverate on negative,
   self-referential thoughts. However, the relationship between
   connectivity and rumination has not been established. Furthermore,
   previous research has not examined how connectivity with the subgenual
   cingulate differs when individuals are engaged in a task or not. The
   purpose of the present study was to examine connectivity of the default
   network specifically in the subgenual cingulate both on- and off-task,
   and to examine the relationship between connectivity and rumination.
   Analyses using a seed-based connectivity approach revealed that MDDs
   show more neural functional connectivity between the posterior-cingulate
   cortex and the subgenual-cingulate cortex than healthy individuals
   during rest periods, but not during task engagement. Importantly, these
   rest-period connectivities correlated with behavioral measures of
   rumination and brooding, but not reflection.}},

Abstract = {{Coping with stressful life events requires a degree of skill in the
   ability to attend to, comprehend, label, communicate and regulate
   emotions. Individuals vary in the extent to which these skills are
   developed, with the term `alexithymia' often applied in the clinical and
   personality literature to those individuals most compromised in these
   skills. Although a frontal lobe model of alexithymia is emerging, it is
   unclear whether such a model satisfactorily reflects brain-related
   patterns associated with perceived emotional intelligence at the facet
   level. To determine whether these trait meta-mood facets (ability to
   attend to, have clarity of and repair emotions) have unique gray matter
   volume correlates, a voxel-based morphometry study was conducted in 30
   healthy adults using the Trait Meta Mood Scale while co-varying for
   potentially confounding sociodemographic variables. Poorer Attention to
   Emotion was associated with lower gray matter volume in clusters
   distributed primarily throughout the frontal lobe, with peak correlation
   in the left medial frontal gyrus. Poorer Mood Repair was related to
   lower gray matter volume in three clusters in frontal and inferior
   parietal areas, with peak correlation in the left anterior cingulate. No
   significant volumetric correlations emerged for the Clarity of Emotion
   facet. We discuss the localization of these areas in the context of
   cortical circuits known to be involved in processes of self-reflection
   and cognitive control.}},

Abstract = {{Prior studies have demonstrated that the posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (pSTS) is involved in analyzing the intentions underlying actions
   and is sensitive to the context within which actions occur. However, it
   is debated whether the pSTS is actually sensitive to goals underlying
   actions, or whether previous studies can be interpreted to suggest that
   the pSTS is instead involved in the allocation of visual attention
   towards unexpected events. In addition, little is known about whether
   the pSTS is specialized for reasoning about the actions of social agents
   or whether the pSTS is sensitive to the actions of both animate and
   inanimate entities. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   we investigated activation in response to passive viewing of successful
   and unsuccessful animate and inanimate goal-directed actions. Activation
   in the right pSTS was stronger in response to failed actions compared to
   successful actions, suggesting that the pSTS plays a role in encoding
   the goals underlying actions. Activation in the pSTS did not
   differentiate between animate and inanimate actions, suggesting that the
   pSTS is sensitive to the goal-directed actions of both animate and
   inanimate entities.}},

Abstract = {{The premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle is associated with marked
   changes in normal and abnormal motivated behaviors. Animal studies
   suggest that such effects may result from actions of gonadal hormones on
   the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. We therefore investigated
   premenstrual changes in reward-related neural activity in terminal
   regions of the DA system in humans. Twenty-eight healthy young women
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging on 2 days during the
   menstrual cycle, once during the late follicular phase and once during
   the premenstrual phase, in counterbalanced order. Using a modified
   version of the monetary incentive delay task, we assessed responsiveness
   of the ventral striatum to reward anticipation. Our results show
   enhanced ventral striatal responses during the premenstrual as compared
   to the follicular phase. Moreover, this effect was most pronounced in
   women reporting more premenstrual symptoms. These findings provide
   support for the notion that changes in functioning of mesolimbic
   incentive processing circuits may underlie premenstrual changes in
   motivated behaviors. Notably, increases in reward-cue responsiveness
   have previously been associated with DA withdrawal states. Our findings
   therefore suggest that the sharp decline of gonadal hormone levels in
   the premenstrual phase may trigger a similar withdrawal-like state.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Previous theories have proposed that the amygdala is hyper-responsive to
   novel stimuli in persons with an inhibited temperament-a biologically
   based predisposition to respond to novelty with wariness or avoidance
   behavior. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to assess amygdala blood oxygenation level-dependent
   (BOLD) response when viewing novel or recently familiarized faces in
   persons with an extreme inhibited or uninhibited temperament. In persons
   with an inhibited temperament, the amygdala showed increased BOLD
   response when viewing both novel and recently familiarized faces. In
   contrast, in persons with an uninhibited temperament, BOLD response in
   the amygdala was increased only when viewing novel faces. These findings
   suggest that inhibited temperament is characterized not by a simple
   exaggerated response to novel faces, but rather by a sustained increase
   in amygdala response to faces even after the faces have become
   familiarized. In individuals with an inhibited temperament, this
   sustained response may be related to the wariness of social situations
   that persists beyond initial exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial attention has been argued to be adaptive by enhancing the
   processing of visual stimuli within the `spotlight of attention'. We
   previously reported that crude threat cues (backward masked fearful
   faces) facilitate spatial attention through a network of brain regions
   consisting of the amygdala, anterior cingulate and contralateral visual
   cortex. However, results from previous functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) dot-probe studies have been inconclusive regarding a
   fearful face-elicited contralateral modulation of visual targets. Here,
   we tested the hypothesis that the capture of spatial attention by crude
   threat cues would facilitate processing of subsequently presented visual
   stimuli within the masked fearful face-elicited `spotlight of attention'
   in the contralateral visual cortex. Participants performed a backward
   masked fearful face dot-probe task while brain activity was measured
   with fMRI. Masked fearful face left visual field trials enhanced
   activity for spatially congruent targets in the right superior occipital
   gyrus, fusiform gyrus and lateral occipital complex, while masked
   fearful face right visual field trials enhanced activity in the left
   middle occipital gyrus. These data indicate that crude threat elicited
   spatial attention enhances the processing of subsequent visual stimuli
   in contralateral occipital cortex, which may occur by lowering neural
   activation thresholds in this retinotopic location.}},

Abstract = {{Self-referential evaluation of emotional stimuli has been shown to
   modify the way emotional stimuli are processed. This study aimed at a
   new approach by investigating whether self-reference alters emotion
   processing in the absence of explicit self-referential appraisal
   instructions. Event-related potentials were measured while subjects
   spontaneously viewed a series of emotional and neutral nouns. Nouns were
   preceded either by personal pronouns ('my') indicating self-reference or
   a definite article ('the') without self-reference. The early posterior
   negativity, a brain potential reflecting rapid attention capture by
   emotional stimuli was enhanced for unpleasant and pleasant nouns
   relative to neutral nouns irrespective of whether nouns were preceded by
   personal pronouns or articles. Later brain potentials such as the late
   positive potential were enhanced for unpleasant nouns only when preceded
   by personal pronouns. Unpleasant nouns were better remembered than
   pleasant or neutral nouns when paired with a personal pronoun.
   Correlation analysis showed that this bias in favor of self-related
   unpleasant concepts can be explained by participants' depression scores.
   Our results demonstrate that self-reference acts as a first processing
   filter for emotional material to receive higher order processing after
   an initial rapid attention capture by emotional content has been
   completed. Mood-congruent processing may contribute to this effect.}},

Abstract = {{Moral Foundation Theory states that groups of different observers may
   rely on partially dissimilar sets of moral foundations, thereby reaching
   different moral valuations. The use of functional imaging techniques has
   revealed a spectrum of cognitive styles with respect to the differential
   handling of novel or corroborating information that is correlated to
   political affiliation. Here we characterize the collective behavior of
   an agent-based model whose inter individual interactions due to
   information exchange in the form of opinions are in qualitative
   agreement with experimental neuroscience data. The main conclusion
   derived connects the existence of diversity in the cognitive strategies
   and statistics of the sets of moral foundations and suggests that this
   connection arises from interactions between agents. Thus a simple
   interacting agent model, whose interactions are in accord with empirical
   data on conformity and learning processes, presents statistical
   signatures consistent with moral judgment patterns of conservatives and
   liberals as obtained by survey studies of social psychology.}},

Abstract = {{Whether a single perceptual process or separate and possibly independent
   processes support facial identity and expression recognition is unclear.
   We used a morphed-face discrimination test to examine sensitivity to
   facial expression and identity information in patients with occipital or
   temporal lobe damage, and structural and functional MRI to correlate
   behavioral deficits with damage to the core regions of the
   face-processing network. We found selective impairments of identity
   perception in two patients with right inferotemporal lesions and two
   prosopagnosic patients with damage limited to the anterior temporal
   lobes. Of these four patients one exhibited damage to the right fusiform
   and occipital face areas, while the remaining three showed sparing of
   these regions. Thus impaired identity perception can occur with damage
   not only to the fusiform and occipital face areas, but also to other
   medial occipitotemporal structures that likely form part of a face
   recognition network. Impaired expression perception was seen in the
   fifth patient with damage affecting the face-related portion of the
   posterior superior temporal sulcus. This subject also had difficulty in
   discriminating identity when irrelevant variations in expression needed
   to be discounted. These neuropsychological and neuroimaging data provide
   evidence to complement models which address the separation of expression
   and identity perception within the face-processing network. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Left unilateral spatial neglect resulting from right brain damage is
   characterized by loss of awareness for stimuli in the contralesional
   side of space, despite intact visual pathways. We examined using fMRI
   whether patients with neglect are more likely to consciously detect in
   the neglected hemifield, emotionally negative complex scenes rather than
   visually similar neutral pictures and if so, what neural mechanisms
   mediate this effect. Photographs of emotional and neutral scenes taken
   from the LAPS were presented in a divided visual field paradigm. As
   expected, the detection rate for emotional stimuli presented in the
   neglected field was higher than for neutral ones. Successful detection
   of emotional scenes as opposed to neutral stimuli in the left visual
   field (LVF) produced activations in the parahippocampal and anterior
   cingulate areas in the right hemisphere. Detection of emotional stimuli
   presented in the intact right visual field (RVF) activated a distributed
   network of structures in the left hemisphere, including anterior and
   posterior cingulate cortex, insula, as well as visual striate and
   extrastriate areas. LVF-RVF contrasts for emotional stimuli revealed
   activations in right and left attention related prefrontal areas whereas
   RVF-LVF comparison showed activations in the posterior cingulate and
   extrastriate visual cortex in the left hemisphere. An additional
   analysis contrasting detected vs. undetected emotional LW stimuli showed
   involvement of left anterior cingulate, right frontal and extrastriate
   areas. We hypothesize that beneficial role of emotion in overcoming
   neglect is achieved by activation of frontal and limbic lobe networks,
   which provide a privileged access of emotional stimuli to attention by
   top-down modulation of processing in the higher-order extrastriate
   visual areas. Our results point to the importance of top-down regulatory
   role of the frontal attentional systems, which might enhance visual
   activations and lead to greater salience of emotional stimuli for
   perceptual awareness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the semantic memory literature the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is
   frequently discussed as one homogeneous region when in fact, anatomical
   studies indicate that it is likely that there are discrete subregions
   within this area. Indeed, the influential Hub Account of semantic memory
   has proposed that this region is a sensory-amodal, general-purpose
   semantic processing region. However review of the literature suggested
   two potential demarcations: sensory subdivisions and a social/nonsocial
   subdivision. To test this, participants were trained to associate social
   or non-social words with novel auditory, visual, or audiovisual stimuli.
   Later, study participants underwent an fMRI scan where they were
   presented with the sensory stimuli and the task was to recall the
   semantic associate. The results showed that there were sensory specific
   subdivisions within the ATL - that the perceptual encoding of auditory
   stimuli preferentially activated the superior ATL, visual stimuli the
   inferior ATL, and multisensory stimuli the polar AIL Moreover, our data
   showed that there is stimulus-specific sensitivity within the ATL - the
   superior and polar ATLs were more sensitive to the retrieval of social
   knowledge as compared to non-social knowledge. No An regions were more
   sensitive to the retrieval of non-social knowledge. These findings
   indicate that the retrieval of newly learned semantic associations
   activates the ATL. In addition, superior and polar aspects of the All
   are sensitive to social stimuli but relatively insensitive to non-social
   stimuli, a finding that is predicted by anatomical connectivity and
   single-unit studies in non-human primates. And lastly, the An contains
   sensory processing subdivisions that fall along superior (auditory),
   inferior (visual), polar (audiovisual) subdivisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {{Different hemodynamic response patterns in the prefrontal cortical

Journal = {{SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{132}},

Abstract = {{Background: Symptomatic and functional outcomes in schizophrenia are
   associated with the duration of untreated psychosis. However, no
   candidate biomarkers have been adopted in clinical settings.
   Multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which can easily and
   noninvasively measure hemodynamics over the prefrontal cortex, is a
   candidate instrument for clinical use.
   Aims: We intended to explore prefrontal dysfunction among individuals at
   different clinical stages, including ultra-high-risk (UHR),
   first-episode psychosis (FEP), and chronic schizophrenia (ChSZ),
   compared to healthy subjects.
   Method: Twenty-two UHR subjects, 27 patients with FEP, 38 patients with
   ChSZ, and 30 healthy subjects participated. We measured hemodynamic
   changes during a block-designed letter fluency task using multichannel
   NIRS instruments.
   Results: We found that the activations of the bilateral ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex, and the fronto-polar and anterior parts of the
   temporal cortical regions in the UHR group were lower than those of the
   controls, but similar to those of the FEP and ChSZ groups. However, the
   activations in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex regions
   decrease with advancing clinical stage.
   Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
   directly comparing differences in hemodynamic changes with respect to
   the 3 clinical stages of psychosis. Furthermore, this study also
   demonstrates different patterns of impairment according to the
   progression of clinical stages using NIRS instruments. NIRS measurements
   for UHR and FEP individuals may be candidate biomarkers for the early
   detection of the clinical stages of psychosis. Crown Copyright (C) 2011

   sensitive to the valence dimension, with larger responses to low-valence

Abstract = {{Prior work has identified a common left parietofrontal network for
   storage of tool-related information for various tasks. How these
   representations become established within this network on the basis of
   different modes of exposure is unclear. Here, healthy subjects engaged
   in physical practice (direct exposure) with familiar and unfamiliar
   tools. A separate group of subjects engaged in video-based observation
   (indirect exposure) of the same tools to understand how these learning
   strategies create representations. To assess neural mechanisms engaged
   for pantomime after different modes of exposure, a pantomime task was
   performed for both tools while recording neural activation with
   high-density EEG. Motor planning-related neural activation was evaluated
   using beta band (13-22 Hz) event-related desynchronization. Hemispheric
   dominance was assessed, and activation maps were generated to understand
   topography of activations. Comparison of conditions (effects of tool
   familiarity and tool exposure) was performed with standardized
   low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Novel tool pantomime
   following direct exposure resulted in greater activations of bilateral
   parietofrontal regions. Activations following indirect training varied
   by tool familiarity; pantomime of the familiar tool showed greater
   activations in left parietofrontal areas, whereas the novel tool showed
   greater activations at right temporoparieto-occipital areas. These
   findings have relevance to the mechanisms for understanding
   motor-related behaviors involved in new tools that we have little or no

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{453-463}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Much is understood about loss aversion (the tendency for losses to have
   greater hedonic impact than comparable gains), but open questions
   remain. First, there is debate about whether loss aversion is best
   understood as the byproduct of a single system within the brain that
   treats losses and gains asymmetrically or the interaction of separate
   deliberative and emotional systems. Second, some have questioned whether
   loss aversion alone is the best account for the endowment effect.
   Alternative accounts, based on the differential focus induced by buying
   versus selling, the order in which buyers and sellers consider positive
   and negative aspects of the good, the extent to which ownership induces
   liking, and the desire to avoid making a bad deal, have been proposed.
   Third, it is unclear whether losses are actually experienced more
   intensely than comparable gains, or whether people simply behave as if
   they were. Some have argued that loss aversion is nothing more than an
   affective forecasting error, while others have argued that there are
   many situations in which losses are actually more impactful than
   comparable gains. This review synthesizes the insights that behavioral
   researchers and neuroeconomists have contributed to each debate, and
   highlights potential avenues for future research. (C) 2010 Society for

Abstract = {{Introduction. The projection of vagina, uterine cervix, and nipple to
   the sensory cortex in humans has not been reported.
   Aims. The aim of this study was to map the sensory cortical fields of
   the clitoris, vagina, cervix, and nipple, toward an elucidation of the
   neural systems underlying sexual response.
   Methods. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we mapped
   sensory cortical responses to clitoral, vaginal, cervical, and nipple
   self-stimulation. For points of reference on the homunculus, we also
   mapped responses to the thumb and great toe (hallux) stimulation.
   Main Outcome Measures. The main outcome measures used for this study
   were the fMRI of brain regions activated by the various sensory stimuli.
   Results. Clitoral, vaginal, and cervical self-stimulation activated
   differentiable sensory cortical regions, all clustered in the medial
   cortex (medial paracentral lobule). Nipple self-stimulation activated
   the genital sensory cortex (as well as the thoracic) region of the
   homuncular map.
   Conclusion. The genital sensory cortex, identified in the classical
   Penfield homunculus based on electrical stimulation of the brain only in
   men, was confirmed for the first time in the literature by the present
   study in women applying clitoral, vaginal, and cervical
   self-stimulation, and observing their regional brain responses using
   fMRI. Vaginal, clitoral, and cervical regions of activation were
   differentiable, consistent with innervation by different afferent nerves
   and different behavioral correlates. Activation of the genital sensory
   cortex by nipple self-stimulation was unexpected, but suggests a
   neurological basis for women's reports of its erotogenic quality.

Abstract = {{Neuropsychological and functional neuroimaging studies have revealed
   early changes of cognition and brain function in individuals with the
   Huntington's disease (HD) gene mutation who are presymptomatic for the
   motor symptoms of the disease (preHD). However, little is known about
   whether changes of neural function progress over time. In this study, we
   used neuropsychological tests of attention, working memory and executive
   function, functional magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based analyses
   of high-resolution structural data to explore the temporal dynamics of
   potential cognitive, functional and structural biomarkers in far from
   onset preHD (n = 13, mean time to the estimated motor symptom onset =
   19.5 years) and healthy controls (n = 13) followed over a 2-year period.
   Behavioral measures were similar in preHD individuals and controls at
   baseline and remained normal 2 years later. At both time points, the
   left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was less active in preHD than in
   controls during working memory performance. The left dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex did not exhibit further loss of activity over time.
   Regions showing less gray matter volume in preHD at baseline did not
   show further volume loss over time. These data indicate that the
   activity in brain regions contributing to working memory processing
   differs consistently in HD expansion mutation carriers while cognitive
   performance remains normal. However, the present data do not support the
   notion of a progressive decline of left prefrontal cortex activity in
   far from onset preHD followed over a 2-year period. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Responses to stress vary greatly in young adolescents, and
   little is known about neural correlates of the stress response in youth.
   The purpose of this study was to examine whether variability in cortisol
   responsivity following a social stress test in young adolescents is
   associated with altered neural functional connectivity (FC) of the
   salience network (SN) measured during resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Methods: Forty-nine typically developing
   young adolescents participated in a social stress test during which they
   contributed salivary cortisol samples. Following this, they underwent
   rs-fMRI scanning. We examined the association of FC of the SN {[}
   composed of anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral anterior insula
   regions] with cortisol responsivity. Results: Greater cortisol
   responsivity was significantly positively correlated with higher FC
   between subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (Cg25) and the SN,
   controlling for participant age. There were no regions of the brain that
   showed an inverse relation. Conclusions: Brain systems that have been
   implicated in autonomic arousal and that influence subjective feeling

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{Human beings are social organisms with an intrinsic desire to seek and
   participate in social interactions. Social anhedonia is a personality
   trait characterized by a reduced desire for social affiliation and
   reduced pleasure derived from interpersonal interactions. Abnormally
   high levels of social anhedonia prospectively predict the development of
   schizophrenia and contribute to poorer outcomes for schizophrenia
   patients. Despite the strong association between social anhedonia and
   schizophrenia, the neural mechanisms that underlie individual
   differences in social anhedonia have not been studied and are thus
   poorly understood. Deficits in face emotion recognition are related to
   poorer social outcomes in schizophrenia, and it has been suggested that
   face emotion recognition deficits may be a behavioral marker for
   schizophrenia liability. In the current study, we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to see whether there are differences
   in the brain networks underlying basic face emotion processing in a
   community sample of individuals low vs. high in social anhedonia. We
   isolated the neural mechanisms related to face emotion processing by
   comparing face emotion discrimination with four other baseline
   conditions (identity discrimination of emotional faces, identity
   discrimination of neutral faces, object discrimination, and pattern
   discrimination). Results showed a group (high/low social anhedonia) x
   condition (emotion discrimination/control condition) interaction in the
   anterior portion of the rostral medial prefrontal cortex, right superior
   temporal gyms, and left somatosensory cortex. As predicted, high
   (relative to low) social anhedonia participants showed less neural
   activity in face emotion processing regions during emotion
   discrimination as compared to each control condition. The findings
   suggest that social anhedonia is associated with abnormalities in
   networks responsible for basic processes associated with social
   cognition, and provide a starting point for understanding the neural
   basis of social motivation and our drive to seek social affiliation. (C)

Abstract = {{Adolescents often fail to adaptively regulate their emotions and
   behaviors. This is most clearly demonstrated by the marked increase
   during this period in fatalities that are attributable to preventable
   causes. Using functional magnetic resonance methodology, this study
   explored whether adolescents and adults differed in their engagement of
   prefrontal circuitry in response to a cognitive and emotional challenge.
   Twenty-four adolescents and twenty-three adults were scanned while they
   solved difficult math problems with induced failure and negative social
   evaluation. Data is reported from 23 adolescents and 23 adults. Adult
   and adolescent participants showed similar increases in heart rate when
   responding to the experimental challenge. Despite the similarity of the
   autonomic response, adolescents recruited a more restricted network of
   prefrontal regions as compared to adults. Both adolescents and adults
   recruited the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, however adults additionally recruited the anterior
   insula. Functional connectivity between the anterior insula and other
   prefrontal regions was stronger in adults as compared to adolescents.
   Further, for adults, the magnitude of activity in the insula predicted
   lower autonomic activity in response to the challenge. Differences
   between adolescents and adults engagement of prefrontal networks may
   relate to adolescents' poor behavioral and emotional regulation. (C)

Abstract = {{It is clear that the steroid hormone testosterone plays an important
   role in the regulation of social emotional behavior, but it remains
   unknown which neural circuits mediate these hormonal influences in
   humans. We investigated the modulatory effects of endogenous
   testosterone on the control of social emotional behavior by applying
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while healthy male participants
   performed a social approach-avoidance task. This task operationalized
   social emotional behavior by having participants approach and avoid
   emotional faces by pulling and pushing a joystick, respectively.
   Affect-congruent trials mapped the automatic tendency to approach happy
   faces and avoid angry faces. Affect-incongruent trials required
   participants to override those automatic action tendencies and select
   the opposite response (approach-angry, avoid-happy). The social
   emotional control required by affect-incongruent responses resulted in
   longer reaction times (RTs) and increased activity at the border of the
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal pole (VLPFC/FP). We show
   that endogenous testosterone modulates these cerebral congruency effects
   through 2 mechanisms. First, participants with lower testosterone levels
   generate larger VLPFC/FP responses during affect-incongruent trials.
   Second, during the same trials, endogenous testosterone modulates the
   effective connectivity between the VLPFC/FP and the amygdala. These
   results indicate that endogenous testosterone influences local
   prefrontal activity and interregional connectivity supporting the
   control of social emotional behavior.}},

   network cortical plasticity, in humans in vivo, and characterize their
   changes across the age-span. Parallel, translational studies in animals
   can provide mechanistic insights. Here, we argue that, for each
   individual, the efficiency of neuronal plasticity declines throughout
   the age-span and may do so more or less prominently depending on
   variable `starting-points' and different `slopes of change' defined by
   genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Furthermore, aberrant,
   excessive, insufficient, or mistimed plasticity may represent the
   proximal pathogenic cause of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
   disorders such as autism spectrum disorders or Alzheimer's disease.}},

Abstract = {{In an fMRI study, 20 younger and 20 healthy older adults were scanned
   while performing a spatial working-memory task under two levels of load.
   On a separate occasion, the same subjects underwent PET measurements
   using the radioligand {[}C-11] SCH23390 to determine dopamine D-1
   receptor binding potential (BP) in caudate nucleus and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The fMRI study revealed a significant load
   modulation of brain activity (higher load > lower load) in frontal and
   parietal regions for younger, but not older, adults. The PET
   measurements showed marked age-related reductions of D-1 BP in caudate
   and DLPFC. Statistical control of caudate and DLPFC D-1 binding
   eliminated the age-related reduction in load-dependent BOLD signal in
   left frontal cortex, and attenuated greatly the reduction in right
   frontal and left parietal cortex. These findings suggest that
   age-related alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission may contribute
   to underrecruitment of task-relevant brain regions during working-memory
   performance in old age. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Responses to threat occur via two known independent processing routes.
   We propose that early, reflexive processing is predominantly tuned to
   the detection of congruent combinations of facial cues that signal
   threat, whereas later, reflective processing is predominantly tuned to
   incongruent combinations of threat. To test this prediction, we examined
   responses to threat-gaze expression pairs (anger versus fear expression
   by direct versus averted gaze). We report on two functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, one employing prolonged presentations
   (2 s) of threat-gaze pairs to allow for reflective processing (Study 1),
   and one employing severely restricted (33 ms), backward masked
   presentations of threat-gaze pairs to isolate reflexive neural
   responding (Study 2). Our findings offer initial support for the
   conclusion that early, reflexive responses to threat are predominantly
   tuned to congruent threat-gaze pairings, whereas later reflective
   responses are predominantly tuned to ambiguous threat-gaze pairings.
   These findings highlight a distinct dual function in threat perception.

Abstract = {{Normal language acquisition is a process that unfolds with amazing speed
   primarily in the first years of life. However, the refinement of
   linguistic proficiency is an ongoing process, extending well into
   childhood and adolescence. An increase in lateralization and a more
   focussed productive language network have been suggested to be the
   neural correlates of this process. However, the processes underlying the
   refinement of language comprehension are less clear. Using a language
   comprehension (Beep Stories) and a language production (Vowel
   Identification) task in fMRI, we studied language representation and
   lateralization in 36 children, adolescents, and young adults (age 6-24
   years). For the language comprehension network, we found a more focal
   activation with age in the bilateral superior temporal gyri. No
   significant increase of lateralization with age could be observed, so
   the neural basis of language comprehension as assessed with the Beep
   Stories task seems to be established in a bilateral network by late
   childhood. For the productive network, however, we could confirm an
   increase with age both in focus and lateralization. Only in the language
   comprehension task did verbal IQ correlate with lateralization, with
   higher verbal IQ being associated with more right-hemispheric
   involvement. In some subjects (24\%), language comprehension and
   language production were lateralized to opposite hemispheres. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Striking disturbances have been reported in language and emotional
   prosody processing by patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. In view of
   this and of research suggesting that schizotypal personality traits can
   also be expressed sub-clinically, the present study aimed to discover
   whether similar disturbances would be reflected in cognitive laterality
   patterns when symptoms of schizotypy are present yet at a non-clinical
   level. A dichotic listening task was used to examine the sensitivity and
   speed with which 132 right-handed participants (85 females and 47 males,
   mean age = 32.44, SD = 12.29) detected both words and emotional prosody,
   all of whom also completed the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire.
   Findings indicated that both high (n = 64) and low (n = 68) schizotypy
   groups demonstrated the typical right ear advantage for the detection of
   words and left ear advantage for the detection of emotional prosody.
   Individuals with higher schizotypal personality scores also demonstrated
   poorer sensitivity in detecting emotional prosody. These results reveal
   that within the healthy population, higher levels of schizotypy are not
   associated with the atypical lateralisation of language and emotion.
   Nevertheless, the existence of these symptoms does signal the presence
   of shared characteristics with the clinical sphere, namely poorer
   emotion recognition performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   revealed differential effects for achievement goals over time:
   Performance-approach goals showed higher correct remember responding on
   an immediate recognition test, whereas mastery-approach goals showed
   higher correct remember responding on a delayed recognition test.
   Achievement goals had no influence on overall recognition memory and no
   consistent influence on know responding across experiments. These

Abstract = {{DRD2/ANKK1 TaqI A polymorphism has been suggested to be involved in a
   reward-related psychiatric disorders. However, the effect of Dopamine
   receptor D2 (DRD2) on emotional processing has not been investigated
   yet. We investigated the possible relationship between DRD2/ANKK1 TaqI A
   polymorphism and corticostriatal response to negative facial stimuli
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging. All participants were
   genotyped with regard to the DRD2/ANKK1 TaqI A polymorphism. Our results
   suggest an association between the DRD2/ANKK1 TaqI A polymorphism and
   activations in the putamen, the anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala
   in response to negative facial stimuli. Furthermore, molecular heterosis
   at the TaqI polymorphism of DRD2/ANKK1 may play an important role in
   affective regulation by corticostriatal pathway. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A large network of spatially contiguous, yet anatomically distinct
   regions in medial frontal cortex is involved in reward processing.
   Although it is clear these regions play a role in critical aspects of
   reward-related learning and decision-making, the individual
   contributions of each component remains unclear. We explored
   dissociations in reward processing throughout several key regions in the
   reward system and aimed to clarify the nature of previously observed
   outcome-related activity in a portion of anterior medial orbitofrontal
   cortex (mOFC). Specifically, we tested whether activity in anterior mOFC
   was related to processing successful actions, such that this region
   would respond similarly to rewards with and without tangible benefits,
   or whether this region instead encoded only quantifiable outcome values
   (e. g., money). Participants performed a task where they encountered
   monetary gains and losses (and non-gains and non-losses) during fMRI
   scanning. Critically, in addition to the outcomes with monetary
   consequences, the task included trials that provided outcomes without
   tangible benefits (participants were simply told that they were correct
   or incorrect). We found that anterior mOFC responded to all successful
   outcomes regardless of whether they carried tangible benefits (monetary
   gains and non-losses) or not (controls). These results support the
   hypothesis that anterior mOFC processes rewards in terms of a common
   currency and is capable of providing reward-based signals for everything
   we value, whether it be primary or secondary rewards or simply a
   successful experience without objectively quantifiable benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Supramodal representation of emotion and its neural substrates have
   recently attracted attention as a marker of social cognition. However,
   the question whether perceptual integration of facial and vocal emotions
   takes place in primary sensory areas, multimodal cortices, or in
   affective structures remains unanswered yet. Using novel
   computer-generated stimuli, we combined emotional faces and voices in
   congruent and incongruent ways and assessed functional brain data (fMRI)
   during an emotional classification task. Both congruent and incongruent
   audiovisual stimuli evoked larger responses in thalamus and superior
   temporal regions compared with unimodal conditions. Congruent emotions
   were characterized by activation in amygdala, insula, ventral posterior
   cingulate (vPCC), temporo-occipital, and auditory cortices; incongruent
   emotions activated a frontoparietal network and bilateral caudate
   nucleus, indicating a greater processing load in working memory and
   emotion-encoding areas. The vPCC alone exhibited differential reactions
   to congruency and incongruency for all emotion categories and can thus
   be considered a central structure for supramodal representation of
   complex emotional information. Moreover, the left amygdala reflected
   supramodal representation of happy stimuli. These findings document that
   emotional information does not merge at the perceptual audiovisual
   integration level in unimodal or multimodal areas, but in vPCC and
   amygdala.}},

Abstract = {{We compared private and social decision making to investigate the neural
   underpinnings of the effect of social comparison on risky choices. We
   measured brain activity using functional MRI while participants chose
   between two lotteries: in the private condition, they observed the
   outcome of the unchosen lottery, and in the social condition, the
   outcome of the lottery chosen by another person. The striatum, a
   reward-related brain structure, showed higher activity when participants
   won more than their counterpart ( social gains) compared with winning in
   isolation and lower activity when they won less than their counterpart (
   social loss) compared with private loss. The medial prefrontal cortex,
   implicated in social reasoning, was more activated by social gains than
   all other events. Sensitivity to social gains influenced both brain
   activity and behavior during subsequent choices. Specifically, striatal
   activity associated with social gains predicted medial prefrontal cortex
   activity during social choices, and experienced social gains induced
   more risky and competitive behavior in later trials. These results show
   that interplay between reward and social reasoning networks mediates the
   influence of social comparison on the decision process.}},

Abstract = {{This is the final paper in a Comments and Controversies series dedicated

   These models have to be endowed with priors on unknown parameters and
   afford checks for model Identifiability. We consider the similarities
   and differences among Dynamic Causal Modeling, Granger Causal Modeling
   and other approaches. We establish links between past and current
   statistical causal modeling, in terms of Bayesian dependency graphs and
   Wiener-Akaike-Granger-Schweder influence measures. We show that some of
   the challenges faced in this field have promising solutions and

Abstract = {{This paper is about the fitting or inversion of dynamic causal models
   (DCMs) of fMRI time series. It tries to establish the validity of
   stochastic DCMs that accommodate random fluctuations in hidden neuronal
   and physiological states. We compare and contrast deterministic and
   stochastic DCMs, which do and do not ignore random fluctuations or noise
   on hidden states. We then compare stochastic DCMs, which do and do not
   ignore conditional dependence between hidden states and model parameters
   (generalised filtering and dynamic expectation maximisation,
   respectively). We first characterise state-noise by comparing the log
   evidence of models with different a priori assumptions about its
   amplitude, form and smoothness. Face validity of the inversion scheme is
   then established using data simulated with and without state-noise to
   ensure that DCM can identify the parameters and model that generated the
   data. Finally, we address construct validity using real data from an
   fMRI study of internet addiction. Our analyses suggest the following.
   (i) The inversion of stochastic causal models is feasible, given typical
   fMRI data. (ii) State-noise has nontrivial amplitude and smoothness.
   (iii) Stochastic DCM has face validity, in the sense that Bayesian model
   comparison can distinguish between data that have been generated with
   high and low levels of physiological noise and model inversion provides
   veridical estimates of effective connectivity. (iv) Relaxing conditional
   independence assumptions can have greater construct validity, in terms
   of revealing group differences not disclosed by variational schemes.
   Finally, we note that the ability to model endogenous or random
   fluctuations on hidden neuronal (and physiological) states provides a
   new and possibly more plausible perspective on how regionally specific
   signals in fMRI are generated. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing consensus in behavioral neuroscience that the brain
   makes simple choices by first assigning a value to the options under
   consideration and then comparing them. Two important open questions are
   whether the brain encodes absolute or relative value signals, and what
   role attention might play in these computations. We investigated these
   questions using a human fMRI experiment with a binary choice task in
   which the fixations to both stimuli were exogenously manipulated to
   control for the role of visual attention in the valuation computation.
   We found that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral
   striatum encoded fixation-dependent relative value signals: activity in
   these areas correlated with the difference in value between the attended
   and the unattended items. These attention-modulated relative value
   signals might serve as the input of a comparator system that is used to
   make a choice.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{The coupling process between observed and performed actions is thought
   to be performed by a fronto-parietal perception-action system including
   regions of the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule.
   When investigating the influence of the movements' characteristics on
   this process, most research on action observation has focused on only
   one particular variable even though the type of movements we observe can
   vary on several levels. By manipulating the visual perspective,
   transitivity and meaningfulness of observed movements in a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study we aimed at investigating how the type
   of movements and the visual perspective can modulate brain activity
   during action observation in healthy individuals. Importantly, we used
   an active observation task where participants had to subsequently
   execute or imagine the observed movements. Our results show that the
   fronto-parietal regions of the perception action system were mostly
   recruited during the observation of meaningless actions while visual
   perspective had little influence on the activity within the
   perception-action system. Simultaneous investigation of several sources
   of modulation during active action observation is probably an approach
   that could lead to a greater ecological comprehension of this important
   sensorimotor process.}},

Title = {{Differential magnitude coding of gains and omitted rewards in the
   ventral striatum}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{1411}},
Pages = {{76-86}},
Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{Physiologic studies revealed that neurons in the dopaminergic midbrain
   of non-human primates encode reward prediction errors. It was
   furthermore shown that reward prediction errors are adaptively scaled
   with respect to the range of possible outcomes, enabling sensitive
   encoding for a large range of reward values. Congruently, neuroimaging
   studies in humans demonstrated that BOLD-responses in the ventral
   striatum encode reward prediction errors in similar fashion as
   dopaminergic midbrain neurons, suggesting that these BOLD-responses may
   be driven by dopaminergic midbrain activity. However, neuroimaging
   results are ambiguous with respect to the adaptive scaling of reward
   prediction errors, leading to the conjecture that under certain
   circumstances other than dopaminergic midbrain input may drive ventral
   striatal BOLD-responses. The goal of this study was to substantiate
   whether BOLD-responses in the ventral striatum rather respond to
   adaptively scaled reward prediction errors or absolute reward magnitude.
   In addition, we aimed to identify neuronal structures modulating
   activity in the ventral striatum. Sixteen healthy participants played a
   wheel of fortune game, where they could win three differently valued
   rewards while being scanned. BOLD-responses increased after gaining
   rewards; this gain was however independent of the absolute reward
   magnitude. In contrast BOLD-responses upon reward omission decreased
   with reward magnitude. A psychophysiological interaction analysis
   identified a cluster in the brainstem in proximity of the dorsal raphe
   nucleus, a cluster in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and a cluster in
   the rostral cingulate zone. These clusters changed their connectivity
   with the ventral striatum in relation to the absolute reward magnitude
   in reward omission trials. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the contribution of agency to neural processing involved
   in aggression and morality, participants viewed in the MRI scanner a
   series of short visual scenarios in which an individual was either
   intentionally harming another person or easing the other's pain. They
   were required to mentally simulate being the perpetrator or the
   recipient of those actions. Functional connectivity analyses demonstrate
   that positive agency (easing the pain of another) was associated with
   increased activity in ventral striatum, while negative agency (harming
   the other) resulted in a strong signal decrease in the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and activation in the amygdala. Overall, our data show
   that explicit perspective taking strategy has profound impact on the
   neural recruitment associated with distinct behaviors as well as their
   moral consequences. Results from this study can inform new strategies
   both for therapeutic interventions for patients with socioemotional
   disorders and the education of medical practitioners. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this study, the first to explore the cortical correlates of signed
   language (SL) processing under point-light display conditions, the
   observer identified either a signer or a lexical sign from a display in
   which different signers were seen producing a number of different
   individual signs. many of the regions activated by point-light under
   these conditions replicated those previously reported for full-image
   displays, including regions within the inferior temporal cortex that are
   specialised for face and body-part identification, although such body
   parts were invisible in the display. Right frontal regions were also
   recruited - a pattern not usually seen in full-image SL processing. This
   activation may reflect the recruitment of information about person
   identity from the reduced display. A direct comparison of
   identify-signer and identify-sign conditions showed these tasks relied
   to a different extent on the posterior inferior regions. Signer
   identification elicited greater activation than sign identification in
   (bilateral) inferior temporal gyri (BA 37/19), fusiform gyri (BA 37),
   middle and posterior portions of the middle temporal gyri (BAs 37 and
   19), and superior temporal gyri (BA 22 and 42). Right inferior frontal
   cortex was a further focus of differential activation (signer > sign).
   These findings suggest that the neural systems supporting point-light
   displays for the processing of SL rely on a cortical network including
   areas of the inferior temporal cortex specialized for face and body
   identification. While this might be predicted from other studies of
   whole body point-light actions (Vaina, Solomon, Chowdhury, Sinha, \&
   Belliveau, 2001) it is not predicted from the perspective of spoken
   language processing, where voice characteristics and speech content
   recruit distinct cortical regions (Stevens, 2004) in addition to a
   common network. In this respect, our findings contrast with studies of
   voice/speech recognition (Von Kriegstein, Kleinschmidt, Sterzer, \&
   Giraud, 2005). Inferior temporal regions associated with the visual
   recognition of a person appear to be required during SL processing, for
   both carrier and content information. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published

Abstract = {{Objective: Individuals with alexithymia have a reduced ability to use
   their feelings to guide their behavior appropriately in social
   situations. To reveal the capacity to use emotional signals in
   alexithymia under conditions of uncertainty, this study investigates
   neural substrates and performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which
   was developed to assess decision making based on emotion-guided
   evaluation. Methods: The participants were 10 men with alexithymia and
   13 without. Alexithymia was assessed by the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia
   Scale. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured by
   {[}(15)O]-H(2)O positron emission tomography during four trials of the
   IGT and two visuomotor control tasks. Results: The participants with
   alexithymia failed to learn an advantageous decision-making strategy,
   with performance differing significantly from the nonalexithymic group
   in the fourth IGT trial (p = .029). Comparing performance between the
   IGT and the control tasks, both groups showed brain activation in the
   dorsolateral frontal area, inferior frontal lobe, pre-supplementary
   motor area, inferior parietal lobe, fusiform gyrus, and cerebellum. Men
   with alexithymia showed lower rCBF in the medial frontal area (Brodmann
   area {[}BA] 10) and higher rCBF in the caudate and occipital areas in
   the first and second IGT trials, which are within a learning phase
   according to test performance data. All brain data were significant at p
   <= .001, uncorrected. Conclusions: BA10 activity may be associated with
   using internal signals accompanying affective evaluation of the stimuli,
   which is crucial for successful decision making. Reduced BA10 activity
   in participants with alexithymia suggests that they may not use an
   emotion-based biasing signal to lead to advantageous decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Psychological stress causes dopamine release in the striatum and is
   thought to play a role in susceptibility to psychotic illness. Previous
   work suggests that an elevated dopaminergic response to stress may index
   vulnerability to psychosis in certain individuals. With functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, we measured stress-induced changes in brain
   activity in healthy individuals at elevated risk of developing
   psychosis. Participants were 15 controls and 25 psychometric
   schizotypes: 12 with positive symptom schizotypy (perceptual
   aberrations) and 13 with negative symptom schizotypy (physical
   anhedonia), as determined by questionnaires (Chapman et al., 1976;
   Chapman and Chapman, 1978). In the scanner, participants performed the
   Montreal Imaging Stress Task and a matched sensory-motor control task.
   Measures of self-reported stress and salivary cortisol levels were taken
   throughout the experiment.
   All three groups showed significant increases in self-reported stress
   and significant fMRI signal change in the striatal, limbic and cortical
   regions. However, the Physical Anhedonia group showed greater
   stress-induced striatal and limbic deactivation than the other two
   groups. Deactivation in the striatum was significantly correlated with
   Physical Anhedonia score across all subjects. Our findings suggest the
   presence of abnormalities in striatal response to stress in negative
   symptom schizotypy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have demonstrated that attentional shift triggered by gaze
   direction is reflexive. However, here we show that attentional shift by
   gaze direction was not always reflexive, but could be modulated by
   another's perspective. In Experiment 1, a schematic face's line of sight
   to a peripheral target was obstructed by a vertical barrier located
   between the face and the target under two conditions. However, the line
   of sight of the face was clear under another two conditions, in which
   the barrier was located behind the line of sight by utilizing a depth
   cue. The gaze cue shifted attention only when the line of sight was not
   blocked (i.e. joint attention was attained). The arrow cue did not shift
   attention regardless of the obstruction conditions in Experiment 2.
   These results suggest that attentional shift by gaze cues, but not arrow
   cues, involve a higher social cognitive process such as interpretation
   of the gaze.}},

Title = {{Neural Bases of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in Women: An
   Event-Related fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Although there is an abundant debate regarding the
   mechanisms sustaining one of the most common sexual complaints among
   women, i.e., female hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), little
   remains known about the specific neural bases of this disorder.
   Aim. The main goal of this study was to determine whether women with
   HSDD showed differential patterns of activation within the brain network
   that is active for sexual desire in subjects without HSDD.
   Methods. A total of 28 right-handed women participated in this study
   (mean age 31.1 +/- 7.02 years). Thirteen out of the 28 women had HSDD
   (HSDD participants), while 15 women reported no hypoactive sexual desire
   disorder (NHSDD participants). Using event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), we compared the regional cerebral blood flow
   responses between these two groups of participants, while they were
   looking at erotic vs. non-erotic stimuli.
   Main Outcome Measure. Blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal
   changes in response to erotic stimuli (compared with non-erotic
   stimuli). Statistical Parametric Mapping was used to identify brain
   regions that demonstrated significant differential activations between
   stimuli and between groups.
   Results. As expected, behavioral results showed that NHSDD participants
   rated erotic stimuli significantly higher than HSDD participants did on
   a 10-point desirable scale. No rating difference was observed for the
   non-erotic stimuli between NHSDD and HSDD participants. Our functional
   neuroimaging results extended these data by demonstrating two distinct
   types of neural changes in participants with and without HSDD. In
   comparison with HSDD participants, participants without HSDD
   demonstrated more activation in brain areas involved in the processing
   of erotic stimuli, including intraparietal sulcus, dorsal anterior
   cingulate gyrus, and ento/perirhinal region. Interestingly, HSDD
   participants also showed additional activations in brain areas
   associated with higher order social and cognitive functions, such as
   inferior parietal lobule, inferior frontal gyrus, and posterior medial
   occipital gyrus.
   Conclusion. Together, these findings indicate that HSDD participants do
   not only show a hypo activation in brain areas mediating sexual desire,
   but also a different brain network of hyper activation, which might
   reflect differences in subjective, social, and cognitive interpretations
   of erotic stimuli. Collectively, these data are in line with the
   incentive motivation model of sexual functioning. Bianchi-Demicheli F,

Abstract = {{Research on emotional processing in schizophrenia suggests relatively
   intact subjective responses to affective stimuli ``in the moment.{''}
   However, neuroimaging evidence suggests diminished activation in brain
   regions associated with emotional processing in schizophrenia. We asked
   whether given a more vulnerable cognitive system in schizophrenia,
   individuals with this disorder would show increased or decreased
   modulation of working memory (WM) as a function of the emotional content
   of stimuli compared with healthy control subjects. In addition, we
   examined whether higher anhedonia levels were associated with a
   diminished impact of emotion on behavioral and brain activation
   responses. In the present study, 38 individuals with schizophrenia and
   32 healthy individuals completed blocks of a 2-back WM task in a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning session. Blocks contained
   faces displaying either only neutral stimuli or neutral and emotional
   stimuli (happy or fearful faces), randomly intermixed and occurring both
   as targets and non-targets. Both groups showed higher accuracy but
   slower reaction time for negative compared to neutral stimuli.
   Individuals with schizophrenia showed intact amygdala activity in
   response to emotionally evocative stimuli, but demonstrated altered
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampal activity while
   performing an emotionally loaded WM-task. Higher levels of social
   anhedonia were associated with diminished amygdala responses to
   emotional stimuli and increased DLPFC activity in individuals with
   schizophrenia. Emotional arousal may challenge dorsal-frontal control
   systems, which may have both beneficial and detrimental influences. Our
   findings suggest that disturbances in emotional processing in
   schizophrenia relate to alterations in emotion-cognition interactions
   rather than to the perception and subjective experience of emotion per
   se.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain could be a powerful tool

   of the Huntington's disease gene mutation (preHD). The aim of this study
   was to investigate the sensitivity of resting-state perfusion MRI in
   preHD and to identify neural changes, which could serve as biomarkers
   for future clinical trials. Differences in regional cerebral blood flow
   (rCBF) in 18 preHD and 18 controls were assessed with a novel MRI method
   based on perfusion images obtained with continuous arterial spin
   labeling. High-resolution structural data were collected to test for
   changes of brain volume. Compared with controls, preHD individuals
   showed decreased rCBF in medial and lateral prefrontal regions and
   increased rCBF in the precuneus. PreHD near to symptom onset
   additionally showed decreased rCBF in the putamen and increased rCBF in
   the hippocampus. Network analyses revealed an abnormal lateral
   prefrontal pattern in preHD far and near to motor onset. These data
   suggest early changes of frontostriatal baseline perfusion in preHD
   independent of substantial reductions of gray matter volume. This study
   also shows the feasibility of detecting neural changes in preHD with a

   autism group showed reduced posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus (pSTS),
   parietal and frontal activity during a biological motion task while
   showing similar levels of activity in MT+/V5 during both coherent and
   biological motion trials. Activity in MT+/V5 was predictive of
   individual coherent motion thresholds in both groups. Activity in
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and pSTS was predictive of
   biological motion thresholds in control participants but not in those
   with autism. Notably, however, activity in DLPFC was negatively related
   to autism symptom severity. These results suggest that impairments in
   higher-order social or attentional networks may underlie visual motion
   deficits observed in autism.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of differences in expert and novice neural behavior can
   inform surgical skills training. Outside the surgical domain,
   electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence analyses have shown that during
   motor performance, experts display less coactivation between the
   verbal-analytic and motor planning regions than their less skilled
   counterparts. Reduced involvement of verbal-analytic processes suggests
   greater neural efficiency. The authors tested the utility of an implicit
   motor learning intervention specifically devised to promote neural
   efficiency by reducing verbal-analytic involvement in laparoscopic
   performance.
   In this study, 18 novices practiced a movement pattern on a laparoscopic
   trainer with either conscious awareness of the movement pattern
   (explicit motor learning) or suppressed awareness of the movement
   pattern (implicit motor learning). In a retention test, movement
   accuracy was compared between the conditions, and coactivation (EEG
   coherence) was assessed between the motor planning (Fz) region and both
   the verbal-analytic (T3) and the visuospatial (T4) cortical regions
   (T3-Fz and T4-Fz, respectively).
   Movement accuracy in the conditions was not different in a retention
   test (P = 0.231). Findings showed that the EEG coherence scores for the
   T3-Fz regions were lower for the implicit learners than for the explicit
   learners (P = 0.027), but no differences were apparent for the T4-Fz
   regions (P = 0.882).
   Implicit motor learning reduced EEG coactivation between verbal-analytic
   and motor planning regions, suggesting that verbal-analytic processes
   were less involved in laparoscopic performance. The findings imply that
   training techniques that discourage nonessential coactivation during
   motor performance may provide surgeons with more neural resources with
   which to manage other aspects of surgery.}},

Title = {{Probing the Brain in Autism Using fMRI and Diffusion Tensor Imaging}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Number = {{55}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Newly emerging theories suggest that the brain does not function as a
   cohesive unit in autism, and this discordance is reflected in the
   behavioral symptoms displayed by individuals with autism. While
   structural neuroimaging findings have provided some insights into brain
   abnormalities in autism, the consistency of such findings is
   questionable. Functional neuroimaging, on the other hand, has been more
   fruitful in this regard because autism is a disorder of dynamic
   processing and allows examination of communication between cortical
   networks, which appears to be where the underlying problem occurs in
   autism. Functional connectivity is defined as the temporal correlation
   of spatially separate neurological events1. Findings from a number of
   recent fMRI studies have supported the idea that there is weaker
   coordination between different parts of the brain that should be working
   together to accomplish complex social or language problems(2,3,4,5,6).
   One of the mysteries of autism is the coexistence of deficits in several
   domains along with relatively intact, sometimes enhanced, abilities.
   Such complex manifestation of autism calls for a global and
   comprehensive examination of the disorder at the neural level. A
   compelling recent account of the brain functioning in autism, the
   cortical underconnectivity theory,(2,7) provides an integrating
   framework for the neurobiological bases of autism. The cortical
   underconnectivity theory of autism suggests that any language, social,
   or psychological function that is dependent on the integration of
   multiple brain regions is susceptible to disruption as the processing
   demand increases. In autism, the underfunctioning of integrative
   circuitry in the brain may cause widespread underconnectivity. In other
   words, people with autism may interpret information in a piecemeal
   fashion at the expense of the whole. Since cortical underconnectivity
   among brain regions, especially the frontal cortex and more posterior
   areas(3,6), has now been relatively well established, we can begin to
   further understand brain connectivity as a critical component of autism
   symptomatology.
   A logical next step in this direction is to examine the anatomical
   connections that may mediate the functional connections mentioned above.
   Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a relatively novel neuroimaging
   technique that helps probe the diffusion of water in the brain to infer
   the integrity of white matter fibers. In this technique, water diffusion
   in the brain is examined in several directions using diffusion
   gradients. While functional connectivity provides information about the
   synchronization of brain activation across different brain areas during
   a task or during rest, DTI helps in understanding the underlying axonal
   organization which may facilitate the cross-talk among brain areas. This
   paper will describe these techniques as valuable tools in understanding
   the brain in autism and the challenges involved in this line of
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Anxious individuals have been shown to interpret others' emotional
   states negatively. Since most studies have used facial expressions as
   emotional cues, we examined whether trait anxiety affects the
   recognition of emotion in a dynamic face and voice that were presented
   in synchrony. The face and voice cues conveyed either matched (e.g.,
   happy face and voice) or mismatched emotions (e.g., happy face and angry
   voice). Participants with high or low trait anxiety were to indicate the
   perceived emotion using one of the cues while ignoring the other. The
   results showed that individuals with high trait anxiety were more likely
   to interpret others' emotions in a negative manner, putting more weight
   on the to-be-ignored angry cues. This interpretation bias was found
   regardless of the cue modality (i.e., face or voice). Since trait
   anxiety did not affect recognition of the face or voice cues presented
   in isolation, this interpretation bias appears to reflect an altered
   integration of the face and voice cues among anxious individuals.}},

Abstract = {{This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify
   differences in the neural processes underlying direct and semidirect
   interviews. We examined brain activation patterns while 20 native
   speakers of Japanese participated in direct and semidirect interviews in
   both Japanese (first language {[}L1]) and English (second language
   {[}L2]). Significantly greater activation was observed in the regions
   involved in social communication (the medial prefrontal cortex and the
   bilateral posterior superior temporal sulci) during the direct interview
   conducted in the L2 than during the semidirect interview conducted in
   the L2. In contrast, both the direct and semidirect interviews conducted
   in the L1 produced similar increases in activation in the same brain
   areas as those observed during the L2 direct interview. These findings
   suggest that the direct interview may have elicited L2 communicative
   ability to a greater degree than the semidirect interview. Furthermore,
   during the L2 direct interview, activity in the right superior temporal
   region, which is involved in the processing of paralinguistic features
   (e. g., prosody and intonation), was positively correlated with
   increased L2 oral proficiency. Based on our findings, we conclude that
   the L2 direct interview may elicit more balanced and varied aspects of
   communicative ability than the L2 semidirect interview.}},

Abstract = {{Previous evidence suggests that `social gaze' can not only cause shifts
   in attention, but also can change the perception of objects located in
   the direction of gaze and how these objects will be manipulated by an
   observer. These findings implicate differences in the neural networks
   sub-serving action control driven by social cues as compared with
   nonsocial cues. Here, we sought to explore this hypothesis by using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and a stimulus-response
   compatibility paradigm in which participants were asked to generate
   spatially congruent or incongruent motor responses to both social and
   nonsocial stimuli. Data analysis revealed recruitment of a dorsal
   frontoparietal network and the locus coeruleus for the generation of
   incongruent motor responses, areas previously implicated in controlling
   attention. As a correlate for the effect of `social gaze' on action
   control, an interaction effect was observed for incongruent responses to
   social stimuli in sub-cortical structures, anterior cingulate and
   inferior frontal cortex. Our results, therefore, suggest that performing
   actions in a-albeit minimal-social context significantly changes the
   neural underpinnings of action control and recruits brain regions
   previously implicated in action monitoring, the reorienting of attention
   and social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how visual and linguistic information interact in the
   perception of emotion. We borrowed a phenomenon from film theory which
   states that presentation of an as such neutral visual scene intensifies
   the percept of fear or suspense induced by a different channel of
   information, such as language. Our main aim was to investigate how
   neutral visual scenes can enhance responses to fearful language content
   in parts of the brain involved in the perception of emotion. Healthy
   participants' brain activity was measured (using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging) while they read fearful and less fearful sentences
   presented with or without a neutral visual scene. The main idea is that
   the visual scenes intensify the fearful content of the language by
   subtly implying and concretizing what is described in the sentence.
   Activation levels in the right anterior temporal pole were selectively
   increased when a neutral visual scene was paired with a fearful
   sentence, compared to reading the sentence alone, as well as to reading
   of non-fearful sentences presented with the same neutral scene. We
   conclude that the right anterior temporal pole serves a binding function
   of emotional information across domains such as visual and linguistic
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Social cues have subtle effects on a person, often without them being
   aware. One explanation for this influence involves implicit priming of
   trait associations. To study this effect, we activated implicit
   associations in participants of `being Clever' or `being Stupid' that
   were task relevant, and studied its behavioural impact on an independent
   cognitive task (the n-back task). Activating a representation of
   `Clever' caused participants to slow their reaction times after errors
   on the working memory task, while the reverse pattern was seen for
   associations to `Stupid'. Critically, these behavioural effects were
   absent in control conditions. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we show that the neural basis of this effect involves the
   anterior paracingulate cortex (area 32) where activity tracked the
   observed behavioural pattern, increasing its activity during error
   monitoring in the `Clever' condition and decreasing in the `Stupid'
   condition. The data provide a quantitative demonstration of how implicit
   cues, which specifically target a person's self-concept, influences the
   way we react to our own behaviour and point to the anterior
   paracingulate cortex as a critical cortical locus for mediating these
   self-concept related behavioural regulations.}},

Abstract = {{The neural bases of the association between negative affectivity and
   self-focus remain unknown in healthy subjects. Building on the role of
   the cortical midline structures (CMS) in self-referential processing, we
   hypothesized that negative affectivity in healthy subjects would be
   associated with an increased activation of the CMS during
   self-referential processing. We presented positive and negative pictures
   to 45 healthy subjects during fMRI and asked them to judge whether the
   pictures were related to themselves or not (self condition), or whether
   the pictures were positive or negative (general condition). Negative
   affectivity was measured by the level of harm avoidance (HA) with the
   Temperament and Character Inventory. Self-referential processing
   activated the CMS, including the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). A higher HA
   score was associated with a greater activation of the dorsal MPFC and
   PCC during self-referential processing, this greater activation being
   more pronounced for negative pictures in the dorsal MPFC. This increased
   activation of the CMS may embody the association between negative
   affectivity and self-focus in healthy subjects, as previously observed
   in major depression. Within the CMS, the dorsal MPFC may play a key role
   in negative affectivity, integrating an increased attention to negative
   stimuli with an increased attention to the self.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Emotional stimuli have been shown to preferentially engage initial
   attention but their sustained effects on neural processing remain
   largely unknown. The present study evaluated whether emotional faces
   engage sustained neural processing by examining the attenuation of
   neural repetition suppression to repeated emotional faces. Repetition
   suppression of neural function refers to the general reduction of neural
   activity when processing a repeated stimulus. Preferential processing of
   emotional face stimuli, however, should elicit sustained neural
   processing such that repetition suppression to repeated emotional faces
   is attenuated relative to faces with no emotional content. We measured
   the reduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging signals
   associated with immediate repetition of neutral, angry and happy faces.
   Whereas neutral faces elicited the greatest suppression in ventral
   visual cortex, followed by angry faces, repetition suppression was the
   most attenuated for happy faces. Indeed, happy faces showed almost no
   repetition suppression in part of the right-inferior occipital and
   fusiform gyri, which play an important role in face-identity processing.
   Our findings suggest that happy faces are associated with sustained
   visual encoding of face identity and thereby assist in the formation of
   more elaborate representations of the faces, congruent with findings in
   the behavioral literature.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{460-467}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{People rationalize the choices they make when confronted with difficult
   decisions by claiming they never wanted the option they did not choose.
   Behavioral studies on cognitive dissonance provide evidence for
   decision-induced attitude change, but these studies cannot fully uncover
   the mechanisms driving the attitude change because only pre- and
   post-decision attitudes are measured, rather than the process of change
   itself. In the first fMRI study to examine the decision phase in a
   decision-based cognitive dissonance paradigm, we observed that increased
   activity in right-inferior frontal gyrus, medial fronto-parietal regions
   and ventral striatum, and decreased activity in anterior insula were
   associated with subsequent decision-related attitude change. These
   findings suggest the characteristic rationalization processes that are
   associated with decision-making may be engaged very quickly at the
   moment of the decision, without extended deliberation and may involve
   reappraisal-like emotion regulation processes.}},

Abstract = {{In an fMRI study, effects of contingency awareness on conditioned
   responses were assessed in three groups comprising 118 subjects. A
   differential fear-conditioning paradigm with visual conditioned stimuli,
   an electrical unconditioned stimulus and two distractors was applied.
   The instructed aware group was informed about the contingencies, whereas
   the distractors prevented contingency detection in the unaware group.
   The third group (learned aware) was not informed about the
   contingencies, but learned them despite the distractors. Main effects of
   contingency awareness on conditioned responses emerged in several brain
   structures. Post hoc tests revealed differential dorsal anterior
   cingulate, insula and ventral striatum responses in aware conditioning
   only, whereas the amygdala was activated independent of contingency
   awareness. Differential responses of the hippocampus were specifically
   observed in learned aware subjects, indicating a role in the development
   of contingency awareness. The orbitofrontal cortex showed varying
   response patterns: lateral structures showed higher responses in
   instructed aware than unaware subjects, the opposite was true for medial
   parts. Conditioned subjective and electrodermal responses emerged only
   in the two aware groups. These results confirm the independence of
   conditioned amygdala responses from contingency awareness and indicate
   specific neural circuits for different aspects of fear acquisition in
   unaware, learned aware and instructed aware subjects.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Neural correlates involved in the formation of negative impression from
   face were investigated using event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging and a partial conditioning paradigm. Eighteen normal volunteers
   underwent imaging while they viewed the faces of two unfamiliar
   individuals: one individual's face was partially accompanied by negative
   emotion but the other's was not. After the volunteers learned the
   relationship between the faces and the emotion, they formed a more
   negative impression of the person's face when the emotion was presented.
   Subtraction analysis of the individuals' neutral faces revealed
   activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and superior temporal
   sulcus, but this activity did not correlate with the change of
   impression from face. On the other hand, the response in the left
   amygdala negatively correlated with the change of impression from face
   in the first run. Time modulation analysis revealed that activity in the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex associated with negative emotion was the
   largest in the initial part of the acquisition. These results suggest
   that a negative impression from face may be formed by orchestrated
   activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex and amygdala, and that the activity has a prominent role in the
   initial acquisition of negative emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Prosocial decisions can be difficult because they often involve personal
   sacrifices that do not generate any direct, immediate benefits to the
   self. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to understand how individuals decide to provide support to
   others. Twenty-five participants were scanned as they completed a task
   in which they made costly decisions to contribute money to their family
   and noncostly decisions to accept personal monetary rewards. Decisions
   to contribute to the family recruited brain regions involved in
   self-control and mentalizing, especially for individuals with stronger
   family obligation preferences. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI)
   analyses revealed that individuals with stronger family obligation
   preferences showed greater functional coupling between regions involved
   in self-control and mentalizing with the ventral striatum, a region
   involved in reward processing. These findings suggest that prosocial
   behavior may require both social cognition and deliberate effort, and
   the application of these processes may result in greater positive
   reinforcement during prosocial behavior. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{We present here the most comprehensive analysis to date of
   neuroaesthetic processing by reporting the results of voxel-based
   meta-analyses of 93 neuroimaging studies of positive-valence aesthetic
   appraisal across four sensory modalities. The results demonstrate that
   the most concordant area of activation across all four modalities is the
   right anterior insula, an area typically associated with visceral
   perception, especially of negative valence (disgust, pain, etc.). We
   argue that aesthetic processing is, at its core, the appraisal of the
   valence of perceived objects. This appraisal is in no way limited to
   artworks but is instead applicable to all types of perceived objects.
   Therefore, one way to naturalize aesthetics is to argue that such a
   system evolved first for the appraisal of objects of survival advantage,
   such as food sources, and was later co-opted in humans for the
   experience of artworks for the satisfaction of social needs. (C) 2011

Title = {{Impact of personality on the cerebral processing of emotional prosody}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{259-268}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{While several studies have focused on identifying common brain
   mechanisms governing the decoding of emotional speech melody,
   interindividual variations in the cerebral processing of prosodic
   information, in comparison, have received only little attention to date:
   Albeit, for instance, differences in personality among individuals have
   been shown to modulate emotional brain responses, personality influences
   on the neural basis of prosody decoding have not been investigated
   systematically yet.
   Thus, the present study aimed at delineating relationships between
   interindividual differences in personality and hemodynamic responses
   evoked by emotional speech melody. To determine personality-dependent
   modulations of brain reactivity, fMRI activation patterns during the
   processing of emotional speech cues were acquired from 24 healthy
   volunteers and subsequently correlated with individual trait measures of
   extraversion and neuroticism obtained for each participant.
   Whereas correlation analysis did not indicate any link between brain
   activation and extraversion, strong positive correlations between
   measures of neuroticism and hemodynamic responses of the right amygdala,
   the left postcentral gyrus as well as medial frontal structures
   including the right anterior cingulate cortex emerged, suggesting that
   brain mechanisms mediating the decoding of emotional speech melody may
   vary depending on differences in neuroticism among individuals. Observed
   trait-specific modulations are discussed in the light of processing
   biases as well as differences in emotion control or task strategies
   which may be associated with the personality trait of neuroticism. (C)

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The human voice is one of the principal conveyers of social and
   affective communication. Recent neuroimaging studies have suggested that
   observing pain in others activates neural representations similar to
   those from the first-hand experience of pain; however, studies on pain
   expressions in the auditory channel are lacking. We conducted a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study to examine brain responses
   to emotional exclamations of others' pain. The control condition
   comprised positive (e.g., laughing) or negative (e.g., snoring) stimuli
   of the human voice that were not associated with pain and suffering.
   Compared to these control stimuli, pain-related exclamations elicited
   increased activation in the superior and middle temporal gyri, left
   insula, secondary somatosensory cortices, thalamus, and right
   cerebellum, as well as deactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex.
   The left anterior insular and thalamic activations correlated
   significantly with the Empathic Concern subscale of the Interpersonal
   Reactivity Index. Thus, the brain regions involved in hearing others'
   pain are similar to those activated in the empathic processing of visual
   stimuli. Additionally, the findings emphasise the modulating role of
   interindividual differences in affective empathy.}},

Abstract = {{The ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) has been implicated as a critical neural
   substrate mediating the influence of emotion on moral reasoning. It has
   been shown that the vmPFC is especially important for making moral
   judgments about ``high-conflict{''} moral dilemmas involving direct
   personal actions, that is, scenarios that pit compelling utilitarian
   considerations of aggregate welfare against the highly emotionally
   aversive act of directly causing harm to others {[}Koenigs, M., Young,
   L., Adolphs, R., Tranel, D., Cushman, F., Hauser, M., et al. Damage to
   the prefrontal cortex increases utilitarian moral judgments. Nature,
   446, 908-911, 2007]. The current study was designed to elucidate further
   the role of the vmPFC in high-conflict moral judgments, including those
   that involve indirect personal actions, such as indirectly causing harm
   to one's kin to save a group of strangers. We found that patients with
   vmPFC lesions were more likely than brain-damaged and healthy comparison
   participants to endorse utilitarian outcomes on high-conflict dilemmas
   regardless of whether the dilemmas (1) entailed direct versus indirect
   personal harms and (2) were presented from the Self versus Other
   perspective. In addition, all groups were more likely to endorse
   utilitarian outcomes in the Other perspective as compared with the Self
   perspective. These results provide important extensions of previous
   work, and the findings align with the proposal that the vmPFC is
   critical for reasoning about moral dilemmas in which anticipating the
   social-emotional consequences of an action (e. g., guilt or remorse) is
   crucial for normal moral judgments {[}Greene, J. D. Why are VMPFC

Abstract = {{Real-world decision-making often involves social considerations.
   Consequently, the social value of stimuli can induce preferences in
   choice behavior. However, it is unknown how financial and social values
   are integrated in the brain. Here, we investigated how smiling and angry
   face stimuli interacted with financial reward feedback in a
   stochastically rewarded decision-making task. Subjects reliably
   preferred the smiling faces despite equivalent reward feedback,
   demonstrating a socially driven bias. We fit a Bayesian reinforcement
   learning model to factor the effects of financial rewards and emotion
   preferences in individual subjects, and regressed model predictions on
   the trial-by-trial fMRI signal. Activity in the subcallosal cingulate
   and the ventral striatum, both involved in reward learning, correlated
   with financial reward feedback, whereas the differential contribution of
   social value activated dorsal temporo-parietal junction and dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex, previously proposed as components of a
   mentalizing network. We conclude that the impact of social stimuli on
   value-based decision processes is mediated by effects in brain regions
   partially separable from classical reward circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{Human communicative competence is based on the ability to process a
   specific class of mental states, namely, communicative intention. The
   present fMRI study aims to analyze whether intention processing in
   communication is affected by the expressive means through which a
   communicative intention is conveyed, that is, the linguistic or
   extralinguistic gestural means. Combined factorial and conjunction
   analyses were used to test two sets of predictions: first, that a common
   brain network is recruited for the comprehension of communicative
   intentions independently of the modality through which they are
   conveyed; second, that additional brain areas are specifically recruited
   depending on the communicative modality used, reflecting distinct
   sensorimotor gateways. Our results clearly showed that a common neural
   network is engaged in communicative intention processing independently
   of the modality used. This network includes the precuneus, the left and
   right posterior STS and TPJ, and the medial pFC. Additional brain areas
   outside those involved in intention processing are specifically engaged
   by the particular communicative modality, that is, a peri-sylvian
   language network for the linguistic modality and a sensorimotor network
   for the extralinguistic modality. Thus, common representation of
   communicative intention may be accessed by modality-specific gateways,
   which are distinct for linguistic versus extralinguistic expressive
   means. Taken together, our results indicate that the information
   acquired by different communicative modalities is equivalent from a
   mental processing standpoint, in particular, at the point at which the
   actor's communicative intention has to be reconstructed.}},

Abstract = {{The discrimination of thatcherized faces from typical faces was explored
   in two simultaneous alternative forced choice tasks. Reaction times
   (RTs) and errors were measured in a behavioural task. Brain activation
   was measured in an equivalent fMRI task. In both tasks, participants
   were tested with upright and inverted faces. Participants were also
   tested on churches in the behavioural task. The behavioural task
   confirmed the face specificity of the illusion (by comparing inversion
   effects for faces against churches) but also demonstrated that the
   discrimination was primarily, although not exclusively, driven by
   attending to eyes. The fMRI task showed that, relative to inverted
   faces, upright grotesque faces are discriminated via activation of a
   network of emotion/social evaluation processing areas. On the other
   hand, discrimination of inverted thatcherized faces was associated with
   increased activation of brain areas that are typically involved in
   perceptual processing of faces.}},

   CORTEX}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{189}},
Pages = {{223-235}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Studies have indicated that temporal and prefrontal brain regions
   process face and vocal information. Face-selective and
   vocalization-responsive neurons have been demonstrated in the
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and some prefrontal cells
   preferentially respond to combinations of face and corresponding
   vocalizations. These studies suggest VLPFC in nonhuman primates may play
   a role in communication that is similar to the role of inferior frontal
   regions in human language processing. If VLPFC is involved in
   communication, information about a speaker's face including identity,
   face-view, gaze, and emotional expression might be encoded by prefrontal
   neurons. In the following study, we examined the effect of face-view in
   ventrolateral prefrontal neurons by testing cells with auditory, visual,
   and a set of human and monkey faces rotated through 0 degrees, 30
   degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, and 30 degrees. Prefrontal neurons
   responded selectively to either the identity of the face presented
   (human or monkey) or to the specific view of the face/head, or to both
   identity and face-view. Neurons which were affected by the identity of
   the face most often showed an increase in firing in the second part of
   the stimulus period. Neurons that were selective for face-view typically
   preferred forward face-view stimuli (0 degrees and 30 degrees rotation).
   The neurons which were selective for forward face-view were also
   auditory responsive compared to other neurons which responded to other
   views or were unselective which were not auditory responsive. Our
   analysis showed that the human forward face (0 degrees) was decoded
   better and also contained the most information relative to other
   face-views. Our findings confirm a role for VLPFC in the processing and
   integration of face and vocalization information and add to the growing
   body of evidence that the primate ventrolateral prefrontal cortex plays
   a prominent role in social communication and is an important model in
   understanding the cellular mechanisms of communication. (C) 2011 IBRO.

Title = {{Sex difference in the processing of task-relevant and task-irrelevant
   social information: An event-related potential study of familiar face
   recognition}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{1408}},

Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral studies suggest that men are more likely to develop
   independent self-construals whereas women are more likely to develop
   interdependent self-construals. The gender difference in self-construals
   leads to two predictions. First, independent self-construals may result
   in a bias of attentional processing of self-related information that is
   stronger in men than in women. Second, interdependent self-construals
   may induce greater sensitivity to contextual information from the
   environment in women than in men. The present study tested these
   hypotheses by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) to familiar
   faces (self-, mother-, and father-faces) and unfamiliar faces
   (gender/age matched strangers' faces) from 14 male and 14 female adults.
   Using an odd ball paradigm, in separate blocks of trials, familiar faces
   were designated as either targets that required behavioral responses or
   as non-targets that did not require a behavioral response. We found that
   a long latency positivity at 420-620 ms over the parietal area (the
   attention sensitive target P3) showed a larger amplitude to self-face
   than to mother-/father-faces that were designated as targets in men but
   not in women. In contrast, a long latency positivity at 430-530 ms over
   the central area (the context sensitive novelty P3) was enlarged to
   familiar compared to strangers' faces that were designated as
   non-targets and this effect was greater in women than in men. Our
   results showed ERP evidence for sex differences in the processing of
   task-relevant and task-irrelevant social information. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Communication signals are important for social interactions and survival
   and are thought to receive specialized processing in the visual and
   auditory systems. Whereas the neural processing of faces by face
   clusters and face cells has been repeatedly studied {[}1-5], less is
   known about the neural representation of voice content. Recent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have localized
   voice-preferring regions in the primate temporal lobe {[}6, 7], but the
   hemodynamic response cannot directly assess neurophysiological
   properties. We investigated the responses of neurons in an
   fMRI-identified voice cluster in awake monkeys, and here we provide the
   first systematic evidence for voice cells. ``Voice cells{''} were
   identified, in analogy to ``face cells,{''} as neurons responding at
   least 2-fold stronger to conspecific voices than to ``nonvoice{''}
   sounds or heterospecific voices. Importantly, whereas face clusters are
   thought to contain high proportions of face cells {[}4] responding
   broadly to many faces {[}1, 2, 4, 5, 8-10], we found that voice clusters
   contain moderate proportions of voice cells. Furthermore, individual
   voice cells exhibit high stimulus selectivity. The results reveal the
   neurophysiological bases for fMRI-defined voice clusters in the primate
   brain and highlight potential differences in how the auditory and visual
   systems generate selective representations of communication signals.}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneous mimicry of other people's actions serves an important social
   function, enhancing affiliation and social interaction. This mimicry can
   be subtly modulated by different social contexts. We recently found
   behavioral evidence that direct eye gaze rapidly and specifically
   enhances mimicry of intransitive hand movements (Wang et al., 2011).
   Based on past findings linking medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to both
   eye contact and the control of mimicry, we hypothesized that mPFC might
   be the neural origin of this behavioral effect. The present study aimed
   to test this hypothesis. During functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) scanning, 20 human participants performed a simple mimicry or
   no-mimicry task, as previously described (Wang et al., 2011), with
   direct gaze present on half of the trials. As predicted, fMRI results
   showed that performing the task activated mirror systems, while direct
   gaze and inhibition of the natural tendency to mimic both engaged mPFC.
   Critically, we found an interaction between mimicry and eye contact in
   mPFC, superior temporal sulcus (STS) and inferior frontal gyrus. We then
   used dynamic causal modeling to contrast 12 possible models of
   information processing in this network. Results supported a model in
   which eye contact controls mimicry by modulating the connection strength
   from mPFC to STS. This suggests that mPFC is the originator of the
   gaze-mimicry interaction and that it modulates sensory input to the
   mirror system. Thus, our results demonstrate how different components of
   the social brain work together to on-line control mimicry according to
   the social context.}},

Abstract = {{There is mounting evidence that mindfulness meditation is beneficial for
   the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, yet little is known
   regarding the neural mechanisms through which mindfulness modulates
   emotional responses. Thus, a central objective of this functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study was to investigate the effects of
   mindfulness on the neural responses to emotionally laden stimuli.
   Another major goal of this study was to examine the impact of the extent
   of mindfulness training on the brain mechanisms supporting the
   processing of emotional stimuli. Twelve experienced (with over 1000 h of
   practice) and 10 beginner meditators were scanned as they viewed
   negative, positive, and neutral pictures in a mindful state and a
   non-mindful state of awareness. Results indicated that the Mindful
   condition attenuated emotional intensity perceived from pictures, while
   brain imaging data suggested that this effect was achieved through
   distinct neural mechanisms for each group of participants. For
   experienced meditators compared with beginners, mindfulness induced a
   deactivation of default mode network areas (medial prefrontal and
   posterior cingulate cortices) across all valence categories and did not
   influence responses in brain regions involved in emotional reactivity
   during emotional processing. On the other hand, for beginners relative
   to experienced meditators, mindfulness induced a down-regulation of the
   left amygdala during emotional processing. These findings suggest that
   the long-term practice of mindfulness leads to emotional stability by
   promoting acceptance of emotional states and enhanced present-moment
   awareness, rather than by eliciting control over low-level affective
   cerebral systems from higher-order cortical brain regions. These results
   have implications for affect-related psychological disorders. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Whereas we know a fair amount on the role of the amygdala in the acute
   stress response, virtually nothing is known about its role during the
   recovery period after the stress has waned. Functional connectivity
   analysis of the amygdala during this period might be useful in revealing
   brain circuits promoting adaptive recovery from a stressful event, as
   well as consolidation of emotionally relevant information in preparing
   for future challenges.
   Healthy participants were randomly assigned to either a psychosocial
   stress task (n = 18; stress group) or a comparable non-stressful control
   procedure (n = 20; controls). To study the prolonged effects of stress
   on amygdala functional connectivity, resting-state fMRI scans were
   acquired an hour after the stress task. Amygdala functional connectivity
   with other brain regions was assessed using seed-based correlations.
   The stress group exhibited a strong physiological and behavioral
   reaction to psychosocial stress exposure. Compared with controls the
   stress group showed increased amygdala functional connectivity with
   three cortical midline structures: the posterior cingulate cortex and
   precuneus (p<.05, corrected), and the medial prefrontal cortex (p<.05,
   small volume corrected).
   An hour after psychosocial stress, changes in amygdala functional
   connectivity were detected with cortical midline structures involved in
   the processing and regulation of emotions, as well as autobiographical
   memory. It is hypothesized that these effects could relate to top-down
   control of the amygdala and consolidation of self-relevant information
   after a stressful event. These results on functional connectivity in the
   recovery phase after stress might provide an important new vantage point
   in studying both sensitivity and resilience to stress. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The perception and judgement of social hierarchies forms an integral
   part of social cognition. Hierarchical judgements can be either
   self-referential or allocentric (pertaining to two or more external
   agents). In psychiatric conditions such as dissocial personality
   disorder and schizophrenia, the impact of hierarchies may be
   problematic. We sought to elucidate the brain regions involved in
   judging allocentric social hierarchies. Twenty-two healthy male subjects
   underwent three fMRI scans. During scanning, subjects answered questions
   concerning visually-presented target pairs of human individual's
   relative superiority within a specific social hierarchy or their
   perceived degree of social alliance (i.e., whether they were ``friends
   or enemies{''}). Subjects also made judgements relating to target pairs'
   age, gender and fame to control for confounding factors and performed a
   baseline numerical task. Response times increased in line with
   hypothesized ascending executive load. Both social hierarchy and social
   alliance judgements activated left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   (VLPFC), left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and bilateral fusiform
   gyri. In addition, social alliance judgements activated right dorsal IFG
   and medial prefrontal cortex. When compared directly with social
   alliance, social hierarchy judgements activated left orbitofrontal
   cortex. Detecting the presence of social hierarchies and judging other's
   relative standing within them implicates the cognitive executive, in
   particular the VLPFC. Our finding informs accounts of `normal' social
   cognition but our method also provides a means of probing the dissocial
   brain in personality disorder and schizophrenia where executive function
   may be dysfunctional. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive abilities such as Theory of Mind (ToM), and more generally
   mentalizing competences, are central to human sociality. Neuroimaging
   has associated these abilities with specific brain regions including
   temporoparietal junction, superior temporal sulcus, frontal pole, and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Previous studies have shown both that
   mentalizing competence, indexed as the ability to correctly understand
   others' belief states, is associated with social network size and that
   social group size is correlated with frontal lobe volume across primate
   species (the social brain hypothesis). Given this, we predicted that
   both mentalizing competences and the number of social relationships a
   person can maintain simultaneously will be a function of gray matter
   volume in these regions associated with conventional Theory of Mind. We
   used voxel-based morphometry of Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) to test
   this hypothesis in humans. Specifically, we regressed individuals'
   mentalizing competences and social network sizes against gray matter
   volume. This revealed that gray matter volume in bilateral posterior
   frontal pole and left temporoparietal junction and superior temporal
   sucus varies parametrically with mentalizing competence. Furthermore,
   gray matter volume in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral
   portion of medial frontal gyrus, varied parametrically with both
   mentalizing competence and social network size, demonstrating a shared
   neural basis for these very different facets of sociality. These
   findings provide the first fine-grained anatomical support for the
   social brain hypothesis. As such, they have important implications for
   our understanding of the constraints limiting social cognition and
   social network size in humans, as well as for our understanding of how
   such abilities evolved across primates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies suggested that ERP component contralateral delay
   activity (CDA) tracks the number of objects containing identity
   information stored in visual short term memory (VSTM). Later MEG and
   fMRI studies implied that its neural source lays in superior IPS.
   However, since the memorized stimuli in previous studies were displayed
   in distinct spatial locations, hence possibly CDA tracks the
   object-location information instead. Moreover, a recent study implied
   the activation in superior IPS reflected the location load. The current
   research thus explored whether CDA tracks the object-location load or
   the object-identity load, and its neural sources. Participants were
   asked to remember one color, four identical colors or four distinct
   colors. The four-identical-color condition was the critical one because
   it contains the same amount of identity information as that of one color
   while the same amount of location information as that of four distinct
   colors. To ensure the participants indeed selected four colors in the
   four-identical-color condition, we also split the participants into two
   groups (low- vs. high-capacity), analyzed late positive component (LPC)
   in the prefrontal area, and collected participant's subjective-report.
   Our results revealed that most of the participants selected four
   identical colors. Moreover, regardless of capacity-group, there was no
   difference on CDA between one color and four identical colors yet both
   were lower than 4 distinct colors. Besides, the source of CDA was
   located in the superior parietal lobule, which is very close to the
   superior IPS. These results support the statement that CDA tracks the
   object identity information in VSTM. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Mania is argued to stem from the dysfunctional processing of
   reward. Investigation of hypomania in healthy samples has the potential
   to offer refined insight into the particular aspects of reward
   processing in mania that are dysfunctional.
   Method: In this study, fMRI was employed in contrasting a sample of 12
   unmedicated subclinical hypomanic individuals with a sample of 12
   unmedicated controls in order to investigate reward-related processing
   in a reinforcement-learning task.
   Results: Four findings in the hypomania-prone group relative to the
   control group supported atypical reward processing. Firstly, striatal
   activation that correlated with reward value and prediction error was
   stronger in response to cues and outcomes respectively, consistent with
   hypomania being related to an enhanced perception of the value of goals
   that may lead to reward. Secondly, value-related medial temporal
   activation was stronger in response to cues, suggesting that in
   hypomania-prone individuals, stimuli in memory were represented in
   accordance with their perceived value. Thirdly, these effects failed to
   be modulated by the actual value of outcomes, suggesting that hypomania
   is related to a decreased ability to discriminate between cues differing
   in value. Fourthly, increased insula activation in response to expected,
   but absent, reward was consistent with a bias towards expecting positive
   outcomes in decision-making.
   Conclusion: Together, the findings suggest that enhanced perception and
   representation of goal-value that nonetheless fails to discriminate on
   the basis of actual goal-value, coupled with a positive
   outcome-expectancy bias, could be causally related to insatiable and
   indiscriminate reward seeking in mania. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Previous research has consistently shown that the left parietal cortex
   is critical for numerical processing, but the role of the right parietal
   lobe has been much less clear. This study used the intraoperative
   cortical electrical stimulation approach to investigate neural
   dissociation in the right parietal cortex for subtraction and
   multiplication. Results showed that multiplication (as well as picture
   naming) was not affected by the cortical electrical stimulation on all
   the targeted sites of the right parietal cortex as well as those of the
   right temporal cortex. In contrast, stimulation at three right parietal
   sites (two sites in the right inferior parietal lobule and one in the
   right angular gyrus) impaired performance on simple subtraction
   problems. This study provided the first evidence from an intraoperative
   cortical electrical stimulation study to show the dissociation of
   arithmetic operations in the right parietal cortex. This dissociation
   between subtraction and multiplication suggests that the right parietal

Abstract = {{The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated the
   role of emotion-related (e.g., amygdala) and self-related brain
   structures (MPFC in particular) in the processing of emotional words
   varying in stimulus reference. Healthy subjects (N = 22) were presented
   with emotional (pleasant or unpleasant) or neutral words in three
   different conditions: (1) self (e.g., my fear), (2) other (e.g., his
   fear) and (3) no reference (e.g., the fear). Processing of unpleasant
   words was associated with increased amygdata and also insula activation
   across all conditions. Pleasant stimuli were specifically associated
   with increased activation of amygdala and insula when related to the
   self (vs. other and no reference). Activity in the MPFC (vMPFC in
   particular) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was preferentially
   increased during processing of self-related emotional words (vs. other
   and no reference). These results demonstrate that amygdala activation in
   response to emotional stimuli is modulated by stimulus reference and
   that brain structures implicated in emotional and self-related
   processing might be important for the subjective experience of one's own
   emotions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Research points to the importance of breastfeeding for
   promoting close mother-infant contact and social-emotional development.
   Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have
   identified brain regions related to maternal behaviors. However, little
   research has addressed the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the
   relationship between breastfeeding and maternal behavior in human
   mothers. We investigated the associations between breastfeeding,
   maternal brain response to own infant stimuli, and maternal sensitivity
   in the early postpartum. Methods: Seventeen biological mothers of
   healthy infants participated in two matched groups according to feeding
   method - exclusive breastfeeding and exclusive formula-feeding at 2-4
   weeks postpartum. fMRI scanning was conducted in the first postpartum
   month to examine maternal brain activation in response to her own baby's
   cry versus control baby-cry. Dyadic interactions between mothers and
   infants at 3-4 months postpartum were videotaped in the home and blindly
   coded for maternal sensitivity. Results: In the first postpartum month,
   breastfeeding mothers showed greater activations in the superior frontal
   gyrus, insula, precuneus, striatum, and amygdala while listening to
   their own baby-cry as compared to formula-feeding mothers. For both
   breastfeeding and formula-feeding mothers, greater activations in the
   right superior frontal gyrus and amygdala were associated with higher
   maternal sensitivity at 3-4 months postpartum. Conclusions: Results
   suggest links between breastfeeding and greater response to infant cues
   in brain regions implicated in maternal-infant bonding and empathy
   during the early postpartum. Such brain activations may facilitate
   greater maternal sensitivity as infants enter their social world.}},

Title = {{Differential modulation of emotion processing brain regions by
   noradrenergic and serotonergic antidepressants}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{216}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Rationale Most widely used antidepressant drugs affect the serotonergic
   and noradrenergic pathways. However, there are currently no
   neurobiological criteria for selecting between these targets and
   predicting the treatment response in individual depressed patients.
   Objectives The current study is aimed at differentiating brain regions
   known to be pathophysiologically and functionally involved in
   depression-related emotion processing with respect to their
   susceptibility to serotonergic and noradrenergic modulation.
   Methods In a single-blind pseudo-randomized crossover study, 16 healthy
   subjects (out of 21 enrolled) were included in analysis after ingesting
   a single dose of citalopram (a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor,
   40 mg), reboxetine (a selective noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitor, 8 mg),
   or placebo at three time points prior to functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). During fMRI, subjects anticipated and subsequently
   viewed emotional pictures. Effects of serotonergic and noradrenergic
   modulation versus placebo on brain activity during the perception of
   negative pictures were analyzed with a repeated measures ANOVA in the
   whole brain and in specific regions of interest relevant to depression.
   Results Noradrenergic modulation by reboxetine increased brain activity
   in the thalamus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and occipital
   regions during the perception of negative emotional stimuli. Citalopram
   primarily affected the ventrolateral prefrontal cortical regions.
   Conclusion The brain regions involved in the processing of negative
   emotional stimuli were differentially modulated by selective
   noradrenergic and serotonergic drugs: thalamic activity was increased by
   reboxetine, whereas citalopram primarily affected ventrolateral
   prefrontal regions. Thus, dysfunction in these regions, which could be
   identified in depressed patients, may predict treatment responses to
   either noradrenergic or serotonergic antidepressants.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. The abnormal processing of emotional stimuli is common to a
   variety of psychiatric disorders. Specifically, patients with prominent
   anxiety symptoms generally overreact to emotional cues, which has been
   linked to increased amygdala activation. However, in OCD, enhanced
   responses are predominantly obtained using disease-specific stimuli and
   preferentially involve frontostriatal systems. Methods. We assessed 21
   OCD patients and 21 healthy controls with fMRI during an emotional
   face-processing paradigm involving active response generation to test
   for alterations in both brain activation and task-induced functional
   connectivity of the frontal cortex, the amygdala and the fusiform face
   area. Results. OCD patients showed significantly greater activation of
   ``{''}face-processing{''}{''} regions including the amygdala, fusiform
   gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The reciprocal connectivity
   between face-processing regions was enhanced in OCD. Importantly, we
   detected significant correlations between patients'' clinical symptom
   severity and both task-related region activation and network functional
   connectivity. Conclusions. The results suggest that OCD patients may
   show enhanced brain responsiveness during emotional face-processing when
   tasks involve active response generation. Our findings diverge from
   previously described alterations in anxiety disorders, as patients
   showed enhanced amygdala-prefrontal connectivity as opposed to negative
   reciprocal interaction. This pattern would appear to be
   disorder-specific and was significantly related to obsessive-compulsive
   symptom severity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Socio-communicative impairments are salient features of
   autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Abnormal development of posterior
   superior temporal sulcus (pSTS)-a key processing area for language,
   biological motion, and social context-could play a role in these
   deficits.
   Methods: Functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging was used to
   examine the synchronization of low-frequency blood oxygen
   level-dependent fluctuations during continuous performance on a visual
   search task. Twenty-one children and adolescents with ASD and 26
   typically developing individuals-matched on age and IQ-participated in
   the study. Three subregions of pSTS were delineated with a data-driven
   approach, and differentiation of pSTS was examined by comparing the
   connectivity of each subregion.
   Results: In typically developing individuals, differentiation of
   networks was positively associated with age and anatomical maturation
   (cortical thinning in pSTS, greater white matter volume). In the ASD
   group, differentiation of pSTS connectivity was significantly reduced,
   and correlations with anatomical measures were weak or absent. Moreover,
   pSTS differentiation was inversely correlated with autism symptom
   severity.
   Conclusions: Atypical maturation of pSTS suggests altered trajectories
   for functional segregation and integration of networks in ASD,
   potentially related to impaired cognitive and sensorimotor development.
   Furthermore, our findings provide a novel explanation for atypically
   increased connectivity in ASD that has been observed in some functional
   connectivity magnetic resonance imaging studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Oxytocin facilitates parental caregiving and mother-infant
   bonding and might be involved in responses to infant crying. Infant
   crying provides information about the physical status and mood of the
   infant and elicits parental proximity and caregiving. Oxytocin might
   modulate the activation of brain structures involved in the perception
   of cry sounds-specifically the insula, the amygdala, and the
   thalamocingulate circuit-and thereby affect responsiveness to infant
   crying.
   Method: In a randomized controlled trial we investigated the influence
   of intranasally administered oxytocin on neural responses to infant
   crying with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Blood oxygenation
   level-dependent responses to infant crying were measured in 21 women who
   were administered oxytocin and 21 women who were administered a placebo.
   Results: Induced oxytocin levels reduced, experimentally, activation in
   the amygdala and increased activation in the insula and inferior frontal
   gyrus pars triangularis.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that oxytocin promotes responsiveness
   to infant crying by reducing activation in the neural circuitry for
   anxiety and aversion and increasing activation in regions involved in
   empathy.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   In this review, we discuss findings from some recent brain imaging
   studies that shed new light on our understanding of the role of visual
   experience on the development of the brain morphological and functional
   architecture in humans. To what extent is vision truly necessary to
   `see' the world around us?
   Recent findings
   Congenitally blind and sighted individuals present analogous cognitive
   and social performances. Findings from structural and functional brain
   studies in both sighted and congenitally blind individuals have shown
   the existence of supramodal brain regions able to process external
   information regardless of the sensory modality through which such an
   information has been acquired. This more abstract nature of functional
   cortical organization may enable congenitally blind individuals to
   acquire knowledge, form mental representations of and interact
   effectively with an external world that they have never seen.
   Summary
   Altogether, findings from both behavioural and imaging studies indicate
   that the brain functional organization is to a large extent independent
   from visual experience and able to process information in a supramodal
   fashion. The study of the blind brain is a very powerful approach to
   understanding not only the cross-modal plastic, adaptative modifications
   that occur in the `visual' regions but primarily the functional
   architecture of the human brain itself.}},

Volume = {{212}},

Pages = {{593-601}},

Abstract = {{In general, humans tend to devalue a delayed reward. Such delay
   discounting is a theoretical and computational concept in which the
   discount factor influences the time scale of the trade-off between delay
   of reward and amount of reward. The discount factor relies on the
   individual's ability to evaluate the future reward. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated brain mechanisms for reward
   valuation at different individual discount factors in a delayed reward
   choice task. In the task, participants were required to select
   small/immediate or large/delayed rewards to maximize the total reward
   over time. The discount factor for each participant individually was
   calculated from the behavioral data based on an exponential discounting
   model. The estimated value of a future reward increases as the expected
   delivery approaches, so the time course of these estimated values was
   computed based on each individual's discount factor; each was entered
   into the regression analysis as an explanatory (independent) variable.
   After the region of interest was narrowed anatomically to the caudate, a
   peak coordinate was detected in each individual. A correlation analysis
   revealed that the location of the peak along the dorsal-ventral axis in
   the right caudate was positively correlated with the discount factor.
   This implies that individuals who showed a larger discount factor had
   peak activations in a more dorsal part of the right caudate associated
   with future reward prediction. This evidence also suggests that a higher
   ability to delay reward prediction might be related to activation of the
   more dorsal caudate.}},

Abstract = {{Relational aggression such as social rejection is common within school
   peer groups. Converging evidence suggests that adolescent females are
   particularly sensitive to social rejection. We used a novel fMRI
   adaptation of the Cyberball social rejection paradigm to investigate the
   neural response to social rejection in 19 mid-adolescent (aged 14-16)
   and 16 adult female participants. Across all participants, social
   exclusion (relative to inclusion) elicited a response in bilateral
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) extending into ventral and subgenual
   anterior cingulate cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex; and the left
   ventrolateral PFC (vIPFC); regions that have been associated in previous
   studies with social evaluation, negative affective processing, and
   affect regulation respectively. However, the exclusion-related response
   in right vIPFC, a region associated in previous studies with the
   regulation of rejection-related distress, was attenuated in adolescents.
   Within mPFC, greater activation during exclusion vs. inclusion was
   associated with greater self-reported susceptibility to peer influence
   in adolescents but not in adults. This suggests that the brain's
   response to experimentally-induced social rejection relates to
   adolescent behaviour in real-world social interactions. We speculate
   about the potential implications of these findings for educational
   settings. In particular, functional development of affective circuitry
   during adolescence may influence social interaction within the school
   peer group. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported reduced
   activation in parietotemporal and occipitotemporal areas in adults and
   children with developmental dyslexia compared to controls during reading
   and reading related tasks. These patterns of regionally reduced
   activation have been linked to behavioral impairments of reading-related
   processes (e.g., phonological skills and rapid automatized naming). The
   observed functional and behavioral differences in individuals with
   developmental dyslexia have been complemented by reports of reduced gray
   matter in left parietotemporal, occipitotemporal areas, fusiform and
   lingual gyrus and the cerebellum. An important question for education is
   whether these neural differences are present before reading is taught.
   Developmental dyslexia can only be diagnosed after formal reading
   education starts. However, here we investigate whether the previously
   detected gray matter alterations in adults and children with
   developmental dyslexia can already be observed in a small group of
   pre-reading children with a family-history of developmental dyslexia
   compared to age and IQ-matched children without a family-history (N =
   20/mean age: 5:9 years; age range 5:1-6:5 years). Voxel-based
   morphometry revealed significantly reduced gray matter volume indices
   for pre-reading children with, compared to children without, a
   family-history of developmental dyslexia in left occipitotemporal,
   bilateral parietotemporal regions, left fusiform gyrus and right lingual
   gyrus. Gray matter volume indices in left hemispheric occipitotemporal
   and parietotemporal regions of interest also correlated positively with
   rapid automatized naming. No differences between the two groups were
   observed in frontal and cerebellar regions. This discovery in a small
   group of children suggests that previously described functional and
   structural alterations in developmental dyslexia may not be due to
   experience-dependent brain changes but may be present at birth or
   develop in early childhood prior to reading onset. Further studies using
   larger sample sizes and longitudinal analyses are needed in order to
   determine whether the identified structural alterations may be utilized
   as structural markers for the early identification of children at risk,
   which may prevent the negative clinical, social and psychological
   outcome of developmental dyslexia. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In alphabetic language systems, converging evidence indicates that

   whether, impaired phonological processing remains the core deficit of
   impaired English reading in individuals with English as their second
   language and how it is represented in the neural cortex. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study investigated
   the neural responses to letter rhyming judgment (phonological task) and
   letter same/different judgment (orthographic task) in Chinese school
   children with English and Chinese reading impairment compared to
   typically developing children. Whole brain analyses with multiple
   comparison correction revealed reduced activation within the left
   lingual/calcarine gyrus during orthographic processing in children with
   reading impairment compared to typical readers. An independent region of
   interest analysis showed reduced activation in occipitotemporal regions
   during orthographic processing, and reduced activation in
   parietotemporal regions during phonological processing, consistent with
   previous studies in English native speakers. These results suggest that
   similar neural deficits are involved for impaired phonological
   processing in English as both the first and the second language
   acquired. These findings pose implications for reading remediation,

Abstract = {{The representation of social interaction in episodic memory is a
   critical factor for the successful navigation of social relationships.
   In general, it is important to separate episodic memory during social
   interaction from episodic memory during the self-generation of action
   events. Different cortical representations have been associated with
   social interaction vs. self-generated episodic memory. Here we clarified
   the cortical representation of the effect of context (social vs.
   solitary) on episodic memory by comparing it with the generation effect
   (self vs. other) on episodic memory. Each participant learned words
   while engaged in a sentence generation and a reading task, and
   subsequently each participant was scanned with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) while they performed a recognition task using
   the words that had been learned. The experiment was comprised of four
   conditions and we looked at two situations that involved a social
   context and non-social (solitary) context task. In the learning session
   before entering the MRI, two participants collaborated in a social
   context either generating (social-contextual self-generation condition:
   SS) or reading (social-contextual other-generation condition: SO) a
   sequence of sentences alternately to construct a meaningful story
   narrative. In the non-social context, the participants generated
   (non-social-contextual self-generation condition: NS) or read
   (non-social-contextual other-generation condition: NO) a sequence of
   sentences individually. The stimuli for the recognition session
   consisted of learned words and novel words. Activation for social
   context retrieval was identified in the right medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC), and activation for self-generated retrieval was identified in
   the left mPFC and the left middle cingulate cortex. These results
   indicate that dissociable regions within the medial prefrontal cortices
   contribute to the processes involved in the representation of social
   interaction, including social context and self-generation in the
   retrieval of episodic memory. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{The narcissistic self and its psychological and neural correlates: an

Abstract = {{Background. The concept of narcissism has been much researched in
   psychoanalysis and especially in self psychology. One of the hallmarks
   of narcissism is altered emotion, including decreased affective
   resonance (e. g. empathy) with others, the neural underpinnings of which
   remain unclear. The aim of our exploratory study was to investigate the
   psychological and neural correlates of empathy in two groups of healthy
   subjects with high and low narcissistic personality trait. We
   hypothesized that high narcissistic subjects would show a differential
   activity pattern in regions such as the anterior insula that are
   typically associated with empathy.
   Method. A sample of 34 non-clinical subjects was divided into high
   (n=11) and low (n=11) narcissistic groups according to the 66th and 33rd
   percentiles of their scores on the Narcissism Inventory (NI). Combining
   the psychological, behavioral and neuronal {[}i.e. functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI)] measurements of empathy, we compared the high
   and low narcissistic groups of subjects.
   Results. High narcissistic subjects showed higher scores on the Symptom
   Checklist-90 - Revised (SCL-90-R) and the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia
   Scale (TAS-20) when compared to low narcissistic subjects. High
   narcissistic subjects also showed significantly decreased deactivation
   during empathy, especially in the right anterior insula.
   Conclusions. Psychological and neuroimaging data indicate respectively
   higher degrees of alexithymia and lower deactivation during empathy in
   the insula in high narcissistic subjects. Taken together, our
   preliminary findings demonstrate, for the first time, psychological and
   neuronal correlates of narcissism in non-clinical subjects. This might
   stipulate both novel psychodynamic conceptualization and future
   psychological-neuronal investigation of narcissism.}},

Abstract = {{Lesion and electrophysiological studies in animals provide evidence of
   opposing functions for subcortical nuclei such as the amygdala and
   ventral striatum, but the implications of these findings for emotion
   identification in humans remain poorly described. Here we report a
   high-resolution fMRI study in a sample of 39 healthy subjects who
   performed a well-characterized emotion identification task. As expected,
   the amygdala responded to THREAT (angry or fearful) faces more than
   NON-THREAT (sad or happy) faces. A functional connectivity analysis of
   the time series from an anatomically defined amygdala seed revealed a
   strong anticorrelation between the amygdala and the ventral
   striatum/ventral pallidum, consistent with an opposing role for these
   regions in during emotion identification. A second functional
   connectivity analysis (psychophysiological interaction) investigating
   relative connectivity on THREAT vs. NON-THREAT trials demonstrated that
   the amygdala had increased connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex
   during THREAT trials, whereas the ventral striatum demonstrated
   increased connectivity with the posterior hippocampus on NON-THREAT
   trials. These results indicate that activity in the amygdala and ventral
   striatum may be inversely related, and that both regions may provide
   opposing affective bias signals during emotion identification. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Solving simple arithmetic problems involves three stages: encoding the

   This study compared the event-related potentials elicited by
   single-digit addition and multiplication problems to examine the
   relationship between encoding and retrieval/calculation stages. Results
   showed that the operation effect appeared as early as the encoding of
   the first operand and continued to the retrieval/calculation stage:
   compared to addition, multiplication elicited larger negative potentials
   in the left anterior electrodes and larger positive potentials in the
   right posterior electrodes. The consistency of this operation effect
   across the first two stages of arithmetic processing suggests that
   encoding of arithmetic problems can be modulated by the nature of
   representation of the to-be-retrieved arithmetic facts, and thus these
   two stages are additive rather than interactive. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

   and robotic face expressions evoked activity in face-responsive regions
   in the fusiform gyrus and STS and in the putative human mirror neuron
   system. These results suggest that these areas mediate perception of
   agency, independently of whether the agents are living or not. By
   contrast, the human faces evoked stronger activity than did robotic
   faces in the medial pFC and the anterior temporal cortex-areas
   associated with the representation of others' mental states (theory of
   mind), whereas robotic faces evoked stronger activity in areas
   associated with perception of objects and mechanical movements. Our data
   demonstrate that the representation of the distinction between animate

Abstract = {{Selective attention is critical for controlling the input to mental
   processes. Attentional mechanisms act not only to select relevant
   stimuli but also to exclude irrelevant stimuli. There is evidence that
   we can actively ignore irrelevant information. We measured neural
   activity relating to successfully ignoring distracters (using preview
   search) and found increases in both the precuneus and primary visual
   cortex during preparation to ignore distracters. We also found
   reductions in activity in fronto-parietal regions while previewing
   distracters and a reduction in activity in early visual cortex during
   search when a subset of items was successfully excluded from search,
   both associated with precuneus activity. These results are consistent
   with the proposal that actively excluding distractions has two
   components: an initial stage where distracters are encoded, and a
   subsequent stage where further processing of these items is inhibited.
   Our findings suggest that it is the precuneus that controls this process
   and can modulate activity in visual cortex as early as V1.}},

   to self-related information in patients with GSP concerns an increased
   representation of their own or others' opinions. In this article, we
   examine whether GSP is associated with increased response to own (1st
   person) or other individuals' (2nd person) opinions relative to healthy
   individuals. Unmedicated individuals with GSP (n = 15) and age-. IQ-,
   and gender-matched comparison individuals (n = 15) read 1st (e.g., I'm
   ugly), and 2nd (e.g., You're ugly) person viewpoint comments during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. We observed significant
   group-by-viewpoint interactions within the ventral MPFC. Whereas the
   healthy comparison individuals showed significantly increased (or less
   decreased) BOLD responses to 1st relative to 2nd person viewpoints, the
   patients showed significantly increased responses to 2nd relative to 1st
   person viewpoints. The reduced BOLD responses to 1st person viewpoint
   comments shown by the patients correlated significantly with severity of
   social anxiety symptom severity. These results underscore the importance
   of dysfunctional self-referential processing and MPFC in GSP. We believe
   that these data reflect a reorganization of self-referential reasoning
   in the disorder with a self-concept perhaps atypically related to the
   view of others. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Attention is thought to play a key role in the computation of stimulus
   values at the time of choice, which suggests that attention
   manipulations could be used to improve decision-making in domains where
   self-control lapses are pervasive. We used an fMRI food choice task with
   non-dieting human subjects to investigate whether exogenous cues that
   direct attention to the healthiness of foods could improve dietary
   choices. Behaviorally, we found that subjects made healthier choices in
   the presence of health cues. In parallel, stimulus value signals in
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex were more responsive to the healthiness
   of foods in the presence of health cues, and this effect was modulated
   by activity in regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings
   suggest that the neural mechanisms used in successful self-control can
   be activated by exogenous attention cues, and provide insights into the
   processes through which behavioral therapies and public policies could
   facilitate self-control.}},

Abstract = {{Human voices play a fundamental role in social communication, and areas
   of the adult ``social brain{''} show specialization for processing
   voices and their emotional content (superior temporal sulcus, inferior
   prefrontal cortex, premotor cortical regions, amygdala, and insula)
   {[}1-8]. However, it is unclear when this specialization develops.
   Functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) studies suggest that the infant
   temporal cortex does not differentiate speech from music or backward
   speech {[}9, 10], but a prior study with functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy revealed preferential activation for human voices in
   7-month-olds, in a more posterior location of the temporal cortex than
   in adults {[}11]. However, the brain networks involved in processing
   nonspeech human vocalizations in early development are still unknown. To
   address this issue, in the present fMRI study, 3- to 7-month-olds were
   presented with adult nonspeech vocalizations (emotionally neutral,
   emotionally positive, and emotionally negative) and nonvocal
   environmental sounds. Infants displayed significant differential
   activation in the anterior portion of the temporal cortex, similarly to
   adults {[}1]. Moreover, sad vocalizations modulated the activity of
   brain regions involved in processing affective stimuli such as the
   orbitofrontal cortex {[}12] and insula {[}7, 8]. These results suggest
   remarkably early functional specialization for processing human voice
   and negative emotions.}},

Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) has been principally investigated using
   positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) and has received mixed support in electroencephalographic
   (EEG) studies. In particular, the existing evidence is too inconsistent
   to allow formulation of specific hypotheses linking DMN activity to
   traditional EEG frequency bands. In this study, we aimed to test whether
   blind decomposition methods are able to identify in EEG data spatial
   patterns resembling the DMN as it is described in PET and fMRI studies.
   Further we aimed to test a degree of task-relatedness of DMN patterns
   identified in the traditional EEG frequency bands. To answer these
   questions we collected data both in a resting state and during
   performance of two experimental tasks: an explicit judgment of facial
   affect and a social game task. Individual differences in amount of
   self-referential thoughts during the resting state were measured by a
   short self-report scale. Only alpha band spatial patterns simultaneously
   showed a considerable overlap with the DMN and high correlations with
   presumptive DMN function-related outcomes both in the resting state and
   during the social game task. Spontaneous self-referential thoughts were
   associated with enhanced alpha activity in the posterior DMN hub,
   whereas processing of DMN function-related external stimuli disrupted
   this activity and simultaneously caused partial alpha phase-locking to
   external events. This evidence implies that synchronization of internal
   mental processes, as opposed to the processing of external stimuli,
   might be the primary function of alpha oscillations which is bound to be
   related to activity of the DMN. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Epilepsy is a brain disorder usually associated with abnormal cortical
   and/or subcortical functional networks. Exploration of the abnormal
   network properties and localization of the brain regions involved in
   human epilepsy networks are critical for both the understanding of the
   epilepsy networks and planning therapeutic strategies. Currently, most
   localization of seizure networks come from ictal EEG observations.
   Functional MRI provides high spatial resolution together with more
   complete anatomical coverage compared with EEG and may have advantages
   if it can be used to identify the network(s) associated with seizure
   onset and propagation. Epilepsy networks are believed to be present with
   detectable abnormal signatures even during the interictal state. In this
   study, epilepsy networks were investigated using resting-state fMRI
   acquired with the subjects in the interictal state. We tested the
   hypothesis that social network theory applied to resting-state fMRI data
   could reveal abnormal network properties at the group level. Using
   network data as input to a classification algorithm allowed separation
   of medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients from normal control
   subjects indicating the potential value of such network analyses in
   epilepsy. Five local network properties obtained from 36 anatomically
   defined ROIs were input as features to the classifier. An iterative
   feature selection strategy based on the classification efficiency that
   can avoid `over-fitting' is proposed to further improve the
   classification accuracy. An average sensitivity of 77.2\% and
   specificity of 83.86\% were achieved via `leave one out' cross
   validation. This finding of significantly abnormal network properties in
   group level data confirmed our initial hypothesis and provides
   motivation for further investigation of the epilepsy process at the
   network level. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe psychiatric condition
   of undetermined brain underpinnings, which involves profound emotion
   regulation deficits and interpersonal impairment. To elucidate
   biopsychological markers of the disorder, we performed two studies: i.)
   assessing empathy and social cognition and ii.) measuring the
   psychophysical properties and functional brain correlates of empathic
   functioning in a total of fifty-one affected patients and 50 age- and
   gender-matched controls. In the behavioral study we applied the
   Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET), a new, ecologically valid measure to
   assess cognitive (i.e., social cognition) and emotional (i.e., empathic
   concern) empathy to a subset of participants. In the second study,
   functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and skin conductance measurements
   were performed while participants took a scanner-adapted version of the
   MET. Patients with BPD showed impairments in cognitive and emotional
   empathy. Brain responses during cognitive empathy were significantly
   reduced in patients compared to controls in the left superior temporal
   sulcus and gyrus (STS/STG), where this reduction was associated with
   levels of intrusive symptomatology in the BPD group. During emotional
   empathy, patients with BPD exhibited greater brain activity than
   controls in the right middle insular cortex, a response that was
   associated with skin conductance responses in the patients. Results
   indicate that altered functioning of the STS/STG and insula represents
   pathophysiological mediators for reduced empathy in BPD, with an
   important role for intrusive symptomatology and levels of arousal. The
   findings thus support a conceptualization of BPD as involving deficits
   in both inferring others' mental states and being emotionally attuned to
   another person. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   are similarly sensitive to the stereotype-related status of individuals.
   To explore this issue, the current investigation measured neural
   activity while participants made social (i.e., sex categorization) and
   non-social (i.e., dot detection) judgments about men and women portrayed
   in expected and unexpected occupations. When participants categorized
   the stimuli according to sex, stereotype-inconsistent targets elicited
   increased activity in cortical areas associated with person perception
   and conflict resolution. Comparable effects did not emerge during a
   non-social judgment task. These findings begin to elucidate how and when
   stereotypic beliefs modulate the formation of person percepts in the
   brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   Subjects were asked to form an impression of the targets using
   information about both their political affiliation and their political
   views. Of interest was the contrast between stereotypically congruent

Abstract = {{In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we examined
   developmental changes in the brain regions involved in reactions to
   unfair allocations. Previous studies on adults suggested that reactions
   to unfairness are not only affected by the distribution itself but also
   by the ascribed intentionality of the proposer. In the current study, we
   employed the mini Ultimatum Game (Falk, Fehr, \& Fischbacher, 2003) to
   examine responder behavior to unfair offers of varying degrees of
   intentionality. Sixty-eight participants from four age groups (10-, 13-,
   15-, and 20-year-olds) carried out the task while fMRI data were
   acquired. Participants of all ages showed activation in the bilateral
   insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) during rejection of
   unintentional but acceptance of intentional unfair offers. Rejection of
   unintentional unfair offers further involved increasing activation with
   age in the temporoparietal junction and the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex. These findings provide evidence for an early developing
   insula-dACC network involved in detecting personal norm-violations and
   gradually increasing involvement of temporal and prefrontal brain
   regions related to intentionality considerations in social reasoning.
   The results are discussed in light of recent findings on the development
   of the adolescent social brain network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Cultures vary in the extent to which people prefer social hierarchical
   or egalitarian relations between individuals and groups. Here we
   examined the effect of cultural variation in preference for social
   hierarchy on the neural basis of intergroup empathy. Using
   cross-cultural neuroimaging, we measured neural responses while Korean
   and American participants observed scenes of racial ingroup and outgroup
   members in emotional pain. Compared to Caucasian-American participants,
   Korean participants reported experiencing greater empathy and elicited
   stronger activity in the left temporo-parietal junction (L-TPJ), a
   region previously associated with mental state inference, for ingroup
   compared to outgroup members. Furthermore, preferential reactivity
   within this region to the pain of ingroup relative to outgroup members
   was associated with greater preference for social hierarchy and ingroup
   biases in empathy. Together, these results suggest that cultural
   variation in preference for social hierarchy leads to cultural variation
   in ingroup-preferences in empathy, due to increased engagement of brain
   regions associated with representing and inferring the mental states of
   others. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Reward system and temporal pole contributions to affective evaluation
   during a first person shooter video game}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUL 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Violent content in video games evokes many concerns but
   there is little research concerning its rewarding aspects. It was
   demonstrated that playing a video game leads to striatal dopamine
   release. It is unclear, however, which aspects of the game cause this
   reward system activation and if violent content contributes to it. We
   combined functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with individual
   affect measures to address the neuronal correlates of violence in a
   video game.
   Results: Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter
   game (Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror) during fMRI measurement. We
   defined success as eliminating opponents, and failure as being
   eliminated themselves. Affect was measured directly before and after
   game play using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).
   Failure and success events evoked increased activity in visual cortex
   but only failure decreased activity in orbitofrontal cortex and caudate
   nucleus. A negative correlation between negative affect and responses to
   failure was evident in the right temporal pole (rTP).
   Conclusions: The deactivation of the caudate nucleus during failure is
   in accordance with its role in reward-prediction error: it occurred
   whenever subject missed an expected reward (being eliminated rather than
   eliminating the opponent). We found no indication that violence events
   were directly rewarding for the players. We addressed subjective
   evaluations of affect change due to gameplay to study the reward system.
   Subjects reporting greater negative affect after playing the game had
   less rTP activity associated with failure. The rTP may therefore be
   involved in evaluating the failure events in a social context, to
   regulate the players' mood.}},

Abstract = {{Social influence-individuals' tendency to conform to the beliefs and
   attitudes of others-has interested psychologists for decades. However,
   it has traditionally been difficult to distinguish true modification of
   attitudes from mere public compliance with social norms; this study
   addressed this challenge using functional neuroimaging. Participants
   rated the attractiveness of faces and subsequently learned how their
   peers ostensibly rated each face. Participants were then scanned using
   functional MRI while they rated each face a second time. The second
   ratings were influenced by social norms: Participants changed their
   ratings to conform to those of their peers. This social influence was
   accompanied by modulated engagement of two brain regions associated with
   coding subjective value-the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex-a
   finding suggesting that exposure to social norms affected participants'
   neural representations of value assigned to stimuli. These findings
   document the utility of neuroimaging to demonstrate the private
   acceptance of social norms.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with optic ataxia, a deficit in visually guided action,
   paradoxically improve when pantomiming an action towards memorized
   stimuli. Visual form agnosic patient D.F. shows the exact opposite
   pattern of results: although being able to grasp objects in real-time
   she loses grip scaling when grasping an object from memory. Here we
   explored the dissociation between immediate and delayed grasping in a
   patient (F.S.) who after a parietal-occipital stroke presented with
   severe left visual neglect, a loss of awareness of the contralesional
   side of space. Although F.S. had preserved grip scaling even in his
   neglected field, he was markedly impaired when asked to pretend to grasp
   a leftward object from memory. Critically, his deficit cannot be simply
   explained by the absence of continuous on-line visual feedback, as F.S.
   was also able to grasp leftward objects in real-time when vision was
   removed. We suggest that regions surrounding the parietal-occipital
   sulcus, typically damaged in patients with optic ataxia but spared in
   F.S., seem to be essential for real-time actions. On the other hand, our
   data indicates that regions in the ventral visual stream, damaged in D.F
   but intact in F.S., would appear to be necessary but not sufficient for
   memory-guided action. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The anatomic basis of the right face-selective N170 IN acquired

Abstract = {{The N170 waveform is larger over posterior temporal cortex when healthy
   subjects view faces than when they view other objects. Source analyses
   have produced mixed results regarding whether this effect originates in
   the fusiform face area (FFA), lateral occipital cortex, or superior
   temporal sulcus (STS), components of the core face network. In a
   complementary approach, we assessed the face-selectivity of the right
   N170 in five patients with acquired prosopagnosia, who also underwent
   structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We used a
   non-parametric bootstrap procedure to perform single-subject analyses,
   which reliably confirmed N170 face-selectivity in each of 10 control
   subjects. Anterior temporal lesions that spared the core face network
   did not affect the face-selectivity of the N170. A face-selective N170
   was also present in another subject who had lost only the right FFA.
   However, face-selectivity was absent in two patients with lesions that
   eliminated the occipital face area (OFA) and FFA, sparing only the STS.
   Thus while the right FFA is not necessary for the face-selectivity of
   the N170, neither is the STS sufficient. We conclude that the
   face-selective N170 in prosopagnosia requires residual function of at
   least two components of the core face-processing network. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine functional
   anatomy of attention to social (eye gaze) and nonsocial (arrow)
   communicative stimuli in late childhood and in a disorder defined by
   atypical processing of social stimuli, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).
   Children responded to a target word ('LEFT/'RIGHT) in the context of a
   distracting arrow or averted gaze pointing in a direction that was
   congruent, incongruent, or neutral (bar without arrowheads, central
   gaze) relative to the target word. Despite being irrelevant to the
   target task, both arrow and averted gaze facilitated responses
   (Congruent vs. Neutral trials) to the same extent in the two groups and
   led to interference (Incongruent vs. Congruent trials), which was
   greater from arrows in ASD than control children. ha the brain,
   interaction between group and distracter-domain was observed in
   frontal-temporal regions during facilitation and frontal-striatal
   regions during interference. During facilitation, regions associated
   with attention to gaze in control children (left superior temporal
   sulcus, premotor) were associated with attention to arrows in ASD
   children; gaze was associated with medial temporal involvement in ASD
   children. During interference, regions associated with arrows in control
   children (anterior cingulate, right caudate) were activated in response
   to gaze in ASD children; further, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a
   region not observed in control children, was activated during
   gaze-interference in ASD children. Thus, functional anatomy was atypical
   in ASD children during spontaneous processing of social and nonsocial
   communicative cues.}},

Abstract = {{To understand how the human amygdala contributes to associative

   subregions. However, major limitations in the techniques used for the
   acquisition and analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   data have hitherto precluded segregation of function with the amygdala

   region-of-interest-based normalization method to differentiate
   functionally the contributions of distinct subregions within the human
   amygdala during two different types of instrumental conditioning: reward
   and avoidance learning. Through the application of a
   computational-model-based analysis, we found evidence for a dissociation
   between the contributions of the basolateral and centromedial complexes
   in the representation of specific computational signals during learning,
   with the basolateral complex contributing more to reward learning, and
   the centromedial complex more to avoidance learning. These results
   provide unique insights into the computations being implemented within
   fine-grained amygdala circuits in the human brain.}},

Abstract = {{Research has shown that social exclusion has devastating psychological,
   physiological, and behavioral consequences. However, little is known
   about possible ways to shield individuals from the detrimental effects
   of social exclusion. The present study, in which participants were
   excluded during a ball-tossing game, examined whether (reminders of)
   secure attachment relationships could attenuate neurophysiological pain-
   and stress-related responses to social exclusion. Social exclusion was
   associated with activation in brain areas implicated in the regulation
   and experience of social distress, including areas in the lateral and
   medial prefrontal cortex, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and
   hypothalamus. However, less activation in these areas was found to the
   extent that participants felt more securely attached to their attachment
   figure. Moreover, the psychological presence (i.e., salience) of an
   attachment figure attenuated hypothalamus activation during episodes of
   social exclusion, thereby providing insight into the neural mechanisms
   by which attachment relationships may help in coping with social stress.

Title = {{An fMRI study of whispering: The role of human evolution in

Journal = {{MEDICAL HYPOTHESES}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{112-115}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Humans are the only species known to use whispering for communication,
   and humans are also the only species known to suffer from functional
   (psychological) aphonia, a condition in which only whispered and not
   vocalized speech can be produced. Thus, whispering is uniquely a human
   function and psychological aphonia is uniquely a human dysfunction; both
   can be considered to result from human evolution. We hypothesize that
   the human brain has developed one or more identifiable switching
   mechanisms that overlay whispering onto the mechanisms of normal speech
   production. Thus, for whispering the speech production system operates
   as for normal speech production, but the switch to whispering activates
   the laryngeal abductor muscle (and possibly the inferior pharyngeal
   constrictor) so that the larynx does not completely adduct and
   turbulence noise is produced at the larynx. We hypothesize that
   psychological aphonia results from involuntary or subconscious
   activation of this switching mechanism. Preliminary research leads us to
   hypothesize that there are two switching mechanisms. This research used
   functional magnetic-resonance imaging to contrast brain activity for
   both normal speech and whispering (versus silence) for normally phonic
   subjects in an imagined social situation. One pattern of results
   involved a decrease of overall activity for whispering, with possible
   activation of the corpus callosum, and possible crossover of the main
   locus of activation from the dominant to the nondominant side. The other
   involved increased overall activity for whispering versus normal voice,
   accompanied by an increase of activity in the frontal cortex. More
   participants exhibited the former pattern than the latter one. These
   results may be related to the fact that there are actually two types of
   psychological aphonia, one that occurs after bouts of severe coughing
   associated with lower-respiratory disorders and the other due to purely
   psychological factors. We hypothesize that these are associated with the
   two different switching mechanisms, an upper one associated with the
   conscious brain and a lower one associated with more basic functions
   such as protecting the vocal folds. Understanding brain mechanisms for
   voluntary whispering and relating them to the occurrence of dysphonia
   has obvious implications for improving clinical assessment and treatment
   of aphonia, and would also contribute to improved understanding of human
   function in general. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Visual masking provides several key advantages for exploring the

   control over timing at the millisecond level, there are several
   well-supported theories of the underlying neurobiology of visual

   provide an overview of the visual masking impairment schizophrenia,
   including the relevant theoretical mechanisms for masking impairment. We
   will discuss its relationship to clinical symptoms, antipsychotic
   medications, diagnostic specificity, and presence in at-risk
   populations. As part of this overview, we will cover the neural
   correlates of visual masking based on recent findings from EEG and fMRI.
   Finally, we will suggest a possible mechanism that could explain the

Abstract = {{Impaired understanding of others' sensations and emotions as well as
   abnormal experience of their own emotions and sensations is frequently
   reported in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). It is
   hypothesized that these abnormalities are based on altered connectivity
   within ``shared'' neural networks involved in emotional awareness of
   self and others. The insula is considered a central brain region in a
   network underlying these functions, being located at the transition of
   information about bodily arousal and the physiological state of the body
   to subjective feelings. The present study investigated the intrinsic
   functional connectivity properties of the insula in 14 high-functioning
   participants with ASD (HF-ASD) and 15 typically developing (TD)
   participants in the age range between 12 and 20 years by means of
   ``resting state'' or ``nontask'' functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Essentially, a distinction was made between anterior and posterior
   regions of the insular cortex. The results show a reduced functional
   connectivity in the HF-ASD group, compared with the TD group, between
   anterior as well as posterior insula and specific brain regions involved
   in emotional and sensory processing. It is suggested that functional
   abnormalities in a network involved in emotional and interoceptive
   awareness might be at the basis of altered emotional experiences and
   impaired social abilities in ASD, and that these abnormalities are
   partly based on the intrinsic functional connectivity properties of such
   a network. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 1013-1028, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The putative mirror neuron system may either function as a strict
   feed-forward system or as a dynamic control system. A strict
   feed-forward system would predict that action observation leads to a
   predominantly temporal -> parietal -> premotor flow of information in
   which a visual representation is transformed into motor-programs which
   contribute to action understanding. Instead, a dynamic feedback control
   system would predict that the reverse direction of information flow
   predominates because of a combination of inhibitory forward and
   excitatory inverse models. Here we test which of these conflicting
   predictions best matches the information flow within the putative mirror
   neuron system (pMNS) and between the pMNS and the rest of the brain
   during the observation of comparatively long naturalistic stretches of
   communicative gestures. We used Granger causality to test the dominant
   direction of influence. Our results fit the predictions of the dynamic
   feedback control system: we found predominantly an information flow
   within the pMNS from premotor to parietal and middle temporal cortices.
   This is more pronounced during an active guessing task than while
   passively reviewing the same gestures. In particular, the ventral
   premotor cortex sends significantly more information to other pMNS areas
   than it receives during active guessing than during passive observation.

Abstract = {{Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has been applied successfully to a
   variety of fMRI research questions in healthy participants. The full
   potential of applying MVPA to functional data from patient groups has
   yet to be fully explored. Our goal in this study was to investigate
   whether MVPA might yield a sensitive predictor of patient symptoms. We
   also sought to demonstrate that this benefit can be realized from
   existing datasets, even when they were not designed with MVPA in mind.
   We analyzed data from an fMRI study of the neural basis for face
   processing in individuals with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), who
   often show fusiform gyrus hypoactivation when presented with unfamiliar
   faces, compared to controls. We found reliable correlations between MVPA
   classification performance and standardized measures of symptom severity
   that exceeded those observed using a univariate measure; a relation that
   was robust across variations in ROI definition. A searchlight analysis
   across the ventral temporal lobes identified regions with relationships
   between classification performance and symptom severity that were not
   detected using mean activation. These analyses illustrate that MVPA has
   the potential to act as a sensitive functional biomarker of patient
   severity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{57}},

Pages = {{130-139}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Spatio-temporally organized low-frequency fluctuations (<0.1 Hz),
   observed in BOLD fMRI signal during rest, suggest the existence of
   underlying network dynamics that emerge spontaneously from intrinsic
   brain processes. Furthermore, significant correlations between distinct
   anatomical regions or functional connectivity (FC)-have led to the
   identification of several widely distributed resting-state networks
   (RSNs). This slow dynamics seems to be highly structured by anatomical
   connectivity but the mechanism behind it and its relationship with
   neural activity, particularly in the gamma frequency range, remains
   largely unknown. Indeed, direct measurements of neuronal activity have
   revealed similar large-scale correlations, particularly in slow power
   fluctuations of local field potential gamma frequency range
   oscillations. To address these questions, we investigated neural
   dynamics in a large-scale model of the human brain's neural activity. A
   key ingredient of the model was a structural brain network defined by
   empirically derived long-range brain connectivity together with the
   corresponding conduction delays. A neural population, assumed to
   spontaneously oscillate in the gamma frequency range, was placed at each
   network node. When these oscillatory units are integrated in the
   network, they behave as weakly coupled oscillators. The time-delayed
   interaction between nodes is described by the Kuramoto model of phase
   oscillators, a biologically-based model of coupled oscillatory systems.
   For a realistic setting of axonal conduction speed, we show that
   time-delayed network interaction leads to the emergence of slow neural
   activity fluctuations, whose patterns correlate significantly with the
   empirically measured FC. The best agreement of the simulated FC with the
   empirically measured FC is found for a set of parameters where subsets
   of nodes tend to synchronize although the network is not globally
   synchronized. Inside such clusters, the simulated BOLD signal between
   nodes is found to be correlated, instantiating the empirically observed
   RSNs. Between clusters, patterns of positive and negative correlations
   are observed, as described in experimental studies. These results are
   found to be robust with respect to a biologically plausible range of
   model parameters. In conclusion, our model suggests how resting-state
   neural activity can originate from the interplay between the local
   neural dynamics and the large-scale structure of the brain. (C) 2011

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alcohol dependence has repeatedly been associated with
   impulsive choice, or the inability to choose large delayed rewards over
   smaller, but more immediate rewards. However, the neural basis of
   impulsive choice in alcohol use disorders (AUDs) is not well understood.
   Methods: One hundred fifty-one individuals with a range of alcohol use
   from social drinking to severe alcohol dependence completed a delay
   discounting task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Participants received customized trials designed to ensure an
   approximately equivalent number of immediate responses.
   Results: Delaying gratification recruited regions involved in cognitive
   control, conflict monitoring, and the interpretation of somatic states.
   Individuals with more severe alcohol use problems showed increased
   discounting of delayed rewards and greater activation in several regions
   including supplementary motor area, insula/orbitofrontal cortex,
   inferior frontal gyrus, and the precuneus.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that impulsive choice in alcohol
   dependence is the result of functional anomolies in widely distributed,
   but interconnected brain regions involved in cognitive and emotional
   control. Furthermore, our results suggest that the neural mechanisms of
   impulsive choice in AUD both overlaps with that observed in previous
   studies, and shows that individuals with AUD recruit additional
   mechanisms when making intertemporal choices.}},

Abstract = {{Peer rejection is particularly pervasive among adolescents with autism
   spectrum disorders (ASD). However, how adolescents with ASD differ from
   typically developing adolescents in their responses to peer rejection is
   poorly understood. The goal of the current investigation was to examine
   neural responses to peer exclusion among adolescents with ASD compared
   to typically developing adolescents. Nineteen adolescents with ASD and
   17 typically developing controls underwent fMRI as they were ostensibly
   excluded by peers during an online game called Cyberball. Afterwards,
   participants reported their distress about the exclusion. Compared to
   typically developing adolescents, those with ASD displayed less activity
   in regions previously linked with the distressing aspect of peer
   exclusion, including the subgenual anterior cingulate and anterior
   insula, as well as less activity in regions previously linked with the
   regulation of distress responses during peer exclusion, including the
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. Interestingly,
   however, both groups self-reported equivalent levels of distress. This
   suggests that adolescents with ASD may engage in differential processing
   of social experiences at the neural level, but be equally aware of, and
   concerned about, peer rejection. Overall, these findings contribute new
   insights about how this population may differentially experience
   negative social events in their daily lives. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to explore the neural correlates of two
   characteristic deficits in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs): social
   impairment and restricted, repetitive behavior patterns. To this end, we
   used comparable experiences of social exclusion and rule violation to
   probe potentially atypical neural networks in ASD. In children and
   adolescents with and without ASD, we used the interactive ball-toss game
   (Cyberball) to elicit social exclusion and a comparable game
   (Cybershape) to elicit a non-exclusive rule violation. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we identified group differences in
   brain responses to social exclusion and rule violation. Though both
   groups reported equal distress following exclusion, the right insula and
   ventral anterior cingulate cortex were hypoactive during exclusion in
   children with ASD. In rule violation, right insula and dorsal prefrontal
   cortex were hyperactive in ASD. Right insula showed a dissociation in
   activation; it was hypoactive to social exclusion and hyperactive to
   rule violation in the ASD group. Further probed, different regions of
   right insula were modulated in each game, highlighting differences in
   regional specificity for which subsequent analyses revealed differences
   in patterns of functional connectivity. These results demonstrate
   neurobiological differences in processing social exclusion and rule
   violation in children with ASD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Williams syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder with an intriguing
   behavioral phenotype-hypersociability combined with significant
   non-social fears. Previous studies have demonstrated abnormalities in
   amygdala function in individuals with Williams syndrome compared to
   typically developing controls. However, it remains unclear whether the
   findings are related to the atypical neurodevelopment in Williams
   syndrome, or are also associated with behavioral traits at the extreme
   end of a normal continuum. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to compare amygdala blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD)
   responses to non-social and social images in individuals with Williams
   syndrome compared to either individuals with inhibited temperament (high
   non-social fear) or individuals with uninhibited temperament (high
   sociability). Individuals with Williams syndrome had larger amygdala
   BOLD responses when viewing the non-social fear images than the
   inhibited temperament control group. In contrast, when viewing both fear
   and neutral social images, individuals with Williams syndrome did not
   show smaller amygdala BOLD responses relative to the uninhibited
   temperament control group, but instead had amygdala responses
   proportionate to their sociability. These results suggest heightened
   amygdala response to non-social fear images is characteristic of WS,
   whereas variability in amygdala response to social fear images is
   proportionate to, and might be explained by, levels of trait
   sociability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to gauge social interactions is crucial in the assessment of
   others' intentions. Factors such as facial expressions and body language
   affect our decisions in personal and professional life alike (1). These
   ``friend or foe{''} judgements are often based on first impressions,
   which in turn may affect our decisions to ``approach or avoid{''}.
   Previous studies investigating the neural correlates of social cognition
   tended to use static facial stimuli (2). Here, we illustrate an
   experimental design in which whole-body animated characters were used in
   conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   recordings. Fifteen participants were presented with short movie-clips
   of guest-host interactions in a business setting, while fMRI data were
   recorded; at the end of each movie, participants also provided ratings
   of the host behaviour. This design mimics more closely real-life
   situations, and hence may contribute to better understanding of the
   neural mechanisms of social interactions in healthy behaviour, and to
   gaining insight into possible causes of deficits in social behaviour in
   such clinical conditions as social anxiety and autism}},

Abstract = {{Human memory is strikingly susceptible to social influences, yet we know
   little about the underlying mechanisms. We examined how socially induced
   memory errors are generated in the brain by studying the memory of
   individuals exposed to recollections of others. Participants exhibited a
   strong tendency to conform to erroneous recollections of the group,
   producing both long-lasting and temporary errors, even when their
   initial memory was strong and accurate. Functional brain imaging
   revealed that social influence modified the neuronal representation of
   memory. Specifically, a particular brain signature of enhanced amygdala
   activity and enhanced amygdala-hippocampus connectivity predicted
   long-lasting but not temporary memory alterations. Our findings reveal
   how social manipulation can alter memory and extend the known functions
   of the amygdala to encompass socially mediated memory distortions.}},

Title = {{A novel functional brain imaging endophenotype of autism: the neural
   response to facial expression of emotion}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Siblings of individuals with autism have over 20 times the population
   risk of autism. Evidence of comparable, but less marked, cognitive and
   social communication deficits in siblings suggests a role for these
   traits in the search for biomarkers of familial risk. However, no
   neuroimaging biomarkers of familial risk have been identified to date.
   Here we show, for the first time, that the neural response to facial
   expression of emotion differs between unaffected siblings and healthy
   controls with no family history of autism. Strikingly, the functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to happy versus neutral faces
   was significantly reduced in unaffected siblings compared with controls
   within a number of brain areas implicated in empathy and face
   processing. The response in unaffected siblings did not differ
   significantly from the response in autism. Furthermore, investigation of
   the response to faces versus fixation crosses suggested that, within the
   context of this study, an atypical response specifically to happy faces,
   rather than to faces in general, accounts for the observed sibling
   versus controls difference and is a clear biomarker of familial risk.
   Our findings suggest that an atypical implicit response to facial
   expression of emotion may form the basis of impaired emotional
   reactivity in autism and in the broader autism phenotype in relatives.
   These results demonstrate that the fMRI response to facial expression of
   emotion is a candidate neuroimaging endophenotype for autism, and may
   offer far-reaching insights into the etiology of autism.}},

Volume = {{70}},

Pages = {{81-87}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Schizophrenia is characterized by impaired social cognition,
   including emotion processing. Behavioral studies have reported impaired
   performance on various emotion processing tasks, and imaging studies in
   patients have observed aberrant activity within the underlying neural
   circuitry. Also, subjects at increased genetic risk of developing
   schizophrenia, including unaffected siblings of patients, show
   behavioral impairments in emotion processing. It is unclear, however,
   whether and how the underlying neural system is disrupted in these
   subjects. In this study, we investigated whether siblings of patients
   with schizophrenia show abnormal brain activation during basic emotion
   processing.
   Methods: Brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging in 24 unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia and 25
   healthy control subjects while they viewed and rated neutral, positive,
   and negative pictures. None of the subjects had a psychiatric disorder,
   and the two groups did not differ in age, gender, or level of own,
   paternal, or maternal education.
   Results: Compared with control subjects, siblings showed increased
   activity within the amygdala, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex,
   posterior and anterior cingulate cortex, and middle temporal gyrus in
   response to emotionally arousing pictures relative to neutral pictures.
   No activation differences between the groups were found during the
   neutral stimuli, indicating that the observed hyperactivity is likely
   caused by abnormal emotion processing rather than impaired
   visuoattentional processing.
   Conclusions: Our findings of hyperactivity in siblings during emotion
   processing suggest that functional abnormalities within the neural
   circuitry of emotion processing are related to the genetic risk for
   developing schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that certain types of figurative language, such
   as conventional metaphors or idioms, may have a left hemisphere
   processing advantage or are processed similarly in both hemispheres.
   Sarcasm, however, is likely processed differently than other types of
   figurative language in the hemispheres because readers often need to
   construct a novel interpretation of sarcastic text to successfully
   understand the text's sarcastic meaning. To investigate how the
   hemispheres process sarcasm during text comprehension, participants in
   the current study read sarcastic, literal, and neutral texts and made
   lexical decisions to related target words presented to either the left
   visual field-right hemisphere or the right visual field-left hemisphere.
   Facilitation for sarcastic texts was greater in the right hemisphere
   than the left hemisphere. In addition, facilitation was greater for
   literal texts than sarcastic texts in the left hemisphere. These
   findings suggest that the right hemisphere may play a unique role when
   readers encounter sarcasm during text comprehension. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Brain activity was recorded while participants engaged in a difficult
   visual search task for a target defined by the spatial configuration of
   its component elements. The search displays were segmented by time (a
   preview then a search display), by motion, or were un-segmented. A
   preparatory network showed activity to the preview display, in the time
   but not in the motion segmentation condition. A region of the precuneus
   showed (i) higher activation when displays were segmented by time or by
   motion, and (ii) correlated activity with larger segmentation benefits
   behaviorally, regardless of the cue. Additionally, the results revealed
   that success in temporal segmentation was correlated with reduced
   activation in early visual areas, including V1. The results depict
   partially overlapping brain networks for segmentation in search by time
   and motion, with both cue-independent and cue-specific mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Regions of the occipital and temporal lobes, including a region in the
   fusiform gyrus (FG), have been proposed to constitute a ``core{''}
   visual representation system for faces, in part because they show face
   selectivity and face repetition suppression. But recent fMRI studies of
   developmental prosopagnosics (DPs) raise questions about whether these
   measures relate to face processing skills. Although DPs manifest
   deficient face processing, most studies to date have not shown
   unequivocal reductions of functional responses in the proposed core
   regions. We scanned 15 DPs and 15 non-DP control participants with fMRI
   while employing factor analysis to derive behavioral components related
   to face identification or other processes. Repetition suppression
   specific to facial identities in FG or to expression in FG and STS did
   not show compelling relationships with face identification ability.
   However, we identified robust relationships between face selectivity and
   face identification ability in FG across our sample for several
   convergent measures, including voxel-wise statistical parametric
   mapping, peak face selectivity in individually defined ``fusiform face
   areas{''} (FFAs), and anatomical extents (cluster sizes) of those FFAs.
   None of these measures showed associations with behavioral expression or
   object recognition ability. As a group, DPs had reduced face-selective
   responses in bilateral FFA when compared with non-DPs. Individual DPs
   were also more likely than non-DPs to lack expected face-selective
   activity in core regions. These findings associate individual
   differences in face processing ability with selectivity in core face
   processing regions. This confirms that face selectivity can provide a
   valid marker for neural mechanisms that contribute to face
   identification ability.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental question for social cognitive neuroscience is how and
   where in the brain the identities and actions of others are represented.
   Here we present a replication and extension of a study by Kable and
   Chatterjee {[}Kable, J. W., \& Chatterjee, A. Specificity of action
   representations in the lateral occipito-temporal cortex. Journal of
   Cognitive Neuroscience, 18, 14981517, 2006] examining the role of
   occipito-temporal cortex in these processes. We presented full-cue
   movies of actors performing whole-body actions and used fMRI to test for
   action- and identity-specific adaptation effects. We examined a series
   of functionally defined regions, including the extrastriate and fusiform
   body areas, the fusiform face area, the parahippocampal place area, the
   lateral occipital complex, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus,
   and motion-selective area hMT+. These regions were analyzed with both
   standard univariate measures as well as multivoxel pattern analyses.
   Additionally, we performed whole-brain tests for significant adaptation
   effects. We found significant action-specific adaptation in many areas,
   but no evidence for identity-specific adaptation. We argue that this
   finding could be explained by differences in the familiarity of the
   stimuli presented: The actions shown were familiar but the actors
   performing the actions were unfamiliar. However, in contrast to previous
   findings, we found that the action adaptation effect could not be
   conclusively tied to specific functionally defined regions. Instead, our
   results suggest that the adaptation to previously seen actions across
   identities is a widespread effect, evident across lateral and ventral
   occipito-temporal cortex.}},

Title = {{Differential Involvement of Somatosensory and Interoceptive Cortices

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggested that the observation of other individuals'
   somatosensory experiences also activates brain circuits processing one's
   own somatosensory experiences. However, it is unclear whether cortical
   regions involved with the elementary stages of touch processing are also
   involved in the automatic coding of the affective consequences of
   observed touch and to which extent they show overlapping activation for
   somatosensory experiences of self and others. In order to investigate
   these issues, in the present fMRI study, healthy participants either
   experienced touch or watched videos depicting other individuals'
   inanimate and animate/social touch experiences. Essentially, a
   distinction can be made between exteroceptive and interoceptive
   components of touch processing, involved with physical stimulus
   characteristics and internal feeling states, respectively. Consistent
   with this distinction, a specific negative modulation was found in the
   posterior insula by the mere visual perception of other individuals'
   social or affective cutaneous experiences, compared to neutral inanimate
   touch. On the other hand, activation in secondary somatosensory and
   posterior superior temporal regions, strongest for the most intense
   stimuli, seemed more dependent on the observed physical stimulus
   characteristics. In contrast to the detected vicarious activation in
   somatosensory regions, opposite activation patterns for the experience
   (positive modulation) and observation (negative modulation) of touch
   suggest that the posterior insula does not reflect a shared
   representation of self and others' experiences. Embedded in a
   distributed network of brain regions underpinning a sense of the bodily
   self, the posterior insula rather appears to differentiate between self
   and other conditions when affective experiences are implicated.}},

Abstract = {{With the advance of novel brain imaging technology more correlations
   between complex human properties and the neuronal substrate can be
   assessed. However, thus far, not many well-validated paradigms exist
   that would allow for a systematic and quantitative exploration of these
   phenomena. For instance, despite the rapid technological advances in the
   domain of mixed and virtual reality systems, a fundamental issue remains
   how we can define and quantify ``presence{''}. A standard approach has
   been to use questionnaires and self-report measures. However, it has
   been well established that humans' capabilities to access and
   externalize their internal states are limited. Hence, we have
   investigated the question whether other less subjective measures can be
   devised that can corroborate subjective self-reports on presence. In
   particular, we have developed a quantitative recollection task that
   assesses the ability of human subjects (N = 40) to recollect the factual
   structure and organization of a structured and fully controlled
   experience in a human accessible mixed reality space, the eXperience
   Induction Machine (XIM). In this structured experience - referred to as
   the ``Autodemo{''} - a virtual guide explains the key elements and
   properties of XIM while the user is able to freely move around in the
   space. To evaluate the users' experience and the amount of factual
   information retained about the Autodemo, we used the ITC-SOPI
   questionnaire and a recall test specifically designed for the Autodemo.
   We found significant correlations between spatial presence and
   engagement factors of ITC-SOPI and recall performance. Moreover we
   observed an interaction with the participants' gender. Our results show
   that we can assess correlates of ``presence{''} by focusing on other
   dependent measures such as those related to memory and performance.
   Additionally, our work exemplifies how virtual and mixed reality systems
   provide new ways to address fundamental questions in psychology and
   cognitive neuroscience. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   behavioral and evoked cortical processing of empathy for pain}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{1398}},

Abstract = {{Current research on empathy for pain emphasizes the overlap in the
   neural response between the first-hand experience of pain and its
   perception in others. However, recent studies suggest that the
   perception of the pain of others may reflect the processing of a threat
   or negative arousal rather than an automatic pro-social response. It can
   thus be suggested that pain processing of other-related, but not
   self-related, information could imply danger rather than empathy, due to
   the possible threat represented in the expressions of others (especially
   if associated with pain stimuli). To test this hypothesis, two
   experiments considering subliminal stimuli were designed. In Experiment
   1, neutral and semantic pain expressions previously primed with own or
   other faces were presented to participants. When other-face priming was
   used, only the detection of semantic pain expressions was facilitated.
   In Experiment 2, pictures with pain and neutral scenarios previously
   used in ERP and fMRI research were used in a categorization task. Those
   pictures were primed with own or other faces following the same
   procedure as in Experiment 1 while ERPs were recorded. Early (N1) and
   late (P3) cortical responses between pain and no-pain were modulated
   only in the other-face priming condition. These results support the
   threat value of pain hypothesis and suggest the necessity for the
   inclusion of own-versus other-related information in future empathy for
   pain research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In accordance with influential models proposing prioritized processing

   this effect was absent during the visual task. Thus, our results show a
   limitation of the automaticity of the activation of the amygdala and
   auditory cortex to angry prosody. The activation of these areas to
   threat-related voices depends on modality-specific attention.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expression of affective states plays a key role in social
   interactions. Interestingly, however, individuals differ substantially
   in their level of expressiveness, ranging from high expressive to stoic
   individuals. Here, we investigate which brain mechanisms underlie the
   regulation of facial expressiveness to acute pain. Facial responses,
   pain ratings, and brain activity (BOLD-fMRI) evoked by noxious heat and
   warm (control) stimuli were recorded in 34 human volunteers with
   different degrees of facial expressiveness. Within-subject and
   between-subject variations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
   responses were examined specifically in relation to facial responses.
   Pain expression was inversely related to frontostriatal activity,
   consistent with a role in downregulating facial displays. More detailed
   analyses of the peak activity in medial prefrontal cortex revealed
   negative BOLD responses to thermal stimuli, an effect generally
   associated with the default mode network. Given that this negative BOLD
   response was weaker in low expressive individuals during pain, it could
   reflect stronger engagement in, or reduced disengagement from,
   self-reflective processes in stoic individuals. The occurrence of facial
   expressions during pain was coupled with stronger primary motor activity
   in the face area and-interestingly-in areas involved in pain processing.
   In conclusion, these results indicate that spontaneous pain expression
   reflects activity within nociceptive pathways while stoicism involves
   the active suppression of expression, a manifestation of learned display
   rules governing emotional communication and possibly related to an
   increased self-reflective or introspective focus.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to inverting (fitting) models of
   coupled dynamical systems based on state-of-the-art (cubature) Kalman
   filtering. Crucially, this inversion furnishes posterior estimates of
   both the hidden states and parameters of a system, including any unknown
   exogenous input. Because the underlying generative model is formulated
   in continuous time (with a discrete observation process) it can be
   applied to a wide variety of models specified with either ordinary or
   stochastic differential equations. These are an important class of
   models that are particularly appropriate for biological time-series,
   where the underlying system is specified in terms of kinetics or
   dynamics (i.e., dynamic causal models). We provide comparative
   evaluations with generalized Bayesian filtering (dynamic expectation
   maximization) and demonstrate marked improvements in accuracy and
   computational efficiency. We compare the schemes using a series of
   difficult (nonlinear) toy examples and conclude with a special focus on
   hemodynamic models of evoked brain responses in fMRI. Our scheme
   promises to provide a significant advance in characterizing the
   functional architectures of distributed neuronal systems, even in the
   absence of known exogenous (experimental) input; e.g., resting state
   fMRI studies and spontaneous fluctuations in electrophysiological
   studies. Importantly, unlike current Bayesian filters (e.g. DEM), our
   scheme provides estimates of time-varying parameters, which we will
   exploit in future work on the adaptation and enabling of connections in
   the brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have identified DAAO as a probable susceptibility gene
   for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. However, little is known about
   how this gene affects brain function to increase vulnerability to these
   disorders. We examined the impact of DAAO genotype (rs3918346) on brain
   function in patients with schizophrenia, patients with bipolar I
   disorder and healthy controls. We tested the hypothesis that a variation
   in DAAO genotype would be associated with altered prefrontal function
   and altered functional connectivity in schizophrenia and bipolar
   disorder. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain
   responses during a verbal fluency task in a total of 121 subjects
   comprising 40 patients with schizophrenia, 33 patients with bipolar
   disorder and 48 healthy volunteers. We then used statistical parametric
   mapping (SPM) and psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analyses to
   estimate the main effects of diagnostic group, the main effect of
   genotype, and their interaction on brain activation and on functional
   connectivity. Inferences were made at p < 0.05, after correction for
   multiple comparisons across the whole brain. In the schizophrenia group
   relative to the control group, patients with one or two copies of the T
   allele showed lower deactivation in the left precuneus and greater
   activation in the right posterior cingulate gyrus than patients with two
   copies of the C allele. This diagnosis x genotype interaction was
   associated with differences in the functional connectivity of these two
   regions with other cortical and subcortical areas. In contrast, there
   were no significant effects of diagnosis or of genotype in comparisons
   involving bipolar patients. Our results suggest that genetic variation
   in DAAO has a significant impact on both regional activation and
   functional connectivity, and provide evidence for a diagnosis-dependent
   pattern of gene action. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have identified multiple face-selective regions in
   human cortex but the functional division of labor between these regions
   is not yet clear. A central hypothesis, with some empirical support, is
   that face-selective regions in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are
   particularly responsive to dynamic information in faces, whereas the
   fusiform face area (FFA) computes the static or invariant properties of
   faces. Here we directly tested this hypothesis by measuring the
   magnitude of response in each region to both dynamic and static stimuli.
   Consistent with the hypothesis, we found that the response to movies of
   faces was not significantly different from the response to static images
   of faces from these same movies in the right FFA and right occipital
   face area (OFA). By contrast the face-selective region in the right
   posterior STS (pSTS) responded nearly three times as strongly to dynamic
   faces as to static faces, and a face-selective region in the right
   anterior STS (aSTS) responded to dynamic faces only. Both of these
   regions also responded more strongly to moving faces than to moving
   bodies, indicating that they are preferentially engaged in processing
   dynamic information from faces, not in more general processing of any
   dynamic social stimuli. The response to dynamic and static faces was not
   significantly different in a third face-selective region in the
   posterior continuation of the STS (pcSTS). The strong selectivity of
   face-selective regions in the pSTS and aSTS, but not the FFA, OFA or
   pcSTS, for dynamic face information demonstrates a clear functional
   dissociation between different face-selective regions, and provides
   further clues into their function. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Taking the perspective of somebody else (Theory of Mind; ToM) is an
   essential human ability depending on a large cerebral network comprising
   prefrontal and temporo-parietal regions. Recently, ToM was suggested to
   consist of two processes: (1) self-perspective inhibition and (2) belief
   reasoning. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that self-perspective
   inhibition may build upon basic motor response inhibition. This study
   tested both hypotheses for the first time using functional Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (fMRI), through administering both a ToM and a
   stop-signal paradigm in the same subjects. Both self-perspective and
   motor response inhibition yielded bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)
   activation, suggesting a common inhibitory mechanism, while belief
   reasoning was mediated by the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). Thus, we provide neurobiological
   evidence for a subdivision of ToM into self-perspective inhibition and
   belief reasoning. Furthermore, evidence for partially shared neural
   mechanisms for inhibition in complex social situations and basic motor
   response inhibition was found. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 2}},
Abstract = {{Much of the work on face-selective neural activity has focused on
   posterior, ventral areas of the human and non-human primate brain.
   However, electrophysiological and fMRI studies have identified face
   responses in the prefrontal cortex. Here we used fMRI to characterize
   these responses in the human prefrontal cortex compared with face
   selectivity in posterior ventral region. We examined a region at the
   junction of the right inferior frontal sulcus and the precentral sulcus
   (right inferior frontal junction or rIFJ) that responds more to faces
   than to several other object categories. We find that the rIFJ and the
   right fusiform face area (rFFA) are broadly similar in their responses
   to whole faces, headless bodies, tools, and scenes. Strikingly, however,
   while the rFFA preferentially responds to the whole face, the rIFJ
   response to faces appears to be driven primarily by the eyes. This
   dissociation provides clues to the functional role of the rIFJ face
   response. We speculate on this role with reference to emotion
   perception, gaze perception, and to behavioral relevance more generally.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroticism and extraversion are proposed personality dimensions for
   individual emotion processing. Neuroticism is correlated with depression
   and anxiety disorders, implicating a common neurobiological basis.
   Extraversion is rather inversely correlated with anxiety and depression.
   We examined neural correlates of personality in relation to
   depressiveness and anxiety in healthy adult subjects with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging during the cued anticipation of emotional
   stimuli. Distributed particularly prefrontal but also other cortical
   regions and the thalamus were associated with extraversion.
   Parieto-occipital and temporal regions and subcortically the caudate
   were correlated with neuroticism and affective measures.
   Neuroticism-related regions were partially cross-correlated with anxiety
   and depression and vice versa. Extraversion-related activity was not
   correlated with the other measures. The neural correlates of
   extraversion compared with those of neuroticism and affective measures
   fit with concepts of different neurobiological bases of the personality
   dimensions and point at predispositions for affective disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep loss, widespread in today's society and associated with a number
   of clinical conditions, has a detrimental effect on a variety of
   cognitive domains including attention. This study examined the sequelae
   of sleep deprivation upon BOLD fMRI activation during divided attention.
   Twelve healthy males completed two randomized sessions; one after 27 h
   of sleep deprivation and one after a normal night of sleep. During each
   session, BOLD fMRI was measured while subjects completed a cross-modal
   divided attention task (visual and auditory). After normal sleep,
   increased BOLD activation was observed bilaterally in the superior
   frontal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobe during divided attention
   performance. Subjects reported feeling significantly more sleepy in the
   sleep deprivation session, and there was a trend towards poorer divided
   attention task performance. Sleep deprivation led to a down regulation
   of activation in the left superior frontal gyrus, possibly reflecting an
   attenuation of top-down control mechanisms on the attentional system.
   These findings have implications for understanding the neural correlates
   of divided attention and the neurofunctional changes that occur in
   individuals who are sleep deprived.}},

Abstract = {{It is assumed that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have
   specificities for self-face recognition, which is known to be a basic
   cognitive ability for social development. In the present study, we
   investigated neurological substrates and potentially influential factors
   for self-face recognition of ASD patients using near-infrared
   spectroscopy (NIRS). The subjects were 11 healthy adult men, 13 normally
   developing boys, and 10 boys with ASD. Their hemodynamic activities in
   the frontal area and their scanning strategies (eye-movement) were
   examined during self-face recognition. Other factors such as ASD
   severities and self-consciousness were also evaluated by parents and
   patients, respectively. Oxygenated hemoglobin levels were higher in the
   regions corresponding to the right inferior frontal gyrus than in those
   corresponding to the left inferior frontal gyrus. In two groups of
   children these activities reflected ASD severities, such that the more
   serious ASD characteristics corresponded with lower activity levels.
   Moreover, higher levels of public self-consciousness intensified the
   activities, which were not influenced by the scanning strategies. These
   findings suggest that dysfunction in the right inferior frontal gyrus
   areas responsible for self-face recognition is one of the crucial neural
   substrates underlying ASD characteristics, which could potentially be
   used to evaluate psychological aspects such as public
   self-consciousness. (C) 2010 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Recognition and processing of emotional facial expression are crucial
   for social behavior and employ higher-order cognitive and visual working
   processes. In neuropsychiatric disorders, impaired emotion recognition
   most frequently concerned three specific emotions, i.e., anger, fear,
   and disgust. As incorrect processing of (neutral) facial stimuli per se
   might also underlie deficits in the recognition of emotional facial
   expressions, we aimed to assess all these aspects in one experiment. We
   therefore report here a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   paradigm for parallel assessment of the neural correlates of both the
   recognition of neutral faces and the three clinically most relevant
   emotions for future use in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.
   FMRI analyses were expanded through comparisons of the emotional
   conditions with each other. The differential insights resulting from
   these two analyses strategies are compared and discussed. 30 healthy
   participants (21 F/9 M; age 36.3 +/- 14.3, 17-66 years) underwent fMRI
   and behavioral testing for non-emotional and emotional face recognition.
   Recognition of neutral faces elicited activation in the fusiforrn gyri.
   Processing angry faces led to activation in left middle and superior
   frontal gyri and the anterior cingulate cortex. There was considerable
   heterogeneity regarding the fear versus neutral contrast, resulting in
   null effects for this contrast. Upon recognition of disgust, activation
   was noted in bilateral occipital, in the fronto-orbital cortex and in
   the insula. Analyzing contrasts between emotional conditions showed
   similar results (to those of contrasting with reference conditions) for
   separated emotional network patterns. We demonstrate here that our
   paradigm reproduces single aspects of separate previous studies across a
   cohort of healthy subjects, irrespective of age. Our approach might
   prove useful in future studies of patients with neurologic disorders
   with potential effect on emotion recognition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Activation in frontopolar cortex (FPC; BA 10) has been associated both
   with attending to mental states and with integrating multiple mental
   relations. However, few previous studies have manipulated both of these
   cognitive processes, precluding a clear functional distinction among
   regions within FPC. To address this issue, we developed an fMRI task
   that combined mentalizing and relational integration processes.
   Participants saw blocks of single words and performed one of three
   judgments: how pleasant or unpleasant they found each word (Self
   condition), how a specific friend would evaluate the pleasantness of the
   word (Other condition), or the difference between their own pleasantness
   judgment and that of their friend (Relational condition). We found that
   medial FPC was modulated by Other relative to Self judgments, consistent
   with a role in mentalizing. Lateral FPC was significantly activated
   during Relational compared to Self judgements, suggesting that this
   region is particularly involved in relational integration. The results
   point to a strong functional dissociation between medial and lateral
   FPC. In addition, the data demonstrate a role for lateral FPC in the
   social domain, provided that the task requires the integration of one's
   preferences with those of others.}},

Abstract = {{A functional variant of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) has
   been associated with increased risk for major depression in the context
   of stress. In attempting to understand the mechanisms underlying this
   relation, we tested the hypothesis that 5-HTTLPR genotype affects the
   speed with which amygdala is recruited during emotional processing in
   young girls with no history of psychiatric disorder. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to compare the rise time to peak amygdala
   activation in 5-HTTLPR short-allele carriers and long-allele homozygotes
   during enhancement of sad mood. Relative to long-allele homozygotes,
   participants with at least one copy of the 5-HTTLPR short allele showed
   both stronger and earlier activation in left amygdala as they increased
   a sad mood state. Individuals carrying the short allele appear to
   exhibit a neural `readiness' to engage and enhance negative affect.
   Future research should examine how exposure to negative life events and
   more chronic sadness modify the time course of amygdala activity during
   the experience of negative emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Prior research has shown that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays an
   important role in the representation of the evaluation of stimuli,
   regardless of stimulus modality. Based on these findings, researchers
   have proposed that the OFC serves a common currency function, allowing
   for the direct comparison of different types of perceptual stimuli (e.g.
   food, drink, money). The present study was designed to extend this
   research and investigate whether these same regions of OFC that have
   been identified in previous research are involved in evaluating imagined
   stimuli. Specifically, we asked participants to draw on prior
   attitudinal knowledge to generate internal representations of liked and
   disliked exemplars from different categories during functional magnetic

Abstract = {{Static pictures of emotional facial expressions have been found to
   activate brain structures involved in the processing of emotional
   stimuli. However, in everyday live, emotional expressions are changing
   rapidly, and the processing of the onset vs the offset of the very same
   emotional expression might rely on different brain networks, presumably
   leading to different behavioral and physiological reactions (e.g.
   approach or avoidance). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   this was examined by presenting video clips depicting onsets and offsets
   of happy and angry facial expressions. Subjective valence and threat
   ratings clearly depended on the direction of change. Blood oxygen level
   dependent responses indicate both reward- and threat-related activations
   for the offset of angry expressions. Comparing onsets and offsets, angry
   offsets were associated with stronger ventral striatum activation than
   angry onsets. Additionally, the offset of happy and the onset of angry
   expressions showed strong common activity in the lateral orbitofrontal
   cortex bilaterally, the left amygdala and the left insula, whereas the
   onset of happy and the offset of angry expressions induced significant
   activation in the left dorsal striatum. In sum, the results confirm
   different activity in motivation-related brain areas in response to the
   onset and offset of the same emotional expression and highlight the
   importance of temporal characteristics of facial expressions for social
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions can trigger emotions: when we smile we feel happy,
   when we frown we feel sad. However, the mimicry literature also shows
   that we feel happy when our interaction partner behaves the way we do.
   Thus what happens if we express our sadness and we perceive somebody who
   is imitating us? In the current study, participants were presented with
   either happy or sad faces, while expressing one of these emotions
   themselves. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure
   neural responses on trials where the observed emotion was either
   congruent or incongruent with the expressed emotion. Our results
   indicate that being in a congruent emotional state, irrespective of the
   emotion, activates the medial orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex, brain areas that have been associated with positive
   feelings and reward processing. However, incongruent emotional states
   activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as posterior
   superior temporal gyrus/sulcus, both playing a role in conflict
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion theory emphasizes the distinction between social vs non-social
   emotional-processing (E-P) although few functional neuroimaging studies
   have examined whether the neural systems that mediate social vs
   non-social E-P are similar or distinct. The present fMRI study of
   script-driven imagery in 20 women demonstrates that social E-P,
   independent of valence, more strongly recruits brain regions involved in
   social- and self-referential processing, specifically the dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/precuneus, bilateral temporal
   poles, bilateral temporoparietal junction and right amygdala. Functional
   response within brain regions involved in E-P was also significantly
   more pronounced during negatively relative to positively valenced E-P.
   Finally, the effect for social E-P was increased for positive relative
   to negative stimuli in many of these same regions. Future research
   directions for social and affective neuroscience are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have shed light on cortical language organization,
   with findings implicating the left and right temporal lobes in speech
   processing converging to a left-dominant pattern. Findings highlight the
   fact that the state of theoretical language knowledge is ahead of
   current clinical language mapping methods, motivating a rethinking of
   these approaches. The authors used magnetoencephalography and multiple
   tasks in seven candidates for resective epilepsy surgery to investigate
   language organization. The authors scanned 12 control subjects to
   investigate the time course of bilateral receptive speech processes.
   Laterality indices were calculated for left and right hemisphere late
   fields similar to 150 to 400 milliseconds. The authors report that (1)
   in healthy adults, speech processes activated superior temporal regions
   bilaterally converging to a left-dominant pattern, (2) in four of six
   patients, this was reversed, with bilateral processing converging to a
   right-dominant pattern, and (3) in three of four of these patients,
   receptive and expressive language processes were laterally discordant.
   Results provide evidence that receptive and expressive language may have
   divergent hemispheric dominance. Right-sided receptive language
   dominance in epilepsy patients emphasizes the need to assess both
   receptive and expressive language. Findings indicate that it is critical
   to use multiple tasks tapping separable aspects of language function to
   provide sensitive and specific estimates of language localization in
   surgical patients.}},

Abstract = {{Dysfunction of the corticolimbic circuitry has been highlighted in
   social anxiety disorder (SAD) during social stimuli. However, few
   studies have investigated functional connectivity in SAD during the
   resting state, which may improve our understanding of SAD
   pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to investigate whether
   whole-brain functional connectivity might be aberrant in SAD patients,
   and if so, whether these changes are related to the measured clinical
   severity. Seventeen SAD patients and 19 healthy controls participated in
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The brain was first
   divided into 90 paired brain regions and functional connectivity was
   then estimated by temporal correlation between each of these regions.
   Furthermore, connections that were significantly disrupted in SAD
   patients were correlated with clinical severity measured using the
   Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Compared with healthy controls, SAD
   patients showed decreased positive connections within the frontal lobe
   and decreased negative connections between the frontal and occipital
   lobes. In particular, the weaker negative connections between the
   frontal lobe, which mainly involved the right median prefrontal cortex,
   and the occipital lobe had a significant positive correlation with the
   severity of SAD symptoms. The results support the hypothesis that some
   abnormalities of functional connectivity exist in SAD patients, which
   relate to the frontal cortex and occipital cortex. in addition,
   decreased functional connectivity between the frontal and occipital
   lobes and within the frontal lobe might be related to abnormal
   information processing and reflect disturbed neural organization
   resulting in defective social cognition, which could represent an early
   imaging biomarker for SAD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   to target letters (Experiment 1) or colors (Experiment 2) surrounded by
   distractors. When performing their part of the task next to another
   person performing the complementary part of the task, participants
   responded more slowly to stimuli containing flankers that were potential
   targets for their co-actor (incompatible trials), compared to stimuli
   containing identical, compatible, or neutral flankers. This joint
   Flanker effect also occurred when participants merely believed to be
   performing the task with a co-actor (Experiment 3). Furthermore,
   Experiment 4 demonstrated that people form shared task representations

Abstract = {{In social contexts, errors have a special significance and often bear
   consequences for others. Thinking about others and drawing social
   inferences in interpersonal games engages the mentalizing system. We
   used neuroimaging to investigate the differences in brain activations
   between errors that affect only agents themselves and errors that
   additionally influence the payoffs of interaction partners. Activation
   in posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) and bilateral insula was
   increased for all errors, whereas errors that implied consequences for
   others specifically activated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an
   important part of the mentalizing system. The results demonstrate that
   performance monitoring in social contexts involves additional processes
   and brain structures compared with individual performance monitoring
   where errors only have consequences for the person committing them.
   Taking into account how one's behavior may affect others is particularly
   crucial for adapting behavior in interpersonal interactions and joint

Abstract = {{A large body of research reports that perceiving body movements of other
   people activates motor representations in the observer's brain. This
   automatic resonance mechanism appears to be imitative in nature.
   However, action observation does not inevitably lead to symmetrical
   motor facilitation: mirroring the observed movement might be
   disadvantageous for successfully performing joint actions. In two
   experiments, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to
   investigate whether the excitability of the corticospinal system was
   selectively modulated by the social dimension of an observed action. We
   recorded motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from right-hand muscles during
   the observation of an action sequence which, depending on context, might
   or might not elicit a complementary response. The results demonstrate a
   differential motor facilitation depending on action context.
   Specifically, when the context called for a complementary action, the
   excitability pattern reflected the under-threshold activation of a
   complementary action, whereas when the context did not imply acting in a
   complementary manner, the observer's corticospinal activity reflected
   symmetrical motor resonance. We contend that the mechanisms underlying
   action observation are flexible and respond to contextual factors that
   guide the social interaction between individuals beyond emulation.}},

Abstract = {{Coordination of actions according to the request of another person is
   frequently observed in daily life. The purpose of this study is to
   elucidate the neural mechanisms related to the processing of this type
   of interpersonal action coordination by using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). In the first experiment, participants viewed
   movie clips depicting two people (1st and 3rd person) involved in a
   joint-action situation: one person (passive agent) holding two objects
   asked the other person to take one object; the other person (active
   agent) then performing a congruent or incongruent action with regard to
   the request. fMRI results showed that the right inferior frontal gyrus
   (IFG) and right cerebellum were more activated during the observation of
   incongruent actions than that of congruent actions. Greater activation
   in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and the medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were also found in the same contrast after
   small volume correction (SVC). In the second experiment, in which only
   the active person appeared in the movie clip (single-action situation),
   no significant activation in the right IFG and right cerebellum was
   found, although greater activation in the right pSTS and the mPFC was
   found during the observation of the incongruent action than that of the
   congruent action after SVC. Our study suggests that the right IFG, which
   is assumed to be a part of the mirror neuron system, is involved in
   understanding interpersonal action congruency.}},

Abstract = {{Urine washing (UW) consists of depositing urine on the hands and
   vigorously rubbing the body. As urine contains chemical and pheromonal
   cues, UW may convey socially relevant information. Although ritualized
   UW is observed in many New World primates, including capuchin monkeys,
   the functional significance of UW remains unclear. In this experiment,
   we investigated the social signaling hypothesis of UW. Specifically, we
   hypothesized that UW by males conveys socially relevant signals that
   females can detect. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   to test whether adult female capuchins show differential brain
   activation in response to adult male and juvenile male capuchin urine.
   We expected to see changes in activation of structures involved in
   olfactory processing, including the piriform cortex, medial preoptic and
   anterior hypothesis, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum.
   Data were acquired from four adult female capuchin monkeys.
   Presentations of odor stimuli (obtained from unfamiliar males) were made
   during fMRI acquisition using a standard ON-OFF design. All fMRI data
   were spatially normalized to a template and analyzed using the FMRI
   Expert Analysis Tool Version 5.98, part of the FMRIB's Software Library
   (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Whole brain analyses revealed significant
   activations in the inferior temporal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus,
   precuneus, hippocampus, pulvinar, and cerebellum when females were
   presented with the adult male urine. Notably, significantly greater
   signal activation was observed in several regions associated with
   olfactory processing, when subjects were presented with adult male urine
   as compared with urine from juvenile males. Our results indicate that UW
   serves a social communicative function in capuchins, providing support
   for the sexual signaling hypothesis. Am. J. Primatol. 73:578-584, 2011.

Abstract = {{The regulation of emotion is vital for adaptive behavior in a social
   environment. Different strategies may be adopted to achieve successful
   emotion regulation, ranging from attentional control (e.g., distraction)
   to cognitive change (e.g., reappraisal). However, there is only scarce
   evidence comparing the different regulation strategies with respect to
   their neural mechanisms and their effects on emotional experience. We,
   therefore, directly compared reappraisal and distraction in a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study with emotional pictures. In the
   distraction condition participants performed an arithmetic task, while
   they reinterpreted the emotional situation during reappraisal to
   downregulate emotional intensity. Both strategies were successful in
   reducing subjective emotional state ratings and lowered activity in the
   bilateral amygdala. Direct contrasts, however, showed a stronger
   decrease in amygdala activity for distraction when compared with
   reappraisal. While both strategies relied on common control areas in the
   medial and dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex, the
   orbitofrontal cortex was selectively activated for reappraisal. In
   contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate and large clusters in the
   parietal cortex were active in the distraction condition. Functional
   connectivity patterns of the amygdala activation confirmed the roles of
   these specific activations for the 2 emotion regulation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder patients suffer from excessive anxious responses
   in social interaction leading to avoidance behavior and social
   impairment. Although the amygdala has a central role in perception and
   processing of threatening cues, little is known about the involved
   networks and corresponding dysfunctions in social anxiety. Therefore,
   this study aims to investigate the functional connectivity network of
   the amygdala in patients with social anxiety disorder and to identify
   regions that might influence amygdalar reactivity via modulatory
   pathways.
   Ten patients with anxiety disorders (social and/or panic) and 27 healthy
   controls underwent a facial emotion processing task as well as 6-min
   functional MRI at resting state. Individual voxel-wise functional
   connectivity maps were calculated using the amygdala as seed region.
   Group comparisons were done by random-effects analysis in SPM.
   Patients exhibited an amygdala hyperactivation during the emotional task
   and decreased functional coupling of the left amygdala With the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. The
   strength of this functional connectivity showed a negative association
   with the severity of state anxiety. In addition, an exploratory analysis
   revealed further reduced functional connectivity and a marked functional
   separation between the medial orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate
   cortices in the patient group.
   Our results suggest alterations within the amygdalar functional
   connectivity network in social anxiety disorder. Combined with the
   amygdalar hyperactivation our findings corroborate the proposed
   dysfunction of the fronto-amygdalar inhibition in anxiety disorders and
   indicate a modulatory influence of the anterior and posterior cingulate
   cortices on threat perception and processing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper is about inferring or discovering the functional architecture
   of distributed systems using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). We describe
   a scheme that recovers the (dynamic) Bayesian dependency graph
   (connections in a network) using observed network activity. This network
   discovery uses Bayesian model selection to identify the sparsity
   structure (absence of edges or connections) in a graph that best
   explains observed time-series. The implicit adjacency matrix specifies
   the form of the network (e.g., cyclic or acyclic) and its
   graph-theoretical attributes (e.g., degree distribution). The scheme is
   illustrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time
   series to discover functional brain networks. Crucially, it can be
   applied to experimentally evoked responses (activation studies) or
   endogenous activity in task-free (resting state) fMRI studies. Unlike
   conventional approaches to network discovery, DCM permits the analysis
   of directed and cyclic graphs. Furthermore, it eschews (implausible)
   Markovian assumptions about the serial independence of random
   fluctuations. The scheme furnishes a network description of distributed
   activity in the brain that is optimal in the sense of having the
   greatest conditional probability, relative to other networks. The
   networks are characterised in terms of their connectivity or adjacency
   matrices and conditional distributions over the directed (and
   reciprocal) effective connectivity between connected nodes or regions.
   We envisage that this approach will provide a useful complement to
   current analyses of functional connectivity for both activation and
   resting-state studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala plays an important role in emotional and social functions,
   and amygdala dysfunction has been associated with multiple
   neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism, anxiety, and depression.
   Although the amygdala is composed of multiple anatomically and
   functionally distinct nuclei, typical structural magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) sequences are unable to discern them. Thus, functional MRI
   (fMRI) studies typically average the BOLD response over the entire
   structure, which reveals some aspects of amygdala function as a whole
   but does not distinguish the separate roles of specific nuclei in
   humans. We developed a method to segment the human amygdala into its
   four major nuclei using only diffusion-weighted imaging and connectivity
   patterns derived mainly from animal studies. We refer to this new method
   as Tractography-based Segmentation, or TractSeg. The segmentations
   derived from TractSeg were topographically similar to their
   corresponding amygdaloid nuclei, and were validated against a
   high-resolution scan in which the nucleic boundaries were visible. In
   addition, nuclei topography was consistent across subjects. TractSeg
   relies on short scan acquisitions and widely accessible software
   packages, making it attractive for use in healthy populations to explore
   normal amygdala nucleus function, as well as in clinical and pediatric
   populations. Finally, it paves the way for implementing this method in
   other anatomical regions which are also composed of functional subunits
   that are difficult to distinguish with standard structural MRI. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{When we observe someone perform a familiar action, we can usually
   predict what kind of sound that action will produce. Musical actions are
   over-experienced by musicians and not by non-musicians, and thus offer a
   unique way to examine how action expertise affects brain processes when
   the predictability of the produced sound is manipulated. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan 11 drummers and 11 age-
   and gender-matched novices who made judgments on point-light drumming
   movements presented with sound. In Experiment 1, sound was synchronized
   or desynchronized with drumming strikes, while in Experiment 2 sound was
   always synchronized, but the natural covariation between sound intensity
   and velocity of the drumming strike was maintained or eliminated. Prior
   to MRI scanning, each participant completed psychophysical testing to
   identify personal levels of synchronous and asynchronous timing to be
   used in the two fMRI activation tasks. In both experiments, the
   drummers' brain activation was reduced in motor and action
   representation brain regions when sound marched the observed movements,
   and was similar to that of novices when sound was mismatched. This
   reduction in neural activity occurred bilaterally in the cerebellum and
   left parahippocampal gyros in Experiment I. and in the right inferior
   parietal lobule, inferior temporal gyros, middle frontal gyros and
   precentral gyrus in Experiment 2. Our results indicate that brain
   functions in action-sound representation areas are modulated by
   multimodal action expertise. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions of emotion constitute a critical portion of our
   non-verbal social interactions. In addition, the identity of the
   individual displaying this expression is critical to these interactions
   as they embody the context in which these expressions will be
   interpreted. To identify any overlapping and/or unique brain circuitry
   involved in the processing of these two information streams in a
   laboratory setting, participants performed a working memory (WM) task
   (i.e., n-back) in which they were instructed to monitor either the
   expression (EMO) or the identity (ID) of the same set of face stimuli.
   Consistent with previous work, during both the EMO and ID tasks, we
   found a significant increase in activity in dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (DLPFC) supporting its generalized role in WM. Further,
   individuals that showed greater DLPFC activity during both tasks also
   showed increased amygdala activity during the EMO task and increased
   lateral fusiform gyrus activity during the ID task. Importantly, the
   level of activity in these regions significantly correlated with
   performance on the respective tasks. These findings provide support for
   two separate neural circuitries, both involving the DLPFC, supporting
   working memory for the faces and expressions of others. Published by

Abstract = {{Professional musicians constitute a model par excellence for
   understanding experience-dependent plasticity in the human brain,
   particularly in the auditory domain. Their intensive sensorimotor
   experience with musical instruments has been shown to entail plastic
   brain alterations in cortical perceptual and motor maps. It remains an
   important question whether this neuroplasticity might extend beyond
   basic perceptual and motor functions and even shape higher-level
   conceptualizations by which we conceive our physical and social world.
   Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that
   conceptual processing of visually presented musical instruments
   activates auditory association cortex encompassing right posterior
   superior temporal gyms. as well as adjacent areas in the superior
   temporal sulcus and the upper part of middle temporal gyrus (pSTG/MTG)
   only in musicians, but not in musical laypersons. These areas in and
   adjacent to auditory association cortex were not only recruited by
   conceptual processing of musical instruments during visual object
   recognition, but also by auditory perception of real sounds. Hence, the
   unique intensive experience of musicians with musical instruments
   establishes a link between auditory perceptual and conceptual brain
   systems. Experience-driven neuroplasticity in musicians is thus not
   confined to alterations of perceptual and motor maps, but even leads to
   the establishment of higher-level semantic representations for musical
   instruments in and adjacent to auditory association cortex. These
   findings highlight the eminent importance of sensory and motor
   experience for acquiring rich concepts. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Over the last 25 years, ``mindblindness{''} (deficits in representing
   mental states) has been one of the primary explanations behind the
   hallmark social-communication difficulties in autism spectrum conditions
   (ASC). However, highlighting neural systems responsible for
   mindblindness and their relation to variation in social impairments has
   remained elusive. In this study we show that one of the neural systems
   responsible for mindblindness in ASC and its relation to social
   impairments is the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). Twenty-nine
   adult males with ASC and 33 age and IQ-matched Controls were scanned
   with fMRI while making reflective mentalizing or physical judgments
   about themselves or another person. Regions of interest within
   mentalizing circuitry were examined for between-group differences in
   activation during mentalizing about self and other and correlations with
   social symptom severity. RTPJ was the only mentalizing region that
   responded atypically in ASC. In Controls. RTPJ was selectively more
   responsive to mentalizing than physical judgments. This selectivity for
   mentalizing was not apparent in ASC and generalized across both self and
   other. Selectivity of RTPJ for mentalizing was also associated wills the
   degree of reciprocal social impairment in ASC. These results lend
   support to the idea that RTPJ is one important neural system behind
   mindblindness in ASC. Understanding the contribution of RTPJ in
   conjunction with other neural systems responsible for other component
   processes involved in social cognition will be illuminating in fully
   explaining the hallmark social-communication difficulties of autism. (C)

Abstract = {{Stereotypes associated with gender, race, ethnicity and religion are
   powerful forces in human social interactions. Previous neuroimaging and
   neuropsychological studies point to a role of the prefrontal cortex in
   controlling stereotypical responses. Here we used transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) in combination with an Implicit Association Test (IAT)
   to highlight the possible causal role of the left dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the right anterior dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex (aDMPFC) in controlling gender-stereotypical responses. Young
   male and female participants were tested. Our results showed that
   applying TMS over the left DLPFC and the right aDMPFC increased the
   gender-stereotypical bias in male participants compared to when TMS was
   applied to a control site (vertex). This suggests that both the left
   DLPFC and the right aDMPFC play a direct role in stereotyping. Females
   did not show a significant gender bias on the IAT; correspondingly their
   responses were unaffected by TMS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{The Neural Basis of Following Advice}},

Abstract = {{Learning by following explicit advice is fundamental for human cultural
   evolution, yet the neurobiology of adaptive social learning is largely
   unknown. Here, we used simulations to analyze the adaptive value of
   social learning mechanisms, computational modeling of behavioral data to
   describe cognitive mechanisms involved in social learning, and
   model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the
   neurobiological basis of following advice. One-time advice received
   before learning had a sustained influence on people's learning
   processes. This was best explained by social learning mechanisms
   implementing a more positive evaluation of the outcomes from recommended
   options. Computer simulations showed that this ``outcome-bonus{''}
   accumulates more rewards than an alternative mechanism implementing
   higher initial reward expectation for recommended options. fMRI results
   revealed a neural outcome-bonus signal in the septal area and the left
   caudate. This neural signal coded rewards in the absence of advice, and
   crucially, it signaled greater positive rewards for positive and
   negative feedback after recommended rather than after non-recommended
   choices. Hence, our results indicate that following advice is
   intrinsically rewarding. A positive correlation between the model's
   outcome-bonus parameter and amygdala activity after positive feedback
   directly relates the computational model to brain activity. These
   results advance the understanding of social learning by providing a
   neurobiological account for adaptive learning from advice.}},

Title = {{Counterfactual Choice and Learning in a Neural Network Centered on Human
   Lateral Frontopolar Cortex}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Decision making and learning in a real-world context require organisms
   to track not only the choices they make and the outcomes that follow but
   also other untaken, or counterfactual, choices and their outcomes.
   Although the neural system responsible for tracking the value of choices
   actually taken is increasingly well understood, whether a neural system
   tracks counterfactual information is currently unclear. Using a
   three-alternative decision-making task, a Bayesian
   reinforcement-learning algorithm, and fMRI, we investigated the coding
   of counterfactual choices and prediction errors in the human brain.
   Rather than representing evidence favoring multiple counterfactual
   choices, lateral frontal polar cortex (lFPC), dorsomedial frontal cortex
   (DMFC), and posteromedial cortex (PMC) encode the reward-based evidence
   favoring the best counterfactual option at future decisions. In addition
   to encoding counterfactual reward expectations, the network carries a
   signal for learning about counterfactual options when feedback is
   available-a counterfactual prediction error. Unlike other brain regions
   that have been associated with the processing of counterfactual
   outcomes, counterfactual prediction errors within the identified network
   cannot be related to regret theory. Furthermore, individual variation in
   counterfactual choice-related activity and prediction error-related
   activity, respectively, predicts variation in the propensity to switch
   to profitable choices in the future and the ability to learn from
   hypothetical feedback. Taken together, these data provide both neural
   and behavioral evidence to support the existence of a previously
   unidentified neural system responsible for tracking both counterfactual
   choice options and their outcomes.}},

Title = {{Generative Embedding for Model-Based Classification of fMRI Data}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Decoding models, such as those underlying multivariate classification
   algorithms, have been increasingly used to infer cognitive or clinical
   brain states from measures of brain activity obtained by functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The practicality of current
   classifiers, however, is restricted by two major challenges. First, due
   to the high data dimensionality and low sample size, algorithms struggle
   to separate informative from uninformative features, resulting in poor
   generalization performance. Second, popular discriminative methods such
   as support vector machines (SVMs) rarely afford mechanistic
   interpretability. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a
   novel generative-embedding approach that incorporates neurobiologically
   interpretable generative models into discriminative classifiers. Our
   approach extends previous work on trial-by-trial classification for
   electrophysiological recordings to subject-by-subject classification for
   fMRI and offers two key advantages over conventional methods: it may
   provide more accurate predictions by exploiting discriminative
   information encoded in `hidden' physiological quantities such as
   synaptic connection strengths; and it affords mechanistic
   interpretability of clinical classifications. Here, we introduce
   generative embedding for fMRI using a combination of dynamic causal
   models (DCMs) and SVMs. We propose a general procedure of DCM-based
   generative embedding for subject-wise classification, provide a concrete
   implementation, and suggest good-practice guidelines for unbiased
   application of generative embedding in the context of fMRI. We
   illustrate the utility of our approach by a clinical example in which we
   classify moderately aphasic patients and healthy controls using a DCM of
   thalamo-temporal regions during speech processing. Generative embedding
   achieves a near-perfect balanced classification accuracy of 98\% and
   significantly outperforms conventional activation-based and
   correlation-based methods. This example demonstrates how disease states
   can be detected with very high accuracy and, at the same time, be
   interpreted mechanistically in terms of abnormalities in connectivity.
   We envisage that future applications of generative embedding may provide
   crucial advances in dissecting spectrum disorders into physiologically
   more well-defined subgroups.}},

Abstract = {{Compassion is considered a moral emotion related to the perception of
   suffering in others, and resulting in a motivation to alleviate the
   afflicted party. We compared brain correlates of compassion-evoking
   images in women and men. BOLD functional images of 24 healthy volunteers
   (twelve women and twelve men; age = 27 +/- 2.5 y.o.) were acquired in a
   3T magnetic resonance scanner while subjects viewed pictures of human
   suffering previously verified to elicit compassion and indicated their
   compassionate experience by finger movements. Functional analysis
   revealed that while women manifested activation in areas involved in
   basic emotional, empathic, and moral processes, such as basal regions
   and cingulate and frontal cortices, activation in men was restricted
   mainly to the occipital cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. These findings
   suggest that compassion and its moral elements constitute
   gender-relative subjective phenomena emerging from differently evolved
   neural mechanisms and socially learned features possibly related to
   nurturing skills. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Constrained principal component analysis (CPCA) with a finite impulse
   response (FIR) basis set was used to reveal functionally connected
   networks and their temporal progression over a multi-stage verbal
   working memory trial in which memory load was varied. Four components
   were extracted, and all showed statistically significant sensitivity to
   the memory load manipulation. Additionally, two of the four components
   sustained this peak activity, both for approximately 3 s (Components 1
   and 4). The functional networks that showed sustained activity were
   characterized by increased activations in the dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left supramarginal
   gyrus, and decreased activations in the primary auditory cortex and
   ``default network{''} regions. The functional networks that did not show
   sustained activity were instead dominated by increased activation in
   occipital cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, sensori-motor
   cortical regions, and superior parietal cortex. The response shapes
   suggest that although all four components appear to be invoked at
   encoding, the two sustained-peak components are likely to be
   additionally involved in the delay period. Our investigation provides a
   unique view of the contributions made by a network of brain regions over
   the course of a multiple-stage working memory trial. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Pregabalin (PGB) has shown potential as an anxiolytic for treatment of
   generalized and social anxiety disorder. PGB binds to voltage-dependent
   calcium channels, leading to upregulation of GABA inhibitory activity
   and reduction in the release of various neurotransmitters. Previous
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indicate that
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines attenuate
   amygdala, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex activation during
   anticipation and emotional processing in healthy controls. The aim of
   this study was to examine whether acute PGB administration would
   attenuate activation in these regions during emotional anticipation. In
   this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study, 16
   healthy controls completed a paradigm involving anticipation of negative
   and positive affective images during fMRI approximately 1 h after
   administration of placebo, 50, or 200 mg PGB. Linear mixed model
   analysis revealed that PGB was associated with (1) decreases in left
   amygdala and anterior insula activation and (2) increases in anterior
   cingulate (ACC) activation, during anticipation of positive and negative
   stimuli. There was also a region of the anterior amygdala in which PGB
   dose was associated with increased activation during anticipation of
   negative and decreased activation during anticipation of positive
   stimuli. Attenuation of amygdala and insula activation during
   anticipatory or emotional processing may represent a common regional
   brain mechanism for anxiolytics across drug classes. PGB induced
   increases in ACC activation could be a unique effect related to top-down
   modulation of affective processing. These results provide further
   support for the viability of using pharmaco-fMRI to determine the
   anxiolytic potential of pharmacologic agents. Neuropsychopharmacology

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging evidence suggests that dynamic facial expressions elicit
   greater activity than static face stimuli in brain structures associated
   with social cognition, interpreted as greater ecological validity.
   However, a quantitative meta-analysis of brain activity associated with
   dynamic facial expressions is lacking. The current study investigated,
   using three fMRI experiments, activity elicited by (a) dynamic and
   static happy faces, (b) dynamic and static happy and angry faces, and
   (c) dynamic faces and dynamic flowers. In addition, using activation
   likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis, we determined areas concordant
   across published studies that (a) used dynamic faces and (b)
   specifically compared dynamic and static emotional faces. The middle
   temporal gyri (Experiment 1) and superior temporal sulci (STS;
   Experiment 1 and 2) were more active for dynamic than static faces. In
   contrasts with the baseline the amygdalae were more active for dynamic
   faces (Experiment 1 and 2) and the fusiform gyri were active for all
   conditions (all Experiments). The ALE meta-analyses revealed concordant
   activation in all of these regions as well as in areas associated with
   cognitive manipulations (inferior frontal gyri). Converging data from
   the experiments and the meta-analyses suggest that dynamic facial
   stimuli elicit increased activity in regions associated with
   interpretation of social signals and emotional processing.}},

Abstract = {{Self-projection, the capacity to re-experience the personal past and to
   mentally infer another person's perspective, has been linked to medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In particular, ventral mPFC is associated with
   inferences about one's own self, whereas dorsal mPFC is associated with
   inferences about another individual. In the present fMRI study, we
   examined self-projection using a novel camera technology, which employs
   a sensor and timer to automatically take hundreds of photographs when
   worn, in order to create dynamic visuospatial cues taken from a
   first-person perspective. This allowed us to ask participants to
   self-project into the personal past or into the life of another person.
   We predicted that self-projection to the personal past would elicit
   greater activity in ventral mPFC, whereas self-projection of another
   perspective would rely on dorsal mPFC. There were three main findings
   supporting this prediction. First, we found that self-projection to the
   personal past recruited greater ventral mPFC, whereas observing another
   person's perspective recruited dorsal mPFC. Second, activity in ventral
   versus dorsal mPFC was sensitive to parametric modulation on each trial
   by the ability to relive the personal past or to understand another's
   perspective, respectively. Third, task-related functional connectivity
   analysis revealed that ventral mPFC contributed to the medial temporal
   lobe network linked to memory processes, whereas dorsal mPFC contributed
   to the fronto-parietal network linked to controlled processes. In sum,
   these results suggest that ventral-dorsal subregions of the anterior
   midline are functionally dissociable and may differentially contribute
   to self-projection of self versus other.}},

Title = {{Autistic Traits and Brain Activation during Face-to-Face Conversations
   in Typically Developed Adults}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by
   impaired social interaction and communication, restricted interests, and
   repetitive behaviours. The severity of these characteristics is posited
   to lie on a continuum that extends into the general population. Brain
   substrates underlying ASD have been investigated through functional
   neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   However, fMRI has methodological constraints for studying brain
   mechanisms during social interactions (for example, noise, lying on a
   gantry during the procedure, etc.). In this study, we investigated
   whether variations in autism spectrum traits are associated with changes
   in patterns of brain activation in typically developed adults. We used
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a recently developed functional
   neuroimaging technique that uses near-infrared light, to monitor brain
   activation in a natural setting that is suitable for studying brain
   functions during social interactions.
   Methodology: We monitored regional cerebral blood volume changes using a
   52-channel NIRS apparatus over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and superior
   temporal sulcus (STS), 2 areas implicated in social cognition and the
   pathology of ASD, in 28 typically developed participants (14 male and 14
   female) during face-to-face conversations. This task was designed to
   resemble a realistic social situation. We examined the correlations of
   these changes with autistic traits assessed using the Autism-Spectrum
   Quotient (AQ).
   Principal Findings: Both the PFC and STS were significantly activated
   during face-to-face conversations. AQ scores were negatively correlated
   with regional cerebral blood volume increases in the left STS during
   face-to-face conversations, especially in males.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate successful monitoring of brain
   function during realistic social interactions by NIRS as well as lesser
   brain activation in the left STS during face-to-face conversations in
   typically developed participants with higher levels of autistic traits.}},

Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment are at high
   risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. Besides episodic memory
   dysfunction they show deficits in accessing contextual knowledge that
   further specifies a general concept or helps to identify an object or a
   person.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we investigated the neural networks associated with the
   perception of personal familiar faces and places in patients with
   amnestic mild cognitive impairment and healthy control subjects.
   Irrespective of stimulus type, patients compared to control subjects
   showed lower activity in right prefrontal brain regions when perceiving
   personally familiar versus unfamiliar faces and places. Both groups did
   not show different neural activity when perceiving faces or places
   irrespective of familiarity.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our data highlight changes in a frontal
   cortical network associated with knowledge-based personal familiarity
   among patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment. These changes
   could contribute to deficits in social cognition and may reduce the
   patients' ability to transition from basic to complex situations and

Title = {{Perception of Biological Motion in Schizophrenia and Healthy
   Individuals: A Behavioral and fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anomalous visual perception is a common feature of
   schizophrenia plausibly associated with impaired social cognition that,
   in turn, could affect social behavior. Past research suggests impairment
   in biological motion perception in schizophrenia. Behavioral and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments were conducted
   to verify the existence of this impairment, to clarify its perceptual
   basis, and to identify accompanying neural concomitants of those
   deficits.
   Methodology/Findings: In Experiment 1, we measured ability to detect
   biological motion portrayed by point-light animations embedded within
   masking noise. Experiment 2 measured discrimination accuracy for pairs
   of point-light biological motion sequences differing in the degree of
   perturbation of the kinematics portrayed in those sequences. Experiment
   3 measured BOLD signals using event-related fMRI during a biological
   motion categorization task. Compared to healthy individuals,
   schizophrenia patients performed significantly worse on both the
   detection (Experiment 1) and discrimination (Experiment 2) tasks.
   Consistent with the behavioral results, the fMRI study revealed that
   healthy individuals exhibited strong activation to biological motion,
   but not to scrambled motion in the posterior portion of the superior
   temporal sulcus (STSp). Interestingly, strong STSp activation was also
   observed for scrambled or partially scrambled motion when the healthy
   participants perceived it as normal biological motion. On the other
   hand, STSp activation in schizophrenia patients was not selective to
   biological or scrambled motion.
   Conclusion: Schizophrenia is accompanied by difficulties discriminating
   biological from non-biological motion, and associated with those
   difficulties are altered patterns of neural responses within brain area
   STSp. The perceptual deficits exhibited by schizophrenia patients may be
   an exaggerated manifestation of neural events within STSp associated
   with perceptual errors made by healthy observers on these same tasks.
   The present findings fit within the context of theories of delusion
   involving perceptual and cognitive processes.}},

Title = {{The Sensory Consequences of Speaking: Parametric Neural Cancellation
   during Speech in Auditory Cortex}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 19}},
Abstract = {{When we speak, we provide ourselves with auditory speech input.
   Efficient monitoring of speech is often hypothesized to depend on
   matching the predicted sensory consequences from internal motor commands
   ( forward model) with actual sensory feedback. In this paper we tested
   the forward model hypothesis using functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging. We administered an overt picture naming task in which we
   parametrically reduced the quality of verbal feedback by noise masking.
   Presentation of the same auditory input in the absence of overt speech
   served as listening control condition. Our results suggest that a match
   between predicted and actual sensory feedback results in inhibition of
   cancellation of auditory activity because speaking with normal unmasked
   feedback reduced activity in the auditory cortex compared to listening
   control conditions. Moreover, during self-generated speech, activation
   in auditory cortex increased as the feedback quality of the
   self-generated speech decreased. We conclude that during speaking early
   auditory cortex is involved in matching external signals with an
   internally generated model or prediction of sensory consequences, the
   locus of which may reside in auditory or higher order brain areas.
   Matching at early auditory cortex may provide a very sensitive
   monitoring mechanism that highlights speech production errors at very
   early levels of processing and may efficiently determine the self-agency
   of speech input.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Accumulating evidence indicates that genetic polymorphisms
   of D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA) (M24; rs1421292; T-allele) and
   catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) (Val(158)Met; rs4680) likely enhance
   susceptibility to schizophrenia. Previously, clinical association
   between DAOA M24 (T-allele) and a functionally inefficient 3-marker COMT
   haplotype (that included COMT Val(158)Met) uncovered epistatic effects
   on risk for schizophrenia. Therefore, we projected that healthy control
   subjects with risk genotypes for both DAOA M24 (T/T) and COMTVal(158)Met
   (Val/Val) would produce prefrontal inefficiency, a critical
   physiological marker of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in
   schizophrenic patients influenced by both familial and heritable
   factors.
   Methods: With 3T blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging data, we analyzed in SPM5 the proposed interaction of
   DAOA and COMT in 82 healthy volunteers performing an N-back executive
   working memory paradigm (2-back > 0-back).
   Results: As predicted, we detected a functional gene x gene interaction
   between DAOA and COMT in the DLPFC.
   Conclusions: The neuroimaging findings here of inefficient information
   processing in the prefrontal cortex seem to echo prior statistical
   epistasis between risk alleles for DAOA and COMT, albeit within a small
   sample. These in vivo results suggest that deleterious genotypes for
   DAOA and COMT might contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,
   perhaps through combined glutamatergic and dopaminergic dysregulation.}},

Abstract = {{For functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), multi-voxel pattern
   analysis (MVPA) has been shown to be a sensitive method to detect areas
   that encode certain stimulus dimensions. By moving a searchlight through
   the volume of the brain, one can continuously map the information
   content about the experimental conditions of interest to the brain.
   Traditionally, the searchlight is defined as a volume sphere that does
   not take into account the anatomy of the cortical surface. Here we
   present a method that uses a cortical surface reconstruction to guide
   voxel selection for information mapping. This approach differs in two
   important aspects from a volume-based searchlight definition. First, it
   uses only voxels that are classified as grey matter based on an
   anatomical scan. Second, it uses a surface-based geodesic distance
   metric to define neighbourhoods of voxels, and does not select voxels
   across a sulcus. We study here the influence of these two factors onto
   classification accuracy and onto the spatial specificity of the
   resulting information map.
   In our example data set, participants pressed one of four fingers while
   undergoing fMRI. We used MVPA to identify regions in which local fMRI
   patterns can successfully discriminate which finger was moved. We show
   that surface-based information mapping is a more sensitive measure of
   local information content, and provides better spatial selectivity. This
   makes surface-based information mapping a useful technique for a
   data-driven analysis of information representation in the cerebral
   cortex. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Conventional decoding methods in neuroscience aim to predict discrete
   brain states from multivariate correlates of neural activity. This
   approach faces two important challenges. First, a small number of
   examples are typically represented by a much larger number of features,
   making it hard to select the few informative features that allow for
   accurate predictions. Second, accuracy estimates and information maps
   often remain descriptive and can be hard to interpret. In this paper, we
   propose a model-based decoding approach that addresses both challenges
   from a new angle. Our method involves (i) inverting a dynamic causal
   model of neurophysiological data in a trial-by-trial fashion; (ii)
   training and testing a discriminative classifier on a strongly reduced
   feature space derived from trial-wise estimates of the model parameters;
   and (iii) reconstructing the separating hyperplane. Since the approach
   is model-based, it provides a principled dimensionality reduction of the
   feature space; in addition, if the model is neurobiologically plausible,
   decoding results may offer a mechanistically meaningful interpretation.
   The proposed method can be used in conjunction with a variety of
   modelling approaches and brain data, and supports decoding of either
   trial or subject labels. Moreover, it can supplement evidence-based
   approaches for model-based decoding and enable structural model
   selection in cases where Bayesian model selection cannot be applied.
   Here, we illustrate its application using dynamic causal modelling (DCM)
   of electrophysiological recordings in rodents. We demonstrate that the
   approach achieves significant above-chance performance and, at the same
   time, allows for a neurobiological interpretation of the results. (C)

Abstract = {{Analyzing distributed patterns of brain activation using multivariate
   pattern analysis (MVPA) has become a popular approach for using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to predict mental
   states. While the majority of studies currently build separate
   classifiers for each participant in the sample, in principle a single
   classifier can be derived from and tested on data from all participants.
   These two approaches, within- and cross-participant classification, rely
   on potentially different sources of variability and thus may provide
   distinct information about brain function. Here, we used both approaches
   to identify brain regions that contain information about passively
   received monetary rewards (i.e., images of currency that influenced
   participant payment) and social rewards (i.e., images of human faces).
   Our within-participant analyses implicated regions in the ventral visual
   processing stream including fusiform gyrus and primary visual cortex and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Two key results indicate these
   regions may contain statistically discriminable patterns that contain
   different informational representations. First, cross-participant
   analyses implicated additional brain regions, including striatum and
   anterior insula. The cross-participant analyses also revealed systematic
   changes in predictive power across brain regions, with the pattern of
   change consistent with the functional properties of regions. Second,
   individual differences in classifier performance in VMPFC were related
   to individual differences in preferences between our two reward
   modalities. We interpret these results as reflecting a distinction
   between patterns showing participant-specific functional organization
   and those indicating aspects of brain organization that generalize
   across individuals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   participants were behaving consistent with our model, and found
   increased activity in the ventromedial PFC, dorsomedial PEG, and nucleus
   accumbens when they chose to abuse trust and maximize their financial

Abstract = {{The present study examined the neural correlates of evaluations of both
   lying and truth-telling in different social contexts using fMRI
   methodology. The results demonstrated the differentiation between lying
   and truth-telling and between different types of lying in a network of
   brain regions. These regions included bilateral superior frontal gyrus
   (SFG), bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL), bilateral cuneus, right
   lingual gyrus (LG), right precuneus, and left postcentral gyrus (PoCG).
   Additionally, we found that activations in the right LG, the left IPL
   and the left PoCG were correlated with the off-line evaluations of
   truthful and untruthful communications about good and bad acts in
   different social contexts. These results suggest that the judgments of
   lying and truth-telling involving a third party might not be
   emotion-arousing but involve rational processing. This study is among
   the first to demonstrate that evaluations of truthful and untruthful
   communications in different social contexts can be differentiated in
   terms of brain BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) activities. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The enormous influence of hierarchical rank on social interactions {[}1]
   suggests that neural mechanisms exist to process status-related
   information {[}2] and ascribe value to it. The ventral striatum is
   prominently implicated in processing value and salience, independent of
   hedonic properties {[}3, 4], and a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study of social status perception in humans demonstrated that
   viewing higher-ranked compared to lower-ranked individuals evokes a
   ventral striatal response {[}5], indicative of a greater assignment of
   value/salience to higher status. Consistent with this interpretation,
   nonhuman primates value information associated with higher-ranked
   conspecifics more than lower-ranked, as illustrated using a choice
   paradigm in which monkeys preferentially take the opportunity to view
   high-status monkeys {[}6]. Interestingly, this status-related value
   assignment in nonhuman primates is influenced by one's own hierarchical
   rank: high-status monkeys preferentially attend to conspecifics of high
   status, whereas low-status monkeys will also attend to other low-status
   monkeys {[}7]. Complementary to these findings, using fMRI and a social
   status judgment task in humans, we suggest a neurobiological mechanism
   by which one's own relative hierarchical rank influences the value
   attributed to particular social status information by demonstrating that
   one's subjective socioeconomic status differentially influences ventral

Abstract = {{Images of buildings and manipulable objects have been found to activate
   distinct regions in the ventral visual pathway. Yet, many
   non-categorical properties distinguish buildings from common everyday
   objects, and perhaps the most salient of these is size. In this fMRI
   study, we investigated whether or not changes in perceived scale can
   account for some of the differences in category-specific responses,
   independent of the influence of semantic or retinotopic image
   properties. We used independent scans to localize object-specific ROIs
   in lateral occipital cortex (LO) and scene-specific ROIs in the
   parahippocampal place area (PPA) and posterior collateral sulcus. We
   then contrasted the effects of stimulus category and perceived
   size/distance in these regions in a factorial design. Participants
   performed an oddball detection task while viewing images of objects,
   buildings, and planar rectangles both with and without a background that
   indicated stimulus size/distance via simple pictorial cues. The analyses
   of fMRI responses showed effects of perceived size/distance in addition
   to effects of category in LO and the PPA. Interestingly, when simple
   rectangles were presented in a control condition against the background
   that indicated size/distance, LO in the right hemisphere responded
   significantly more to the small/close rectangles than to the large/far
   ones, in spite of the fact that the rectangles themselves were
   identical. These findings suggest that ventral stream regions that show
   category specificity are modulated by the perceived size and distance of
   visual stimuli. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{1589-1596}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence has revealed that short-lived internal representations
   held in visual short-term memory (VSTM) can be modulated by top-down
   control via retrospective attention which impacts subsequent behavioral
   performance. However, the functional inter-regional interactions
   underlying these top-down modulatory effects are not fully
   characterized. Here we used event-related functional magnetic imaging to
   investigate whether the strength of functional connectivity between the
   frontal cortex and posterior visual areas varies with the efficacy of
   top-down modulation of memory traces. Top-down modulation was
   manipulated by the timing of retro-cuing (early or late) in a VSTM task.
   Univariate analyses revealed that more effective top-down modulation
   (early cueing vs. late cueing) increased activity in early visual areas.
   Importantly, coherency analyses revealed that top-down modulation
   produced stronger functional connectivity between frontal and posterior
   occipital regions. Also, participants with stronger functional
   connectivity exhibit better memory performance. These results suggest
   that augmented functional connectivity between frontal and posterior
   visual areas strengthens the VSTM representations of importance to
   behavioral goals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Negative symptoms of schizophrenia often predict an
   unfavorable clinical outcome. Disturbed dopamine transmission in
   different brain parts may underlie different aspects of negative
   symptoms, and the effect of antipsychotics on them may also differ. This
   pilot study investigated the potentially therapeutic effects of the
   partial dopamine agonist aripiprazole on different negative symptoms.
   Methods: This pilot study randomly assigned patients with schizophrenia
   (N=40) to either aripiprazole or risperidone. After 6 weeks of
   treatment, the severity of negative symptoms was determined by the
   PANSS. Subscales of self-report questionnaires were used to assess
   differences in initiative, anhedonia, social functioning and subjective
   well-being.
   Results: Patients treated with aripiprazole showed a significant
   improvement on measures for anhedonia and subjective wellbeing. Negative
   symptoms in general, lack of initiative and social inhibition were also
   lower in the aripiprazole treated group, but without reaching
   statistical significance.
   Discussion: According to this pilot study, aripiprazole appears to
   specifically improve anhedonia and subjective wellbeing compared to
   risperidone. This may be caused by a specific effect of aripiprazole on
   the limbic branch of the dopamine system. Future studies should
   replicate this finding with a larger sample size.}},

Abstract = {{There is mounting literature that examines brain activation during tasks
   of working memory in individuals with neurological disorders such as
   traumatic brain injury. These studies represent a foundation for
   understanding the functional brain changes that occur after moderate and
   severe traumatic brain injury, but the focus on topographical
   brain-'activation' differences ignores potential alterations in how
   nodes communicate within a distributed neural network. The present study
   makes use of the most recently developed connectivity modelling
   (extended-unified structural equation model) to examine performance
   during a well-established working-memory task (the n-back) in
   individuals sustaining moderate and severe traumatic brain injury. The
   goal is to use the findings observed in topographical activation
   analysis as the basis for second-level effective connectivity modelling.
   Findings reveal important between-group differences in within-hemisphere
   connectivity during task acquisition, with the control sample
   demonstrating rapid within-left hemisphere connectivity increases and
   the traumatic brain injury sample demonstrating consistently elevated
   within-right hemisphere connectivity. These findings also point to
   important maturational effects from `early' to `late' during task
   performance, including diminished right prefrontal cortex involvement
   and an anterior to posterior shift in connectivity with increased task
   exposure. We anticipate that this approach to functional imaging data
   analysis represents an important future direction for understanding how
   neural plasticity is expressed in brain disorders.}},

   summarizes pertinent functional brain imaging studies addressing the

   associated neuropsychological deficits (theory of mind, executive

Abstract = {{Face recognition is a primary social skill which depends on a
   distributed neural network. A pronounced face recognition deficit in the
   absence of any lesion is seen in congenital prosopagnosia. This study
   investigating 24 congenital prosopagnosic subjects and 25 control
   subjects aims at elucidating its neural basis with fMRI and voxel-based
   morphometry. We found a comprehensive behavioral pattern, an impairment
   in visual recognition for faces and buildings that spared long-term
   memory for faces with negative valence. Anatomical analysis revealed
   diminished gray matter density in the bilateral lingual gyrus, the right
   middle temporal gyrus, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In most
   of these areas, gray matter density correlated with memory success.
   Decreased functional activation was found in the left fusiform gyrus, a
   crucial area for face processing, and in the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex, whereas activation of the medial prefrontal cortex was enhanced.
   Hence, our data lend strength to the hypothesis that congenital
   prosopagnosia is explained by network dysfunction and suggest that
   anatomic curtailing of visual processing in the lingual gyrus plays a
   substantial role. The dysfunctional circuitry further encompasses the
   fusiform gyrus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which may
   contribute to their difficulties in long-term memory for complex visual
   information. Despite their deficits in face identity recognition,
   processing of emotion related information is preserved and possibly
   mediated by the medial prefrontal cortex. Congenital prosopagnosia may,
   therefore, be a blueprint of differential curtailing in networks of
   visual cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Feature-specific enhancement refers to the process by which selectively
   attending to a particular stimulus feature specifically increases the
   response in the same region of the brain that codes that stimulus
   property. Whereas there are many demonstrations of this mechanism in the
   visual system, the evidence is less clear in the auditory system. The
   present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined this
   process for two complex sound features, namely frequency modulation (FM)
   and spatial motion. The experimental design enabled us to investigate
   whether selectively attending to FM and spatial motion enhanced activity
   in those auditory cortical areas that were sensitive to the two
   features. To control for attentional effort, the difficulty of the
   target-detection tasks was matched as closely as possible within
   listeners. Locations of FM-related and motion-related activation were
   broadly compatible with previous research. The results also confirmed a
   general enhancement across the auditory cortex when either feature was
   being attended to, as compared with passive listening. The
   feature-specific effects of selective attention revealed the novel
   finding of enhancement for the nonspatial (FM) feature, but not for the
   spatial (motion) feature. However, attention to spatial features also
   recruited several areas outside the auditory cortex. Further analyses
   led us to conclude that feature-specific effects of selective attention
   are not statistically robust, and appear to be sensitive to the choice
   of fMRI experimental design and localizer contrast.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is under-researched
   despite its high prevalence and large impact on the healthcare system.
   There is a paucity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   studies that explore the neural correlates of emotional processing in
   GAD. The present study investigated the blood oxygen level dependent
   (BOLD) response to processing positive and negative facial emotions in
   patients with GAD.
   Method. A total of 15 female GAD patients and 16 female controls
   undertook an implicit face emotion task during fMRI scanning. They also
   performed a face emotion recognition task outside the scanner.
   Results. The only behavioural difference observed in GAD patients was
   less accurate detection of sad facial expressions compared with control
   participants. However, GAD patients showed an attenuated BOLD signal in
   the prefrontal cortex to fearful, sad, angry and happy facial
   expressions and an attenuated signal in the anterior cingulate coztex to
   happy and fearful facial expressions. No differences were found in
   amygdala response.
   Conclusions. In contrast with previous research, this study found BOLD
   signal attenuation in the ventrolateral and medial prefrontal cortex and
   the anterior cingulate cortex during face emotion processing, consistent
   with a hypothesis of hypo-responsivity to external emotional stimuli in
   GAD. These decreases were in areas that have been implicated in emotion
   and cognition and may reflect an altered balance between internally and
   externally directed attentional processes.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{69}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as neural
   disconnection syndromes have been predominantly supported by
   examinations of abnormalities in corticocortical networks in adults with
   autism. Abroader body of research implicates subcortical structures,
   particularly the striatum, in the physiopathology of autism. Resting
   state functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed detailed maps
   of striatal circuitry in healthy and psychiatric populations and vividly
   captured maturational changes in striatal circuitry during typical
   development.
   Methods: Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   examined striatal functional connectivity (FC) in 20 children with ASD
   and 20 typically developing children between the ages of 7.6 and 13.5
   years. Whole-brain voxelwise statistical maps quantified within-group
   striatal FC and between-group differences for three caudate and three
   putamen seeds for each hemisphere.
   Results: Children with ASD mostly exhibited prominent patterns of
   ectopic striatal FC (i.e., functional connectivity present in ASD but
   not in typically developing children), with increased functional
   connectivity between nearly all striatal subregions and heteromodal
   associative and limbic cortex previously implicated in the
   physiopathology of ASD (e. g., insular and right superior temporal
   gyrus). Additionally, we found striatal functional hyperconnectivity
   with the pons, thus expanding the scope of functional alterations
   implicated in ASD. Secondary analyses revealed ASD-related
   hyperconnectivity between the pons and insula cortex.
   Conclusions: Examination of FC of striatal networks in children with ASD
   revealed abnormalities in circuits involving early developing areas,
   such as the brainstem and insula, with a pattern of increased FC in
   ectopic circuits that likely reflects developmental derangement rather
   than immaturity of functional circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Amygdala responses to emotional faces can be influenced by concomitant
   gaze direction. As an explanation it has been suggested that the
   observer uses eye gaze as a cue to decipher the source of a potential
   threat in order to evaluate the significance of the situation. To test
   this assumption, we kept gaze direction ambiguous and replaced the
   information possibly provided by gaze direction with h explicit,
   contextual information about intentions of angry and fearful faces.
   Using fMRI we show that this manipulation evokes a similar pattern of
   amygdala activation as prior gaze-related accounts: angry faces
   targeting at the observer elicited stronger amygdala responses than
   angry faces targeting at another person, whereas the opposite pattern
   was observed for fearful faces. We further combined our paradigm with
   high-resolution fMRI which enabled us to localize clusters of activation
   in amygdala subregions: purely facial-expression evoked signal changes
   were observed in the accessory basal nucleus, whereas our data suggest a
   critical role of the corticomedial amygdala in linking contextual
   information to emotional faces and in deciphering the significance of
   the faces for the observer. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by significant social
   impairments, including deficits in orienting attention following social
   cues. Behavioral studies investigating social orienting in ASD, however,
   have yielded mixed results, as the use of naturalistic paradigms
   typically reveals clear deficits whereas computerized laboratory
   experiments often report normative behavior. The present study is the
   first to examine the neural mechanisms underlying social orienting in
   ASD in order to provide new insight into the social attention
   impairments that characterize this disorder. Using fMRI, we examined the
   neural correlates of social orienting in children and adolescents with
   ASD and in a matched sample of typically developing (TD) controls while
   they performed a spatial cueing paradigm with social (eye gaze) and
   nonsocial (arrow) cues. Cues were either directional (indicating left or
   right) or neutral (indicating no direction), and directional cues were
   uninformative of the upcoming target location in order to engage
   automatic processes by minimizing expectations. Behavioral results
   demonstrated intact orienting effects for social and nonsocial cues,
   with no differences between groups. The imaging results, however,
   revealed clear group differences in brain activity. When attention was
   directed by social cues compared to nonsocial cues, the TD group showed
   increased activity in frontoparietal attention networks, visual
   processing regions, and the striatum, whereas the ASD group only showed
   increased activity in the superior parietal lobule. Significant group x
   cue type interactions confirmed greater responsivity in task-relevant
   networks for social cues than nonsocial cues in TD as compared to ASD,
   despite similar behavioral performance. These results indicate that, in
   the autistic brain, social cues are not assigned the same privileged
   status as they are in the typically developing brain. These findings
   provide the first empirical evidence that the neural circuitry involved
   in social orienting is disrupted in ASD and highlight that normative
   behavioral performance in a laboratory setting may reflect compensatory
   mechanisms rather than intact social attention. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{We used fMRI to examine the neural responses that occur during
   experiences of perceived racial discrimination. Previous neuroimaging
   studies have focused exclusively on the processes underlying racial bias
   from the perpetrator's perspective and have yet to examine the processes
   that occur when individuals are being discriminated against. To extend
   this work, we examined the neural correlates associated with attributing
   negative social treatment to racial discrimination to explore the
   cognitive and affective processes that occur as discrimination is being
   experienced. To do this, we scanned Black participants while they were
   ostensibly excluded by Whites and then measured distress levels and
   race-based attributions for exclusion. In response to being socially
   excluded by Whites, Black participants who appeared to be more
   distressed showed greater social pain-related neural activity and
   reduced emotion regulatory neural activity. In addition, those who
   attributed exclusion to racial discrimination displayed less social
   pain-related and more emotion regulatory neural activity. The potential
   negative impact that frequent negative social treatment and
   discrimination-related distress regulation might have on individuals'
   long-term mental and physical health is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined dissociations between brain networks involved in
   theory of mind, which is needed for guessing others' mental states, and
   the self, which might constitute the basis for theory of mind's
   development. We used event-related fMRI to compare a condition that
   required participants to guess the mental state of a subject featured in
   first-person perspective sentences (1stPP condition) with a third-person
   perspective sentence condition (3rdPP condition). The caudate nucleus
   was marginally more activated in the 1stPP than in the 3rdPP condition,
   while the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was significantly
   more activated in the 3rdPP condition as compared to the 1stPP
   condition. Furthermore, we examined the correlation between activation
   (signal intensity) of the caudate nucleus and left DLPFC with that of
   the right DLPFC, which is thought to be closely connected with sense of
   self. We found a significant correlation between caudate nucleus and
   right DLPFC activation in the 1stPP condition, and between left and
   right DLPFC activation in the 3rdPP condition. Although theory of mind
   and the self both appear to recruit the right DLPFC, this region seems
   to be accessed through the left DLPFC during theory of mind tasks, but
   through the caudate nucleus when tasks require self reference.}},

Abstract = {{In humans, emotions from music serve important communicative roles.
   Despite a growing interest in the neural basis of music perception,
   action and emotion, the majority of previous studies in this area have
   focused on the auditory aspects of music performances. Here we
   investigate how the brain processes the emotions elicited by audiovisual
   music performances. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, and in Experiment 1 we defined the areas responding to
   audiovisual (musician's movements with music), visual (musician's
   movements only), and auditory emotional (music only) displays.
   Subsequently a region of interest analysis was performed to examine if
   any of the areas detected in Experiment 1 showed greater activation for
   emotionally mismatching performances (combining the musician's movements
   with mismatching emotional sound) than for emotionally matching music
   performances (combining the musician's movements with matching emotional
   sound) as presented in Experiment 2 to the same participants. The insula
   and the left thalamus were found to respond consistently to visual,
   auditory and audiovisual emotional information and to have increased
   activation for emotionally mismatching displays in comparison with
   emotionally matching displays. In contrast, the right thalamus was found
   to respond to audiovisual emotional displays and to have similar
   activation for emotionally matching and mismatching displays. These
   results suggest that the insula and left thalamus have an active role in
   detecting emotional correspondence between auditory and visual
   information during music performances, whereas the right thalamus has a
   different role.}},

Abstract = {{Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) informs the
   understanding of the neural basis of mental function and is a key domain
   of ethical enquiry. It raises questions about the practice and
   implications of research, and reflexively informs ethics through the
   empirical investigation of moral judgments. It is at the centre of
   debate surrounding the importance of neuroscience findings for concepts
   such as personhood and free will, and the extent of their practical
   consequences. Here, we map the landscape of fMRI and neuroethics, using
   citation analysis to uncover salient topics. We find that this landscape
   is sparsely populated: despite previous calls for debate, there are few
   articles that discuss both fMRI and ethical, legal, or social
   implications (ELSI), and even fewer direct citations between the two
   literatures. Recognizing that practical barriers exist to integrating
   ELSI discussion into the research literature, we argue nonetheless that
   the ethical challenges of fMRI, and controversy over its conceptual and
   practical implications, make this essential.}},

Abstract = {{There is still controversy in the literature whether a single episode of
   mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) results in short- and/or long-term
   functional and structural deficits in the concussed brain. With the
   inability of traditional brain imaging techniques to properly assess the
   severity of brain damage induced by a concussive blow, there is hope
   that more advanced applications such as resting state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (rsFMRI) will be more specific in accurately
   diagnosing mTBI. In this rsFMRI study, we examined 17 subjects 10 +/- 2
   days post-sports-related mTBI and 17 age-matched normal volunteers (NVs)
   to investigate the possibility that the integrity of the resting state
   brain network is disrupted following a single concussive blow. We
   hypothesized that advanced brain imaging techniques may reveal subtle
   alterations of functional brain connections in asymptomatic mTBI
   subjects. There are several findings of interest. All mTBI subjects were
   asymptomatic based upon clinical evaluation and neuropsychological (NP)
   assessments prior to the MRI session. The mTBI subjects revealed a
   disrupted functional network both at rest and in response to the YMCA
   physical stress test. Specifically, interhemispheric connectivity was
   significantly reduced in the primary visual cortex, hippocampal and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex networks (p < 0.05). The YMCA physical
   stress induced nonspecific and similar changes in brain network
   connectivity patterns in both the mTBI and NV groups. These major
   findings are discussed in relation to underlying mechanisms, clinical
   assessment of mTBI, and current debate regarding functional brain
   connectivity in a clinical population. Overall, our major findings
   clearly indicate that functional brain alterations in the acute phase of
   injury are overlooked when conventional clinical and neuropsychological
   examinations are used. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studies of depressed patients have demonstrated increased
   amygdala activation to negative affective stimuli. In this study, we
   used a paradigm that employed personally relevant social stimuli, which
   are known to strongly activate the amygdala, to test whether the
   amygdala demonstrated aberrant activity in depressed participants as
   they responded to stimuli with positive valence.
   Methods: Nineteen patients with major depressive disorder, aged 15 to 24
   years, were matched with 20 healthy control participants. They completed
   a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging task in which they
   received social feedback from people who they believed had evaluated
   them. Voxelwise statistical parametric maps of brain response to
   positive social feedback and to a control feedback condition were
   compared to test the hypothesis that differences in neural response
   between depressed and control participants would arise in the amygdala.
   Results: Depressed participants showed increased neural response to the
   positive-versus control-feedback condition in the amygdala (p < .05,
   corrected). An exploratory analysis showed that depressed participants
   responded to faces from both feedback conditions with increased activity
   in regions subserving social appraisal (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   and inferior parietal cortex) and affective processing (pregenual
   anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insular cortex; p < .001,
   uncorrected).
   Conclusions: Depressed patients responded to positive social feedback
   with increased amygdala activation, demonstrating that amygdala
   hyperresponsivity in depression is not restricted to negatively-valenced
   stimuli. The heightened sensitivity of depressed participants to social
   evaluation may help explain symptoms of depression such as social
   withdrawal.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 13}},
Abstract = {{People vicariously experience embarrassment when observing others'
   public pratfalls or etiquette violations. In two consecutive studies we
   investigated the subjective experience and the neural correlates of
   vicarious embarrassment for others in a broad range of situations. We
   demonstrated, first, that vicarious embarrassment was experienced
   regardless of whether the observed protagonist acted accidentally or
   intentionally and was aware or unaware that he/she was in an
   embarrassing situation. Second, using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), we showed that the anterior cingulate cortex and the
   left anterior insula, two cortical structures typically involved in
   vicarious feelings of others' pain, are also strongly implicated in
   experiencing the `social pain' for others' flaws and pratfalls. This
   holds true even for situations that engage protagonists not aware of
   their current predicament. Importantly, the activity in the anterior
   cingulate cortex and the left anterior insula positively correlated with
   individual differences in trait empathy. The present findings establish
   the empathic process as a fundamental prerequisite for vicarious
   embarrassment experiences, thus connecting affect and cognition to
   interpersonal processes. ``When we are living with people who have a
   delicate sense of propriety, we are in misery on their account when
   anything unbecoming is committed. So I always feel for and with
   Charlotte when a person is tipping his chair. She cannot endure it.''

Abstract = {{How similar are the experiences of social rejection and physical pain?
   Extant research suggests that a network of brain regions that support
   the affective but not the sensory components of physical pain underlie
   both experiences. Here we demonstrate that when rejection is powerfully
   elicited-by having people who recently experienced an unwanted break-up
   view a photograph of their ex-partner as they think about being
   rejected-areas that support the sensory components of physical pain
   (secondary somatosensory cortex; dorsal posterior insula) become active.
   We demonstrate the overlap between social rejection and physical pain in
   these areas by comparing both conditions in the same individuals using
   functional MRI. We further demonstrate the specificity of the secondary
   somatosensory cortex and dorsal posterior insula activity to physical
   pain by comparing activated locations in our study with a database of
   over 500 published studies. Activation in these regions was highly
   diagnostic of physical pain, with positive predictive values up to 88\%.
   These results give new meaning to the idea that rejection ``hurts.{''}
   They demonstrate that rejection and physical pain are similar not only
   in that they are both distressing-they share a common somatosensory
   representation as well.}},

Abstract = {{Older adults, compared to younger adults, focus on emotional well-being.
   While the lifespan trajectory of emotional processing and its regulation
   has been characterized behaviorally, few studies have investigated the
   underlying neural mechanisms. Here, older adults (range: 59-73 years)
   and younger adults (range: 19-33 years) participated in a cognitive
   reappraisal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   scanning. On each trial, participants viewed positive, negative or
   neutral pictures and either naturally experienced the image
   ('Experience' condition) or attempted to detach themselves from the
   image ('Reappraise' condition). Across both age groups, cognitive
   reappraisal activated prefrontal regions similar to those reported in
   prior studies of emotion regulation, while emotional experience
   activated the bilateral amygdala. Psychophysiological interaction
   analyses revealed that the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and
   amygdala demonstrated greater inverse connectivity during the
   `Reappraise' condition relative to the `Experience' condition. The only
   regions exhibiting significant age differences were the left IFG and the
   left superior temporal gyrus, for which greater regulation-related
   activation was observed in younger adults. Controlling for age,
   increased performance on measures of cognition predicted greater
   regulation-related decreases in amygdala activation. Thus, while older
   and younger adults use similar brain structures for emotion regulation
   and experience, the functional efficacy of those structures depends on
   underlying cognitive ability.}},

Abstract = {{When making decisions, individuals must often compensate for cognitive
   limitations, particularly in the face of advanced age. Recent findings
   suggest that age-related variability in striatal activity may increase
   financial risk-taking mistakes in older adults. In two studies, we
   sought to further characterize neural contributions to optimal financial
   risk taking and to determine whether decision aids could improve
   financial risk taking. In Study 1, neuroimaging analyses revealed that
   individuals whose mesolimbic activation correlated with the expected
   value estimates of a rational actor made more optimal financial
   decisions. In Study 2, presentation of expected value information
   improved decision making in both younger and older adults, but the
   addition of a distracting secondary task had little impact on decision
   quality. Remarkably, provision of expected value information improved
   the performance of older adults to match that of younger adults at
   baseline. These findings are consistent with the notion that mesolimbic
   circuits play a critical role in optimal choice, and imply that
   providing simplified information about expected value may improve
   financial risk taking across the adult life span.}},

Abstract = {{People have present-biased preferences: they choose more impatiently

   when choosing between a delayed reward and a more delayed reward.
   Following McClure et al. {[}McClure, S.M., Laibson, D.I., Loewenstein,
   G., Cohen, J.D. (2004). Separate neural systems value immediate and
   delayed monetary rewards. Science, 306, 503.], we find that areas in the
   dopaminergic reward system show greater activation when a binary choice
   set includes both an immediate reward and a delayed reward in contrast
   to activation measured when the binary choice set contains only delayed
   rewards. The presence of an immediate reward in the choice set elevates
   activation of the ventral striatum, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex
   and anterior medial prefrontal cortex. These dopaminergic reward areas
   are also responsive to the identity of the recipient of the reward. Even
   an immediate reward does not activate these dopaminergic regions when
   the decision is being made for another person. Our results support the
   hypotheses that participants show less affective engagement (i) when
   they are making choices for themselves that only involve options in the

   hypothesized, we also find that behavioral choices reflect more patience

Abstract = {{Humor is a complex phenomenon of human social cognition with large

   are a common finding in functional neuroimaging studies, and have been
   documented in behavioral studies of humor, but have received limited

   oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrasts with high-field (31)
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMR) we investigated 29 healthy
   subjects (14 female, 15 male) during the processing of humorous
   cartoons. In women, the ventral system implicated in detection and
   appraisal of emotion was activated, including amygdala, insula, and
   Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC). Men showed activation in both the
   ventral and dorsal processing systems. The results indicate that women
   process humor though limbic reactivity, involving appraisal of its
   emotional features, while men apply more evaluative, executive resources
   to humor processing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion Regulation (ER) includes different mechanisms aiming at
   volitionally modulating emotional responses, including cognitive
   re-evaluation (re-appraisal; REAP) or inhibition of emotion expression
   and behavior (expressive suppression; ESUP). However, despite the
   importance of these ER strategies, previous functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have not sufficiently disentangled the
   specific neural impact of REAP versus ESUP on brain responses to
   different kinds of emotion-eliciting events. Moreover, although
   different effects have been reported for stimulus valence (positive vs.
   negative), no study has systematically investigated how ER may change
   emotional processing as a function of particular stimulus content
   variables (i.e., social vs. nonsocial). Our fMRI study directly compared
   brain activation to visual scenes during the use of different ER
   strategies, relative to a ``natural{''} viewing condition, but also
   examined the effects of ER as a function of the social versus nonsocial
   content of scenes, in addition to their negative versus positive valence
   (by manipulating these factors orthogonally in a 2 x 2 factorial
   design). Our data revealed that several prefrontal cortical areas were
   differentially recruited during either REAP or ESUP, independent of the
   valence and content of images. In addition, selective modulations by
   either REAP or ESUP were found depending on the negative valence of
   scenes (medial fusiform gyrus, anterior insula, dmPFC), and on their
   nonsocial (middle insula) or social (bilateral amygdala, mPFC, posterior
   cingulate) significance. Furthermore, we observed a significant
   lateralization in the amygdala for the effect of the two different ER
   strategies, with a predominant modulz.tion by REAP on the left side but
   by ESUP on the right side. Taken together, these results do not only
   highlight the distributed nature of neural changes induced by ER, but
   also reveal the specific impact of different strategies (REAP or ESUP),
   and the specific sites implicated by different dimensions of emotional
   information (social or negative). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Metamemory refers to the ability of individuals to monitor and control
   their own memory performance. Although little theoretical consideration
   of the possible differences between the monitoring of episodic and of
   semantic knowledge has been published, results from patient and drug
   studies that used the ``feeling of knowing{''} (FOK) paradigm show a
   selective impairment in the accuracy of episodic monitoring but not in
   its semantic counterpart. Similarly, neuroimaging studies provide
   indirect evidence for separate patterns of activation during episodic or
   semantic FOKs. However, the semantic-episodic distinction hypothesis has
   not been directly addressed. In the current event-related fMRI study, we
   used a within-subject, within-experiment comparison of the monitoring of
   semantic and episodic content. Whereas the common neural correlates of
   episodic and semantic FOKs observed in this study generally replicate
   the previous neuroimaging findings, several regions were found to be
   differentially associated with each task. Activity of the right inferior
   frontal gyrus was modulated by the semantic-episodic factor only during
   the negative predictions of retrieval, suggesting that negative
   predictions are based on partially distinct mechanisms during each task.
   A posterior midline network, known to be activated during episodic
   retrieval, was activated during episodic and not semantic monitoring,
   suggesting that episodic FOKs rely, to some extent, on common episodic
   retrieval processes. These findings suggest that theoretical accounts of
   the etiology and function of FOKs may benefit from incorporating the
   prediction directionality (positive/negative) and the memory domain
   (semantic/episodic) distinctions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Cognitive impairment is frequent in multiple sclerosis (MS)
   and lacks effective treatment. Cognitive rehabilitation is widely
   applied in neurorehabilitation settings. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) may help in investigating changes in brain activity and
   provide a tool to assess the efficacy of rehabilitation.
   Aim: To investigate the effect on brain activity as measured by fMRI of
   a cognitive rehabilitation programme in patients with MS and cognitive
   impairment.
   Method: Fifteen patients with MS and cognitive impairment and five
   healthy subjects were recruited. Neuropsychological assessments were
   performed in patients with MS at study entry and after rehabilitation to
   assess cognitive changes. fMRI scans were performed at week -5
   (baseline), week 0 (immediately before rehabilitation) and week 5
   (immediately after rehabilitation). The fMRI paradigm was the Paced
   Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). The cognitive rehabilitation
   programme was composed of 15 computer-aided drill and practice sessions
   and five non-computer-aided cognitive stimulation group sessions (over
   5weeks). Strict guidelines ensured comparability of all rehabilitation
   interventions.
   Results: Patients had increased brain fMRI activity after rehabilitation
   in several cerebellar areas when compared with healthy subjects. After
   rehabilitation, patients had significantly improved their performance on
   the backward version of the Digit Span Test (p = 0.007) and on a
   composite score of neuropsychological outcomes (p = 0.009).
   Conclusion: The results of the present study indicate that this
   cognitive rehabilitation programme increases brain activity in the
   cerebellum of cognitively impaired patients with MS. The role of fMRI in
   the assessment of neurorehabilitation schemes warrants further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Amygdala reactivity is a heritable trait, potentiated in affective
   disorders and associated with both the 5-HTTLPR and the COMTval158met
   polymorphism.
   Fifty-four healthy volunteers selected a priori based on gender and
   5-HTTLPR/rs25531 and COMT-val158met genotypes performed a passive
   viewing task of angry facial expressions using fMRI. Amygdala reactivity
   and habituation were investigated using the a priori anatomical region
   of interest (ROI) approach. Furthermore, salivary cortisol and skin
   conductance responses were recorded.
   We observed an effect of 5-HTTLPR on right amygdala reactivity
   (s-carrier > 1/l) and COMTval158met on left amygdala reactivity (met/met
   > val-carrier). We provide preliminary evidence that different amygdala
   habituation curves may partly underlie the differences between 5-HTTLPR
   and not COMT genotype groups. Further, exploratory analyses find no
   evidence for additive or interaction effects.
   Our results support that 5-HTTLPR s-carriers and COMT met/met carriers
   may be more sensitive to the detection of biologically and socially
   relevant information and suggest a mechanism behind this for the
   5-HTTLPR. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with chronic medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) can be
   impaired in different tasks that evaluate emotional or social abilities.
   In particular, the recognition of facial emotions can be affected
   (Meletti S, Benuzzi F, Rubboli G, et al. Neurology 2003;60:426-31.
   Meletti S. Benuzzi F, Cantalupo G. Rubboli G, Tassinari CA, Nichelli P.
   Epilepsia 2009;50:1547-59). To better understand the nature of emotion
   recognition deficits in MTLE we investigated the decoding of basic
   emotions in the visual (facial expression) and auditory (emotional
   prosody) domains in 41 patients. Results showed deficits in the
   recognition of both facial and vocal expression of emotions, with a
   strong correlation between performances across the two tasks. No
   correlation between emotion recognition and measures of IQ quality of
   life (QOLIE-31), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory) was
   significant, except for a weak correlation between prosody recognition
   and IQ. These data suggest that emotion recognition impairment in MTLE
   is not dependent on the sensory channel through which the emotional
   stimulus is transmitted. Moreover, these findings support the notion
   that emotional processing is at least partly independent of measures of
   cognitive intelligence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reading epilepsy is a rare reflex epilepsy in which seizures are
   provoked by reading. Several cases have been described in the
   literature, but the pathophysiological processes vary widely and remain
   unclear. We describe a 42-year-old male patient with reading epilepsy
   evaluated using clinical assessments and continuous video/EEG
   recordings. We administered verbal, nonverbal, and reading tasks to
   determine factors precipitating seizures. Linguistic characteristics of
   the words were manipulated. Results indicated that reading-induced
   seizures were significantly more numerous than those observed during
   verbal and nonverbal tasks. In reading tasks, spike frequency
   significantly increased with involvement of the phonological reading
   route. Spikes were recorded predominantly in left parasagittal regions.
   Future cerebral imaging studies will enable us to visualize the spatial
   localization and temporal course of reading-induced seizures and brain
   activity involved in reading. A better understanding of reading epilepsy
   is crucial for reading rehabilitation in these patients. (C) 2011

   engage patients, more than controls, and negative faces would be related
   to higher levels of negative affect and produce increased activity in
   the medial frontal cortex, an area involved in social appraisal.
   Twenty-one stable outpatients with chronic non-affective psychosis (16
   schizophrenic, 5 schizoaffective) and 21 healthy subjects underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared with the control
   subjects, patients were slower to respond, but particularly slow when
   they judged negatively-valenced faces, a slowness correlated with
   negative affect in the psychosis patients. Appraisal activated the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) across all face valences. For negative
   expressions, patients exhibited greater activation of the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). A psychophysiological interaction
   analysis of the dACC revealed co-modulation of the mPFC in controls,
   significantly less in patients, and a trend for co-modulation of
   occipital cortex in the patients. Activity in occipital cortex
   correlated with poor social adjustment and impaired social cognition,
   and co-modulation of the occipital gyrus by the dACC was correlated with
   poorer social cognition. The findings link appraisal of negative affect
   with aberrant activation of the medial frontal cortex, while early
   sensory processing of this social cognitive task was linked with poor
   social function, reflecting either top-down or bottom-up influences. (C)

Title = {{Do patients with schizophrenia benefit from a self-referential memory

Abstract = {{Background: Self-referential processing (i.e. linking internal and
   external stimuli to one's own self) has received scant attention thus
   far in schizophrenia. This type of processing is a key component of
   social cognition and thought to be important for adaptive social
   functioning. Memory studies in healthy subjects have shown that stimuli
   processed with reference to the self are better remembered than stimuli
   processed in other semantic forms. It is not known whether schizophrenia
   patients benefit from such a memory boost for self-referenced
   information.
   Methods: Twenty-five schizophrenia patients and 22 controls were
   assessed with a self-referential recognition memory paradigm. During an
   encoding phase, participants rated personality adjectives in each of
   three conditions: (1) structural features (uppercase or lowercase
   letters?); (2) social desirability (is adjective socially desirable or
   not?); or (3) self-referential (does adjective describe me or not?).
   Recognition memory for these personality adjectives was then tested
   during an unexpected yes-no recognition test.
   Results: Patients and controls were comparable in memory performance for
   the structural (p = 0.12) and social desirability (p = 0.30) conditions.
   In contrast, patients showed significantly reduced recognition
   sensitivity compared to controls for the self-referential condition (p =
   0.03).
   Discussion: Compared to healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia
   did not benefit from a memory boost for self-referenced information.
   Such impaired self-referential memory may be associated with abnormal
   function of the medial prefrontal cortex. The inability to enhance
   memory for personally relevant information may partly explain poor
   social functioning in schizophrenia patients. (C) 2010 Elsevier By. All

Title = {{Moral Concepts Set Decision Strategies to Abstract Values}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Persons have different value preferences. Neuroimaging studies where
   value-based decisions in actual conflict situations were investigated
   suggest an important role of prefrontal and cingulate brain regions.
   General preferences, however, reflect a superordinate moral concept
   independent of actual situations as proposed in psychological and
   socioeconomic research. Here, the specific brain response would be
   influenced by abstract value systems and moral concepts. The
   neurobiological mechanisms underlying such responses are largely
   unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a
   forced-choice paradigm on word pairs representing abstract values, we
   show that the brain handles such decisions depending on the person's
   superordinate moral concept. Persons with a predominant collectivistic
   (altruistic) value system applied a ``balancing and weighing{''}
   strategy, recruiting brain regions of rostral inferior and
   intraparietal, and midcingulate and frontal cortex. Conversely, subjects
   with mainly individualistic (egocentric) value preferences applied a
   ``fight-and-flight{''} strategy by recruiting the left amygdala.
   Finally, if subjects experience a value conflict when rejecting an
   alternative congruent to their own predominant value preference,
   comparable brain regions are activated as found in actual moral dilemma
   situations, i.e., midcingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our
   results demonstrate that superordinate moral concepts influence the
   strategy and the neural mechanisms in decision processes, independent of
   actual situations, showing that decisions are based on general neural
   principles. These findings provide a novel perspective to future
   sociological and economic research as well as to the analysis of social
   relations by focusing on abstract value systems as triggers of specific
   brain responses.}},

Title = {{Cognitive Context Determines Dorsal Premotor Cortical Activity During

Journal = {{STROKE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1056-1061}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Stroke patients often have difficulties in
   simultaneously performing a motor and cognitive task. Functional imaging
   studies have shown that movement of an affected hand after stroke is
   associated with increased activity in multiple cortical areas,
   particularly in the contralesional hemisphere. We hypothesized patients
   for whom executing simple movements demands greater selective attention
   will show greater brain activity during movement.
   Methods-Eight chronic stroke patients performed a behavioral
   interference test using a visuo-motor tracking with and without a
   simultaneous cognitive task. The magnitude of behavioral task decrement
   under cognitive motor interference (CMI) conditions was calculated for
   each subject. Functional MRI was used to assess brain activity in the
   same patients during performance of a visuo-motor tracking task alone;
   correlations between CMI score and movement-related brain activation
   were then explored.
   Results-Movement-related activation in the dorsal precentral gyrus of
   the contralesional hemisphere correlated strongly and positively with
   CMI score (r(2) at peak voxel=0.92; P<0.05). Similar but weaker
   relationships were observed in the ventral precentral and middle frontal
   gyrus. There was no independent relationship between hand motor
   impairment and CMI.
   Conclusions-Results suggest that variations in the degree to which a
   cognitive task interferes with performance of a concurrent motor task
   explains a substantial proportion of the variations in movement-related
   brain activity in patients after stroke. The results emphasize the
   importance of considering cognitive context when interpreting brain
   activity patterns and provide a rationale for further evaluation of
   integrated cognitive and movement interventions for rehabilitation in
   stroke. (Stroke. 2011;42:1056-1061.)}},

Abstract = {{Although much is known about the neural substrates of reward, the

   (pleasant apple juice or an unpleasant salt flavor). At the group level,
   we found partially overlapping value-related activity within
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during anticipation of juice and
   money reward outcomes. Analogous results were found in the right
   anterior insula, except that this region showed negative correlations as
   a function of increasing expected reward. These results indicate that
   vmPFC and anterior insula contain overlapping representations of
   anticipatory value, consistent with the existence of a common currency

Abstract = {{Most humans are social beings and we express our thoughts and feelings
   through language. In contrast to the ease with which we speak, the
   underlying cognitive and neural processes of language production are
   fairly complex and still little understood. In the hereditary metabolic
   disease classic galactosemia, failures in language production processes
   are among the most reported difficulties. It is unclear, however, what
   the underlying neural cause of this cognitive problem is. Modern brain
   imaging techniques allow us to look into the brain of a thinking patient
   online - while she or he is performing a task, such as speaking. We can
   measure indirectly neural activity related to the output side of a
   process (e.g. articulation). But most importantly, we can look into the
   planning phase prior to an overt response, hence tapping into
   subcomponents of speech planning. These components include verbal
   memory, intention to speak, and the planning of meaning, syntax, and
   phonology. This paper briefly introduces cognitive theories on language
   production and methods used in cognitive neuroscience. It reviews the
   possibilities of applying them in experimental paradigms to investigate
   language production and verbal memory in galactosemia.}},

Title = {{Chronic stress is linked to 5-HT1A receptor changes and functional

Abstract = {{There are increasing reports about stress related cognitive and psychic
   declines in subjects who have no psychiatric premorbidity, depression,
   or major life trauma. Yet, little is known about the underlying
   neurobiology. Based on the typical symptomatology, fMRI data suggesting
   that stress activates the limbic circuits, and animal data showing a
   major involvement of the 5-HT1A receptor in stress regulation, we
   hypothesized that enduring daily stress causes widespread limbic
   dysfunctions, and specific changes of the 5-HT1A receptor.
   To test these hypotheses combined PET studies were carried out in 16
   chronically stressed, and 16 non-stressed subjects. Limbic function was
   tested by measuring cerebral blood flow during rest, and when using an
   odor activation paradigm. 5-HT1A receptor binding potential (BP) was
   assessed with {[}C-11]WAY100635. All subjects went through a battery of
   neuropsychological tests.
   Stressed subjects showed a functional disconnection between the amygdala
   and ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and an impaired odor activation
   of the ACC. They also displayed a reduced 5-HT1A receptor BP in the
   anterior cingulate (ACC), the insular-cortex, and the hippocampus. Their
   performance in attention-, odor discrimination-, and semantic memory
   tasks was impaired, and correlated with the BP-values in the respective
   region. The degree of reported stress was inversely correlated with
   activation of ACC, and the 5-HT1A receptor BP in the amygdala and
   hippocampus.
   Enduring every day psychosocial stress seems to be associated with a
   limbic reduction of 5-HT1A receptor binding and functional
   disintegration of ACC/mPFC. These changes support the notion of an
   impaired top-down regulation of stress stimuli, and identify potential
   targets for early treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety refers to the prevalent and debilitating experience of
   fear and anxiety of being scrutinized in social situations. It
   originates from both learned (e.g. adverse social conditioning) and
   innate (e.g. shyness) factors. Research on social anxiety has
   traditionally focused on negative emotions induced by visual and
   auditory social cues in socially anxious clinical populations, and
   posits a dysfunctional orbitofrontal-amygdala circuit as a primary
   etiological mechanism. Yet as a trait, social anxiety is independent of
   one's specific emotional state. Here we probe the neural substrate of
   intrinsic social anxiety by employing a unique type of social stimuli,
   airborne human social chemosensory cues that are inherently social,
   ubiquitously present, and yet operating below verbal awareness. We show
   that the adopted social chemosensory cues were not perceived to be
   human-related, did not differentially bias self-report of anxiety or
   autonomic nervous system responses, yet individuals with elevated social
   anxiety demonstrated a reduced recruitment of the orbitofrontal cortex
   to social chemosensory cues. No reciprocal activity in the amygdala was
   observed. Our findings point to an intrinsic neural substrate underlying
   social anxiety that is not associated with prior adverse social
   conditioning, thereby providing the first neural evidence for the
   inherent social aspect of this enigmatic phenomenon. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Methamphetamine (MA)-dependent individuals exhibit deficits in cognition
   and prefrontal cortical function. Therefore, medications that improve
   cognition in these subjects may improve the success of therapy for their
   addiction, especially when cognitive behavioral therapies are used.
   Modafinil has been shown to improve cognitive performance in
   neuropsychiatric patients and healthy volunteers. We therefore conducted
   a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, to examine the effects of
   modafinil on learning and neural activity related to cognitive function
   in abstinent, MA-dependent, and healthy control participants. Modafinil
   (200 mg) and placebo were administered orally (one single dose each), in
   counterbalanced fashion, 2 h before each of two testing sessions. Under
   placebo conditions, MA-dependent participants showed worse learning
   performance than control participants. Modafinil boosted learning in
   MA-dependent participants, bringing them to the same performance level
   as control subjects; the control group did not show changes in
   performance with modafinil. After controlling for performance
   differences, MA-dependent participants showed a greater effect of
   modafinil on brain activation in bilateral insula/ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortices than control
   participants. The findings suggest that modafinil improves learning in
   MA-dependent participants, possibly by enhancing neural function in
   regions important for learning and cognitive control. These results
   suggest that modafinil may be a suitable pharmacological adjunct for
   enhancing the efficiency of cognitive-based therapies for MA dependence.

Abstract = {{Much functional neuroimaging evidence indicates that autistic spectrum
   disorders (ASD) demonstrate marked brain abnormalities in face
   processing. Most of these findings were obtained from studies using
   tasks related to whole faces. However, individuals with ASD tend to rely
   more on individual parts of the face for identification than on the
   overall configuration. Therefore, this neuroimaging evidence might
   reflect differential visual attention systems in face recognition. It
   was hypothesized that differential brain function is shown between ASD
   and control participants with face recognition tasks presenting parts of
   faces separately. Nine adults with high-functioning ASD and 24
   age-matched normal comparison participants were studied using a 3T-MR
   scanner. We investigated brain activation when processing whole faces
   and parts of faces displaying positive or negative expressions. The
   control group showed bilateral amygdalae activation to the whole face,
   but not to parts of the face. The ASD group showed bilateral amygdalae
   activation to the lower face (mainly mouth region), but not to the whole
   face and upper face (mainly eye region). These findings suggest that
   differential amygdala function for face processing exists in ASD. This
   aberrant amygdala function might cause abnormalities in gaze processing
   or recognition of emotional expressions, shown clinically in ASD. (C)

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide vasopressin is a key molecular mediator of social
   behavior in animals and humans, implicated in anxiety and autism. Social
   recognition, the ability to assess the familiarity of others, is
   essential for appropriate social interactions and enhanced by
   vasopressin; however, the neural mechanisms mediating this effect in
   humans are unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   and an implicit social recognition matching task, we employed a
   double-blinded procedure in which 20 healthy male volunteers
   self-administered 40 UI of vasopressin or placebo intranasally, 45 min
   before performing the matching task in the scanner. In a random-effects
   fMRI analysis, we show that vasopressin induces a regionally specific
   alteration in a key node of the theory of mind network, the left
   temporoparietal junction, identifying a neurobiological mechanism for
   prosocial neuropeptide effects in humans that suggests novel treatment

Abstract = {{People often make shortsighted decisions to receive small benefits in
   the present rather than large benefits in the future, that is, to favor
   their current selves over their future selves. In two studies using
   fMRI, we demonstrated that people make such decisions in part because
   they fail to engage in the same degree of self-referential processing
   when thinking about their future selves. When participants predicted how
   much they would enjoy an event in the future, they showed less activity
   in brain regions associated with introspective self-reference-such as
   the ventromedial pFC (vMPFC)-than when they predicted how much they
   would enjoy events in the present. Moreover, the magnitude of vMPFC
   reduction predicted the extent to which participants made shortsighted
   monetary decisions several weeks later. In light of recent findings that
   the vMPFC contributes to the ability to simulate future events from a
   first-person perspective, these data suggest that shortsighted decisions
   result in part from a failure to fully imagine the subjective experience
   of one's future self.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Borderline personality disorder has been characterized by
   enhanced emotional reactivity and deficient emotion regulation in
   behavioral and functional imaging studies. We aimed to validate
   patients' difficulties in the cognitive regulation of negative emotions
   and investigated if emotion regulation deficits are restricted to the
   decrease of negative emotions. A cognitive reappraisal paradigm was used
   and hence a regulation strategy that is typically applied in
   cognitive-behavioral therapy.
   Methods: Fifteen unmedicated female borderline patients with affective
   instability and 15 healthy female control subjects underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging during a delayed reappraisal paradigm.
   Hemodynamic responses were measured in response to aversive pictures in
   an initial viewing phase and a subsequent reappraisal phase with three
   different conditions: decreasing, increasing, and maintaining the
   initial emotional reaction.
   Results: Patients demonstrated enhanced activation of left amygdala and
   right insula during the initial viewing of aversive stimuli. During
   attempting to decrease the initial emotional reaction, patients showed
   attenuated activation of the left orbitofrontal cortex and increased
   activation of the bilateral insula. The attempt to increase negative
   emotions resulted in enhanced activity in a mygdala and insula, whereas
   no group differences were found.
   Conclusions: The results point to the role of two distinguishable
   processes of emotional difficulties in borderline personality disorder:
   enhanced emotional reactivity as well as deficits of voluntarily
   decreasing aversive emotions by means of cognitive reappraisal. The
   results suggest the neuronal substrate of deficits in explicit emotion
   regulation in the orbitofrontal cortex, which is in line with previous
   findings of a dysfunctional prefrontal network in borderline personality
   disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   data compare the brain's response to stimulus categories (e.g., pictures
   of faces, stories about beliefs) across participants. In order to infer
   that effects observed with the specific items (a particular set of
   pictures or stories) are generalizable to the entire population (all
   faces, or all stories about beliefs), it is necessary to perform an
   ``item analysis.{''} Item analyses may also reveal relationships between
   secondary (non-hypothesized) features of the items and functional
   activity. Here, we perform an item analysis on a set of stories commonly
   used for localizing brain regions putatively involved in Theory of Mind
   (ToM): right and left temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ/LTPJ), precuneus
   (PC), superior temporal sulcus (STS) and medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC). We address the following questions: Do brain regions that
   comprise the ToM network respond reliably across items (i.e. different
   stories about beliefs)? Do these brain regions demonstrate reliable
   preferences for items within the category? Can we predict any region's
   response to individual items, by using other features of the stimuli? We
   find that the TOM network responds reliably to stories about beliefs,
   generalizing across items as well as subjects. In addition, several
   regions in the ToM network have reliable preferences for individual
   items. Linguistic features of the stimuli did not predict these item
   preferences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the neural correlates of morphological
   priming in overt Dutch language production using a long-lag priming
   paradigm. Compound words were read out loud as primes that were
   morphologically related to picture names (e.g. the word jaszak, `coat
   pocket' was used for a picture of a coat; Dutch jas), or primes were
   form-related, but not morphologically related monomorphemic words (e.g.
   jasmijn, `jasmine'). The morphologically related compounds could be
   semantically transparent (e.g. eksternest, `magpie nest') or opaque
   (e.g. eksteroog, lit. `magpie eye,' corn,' for a picture of a magpie,
   Dutch ekster). These four priming conditions were complemented by two
   matched, unrelated conditions. The production of morphologically
   related, complex words but not the production of form-related words
   facilitated subsequent picture naming. Also, morphologically related but
   not form-related words led to a neural priming effect in the left
   inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). The effects did not differ for
   transparent and opaque relations. The results point to a functional role
   of LIFG in morphological information processing during language
   production contrary to previous meta-analytic findings. Specifically,
   morphological priming effects in language production seem to be
   independent from semantic overlap. However, further research should
   confirm the independence of morphological and phonological factors. It
   is suggested that LIFG subserves word form encoding in language
   production. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The vast maojority of decision-making research is performed under the
   assumption of the value maxing principle. This principle implies that
   when making decisions, individuals try to optimize outcomes on the basis
   of cold mathematical equations. However, decisions are emotion-laden
   rather thatn cool and analytic when they tap into life-threatening
   considerations. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this
   study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying vital loss
   decisions. Participants were asked to make a forced choice between two
   losses across three conditions: both losses are trivial
   (trivial-trivial), both losses are viral (vital-vital), or one loss is
   trivial and the other is vital (vital-trivial). Out results revealed
   that the amygdala was more active and correlated positively with
   self-reported negative emotion associated with choice during vital-vital
   loss decisions, when compared to trivial-trivial loss decisions. The
   rostral anterior cingulate cortex was also more active and correlated
   positively with self-reported positive emotion of choice diring
   vital-trivial loss decisions. Out findings suggest that vital loss
   decisions involve emotions and cannot be adequately captured by cold
   computation of minimizing losses. This research will shed light on how
   people make vital loss decisions.}},

   Insights from fMRI}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{The dominant theories about risky decision-making assume that decision
   conflicts are solved by a compensatory process involving a trade-off of
   probability against payoff, but it is unclear whether these theories
   actually represent the events that occur when people make a risky
   decision. By contrasting a preferential choice with a judgment-based
   choice that required a compensatory process, we explored the mechanisms
   underlying risky decision-making. First, using parametric analyses, we
   identified the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) as the specific
   region in charge of task-related conflict in risky decision-making
   tasks. We also showed that the dMPFC was activated less when
   judgment-based choices were being made, implying that the conflict
   experienced during a judgment-based choice was not as strong as the
   conflict that was experienced during the preferential choice. Our
   results provide neural evidence that preferential choice cannot be
   characterized solely as a compensatory process. Thus, questions were
   raised about whether existing compensatory theories could adequately
   describe individual risky decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is often described as a period of heightened reactivity to
   emotions paired with reduced regulatory capacities, a combination
   suggested to contribute to risk-taking and susceptibility to peer
   influence during puberty. However, no longitudinal research has
   definitively linked these behavioral changes to underlying neural
   development. Here, 38 neurotypical participants underwent two fMRI
   sessions across the transition from late childhood (10 years) to early
   adolescence (13 years). Responses to affective facial displays exhibited
   a combination of general and emotion-specific changes in ventral
   striatum (VS), ventromedial PFC, amygdala, and temporal pole.
   Furthermore, VS activity increases correlated with decreases in
   susceptibility to peer influence and risky behavior. VS and amygdala
   responses were also significantly more negatively coupled in early
   adolescence than in late childhood while processing sad and happy versus
   neutral faces. Together, these results suggest that VS responses to
   viewing emotions may play a regulatory role that is critical to
   adolescent interpersonal functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Specific anxiety disorders are characterized by altered emotion
   processing of phobia-specific stimuli at the neurobiological level.
   Recent work has concentrated on specific anxiety-provoking stimuli;
   focusing on arousal- or fear-related brain areas such as the amygdala.
   We analyzed brain activation during the cued anticipation of unpleasant
   or uncertain emotional stimuli as a means of modeling an unspecific
   anxiety-laden situation. Sixteen patients with social anxiety disorder
   (SAD) and eighteen healthy control subjects completed a task during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging involving the anticipation of cued
   visual stimuli with prior known emotional valence (positive, negative,
   and neutral) or prior unknown/ambiguous emotional content. The
   anticipated stimuli had no social phobia specific content. During the
   anticipation of emotional stimuli of prior known negative and prior
   ambiguous emotional valence, brain activity in patients with SAD was
   increased in the upper midbrain/dorsal thalamus, the amygdala, and in
   temporo-occipital and parietal regions as compared to control subjects.
   Activity was decreased in SAD in left orbitofrontal cortex. Activations
   in the amygdala and in occipital regions correlated with trait anxiety
   and social anxiety measures. In conclusion, SAD was associated with
   enhanced activation in brain regions involved in emotional arousal as
   well as in attention and perception processing during the anticipation
   of non-specific, general emotional stimuli. Hence, our results suggest
   that patients with SAD not only have an altered processing of specific
   feared stimuli, but also a more generally disturbed emotion processing
   in basic neural pathways. These findings have implications for
   diagnostic models and the treatment of SAD. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In both monkeys and humans, the observation of actions performed by
   others activates cortical motor areas. An unresolved question concerns
   the pathways through which motor areas receive visual information
   describing motor acts. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI), we mapped the macaque brain regions activated during the
   observation of grasping actions, focusing on the superior temporal
   sulcus region (STS) and the posterior parietal lobe. Monkeys viewed
   either videos with only the grasping hand visible or videos with the
   whole actor visible. Observation of both types of grasping videos
   activated elongated regions in the depths of both lower and upper banks
   of STS, as well as parietal areas PFG and anterior intraparietal (AIP).
   The correlation of fMRI data with connectional data showed that visual
   action information, encoded in the STS, is forwarded to ventral premotor
   cortex (F5) along two distinct functional routes. One route connects the
   upper bank of the STS with area PFG, which projects, in turn, to the
   premotor area F5c. The other connects the anterior part of the lower
   bank of the STS with premotor areas F5a/p via AIP. Whereas the first
   functional route emphasizes the agent and may relay visual information
   to the parieto-frontal mirror circuit involved in understanding the
   agent's intentions, the second route emphasizes the object of the action
   and may aid in understanding motor acts with respect to their immediate
   goal.}},

Abstract = {{Language and music exhibit similar acoustic and structural properties,
   and both appear to be uniquely human. Several recent studies suggest
   that speech and music perception recruit shared computational systems,
   and a common substrate in Broca's area for hierarchical processing has
   recently been proposed. However, this claim has not been tested by
   directly comparing the spatial distribution of activations to speech and
   music processing within subjects. In the present study, participants
   listened to sentences, scrambled sentences, and novel melodies. As
   expected, large swaths of activation for both sentences and melodies
   were found bilaterally in the superior temporal lobe, overlapping in
   portions of auditory cortex. However, substantial nonoverlap was also
   found: sentences elicited more ventrolateral activation, whereas the
   melodies elicited a more dorsomedial pattern, extending into the
   parietal lobe. Multivariate pattern classification analyses indicate
   that even within the regions of blood oxygenation level-dependent
   response overlap, speech and music elicit distinguishable patterns of
   activation. Regions involved in processing hierarchical aspects of
   sentence perception were identified by contrasting sentences with
   scrambled sentences, revealing a bilateral temporal lobe network. Music
   perception showed no overlap whatsoever with this network. Broca's area
   was not robustly activated by any stimulus type. Overall, these findings
   suggest that basic hierarchical processing for music and speech recruits
   distinct cortical networks, neither of which involves Broca's area. We
   suggest that previous claims are based on data from tasks that tap
   higher-order cognitive processes, such as working memory and/or
   cognitive control, which can operate in both speech and music domains.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging can be used to feed back
   signal changes from the brain to participants such that they can train
   to modulate activation levels in specific brain areas. Here we present
   the first study combining up-regulation of brain areas for positive
   emotions with psychometric measures to assess the effect of successful
   self-regulation on subsequent mood. We localized brain areas associated
   with positive emotions through presentation of standardized pictures
   with positive valence. Participants up-regulated activation levels in
   their target area during specific periods, alternating with rest.
   Participants attained reliable self-control of the target area by the
   last of three seven-minute runs. This training effect was supported by
   an extensive network outside the targeted brain region, including higher
   sensory areas, paralimbic and orbitofrontal cortex. Self-control of
   emotion areas was not accompanied by clear changes in self-reported
   emotions; trend-level improvements on depression scores were
   counteracted by increases on measures of fatigue, resulting in no
   overall mood improvement. It is possible that benefits of self-control
   of emotion networks may only appear in people who display abnormal
   emotional homeostasis. The use of only a single, short, training
   session, overlap between positive and negative emotion networks and
   aversive reactions to the scanning environment may have prevented the
   detection of subtle changes in mood.}},

Abstract = {{The human amygdala is strongly embedded in numerous other structures of
   the limbic system, but is also a hub for a multitude of other brain
   regions it is connected with. Its major involvement in various kinds of
   integrative sensory and emotional functions makes it a cornerstone for
   self-relevant biological and social appraisals of the environment and
   consequently also for the processing of autobiographical events. Given
   its contribution to the integration of emotion, perception and cognition
   (including memory for past autobiographical events) the amygdala also
   forges the establishment and maintenance of an integrated self. Damage
   or disturbances of amygdalar connectivity may therefore lead to
   disconnection syndromes, in which the synchronous processing of
   affective and cognitive aspects of memory is impaired. We will provide
   support for this thesis by reviewing data from patients with a rare
   experiment of nature - Urbach-Wiethe disease - as well as other
   conditions associated with amygdala abnormalities. With respect to
   memory processing, we propose that the amygdala's role is to charge cues
   so that mnemonic events of a specific emotional significance can be
   successfully searched within the appropriate neural nets and
   re-activated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a review of studies that were aimed at determining
   which brain regions are recruited during visual self-recognition, with a
   particular focus on self-face recognition. A complex bilateral network,
   involving frontal, parietal and occipital areas, appears to be
   associated with self-face recognition, with a particularly high
   implication of the right hemisphere. Results indicate that it remains
   difficult to determine which specific cognitive operation is reflected
   by each recruited brain area, in part due to the variability of used
   control stimuli and experimental tasks. A synthesis of the
   interpretations provided by previous studies is presented. The relevance
   of using self-recognition as an indicator of self-awareness is
   discussed. We argue that a major aim of future research in the field
   should be to identify more clearly the cognitive operations induced by
   the perception of the self-face, and search for dissociations between
   neural correlates and cognitive components. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The `self' is increasingly used as a variable in cognitive experiments
   and correlated with activity in particular areas in the brain. At first
   glance, this seems to transform the self from an ephemeral theoretical
   entity to something concrete and measurable. However, the transformation
   is by no means unproblematic. We trace the development of two important
   experimental paradigms in the study of the self, self-face recognition
   and the adjective self ascription task. We show how the experimental
   instrumentalization has gone hand in hand with a simplification of the
   self-concept, and how more conceptual and theoretical reflections on the
   structure, function and nature of self have either disappeared
   altogether or receded into the background. We argue that this
   development impedes and complicates the interdisciplinary study of self.

Abstract = {{Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies addressing
   healthy subjects point towards posterior parietal cortex (PPC)
   involvement in episodic memory tasks. This is noteworthy, since
   neuropsychological studies usually do not connect parietal lesions to
   episodic memory impairments. Therefore an inventory of the possible
   factors behind this apparent paradox is warranted. This review compared
   fMRI studies which demonstrated PPC activity in episodic memory tasks,
   with findings with studies of patients with PPC lesions. A systematic
   evaluation of possible explanations for the posterior parietal paradox
   indicates that PPC activation in fMRI studies does not appear to be
   attributable to confounding cognitive/psychomotor processes, such as
   button pressing or stimulus processing. What may be of more importance
   is the extent to which an episodic memory task loads on three closely
   related cognitive processes: effort and attention, self-related
   activity, and scene and image construction. We discuss to what extent
   these cognitive processes can account for the paradox between lesion and
   fMRI results. They are strongly intertwined with the episodic memory and
   may critically determine in how far the PPC plays a role in a given
   memory task. Future patient studies might profit from specifically
   taking these cognitive factors into consideration in the task design.}},

Title = {{An Anterior-to-Posterior Shift in Mid line Cortical Activity in
   Schizophrenia During Self-Reflection}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{415-423}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Deficits in social cognition, including impairments in
   self-awareness, contribute to the overall functional disability
   associated with schizophrenia. Studies in healthy subjects have shown
   that social cognitive functions, including self-reflection, rely on the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate gyrus, and these
   regions exhibit highly correlated activity during ``resting{''} states.
   In this study, we tested the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia
   show dysfunction of this network during self-reflection and that this
   abnormal activity is associated with changes in the strength of
   resting-state correlations between these regions.
   Methods: Activation during self-reflection and control tasks was
   measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 19 patients with
   schizophrenia and 20 demographically matched control subjects. In
   addition, the resting-state functional connectivity of midline cortical
   areas showing abnormal self-reflection-related activation in
   schizophrenia was measured.
   Results: Compared with control subjects, the schizophrenia patients
   demonstrated lower activation of the right ventral mPFC and greater
   activation of the mid/posterior cingulate gyri bilaterally during
   self-reflection, relative to a control task. A similar pattern was seen
   during overall social reflection. In addition, functional connectivity
   between the portion of the left mid/posterior cingulate gyrus showing
   abnormally elevated activity during self-reflection in schizophrenia,
   and the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus was lower in the schizophrenia
   patients compared with control subjects.
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia is associated with an anterior-to-posterior
   shift in introspection-related activation, as well as changes in
   functional connectivity, of the midline cortex. These findings provide
   support for the hypothesis that aberrant midline cortical function
   contributes to social cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Despite empathy's importance for promoting social interactions,
   neuroimaging research has largely overlooked empathy during social
   experiences. Here, we examined neural activity during empathy for social
   exclusion and assessed how empathy-related neural processes might relate
   to subsequent prosocial behavior toward the excluded victim. During an
   fMRI scan, participants observed one person being excluded by two
   others, and afterwards sent emails to each of these `people.' Later, a
   group of raters assessed how prosocial (e.g., helpful, comforting) the
   emails were. Observing exclusion (vs. inclusion) activated regions
   associated with mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, medial
   prefrontal cortex, precuneus), and highly empathic individuals activated
   both mentalizing regions and social pain-related regions (anterior
   insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Additionally, the
   empathy-related activity in the anterior insula and medial prefrontal
   cortex was associated with later prosocial behavior toward the victim,
   and exploratory mediation analyses indicated that medial prefrontal
   cortex activity, in particular, may support the link between trait
   empathy and prosocial behavior. Overall, findings suggest that
   empathy-related neural responses to social experiences may promote
   spontaneous prosocial treatment of those in need. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Human gaze is a critical social cue that can reveal intentions and
   dispositions of others. The right posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) is thought to be critically involved in processing eye gaze
   information. We combined diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify direct neural connections
   of right pSTS and to determine how these connections are modulated by
   the social significance of perceived gaze shifts. Participants saw faces
   with direct or averted gaze during event-related fMRI. Half of these
   faces remained static, and half displayed a dynamic gaze shift either
   towards or away from the subject. Social attention (dynamic gaze shifts
   towards the observer) not only increased activity in right pSTS, but
   also its functional connectivity with the right anterior insula (alns)
   and right fusiform gyrus (FG). However, direct fiber connections from
   pSTS were demonstrated by DTI for the right alns, but not the right FG.
   Moreover, the right FG responded to eye motion irrespective of direction
   and social significance; whereas the right alns was selectively
   sensitive to social significance (i.e. gaze shifts towards the
   observer), but not generally to eye motion. We conclude that the social
   aspects of mutual gaze contact are processed by direct fiber pathways
   between right pSTS and right alns; whereas increased connectivity with
   FG could reflect an enhanced perceptual analysis of changing facial
   features in dynamic gaze conditions and involves indirect fiber pathways
   with pSTS, perhaps via motion-selective regions in middle temporal (MT)
   gyrus that exhibited strong white-matter connections with both pSTS and
   FG and could thus provide inputs to these two areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{For about two decades now, the localization of the brain regions
   involved in reasoning processes is being investigated through fMRI
   studies, and it is known that for a transitive form of reasoning the
   frontal and parietal regions are most active. In contrast, less is known
   about the information exchange during the performance of such complex
   tasks. In this study, the propagation of brain activity during a
   transitive reasoning task was investigated and compared to the
   propagation during a simple memory task. We studied EEG transmission
   patterns obtained for physiological indicators of brain activity and
   determined whether there are frequency bands specifically related to
   this type of cognitive operations. The analysis was performed by means
   of the directed transfer function. The transmission patterns were
   determined in the theta, alpha and gamma bands. The results show
   stronger transmissions in theta and alpha bands from frontal to parietal
   as well as within frontal regions in reasoning trials comparing to
   memory trials. The increase in theta and alpha transmissions was
   accompanied by flows in gamma band from right posterior to left
   posterior and anterior sites. These results are consistent with previous
   neuroimaging (fMRI) data concerning fronto-parietal regions involvement
   in reasoning and working memory processes and also provide new evidence
   for the executive role of frontal theta waves in organizing the

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are typically characterized by impaired
   social interaction and communication, narrow interests, and repetitive
   behaviors. The heterogeneity in the severity of these characteristics
   across individuals with ASD has led some researchers to suggest that
   these disorders form a continuum which extends into the general, or
   ``typical,{''} population, and there is growing evidence that the extent
   to which typical adults display autistic traits, as measured using the
   autism-spectrum quotient (AQ), predicts performance on behavioral tasks
   that are impaired in ASD. Here, we show that variation in autism
   spectrum traits is related to cortical structure and function within the
   typical population. Voxel-based morphometry showed that increased AQ
   scores were associated with decreased white matter volume in the
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), a region important in
   processing socially relevant stimuli and associated with structural and
   functional impairments in ASD. In addition, AQ was correlated with the
   extent of cortical deactivation of an adjacent area of pSTS during a
   Stroop task relative to rest, reflecting variation in resting state
   function. The results provide evidence that autism spectrum
   characteristics are reflected in neural structure and function across
   the typical (non-ASD) population.}},

Abstract = {{A chronic tendency to avoid novelty is often the result of a
   temperamental bias called inhibited temperament, and is associated with
   increased risk for anxiety disorders. Neuroimaging studies have
   demonstrated that an inhibited temperament is associated with increased
   amygdalar blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) response to
   unfamiliar faces that were not expected; however, the effects of
   variations in expectancy remain unknown. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), we studied BOLD response to infrequently
   encountered fear faces that were either expected or not expected in 42
   adults with an inhibited or an uninhibited temperament. Individuals with
   an inhibited temperament had greater amygdala, but less dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC), BOLD response when the stimuli were expected.
   In contrast, those with an uninhibited temperament had a smaller
   amygdala but larger dorsal anterior cingulate cortex BOLD response when

Abstract = {{Background: Anxiety Sensitivity (AS), the tendency to fear the thoughts,
   symptoms, and social consequences associated with the experience of
   anxiety, is associated with increased risk for developing anxiety
   disorders. Some evidence suggests that higher scores on the Anxiety
   Sensitivity Index (ASI), a measure of the AS construct, are associated
   with activation of the anterior insular cortex during overt emotion
   perception. Although the ASI provides subscale scores measuring
   Physical, Mental Incapacitation, and Social Concerns of AS, no study has
   examined the relationship between these factors and regional brain
   activation during affect processing. We hypothesized that insular
   responses to fear-related stimuli would be primarily related to the
   Physical Concerns subscale of the ASI, particularly for a sample of
   subjects with specific phobias. Methods: Adult healthy controls (HC; n =
   22) and individuals with specific phobia, small animal subtype (SAP; n =
   17), completed the ASI and underwent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging while engaged in a backward-masked affect perception task that
   presents emotional facial stimuli below the threshold of conscious
   perception. Results: Groups did not differ in ASI, state or trait
   anxiety scores, or insula activation. Total ASI scores were positively
   correlated with activation in the right middle/anterior insula for the
   combined sample and for the HC and SAP groups separately. Multiple
   regression analysis revealed that the relationship between AS and
   insular activation was primarily accounted for by Physical Concerns
   only. Conclusions: Findings support the hypothesized role of the right
   anterior insula in the visceral/interoceptive aspects of AS, even in
   response to masked affective stimuli. Depression and Anxiety 28:243-249,

Abstract = {{We used concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation and functional MRI
   (TMS-fMRI) during a visuospatial cueing paradigm in humans, to study the
   causal role of the right angular gyrus (AG) as a source of attentional
   control. Our findings show that TMS over the right AG (high vs. low
   intensity) modulates neural responses interhemispherically, in a manner
   that varies dynamically with the current attentional condition. The
   behavioural impact of such TMS depended not only on the target hemifield
   but also on exogenous cue validity, facilitating spatial reorienting to
   invalidly cued right visual targets. On a neural level, right AG TMS had
   corresponding interhemispheric effects in the left AG and left
   retinotopic cortex, including area V1. We conclude that the direction of
   covert visuospatial attention can involve dynamic interplay between the
   right AG and remote interconnected regions of the opposite left
   hemisphere, whereas our findings also suggest that the right AG can
   influence responses in the retinotopic visual cortex.}},

Journal = {{HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{177-185}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The current study tested whether neural activity in response
   to messages designed to help smokers quit could predict smoking
   reduction, above and beyond self-report. Design: Using neural activity
   in an a priori region of interest (a subregion of medial prefrontal
   cortex {[}MPFC]), in response to ads designed to help smokers quit
   smoking, we prospectively predicted reductions in smoking in a community
   sample of smokers (N = 28) who were attempting to quit smoking. Smoking
   was assessed via expired carbon monoxide (CO; a biological measure of
   recent smoking) at baseline and 1 month following exposure to
   professionally developed quitting ads. Results: A positive relationship
   was observed between activity in the MPFC region of interest and
   successful quitting (increased activity in MPFC was associated with a
   greater decrease in expired CO). The addition of neural activity to a
   model predicting changes in CO from self-reported intentions,
   self-efficacy, and ability to relate to the messages significantly
   improved model fit, doubling the variance explained (R(self-report)(2) =
   .15, R(self-report)(2) (+ neural activity) = .35, R(change)(2) = .20).
   Conclusion: Neural activity is a useful complement to existing
   self-report measures. In this investigation, we extend prior work
   predicting behavior change based on neural activity in response to
   persuasive media to an important health domain and discuss potential
   psychological interpretations of the brain behavior link. Our results
   support a novel use of neuroimaging technology for understanding the
   psychology of behavior change and facilitating health promotion.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{296-305}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) involve a core deficit in social
   functioning and impairments in the ability to recognize face emotions.
   In an emotional faces task designed to constrain group differences in
   attention, the present study used functional MRI to characterize
   activation in the amygdala, ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC), and
   striatum, three structures involved in socio-emotional processing in
   adolescents with ASD.
   Methods:
   Twenty-two adolescents with ASD and 20 healthy adolescents viewed facial
   expressions (happy, fearful, sad and neutral) that were briefly
   presented (250 ms) during functional MRI acquisition. To monitor
   attention, subjects pressed a button to identify the gender of each
   face.
   Results:
   The ASD group showed greater activation to the faces relative to the
   control group in the amygdala, vPFC and striatum. Follow-up analyses
   indicated that the ASD relative to control group showed greater
   activation in the amygdala, vPFC and striatum (p < .05 small volume
   corrected), particularly to sad faces. Moreover, in the ASD group, there
   was a negative correlation between developmental variables (age and
   pubertal status) and mean activation from the whole bilateral amygdala;
   younger adolescents showed greater activation than older adolescents.
   There were no group differences in accuracy or reaction time in the
   gender identification task.
   Conclusions:
   When group differences in attention to facial expressions were limited,
   adolescents with ASD showed greater activation in structures involved in
   socio-emotional processing.}},

Abstract = {{Agency attribution is a hallmark of mind perception; thus, diminished
   attributions of agency may disrupt social-cognition processes typically
   elicited by human targets. The current studies examine the effect of
   perceivers' sexist attitudes on associations of agency with, and neural
   responses to, images of sexualized and clothed men and women. In Study
   1, male (but not female) participants with higher hostile sexism scores
   more quickly associated sexualized women with first-person action verbs
   ({''}handle{''}) and clothed women with third-person action verbs
   ({''}handles{''}) than the inverse, as compared to their less sexist
   peers. In Study 2, hostile sexism correlated negatively with activation
   of regions associated with mental state attribution-medial prefrontal
   cortex, posterior cingulate, temporal poles-but onlywhen viewing
   sexualized women. Heterosexual men best recognized images of sexualized
   female bodies (but not faces), as compared with other targets' bodies;
   however, neither face nor body recognition was related to hostile
   sexism, suggesting that the fMRI findings are not explained by more or
   less attention to sexualized female targets. Diminished mental state
   attribution is not unique to targets that people prefer to avoid, as in
   dehumanization of stigmatized people. The current studies demonstrate
   that appetitive social targets may elicit a similar response depending
   on perceivers' attitudes toward them.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{699-715}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Special processes recruited during the recognition of personally
   familiar people have been assumed to reflect the rich episodic and
   semantic information that selectively represents each person. However,
   the processes may also include person nonselective ones, which may
   require interpretation in terms beyond the memory mechanism. To examine
   this possibility, we assessed decrease in differential activation during
   the second presentation of an identical face (repetition suppression) as
   an index of person selectivity. During fMRI, pictures of personally
   familiar, famous, and unfamiliar faces were presented to healthy
   subjects who performed a familiarity judgment. Each face was presented
   once in the first half of the experiment and again in the second half.
   The right inferior temporal and left inferior frontal gyri were
   activated during the recognition of both types of familiar faces
   initially, and this activation was suppressed with repetition. Among
   preferentially activated regions for personally familiar over famous
   faces, robust suppression in differential activation was exhibited in
   the bilateral medial and anterior temporal structures, left amygdala,
   and right posterior STS, all of which are known to process episodic and
   semantic information. On the other hand, suppression was minimal in the
   posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, right inferior frontal, and
   intraparietal regions, some of which were implicated in social cognition
   and cognitive control. Thus, the recognition of personally familiar
   people is characterized not only by person-selective representation but
   also by nonselective processes requiring a research framework beyond the
   memory mechanism, such as a social adaptive response.}},

Abstract = {{The regulation of affective arousal is a critical aspect of children's
   social and cognitive development. However, few studies have examined the
   brain mechanisms involved in the development of this aspect of ``hot{''}
   executive functioning. This process has been conceptualized as involving
   prefrontal control of the amygdala. Here, using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the brain mechanisms involved
   in the development of affective regulation in typically developing 5- to
   11-year-olds and an adult comparison sample. Children and adults
   displayed differing patterns of increased anterior cingulate cortex and
   decreased amygdala activation during episodes in which emotion
   regulation was required. Specifically, amygdala activation increased in
   adults but decreased in children during recovery from a frustrating
   episode. In addition, we used effective connectivity analyses to
   investigate differential correlations between key emotional brain areas
   in response to the regulatory task demands. We found reliable increases
   in effective connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the
   amygdala during periods of increased demand for emotion regulation. This
   effective connectivity increased with age. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Objective: Poor social functioning is a hallmark of schizophrenia and
   may precede the onset of illness. One of the most robust predictors of
   social impairment is a deficit in the ability to appreciate the mental
   states of others ({''}theory of mind{''}; ToM). We therefore examined
   ToM in subjects at risk of developing psychosis using an fMRI paradigm
   and compared brain activations with those of patients with manifest
   schizophrenia and healthy controls.
   Method: Ten subjects with at-risk ({''}prodromal{''}) states of
   psychosis, 22 schizophrenia patients and 26 healthy controls were
   recruited. During fMRI scanning, participants were shown a series of
   cartoons. The task was to infer the mental states of the cartoon
   characters in terms of beliefs, states of knowledge and intentions.
   Results: Subjects at risk of psychosis activated the ToM neural network
   comprising the prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, and
   the temporoparietal cortex more strongly than patients with manifest
   schizophrenia, and, in part, also more strongly than healthy controls.
   Manifest schizophrenia patients and controls activated the ToM neural
   network differently with little overlap of activated regions, where
   overall, controls showed stronger activations than schizophrenia
   patients.
   Conclusions: Individuals with at-risk states of schizophrenia activate
   the ToM neural network differently, and in part, more strongly compared
   to patients with schizophrenia and controls. This could suggest a
   compensatory overactivation of brain regions critical for empathic
   responses during mental state attribution in at-risk subjects for
   schizophrenia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{The human amygdala is known to be involved in processing social,
   emotional, and reward-related information. Previous reports have
   indicated that the amygdala is involved in extracting trustworthiness
   information from faces. Interestingly, functional neuroimaging research
   using economic tasks that presumably require developing and/or
   expressing interpersonal trust, such as the Trust Game (TG), have not
   routinely identified involvement of the amygdala. The present study
   sought to explore the role of the amygdala in developing and expressing
   interpersonal trust, via a multi-round, multiplayer economic exchange, a
   version of the TG, in a large sample of participants with focal brain
   damage. Participants with unilateral damage to the amygdala displayed
   increased benevolent behavior in the TG, and specifically, they tended
   to increase trust in response to betrayals. On the other hand,
   neurologically normal adults tended to repay trust in kind, i.e., they
   decreased interpersonal trust in response to betrayals or increased
   trust in response to increases from others. Comparison participants,
   with brain damage that does not include the amygdala, ventromedial
   prefrontal or insular cortices, tended to behave ambivalently to the
   expressed trust or betrayal of others. Our data suggest that the
   amygdala is necessary for developing and expressing normal interpersonal
   trust. This increased tendency to behave benevolently in response to
   defections from others may be related to the abnormal social behavior
   observed in this group. Moreover, increased benevolence may increase the
   likelihood or opportunity to be taken advantage of by others. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{A recent set of articles in Perspectives on Psychological Science
   discussed inflated correlations between brain measures and behavioral
   criteria when measurement points (voxels) are deliberately selected to
   maximize criterion correlations (the target article was Vul, Harris,
   Winkielman, \& Pashler, 2009). However, closer inspection reveals that
   this problem is only a special symptom of a broader methodological
   problem that characterizes all paradigmatic research, not just
   neuroscience. Researchers not only select voxels to inflate effect size,
   they also select stimuli, task settings, favorable boundary conditions,
   dependent variables and independent variables, treatment levels,
   moderators, mediators, and multiple parameter settings in such a way
   that empirical phenomena become maximally visible and stable. In
   general, paradigms can be understood as conventional setups for
   producing idealized, inflated effects. Although the feasibility of
   representative designs is restricted, a viable remedy lies in a
   reorientation of paradigmatic research from the visibility of strong
   effect sizes to genuine validity and scientific scrutiny.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{306-313}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Intergroup competition makes social identity salient, which in turn
   affects how people respond to competitors' hardships. The failures of an
   in-group member are painful, whereas those of a rival out-group member
   may give pleasure-a feeling that may motivate harming rivals. The
   present study examined whether valuation-related neural responses to
   rival groups' failures correlate with likelihood of harming individuals
   associated with those rivals. Avid fans of the Red Sox and Yankees teams
   viewed baseball plays while undergoing functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Subjectively negative outcomes (failure of the favored team or
   success of the rival team) activated anterior cingulate cortex and
   insula, whereas positive outcomes (success of the favored team or
   failure of the rival team, even against a third team) activated ventral
   striatum. The ventral striatum effect, associated with subjective
   pleasure, also correlated with self-reported likelihood of aggressing
   against a fan of the rival team (controlling for general aggression).
   Outcomes of social group competition can directly affect primary
   reward-processing neural systems, which has implications for intergroup
   harm.}},

   Differentiates Moral Cognitions Related to Care and Justice Ethics}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Moral sensitivity refers to the interpretive awareness of
   moral conflict and can be justice or care oriented. Justice ethics is
   associated primarily with human rights and the application of moral
   rules, whereas care ethics is related to human needs and a situational
   approach involving social emotions. Among the core brain regions
   involved in moral issue processing are: medial prefrontal cortex,
   anterior (ACC) and posterior (PCC) cingulate cortex, posterior superior
   temporal sulcus (pSTS), insula and amygdala. This study sought to inform
   the long standing debate of whether care and justice moral ethics
   represent one or two different forms of cognition.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Model-free and model-based connectivity
   analysis were used to identify functional neural networks underlying
   care and justice ethics for a moral sensitivity task. In addition to
   modest differences in patterns of associated neural activity, distinct
   modes of functional and effective connectivity were observed for moral
   sensitivity for care and justice issues that were modulated by
   individual variation in moral ability.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results support a neurobiological
   differentiation between care and justice ethics and suggest that human
   moral behavior reflects the outcome of integrating opposing rule-based,
   self-other perspectives, and emotional responses.}},

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2792-2800}},
Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that when we observe somebody else
   executing an action many areas of our own motor systems are active. It
   has been argued that these motor activations are evidence that we
   motorically simulate observed actions; this motoric simulation may
   support various functions such as imitation and action understanding.
   However, whether motoric simulation is indeed the function of motor
   activations during action observation is controversial, due to
   inconsistency in findings. Previous studies have demonstrated dynamic
   modulations in motor activity when we execute actions. Therefore, if we
   do motorically simulate observed actions, our motor systems should also
   be modulated dynamically, and in a corresponding fashion, during action
   observation. Using magnetoen-cephalography, we recorded the cortical
   activity of human participants while they observed actions performed by
   another person. Here, we show that activity in the human motor system is
   indeed modulated dynamically during action observation. The finding that
   activity in the motor system is modulated dynamically when observing
   actions can explain why studies of action observation using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging have reported conflicting results, and is
   consistent with the hypothesis that we motorically simulate observed
   actions.}},

   Demonstrates Reproducible Cerebral Representation of Ongoing
   Post-Surgical Pain}},

Abstract = {{Development of treatments for acute and chronic pain conditions remains
   a challenge, with an unmet need for improved sensitivity and
   reproducibility in measuring pain in patients. Here we used
   pulsed-continuous arterial spin-labelling {[}pCASL], a relatively novel
   perfusion magnetic-resonance imaging technique, in conjunction with a
   commonly-used post-surgical model, to measure changes in regional
   cerebral blood flow {[}rCBF] associated with the experience of being in
   ongoing pain. We demonstrate repeatable, reproducible assessment of
   ongoing pain that is independent of patient self-report. In a crossover
   trial design, 16 participants requiring bilateral removal of lower-jaw
   third molars underwent pain-free pre-surgical pCASL scans. Following
   extraction of either left or right tooth, repeat scans were acquired
   during post-operative ongoing pain. When pain-free following surgical
   recovery, the pre/post-surgical scanning procedure was repeated for the
   remaining tooth. Voxelwise statistical comparison of pre and
   post-surgical scans was performed to reveal rCBF changes representing
   ongoing pain. In addition, rCBF values in predefined pain and control
   brain regions were obtained. rCBF increases (5-10\%) representing
   post-surgical ongoing pain were identified bilaterally in a network
   including primary and secondary somatosensory, insula and cingulate
   cortices, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain and brainstem
   (including trigeminal ganglion and principal-sensory nucleus), but not
   in a control region in visual cortex. rCBF changes were reproducible,
   with no rCBF differences identified across scans within-session or
   between post-surgical pain sessions. This is the first report of the
   cerebral representation of ongoing post-surgical pain without the need
   for exogenous tracers. Regions of rCBF increases are plausibly
   associated with pain and the technique is reproducible, providing an
   attractive proposition for testing interventions for on-going pain that
   do not rely solely on patient self-report. Our findings have the
   potential to improve our understanding of the cerebral representation of
   persistent painful conditions, leading to improved identification of
   specific patient sub-types and implementation of mechanism-based
   treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Contingency theories of goal-directed action propose that experienced
   disjunctions between an action and its specific consequences, as well as
   conjunctions between these events, contribute to encoding the
   action-outcome association. Although considerable behavioral research in
   rats and humans has provided evidence for this proposal, relatively
   little is known about the neural processes that contribute to the two
   components of the contingency calculation. Specifically, while recent
   findings suggest that the influence of action-outcome conjunctions on
   goal-directed learning is mediated by a circuit involving ventromedial
   prefrontal, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and dorsomedial striatum, the
   neural processes that mediate the influence of experienced disjunctions
   between these events are unknown. Here we show differential responses to
   probabilities of conjunctive and disjunctive reward deliveries in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the dorsomedial striatum, and the
   inferior frontal gyrus. Importantly, activity in the inferior parietal
   lobule and the left middle frontal gyrus varied with a formal
   integration of the two reward probabilities, Delta P, as did response
   rates and explicit judgments of the causal efficacy of the action.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{3111-3116}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{In the social neuroscience of face processing, multiple roles are
   attributed to amygdala: signalling of fear/threat-stimuli, of emotional
   expression, and general salience. The current study aimed at a direct
   comparison of amygdala activation attributable to these conditions by
   contrasting amygdala responses to matched emotional (threatening and
   non-threatening) and of non-emotional salient faces in a visual search
   paradigm using cartoon faces. Participants (21 healthy volunteers) had
   to detect a target face (angry, happy, blue, red, differing in the exact
   same features) in an array of closely matched non-target faces.
   Behavioural results revealed a pop-out effect for all targets compared
   to non-targets, indicating that they were all salient, independently of
   being emotional or non-emotional. While significant amygdala activation
   was obtained for all trials with salient faces (compared to those
   containing only non-target faces), no significant differences in
   activation emerged between emotional threatening, emotional
   non-threatening, and non-emotional targets. Moreover, right and left
   amygdala activation for target trials was found correlated to the
   behavioural measure of target detection. These findings provide evidence
   for a general role of the amygdala in signalling salience in a visual
   search independent of modality. Given the critical involvement of the
   amygdala in several neuropsychiatric disorders, the current findings may
   contribute to further our understanding on dysfunctional neural circuits
   in these disorders. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we show how we empirically tested one of the most relevant
   topics in philosophy of mind through a series of fMRI experiments: the
   classification of different types of intention. To this aim, firstly we
   trace a theoretical distinction among private, prospective, and
   communicative intentions. Second, we propose a set of predictions
   concerning the recognition of these three types of intention in healthy
   individuals, and we report the experimental results corroborating our
   theoretical model of intention. Third, we derive from our model
   predictions relevant for the domain of psychopathological functioning.
   In particular, we treat the cases of both hyper-intentionality (as in
   paranoid schizophrenia) and hypo-intentionality (as in autistic spectrum
   disorders). Our conclusion is that the theoretical model of intention we
   propose contributes to enlarge our knowledge on the neurobiological
   bases of intention processing, in both healthy people and in people with
   impairments to the neurocognitive system that underlies intention
   recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A combined protocol of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and
   diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was applied to investigate the
   neurodevelopment of gray and white matter in autism.
   Methods: Twenty children with autism (mean age = 7 +/- 12.75 years old;
   age range: 4-14; 2 girls) and 22 matched normally developing children
   (mean age = 7.68 +/-2.03 years old; age range: 4-11; 2 girls) underwent
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). VBM was employed by applying the
   Template-o-Matic toolbox (TOM), a new approach which constructs the
   age-matched customized template for tissue segmentation. Also, the
   apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) of water molecules were obtained
   from the analysis of DWI. Regions of interests (ROIs), standardized at 5
   pixels, were placed in cortical lobes and corpus callosum on the
   non-diffusion weighted echo-planar images (6 = 0) and were then
   automatically transferred to the corresponding maps to obtain the ADC
   values.
   Results: Compared to normal children, individuals with autism had
   significantly: (1) increased white matter volumes in the right inferior
   frontal gyrus, the right fusiform gyrus, the left precentral and
   supplementary motor area and the left hippocampus, (2) increased gray
   matter volumes in the inferior temporal gyri bilaterally, the right
   inferior parietal cortex, the right superior occipital lobe and the left
   superior parietal lobule, and (3) decreased gray matter volumes in the
   right inferior frontal gyrus and the left supplementary motor area.
   Abnormally increased ADC values in the bilateral frontal cortex and in
   the left side of the genu of the corpus callosum were also reported in
   autism. Finally, age correlated negatively with lobar and callosal ADC
   measurements in individuals with autism, but not in children with normal
   development.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest cerebral dysconnectivity in the
   early phases of autism coupled with an altered white matter maturation
   trajectory during childhood potentially taking place in the frontal and
   parietal lobes, which may represent a neurodevelopmental marker of the
   disorder, possibly accounting for the cognitive and social deficits. (C)

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{546-555}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Autistics exhibit a contrasting combination of auditory behavior, with
   enhanced pitch processing abilities often coexisting with reduced
   orienting towards complex speech sounds. Based on an analogous
   dissociation observed in vision, we expected that autistics' auditory
   behavior with respect to complex sound processing may result from
   atypical activity in non-primary auditory cortex. We employed fMRI to
   explore the neural basis of complex non-social sound processing in 15
   autistic and 13 non-autistics, using a factorial design in which
   auditory stimuli varied in spectral and temporal complexity. Spectral
   complexity was modulated by varying the harmonic content, whereas
   temporal complexity was modulated by varying frequency modulation depth.
   The detection task was performed similarly by autistics and
   non-autistics. In both groups, increasing spectral or temporal
   complexity was associated with activity increases in primary (Heschl's
   gyrus) and non-primary (anterolateral and posterior superior temporal
   gyrus) auditory cortex Activity was right-lateralized for spectral and
   left-lateralized for temporal complexity. Increasing temporal complexity
   was associated with greater activity in anterolateral superior temporal
   gyrus in non-autistics and greater effects in Heschl's gyrus in
   autistics. While we observed similar hierarchical functional
   organization for auditory processing in both groups, autistics exhibited
   diminished activity in non-primary auditory cortex and increased
   activity in primary auditory cortex in response to the presentation of
   temporally, but not of spectrally complex sounds. Greater temporal
   complexity effects in regions sensitive to acoustic features and reduced
   temporal complexity effects in regions sensitive to more abstract sound
   features could represent a greater focus towards perceptual aspects of
   speech sounds in autism. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of action observation on cortical processes have typically
   been interpreted in the context of so-called ``mirror systems{''} (i.e.,
   brain regions active during both the experience and observation of
   behaviour, emotion, or sensation), and viewed as subserving social
   cognition via a self-other matching mechanism. If such cortical
   processes do indeed facilitate social understanding, then cortical
   activity during action observation might be further enhanced when
   observing behaviour embedded within a social, interactive context.
   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was administered to 27 healthy
   adults, and corticospinal excitability (CSE), which is a putative
   measure of the mirror system, was examined during the observation of (1)
   meaningless behaviour, (2) goal-directed behaviour, and (3) social
   behaviour. Although CSE was enhanced during the observation of both
   goal-directed and social behaviour, there was no difference between the
   two. These findings suggest that while the putative human mirror system
   is responsive to goal-directed behaviour, it may not be more responsive
   to behaviour that occurs within a social context. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Predominantly, the impact of environmental noise is measured using sound
   level, ignoring the influence of other factors on subjective experience.
   The present study tested physiological responses to natural urban
   soundscapes, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and vector
   cardiogram. City-based recordings were matched in overall sound level
   (71 decibel A-weighted scale), but differed on ratings of pleasantness
   and vibrancy. Listening to soundscapes evoked significant activity in a
   number of auditory brain regions. Compared with soundscapes that evoked
   no (neutral) emotional response, those evoking a pleasant or unpleasant
   emotional response engaged an additional neural circuit including the
   right amygdala. Ratings of vibrancy had little effect overall, and brain
   responses were more sensitive to pleasantness than was heart rate. A
   novel finding is that urban soundscapes with similar loudness can have
   dramatically different effects on the brain's response to the
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, functional changes in the sensorimotor cortex following
   unilateral hand immobilisation were investigated in 11 healthy
   volunteers. Sensory and motor function of both hands was also assessed.
   Cortical activation was monitored with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging at 3 T. All examinations were performed prior to and directly
   after 72 h of immobilisation of the dominant hand and wrist. Following
   unilateral immobilisation, cortical activation increased substantially
   during tactile stimulation of the non-immobilised hand. This was
   particularly evident in the ipsilateral somatosensory cortex.
   Additionally, a redistribution of hemispheric dominance towards zero
   lateralisation was seen. A bilateral cortical activation increase was
   also seen during performance of a finger-tapping task by the
   non-immobilised hand, although this increase was less prominent than
   during tactile stimulation. In contrast, performance of the
   finger-tapping task with the immobilised hand resulted in an activation
   decrease, predominantly in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. This
   site was anatomically close to the regional activation increase of the
   non-immobilised hand. These functional changes were associated with
   reduced grip strength, dexterity and tactile discrimination of the
   immobilised hand, and simultaneously improved tactile discrimination of
   the non-immobilised hand. This suggests that brain adaptation following
   hand immobilisation includes inter-hemispheric dynamics. In summary, the
   improved sensory function of the non-immobilised hand following
   unilateral immobilisation is associated with cortical expansion,
   predominantly contralateral to the immobilised hand, and a
   redistribution of hemispheric dominance. Both cortical and clinical
   effects of immobilisation were identified after 72 h, suggesting rapid
   inter-hemispheric plasticity using existing neural substrates.}},

Abstract = {{The feeling of guilt is a complex mental state underlying several human
   behaviors in both private and social life. From a psychological and
   evolutionary viewpoint, guilt is an emotional and cognitive function,
   characterized by prosocial sentiments, entailing specific moral
   believes, which can be predominantly driven by inner values
   (deontological guilt) or by more interpersonal situations (altruistic
   guilt). The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a
   distinct neurobiological substrate for these two expressions of guilt in
   healthy individuals. We first run two behavioral studies, recruiting a
   sample of 72 healthy volunteers, to validate a set of stimuli
   selectively evoking deontological and altruistic guilt, or basic control
   emotions (i.e., anger and sadness). Similar stimuli were reproduced in a
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm, to
   investigate the neural correlates of the same emotions, in a new sample
   of 22 healthy volunteers. We show that guilty emotions, compared to
   anger and sadness, activate specific brain areas (i.e., cingulate gyrus
   and medial frontal cortex) and that different neuronal networks are
   involved in each specific kind of guilt, with the insula selectively
   responding to deontological guilt stimuli. This study provides evidence
   for the existence of distinct neural circuits involved in different
   guilty feelings. This complex emotion might account for normal
   individual attitudes and deviant social behaviors. Moreover, an abnormal
   processing of specific guilt feelings might account for some
   psychopathological manifestation, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder
   and depression. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 229-239, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{The evaluation of emotional stimuli is based on different levels of
   information processing, ranging from rather automatic processes to
   focused attention to the emotional relevance of stimuli. The role of
   specific brain areas for these processes is a matter of debate. In this
   event-related fMRI study, we varied the information processing mode of
   participants exposed to aversive and neutral pictures. Based on four
   different tasks, participants' attentional focus onto the emotional
   quality of the stimuli and the own emotional involvement was increased
   systematically across tasks. Regardless of task, stronger activation to
   threatening vs. neutral pictures was found in several regions such as
   the amygdala, anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, primary
   somatosensory cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. However, there was a
   parametric increase of activation with increasing attention to one's own
   emotion specifically in the right posterior insula and right primary and
   secondary somatosensory cortex, i.e. in areas implicated in
   self-awareness of a person's own body. These findings are in accordance
   with theories suggesting a crucial role of the perception of bodily

Abstract = {{Performing goal-directed actions toward an object in accordance with
   contextual constraints, such as the presence or absence of an obstacle,
   has been widely used as a paradigm for assessing the capacity of infants
   or nonhuman primates to evaluate the rationality of others' actions.
   Here, we have used this paradigm in a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging experiment to visualize the cortical regions involved in the
   assessment of action rationality while controlling for visual
   differences in the displays and directly correlating magnetic resonance
   activity with rationality ratings. Bilateral middle temporal gyrus (MTG)
   regions, anterior to extrastriate body area and the human middle
   temporal complex, were involved in the visual evaluation of action
   rationality. These MTG regions are embedded in the superior temporal
   sulcus regions processing the kinematics of observed actions. Our
   results suggest that rationality is assessed initially by purely visual
   computations, combining the kinematics of the action with the physical
   constraints of the environmental context. The MTG region seems to be
   sensitive to the contingent relationship between a goal-directed
   biological action and its relevant environmental constraints, showing
   increased activity when the expected pattern of rational goal attainment
   is violated.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen is critical to normal brain functioning and development. In high
   altitude where the oxygen concentration and pressure are very low, human
   cognitive capability such as working memory has been found to be
   jeopardized. Such effect might persist with long-term high-altitude
   residence. The current study investigated the verbal working memory of
   28 high-altitude residents with blood level oxygen dependent (BOLD)
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in contrast with that of
   the 30 sea level residents. All of the subjects were healthy college
   students, matched on their age, gender ratio and social-economic status;
   they also did not show any difference on their hemoglobin level. The
   high-altitude subjects showed longer reaction time and decreased
   response accuracy in behavioral performance. Both groups showed
   activation in the typical regions associated with the 2-back verbal
   working memory task, and the behavioral performance of both groups
   showed significant correlations with the BOLD signal change amplitude
   and Granger causality values (as a measure of the interregional
   effective connectivity) between these regions. With group comparison
   statistics, the high-altitude subjects showed decreased activation at
   the inferior and middle frontal gyrus, the middle occipital and the
   lingual gyrus, the pyramis of vermis, as well as the thalamus. In
   conclusion, the current study revealed impairment in verbal working
   memory among high-altitude residents, which might be associated with the
   impact of prolonged chronic hypoxia exposure on the brain functionality.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Goal-directed behavior requires cognitive control to regulate the
   occurrence of conflict. The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has
   been suggested in detecting response conflict during various conflict
   tasks. Recent findings, however, have indicated not only that two
   distinct subregions of dACC are involved in conflict processing but also
   that the conflict occurs at both perceptual and response levels. In this
   study, we sought to examine whether perceptual and response conflicts
   are functionally dissociated in dACC. Thirteen healthy subjects
   performed a version of the Stroop task during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We identified a functional
   dissociation of the caudal dACC (cdACC) and the rostral dACC (rdACC) in
   their responses to different sources of conflict. The cdACC was
   selectively engaged in perceptual conflict whereas the rdACC was more
   active in response conflict. Further, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC) was coactivated not with cdACC but with rdACC. We suggest that
   cdACC plays an important role in regulative processing of perceptual
   conflict whereas rdACC is involved in detecting response conflict. Hum

Abstract = {{In social situations, we encounter information transferred in firsthand
   (egocentric) and secondhand (allocentric) communication contexts.
   However, the mechanism by which an individual distinguishes whether a
   past interaction occurred in an egocentric versus allocentric situation
   is poorly understood. This study examined the neural bases for encoding
   memories of social interactions through experimentally manipulating the
   communication context. During fMRI data acquisition, participants
   watched video clips of an actor speaking and gesturing directly toward
   them (egocentric context) or toward an unseen third person (allocentric
   context). After scanning, a recognition task gauged participants'
   ability to recognize the sentences they had just seen and to recall the
   context in which the sentences had been spoken. We found no differences
   between the recognition of sentences spoken in egocentric and
   allocentric contexts. However, when asked about the communication
   context ({''}Had the actor directly spoken to you?{''}), participants
   tended to believe falsely that the actor had directly spoken to them
   during allocentric conditions. Greater activity in the hippocampus was
   related to correct context memory, whereas the ventral ACC was activated
   for subsequent inaccurate context memory. For the interaction between
   encoding context and context memory, we observed increased activation
   for egocentric remembered items in the bilateral and medial frontal
   cortex, the BG, and the left parietal and temporal lobe. Our data
   indicate that memories of social interactions are biased to be
   remembered egocentrically. Self-referential encoding processes reflected
   in increased frontal activation and decreased hippocampal activation
   might be the basis of correct item but false context memory of social
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Several studies have indicated that people with prodromal
   signs of psychosis show alterations in the structure and function of the
   brain when they first present to clinical services. However, the
   longitudinal course of these abnormalities, and how they relate to
   subsequent clinical and functional outcome is relatively unclear.
   Methods: A cohort of subjects at ultra high risk of psychosis were
   studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in
   conjunction with the N-Back task, and volumetric MRI at first clinical
   presentation and again after one year. Levels of psychopathology and
   global functioning were assessed at the same time points using the
   CAARMS, PANSS, and the GAF scale.
   Results: At baseline, the high risk group showed reduced activation
   during the task in the left middle frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus
   and inferior parietal lobule, and reduced gray matter volume in the left
   middle and medial frontal gyri, left insula and the right anterior
   cingulate gyrus. Within the high-risk group, there was a positive
   correlation between the magnitude of the functional and structural
   alterations in the left middle frontal gyrus. Between presentation and
   follow up, the severity of perceptual disorder and thought disorder
   (rated by the CAARMS), and of general psychopathology (rated by the
   PANSS general score) decreased, and the level of global functioning
   improved. This clinical and functional improvement was associated with a
   longitudinal increase in activation in the anterior cingulate and right
   parahippocampal gyrus. The change in anterior cingulate response was
   directly correlated with the improvement in the GAF score.
   Conclusions: In subjects presenting with prodromal signs of psychosis,
   reduced prefrontal activation during a working memory task is associated
   with a reduction in gray matter volume in the same area. Changes in
   anterior cingulate activation were correlated with functional
   improvement in this group, consistent with the role of this region in
   multiple cognitive and social processes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Background: Some gray and white matter regions of the brain are sexually
   dimorphic. The best MRI technique for identifying subtle differences in
   white matter is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The purpose of this
   paper is to investigate whether white matter patterns in female to male
   (FtM) transsexuals before commencing cross-sex hormone treatment are
   more similar to that of their biological sex or to that of their gender
   identity.
   Method: DTI was performed in 18 FtM transsexuals and 24 male and 19
   female heterosexual controls scanned with a 3 T Trio Tim Magneton.
   Fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed on white matter fibers of the
   whole brain, which was spatially analyzed using Tract-Based Spatial
   Statistics.
   Results: In controls, males have significantly higher FA values than
   females in the medial and posterior parts of the right superior
   longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the forceps minor, and the corticospinal
   tract. Compared to control females, FtM showed higher FA values in
   posterior part of the right SLF, the forceps minor and corticospinal
   tract. Compared to control males, FtM showed only lower FA values in the
   corticospinal tract.
   Conclusions: Our results show that the white matter microstructure
   pattern in untreated FtM transsexuals is closer to the pattern of
   subjects who share their gender identity (males) than those who share
   their biological sex (females). Our results provide evidence for an
   inherent difference in the brain structure of FtM transsexuals. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Social exclusion inherently involves an element of expectancy violation,
   in that we expect other people to follow the unwritten rule to include
   us in social interactions. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study, we employed a unique modification of an interactive
   virtual ball-tossing game called ``Cyberball{''} (Williams et al.. 2000)
   and a novel paradigm called ``Cybershape,{''} in which rules are broken
   in the absence of social exclusion, to dissociate brain regions that
   process social exclusion from rule violations more generally. Our
   Cyberball game employed an alternating block design and removed evoked
   responses to events when the participant was throwing the ball in
   inclusion to make this condition comparable to exclusion, where
   participants did not throw. With these modifications, we replicated
   prior findings of ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), insula, and
   posterior cingulate cortex activity evoked by social exclusion relative
   to inclusion. We also identified exclusion-evoked activity in the
   hippocampi, left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and left middle
   temporal gyrus. Comparing social exclusion and rule violation revealed a
   functional dissociation in the active neural systems as well as
   differential functional connectivity with vACC. Some overlap was
   observed in regions differentially modulated by social exclusion and
   rule violation, including the vACC and lateral parietal cortex. These
   overlapping brain regions showed different activation during social
   exclusion compared to rule violation, each relative to fair play.
   Comparing activation patterns to social exclusion and rule violation
   allowed for the dissociation of brain regions involved in the experience
   of exclusion versus expectancy violation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A growing body of evidence suggests that empathy for pain is underpinned
   by neural structures that are also involved in the direct experience of
   pain. In order to assess the consistency of this finding, an image-based
   meta-analysis of nine independent functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) investigations and a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 32 studies
   that had investigated empathy for pain using fMRI were conducted. The
   results indicate that a core network consisting of bilateral anterior
   insular cortex and medial/anterior cingulate cortex is associated with
   empathy for pain. Activation in these areas overlaps with activation
   during directly experienced pain, and we link their involvement to
   representing global feeling states and the guidance of adaptive behavior
   for both self- and other-related experiences. Moreover, the image-based
   analysis demonstrates that depending on the type of experimental
   paradigm this core network was co-activated with distinct brain regions:
   While viewing pictures of body parts in painful situations recruited
   areas underpinning action understanding (inferior parietal/ventral
   premotor cortices) to a stronger extent, eliciting empathy by means of
   abstract visual information about the other's affective state more
   strongly engaged areas associated with inferring and representing mental
   states of self and other (precuneus, ventral medial prefrontal cortex,
   superior temporal cortex, and temporo-parietal junction). In addition,
   only the picture-based paradigms activated somatosensory areas,
   indicating that previous discrepancies concerning somatosensory activity
   during empathy for pain might have resulted from differences in
   experimental paradigms. We conclude that social neuroscience paradigms
   provide reliable and accurate insights into complex social phenomena
   such as empathy and that meta-analyses of previous studies are a
   valuable tool in this endeavor. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Faces are multidimensional stimuli that convey information for complex
   social and emotional functions. Separate neural systems have been
   implicated in the recognition of facial identity (mainly extrastriate
   visual cortex) and emotional expression (limbic areas and the superior
   temporal sulcus). Working-memory (WM) studies with faces have shown
   different but partly overlapping activation patterns in comparison to
   spatial WM in parietal and prefrontal areas. However, little is known
   about the neural representations of the different facial dimensions
   during WM. In the present study 22 subjects performed a face-identity or
   face-emotion WM task at different load levels during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. We found a fronto-parietal-visual WM-network for both
   tasks during maintenance, including fusiform gyrus. Limbic areas in the
   amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus demonstrated a stronger activation
   for the identity than the emotion condition. One explanation for this
   finding is that the repetitive presentation of faces with different
   identities but the same emotional expression during the identity-task is
   responsible for the stronger increase in BOLD signal in the amygdala.
   These results raise the question how different emotional expressions are
   coded in WM. Our findings suggest that emotional expressions are
   re-coded in an abstract representation that is supported at the neural
   level by the canonical fronto-parietal WM network. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   amygdala activity}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{1371}},
Pages = {{87-99}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Facial emotion perception plays a fundamental role in interpersonal
   social interactions. Images of faces contain visual information at
   various spatial frequencies. The amygdala has previously been reported
   to be preferentially responsive to low-spatial frequency (LSF) rather
   than to high-spatial frequency (HSF) filtered images of faces presented
   at the center of the visual field. Furthermore, it has been proposed
   that the amygdala might be especially sensitive to affective stimuli in
   the periphery. In the present study we investigated the impact of
   spatial frequency and stimulus eccentricity on face processing in the
   human amygdala and fusiform gyrus using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). The spatial frequencies of pictures of fearful faces
   were filtered to produce images that retained only LSF or HSF
   information. Facial images were presented either in the left or right
   visual field at two different eccentricities. In contrast to previous
   findings, we found that the amygdala responds to LSF and HSF stimuli in
   a similar manner regardless of the location of the affective stimuli in
   the visual field. Furthermore, the fusiform gyrus did not show
   differential responses to spatial frequency filtered images of faces.
   Our findings argue against the view that LSF information plays a crucial
   role in the processing of facial expressions in the amygdala and of a
   higher sensitivity to affective stimuli in the periphery. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Investigating the organization of trait aggression and impulsivity in
   the prefrontal cortex (PFC) advances our understanding of the
   neuropsychobiology of self-control. While the orbital aspect of the PFC
   (OFC) has received attention, there is reason to believe the lateral
   aspect is also relevant. In the current study using magnetic resonance
   imaging, gray matter volumes in lateral PFC (LPFC) were derived in a
   heterogeneous male psychiatric sample (N = 36) in which OFC volumes had
   previously been reported. In an analysis using self-report measures of
   trait impulsivity and aggression, the left LPFC accounted for
   significant variance in attentional aspects of impulsivity (13\%) and
   aggression (10\%) but not motor aspects of impulsivity, as hypothesized.
   The OFC was associated with motor impulsivity (left-20\%; right-14\%)
   and was also more robustly associated with aggression (left-36\%;
   right-16\%). A social/emotional information processing model was
   explored, based upon whether the LPFC or the OFC depended upon one
   another for their association to trait aggression and impulsivity. It
   was demonstrated that association of the LPFC to both aggression and
   attentional impulsivity depended upon the OFC, while the converse was
   not supported. The LPFC appears relevant to the higher-order aspects of
   a cortical self-control network, and that relevance is dependent upon
   the robust contribution of the OFC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In natural environments, a sound can be heard as stable despite the
   presence of other occasionally louder sounds. For example, when a
   portion in a voice is replaced by masking noise, the interrupted voice
   may still appear illusorily continuous. Previous research found that
   continuity illusions of simple interrupted sounds, such as tones, are
   accompanied by weaker activity in the primary auditory cortex (PAC)
   during the interruption than veridical discontinuity percepts of these
   sounds. Here, we studied whether continuity illusions of more natural
   and more complex sounds also emerge from this mechanism. We used
   psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans to
   measure simultaneously continuity ratings and blood oxygenation
   level-dependent activity to vowels that were partially replaced by
   masking noise. Consistent with previous results on tone continuity
   illusions, we found listeners' reports of more salient vowel continuity
   illusions associated with weaker activity in auditory cortex (compared
   with reports of veridical discontinuity percepts of physically identical
   stimuli). In contrast to the reduced activity to tone continuity
   illusions in PAC, this reduction was localized in the right
   anterolateral Heschl's gyrus, a region that corresponds more to the
   non-PAC. Our findings suggest that the ability to hear differently
   complex sounds as stable during other louder sounds may be attributable
   to a common suppressive mechanism that operates at different levels of
   sound representation in auditory cortex.}},

   Go/NoGo task and psychotic symptoms assessed by the PANSS five-factor
   model in patients with schizophrenia. Subjects in both groups performed
   well on the task, and the omission and commission error rates in the
   NoGo condition showed no statistically significant differences. The
   comparison of prefrontal activation between the Go condition and the
   NoGo condition in each group revealed that the healthy controls had a
   significant deactivation during the NoGo condition in the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and such changes were not shown in patients
   with schizophrenia. Furthermore, in patients with schizophrenia, the
   excitement score of the PANSS five-factor model was positively
   correlated with the activation in the right prefrontal cortex and
   frontopolar region. These results suggested that the abnormal prefrontal
   activity during simple inhibition of response would be associated with
   excitement symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Previous event-related potentials research has suggested that the N170
   component has a larger amplitude to faces and words than to other
   stimuli, but it remains unclear whether it indexes the same cognitive
   processes for faces and for words. The present study investigated how
   category-level repetition effects on the N170 differ across stimulus
   categories. Faces, cars, words, and non-words were presented in
   homogeneous (1 category) or mixed blocks (2 intermixed categories). We
   found a significant repetition effect of N170 amplitude for successively
   presented faces and cars (in homogeneous blocks), but not for words and
   unpronounceable consonant strings, suggesting that the N170 indexes
   different underlying cognitive processes for objects (including faces)
   and orthographic stimuli. The N170 amplitude was significantly smaller
   when multiple faces or multiple cars were presented in a row than when
   these stimuli were preceded by a stimulus of a different category.
   Moreover, the large N170 repetition effect for faces may be important to
   consider when comparing the relative N170 amplitude for different
   stimulus categories. Indeed, a larger N170 deflection for faces than for
   other stimulus categories was observed only when stimuli were preceded
   by a stimulus of a different category (in mixed blocks), suggesting that
   an enhanced N170 to faces may be more reliably observed when faces are
   presented within the context of some non-face stimuli.}},

Title = {{Individualized and Clinically Derived Stimuli Activate Limbic Structures
   in Depression: An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: In the search for neurobiological correlates of depression,
   a major finding is hyperactivity in limbic-paralimbic regions. However,
   results so far have been inconsistent, and the stimuli used are often
   unspecific to depression. This study explored hemodynamic responses of
   the brain in patients with depression while processing individualized
   and clinically derived stimuli.
   Methods: Eighteen unmedicated patients with recurrent major depressive
   disorder and 17 never-depressed control subjects took part in
   standardized clinical interviews from which individualized formulations
   of core interpersonal dysfunction were derived. In the patient group
   such formulations reflected core themes relating to the onset and
   maintenance of depression. In controls, formulations reflected a major
   source of distress. This material was thereafter presented to subjects
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) assessment.
   Results: Increased hemodynamic responses in the anterior cingulate
   cortex, medial frontal gyrus, fusiform gyrus and occipital lobe were
   observed in both patients and controls when viewing individualized
   stimuli. Relative to control subjects, patients with depression showed
   increased hemodynamic responses in limbic-paralimbic and subcortical
   regions (e.g. amygdala and basal ganglia) but no signal decrease in
   prefrontal regions.
   Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that individualized
   stimuli derived from standardized clinical interviewing can lead to
   hemodynamic responses in regions associated with self-referential and
   emotional processing in both groups and limbic-paralimbic and
   subcortical structures in individuals with depression. Although the
   regions with increased responses in patients have been previously
   reported, this study enhances the ecological value of fMRI findings by
   applying stimuli that are of personal relevance to each individual's
   depression.}},

Abstract = {{Reversal learning refers to the ability to inhibit or switch responding
   to an object when the object-reward contingency changes. Deficits in
   this process are related to social abnormalities, impulsiveness, and a
   number of psychiatric disorders. A range of neural regions play a role
   in this process, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC),
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG).
   However, determining the specific functional contribution of each region
   has proved difficult, in part because reversal learning involves
   multiple cognitive subprocesses such as error detection, inhibiting
   responding to formerly rewarded stimuli, and overcoming avoidance of
   previously punished stimuli. We used fMRI and an experimental task
   adapted from a recent neurochemical study in marmosets to parse neural
   responding to subprocesses of reversal learning during choice and
   feedback trial components. Error-feedback processing was associated with
   increased activity in dmPFC, dlPFC, and IFG whether participants were
   overcoming avoidance, inhibiting responding, or performing classic
   response reversal. Reduced activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
   was associated with error-feedback processing for response inhibition
   but not overcoming avoidance. Conversely, there was significantly
   greater activity in anterior dmPFC during error-feedback processing in
   overcoming avoidance compared to response inhibition. A conjunction
   analysis confirmed that a striking overlap in activity was observed
   across the three conditions in IFG, dlPFC, and dmPFC. The results are
   consistent with conceptualizations of IFG function that emphasize
   modulating stimulus-response maps rather than purely response
   inhibition. The approach has implications for models of prefrontal
   function and neurocognitive perspectives on a range of behavioural
   abnormalities associated with impairments in decision making. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Removal of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is an effective surgical
   treatment for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy but carries a risk of
   language and verbal memory deficits. Preoperative localization of
   functional zones in the ATL might help reduce these risks, yet fMRI
   protocols in current widespread use produce very little activation in
   this region. Based on recent evidence suggesting a role for the ATL in
   semantic integration, we designed an fMRI protocol comparing
   comprehension of brief narratives (Story task) with a semantically
   shallow control task involving serial arithmetic (Math task). The Story
   > Math contrast elicited strong activation throughout the ATL, lateral
   temporal lobe, and medial temporal lobe bilaterally in an initial cohort
   of 18 healthy participants. The task protocol was then implemented at 6
   other imaging centers using identical methods. Data from a second cohort
   of participants scanned at these centers closely replicated the results
   from the initial cohort. The Story-Math protocol provides a reliable
   method for activation of surgical regions of interest in the ATL The
   bilateral activation supports previous claims that conceptual processing
   involves both temporal lobes. Used in combination with language
   lateralization measures, reliable ATL activation maps may be useful for
   predicting cognitive outcome in ATL surgery, though the validity of this
   approach needs to be established in a prospective surgical series. (C)

   study}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of other people's facial expressions of emotion plays an
   important role in social communication in infants as well as adults.
   Evidence from behavioral studies has demonstrated that the ability to
   recognize facial expressions develops by 6 to 7 months of age. Although
   the regions of the infant brain involved in processing facial
   expressions have not been investigated. neuroimaging studies in adults
   have revealed that several areas including the superior temporal sulcus
   (STS) participate in the processing of facial expressions. To examine
   whether the temporal area overlying the STS is responsible for the
   processing of facial expressions in infants, near-infrared spectroscopy
   (NIRS) was used to measure the neural activity in the temporal area
   overlying the STS as infants looked at happy and angry faces. NIRS
   provides a non-invasive means of estimating cerebral blood flow in the
   human brain and does not require severe constraints of head-movement.
   According to the International 10-20 system for EEG electrode placement,
   the measurement area was located in the bilateral temporal area centered
   at positions T5 and T6, which correspond to the STS.
   The time-course of the average change in total-Hb concentration revealed
   a clear difference in the pattern of hemodynamic responses to happy and
   angry faces. The hemodynamic response increased gradually when infants
   looked at happy faces and was activated continuously even after the
   disappearance of the face. In contrast, the hemodynamic responses for
   angry faces increased during the presentation of angry faces, then
   decreased rapidly after the face disappeared.
   Moreover, the left temporal area was significantly activated relative to
   the baseline when infants looked at happy faces, while the right
   temporal area was significantly activated for angry faces. These
   findings suggest hemispheric differences in temporal areas during the
   processing of positive and negative facial expressions in infants. (C)

Abstract = {{Because we are a cooperative species, understanding the goals and
   intentions of others is critical for human survival. In this fMRI study,
   participants viewed reaching behaviors in which one of four animated
   characters moved a hand towards one of two objects and either (a) picked
   up the object, (b) missed the object, or (c) changed his path halfway to
   lift the other object. The characters included a human, a humanoid
   robot, stacked boxes with an arm, and a mechanical claw. The first three
   moved in an identical, human-like biological pattern. Right posterior
   superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) activity increased when the human or
   humanoid robot shifted goals or missed the target relative to obtaining
   the original goal. This suggests that the pSTS was engaged
   differentially for figures that appeared more human-like rather than for
   all human-like motion. Medial frontal areas that are part of a
   protagonist-monitoring network with the right pSTS (e.g., Mason and
   Just, 2006) were most engaged for the human character, followed by the
   robot character. The current data suggest that goal-directed action and
   intention understanding require this network and it is used similarly
   for the two processes. Moreover, it is modulated by character identity
   rather than only the presence of biological motion. We discuss the
   implications for behavioral theories of goal-directed action and
   intention understanding. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previous fMRI experiments showed an involvement of the STS in the
   processing of eye-gaze direction in joint attention. Since head-gaze
   direction can also be used for the assessment of another person's
   attentional focus, we compared the mechanisms underlying the processing
   of head- and eye-gaze direction using a combined psychophysical and fMRI
   approach. Subjects actively followed the head- or eye-gaze direction of
   a person in a photograph towards one of seven possible targets by moving
   their eyes. We showed that the right posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (STS) as well as the right fusiform gyrus (FSG) were involved in both
   processing of head- as well as eye-gaze direction. Another finding was a
   bilateral deactivation of a distinct area in the middle STS (mSTS) as
   well as the left anterior STS (aSTS), that was stronger when subjects
   followed eye-gaze direction than when they followed head-gaze direction.
   We assume that this deactivation is based on an active suppression of
   information arising from the distracting other directional cue, i.e.
   head-gaze direction in the eye-gaze direction task and eye-gaze
   direction in the head-gaze direction task.
   These results further support the hypothesis that the human equivalent
   of the gaze sensitive area in monkeys lies in more anterior parts of the
   STS than previously thought. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Facial displays of emotions can help to infer the mental states of other
   individuals. However, the expectations we generate on the basis of
   people's emotions can mismatch their actual behaviour in certain
   circumstances, which generates conflict. In the present study, we
   explored the neural mechanisms of emotional conflict during
   interpersonal interactions. Participants had to accept or reject
   economic offers made by several partners who displayed emotional
   expressions. On every trial, a cue informed participants of whether they
   could trust the emotion of their partner or not. Trustworthy
   (low-conflict) partners with happy facial expressions were cooperative
   and those with angry expressions did not cooperate. Untrustworthy
   (high-conflict) partners, on the other hand, cooperated when their
   expression was angry and did not cooperate when they displayed a happy
   emotion. Behavioural responses were faster for trustworthy than for
   untrustworty partners. High-conflict partners activated the anterior
   cingulate and the anterior insula. In turn, trustworthy partners were
   associated with activations in the left precuneus. Our results suggest
   that the emotion displayed by another person affects our decision-making
   in social contexts. When emotional expressions are linked to their
   natural consequences, they engage ToM processes. In contrast,
   untrustworthy emotional expressions engage conflict-related brain
   regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Poets and philosophers have long acknowledged moral sentiments as key
   motivators of human social behavior. Prosocial sentiments, which include
   guilt, pity and embarrassment, enable us to care about others and to be
   concerned about our mistakes. Functional imaging studies have implicated
   frontopolar, ventromedial frontal and basal forebrain regions in the
   experience of prosocial sentiments. Patients with lesions of the
   frontopolar and ventromedial frontal areas were observed to behave
   inappropriately and less prosocially, which could be attributed to a
   generalized emotional blunting. Direct experimental evidence for brain
   regions distinctively associated with moral sentiment impairments is
   lacking, however. We investigated this issue in patients with the
   behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, a disorder in which early
   and selective impairments of social conduct are consistently observed.
   Using a novel moral sentiment task, we show that the degree of
   impairment of prosocial sentiments is associated with the degree of
   damage to frontopolar cortex and septal area, as assessed with
   18-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose-Positron Emission Tomography, an established
   measure of neurodegenerative damage. This effect was dissociable from
   impairment of other-critical feelings (anger and disgust), which was in
   turn associated with dorsomedial prefrontal and amygdala dysfunction.
   Our findings suggest a critical role of the frontopolar cortex and
   septal region in enabling prosocial sentiments, a fundamental component
   of moral conscience. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This fMRI study was set up to explore how cognitive empathy, i.e. the
   cognitive inference on another person's affective state, can be
   characterized as a distinct brain function relating to pre-existing
   neurofunctional concepts about mentalizing and empathy. In a 3 Tesla MRI
   scanner 28 healthy participants were presented with four different
   instructions randomly combined with 32 false-belief cartoon stories of 3
   subsequent pictures free of direct cues for affective states, like e.g.
   facial expressions. Participants were instructed to judge affective or
   visuospatial changes from their own (1st person perspective) or the
   protagonists' (3rd person perspective, 3rdpp) perspective.
   3rdpp-judgements about affective states differed from visuospatial 3rdpp
   judgements by a significantly higher activation of the anterior
   mentalizing network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, anterior superior
   temporal sulcus, temporal poles) and the limbic system (left amygdala
   and hippocampus). Analysis of main effects revealed that the anterior
   part of the mentalizing network was activated significantly stronger by
   affective compared to visuospatial content. In contrast, the
   temporoparietal junction was rather activated by 3rdpp visuospatial
   judgements. After all, our results demonstrate a functional dissociation
   between cognitive empathy and cognitive visuospatial perspective taking.
   The simultaneous activation of the cortical mentalizing network and the
   amygdala indicates that cognitive empathy actually involves reference to
   own affective states in the observer. Notably, the cognitive reference
   to own affective states activated the mentalizing network as well.
   Moreover our results support pre-existing ideas about a functional
   anterior posterior subdivision of the mentalizing network, depending on
   affective content and 3rd person perspective of cognition. (C) 2010

   processing facial and bodily expressions. Two functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments investigated whether areas involved
   in processing social signals are activated differently by threatening
   signals (fear and anger) from facial or bodily expressions. The amygdala
   (AMG) was more active for facial than for bodily expressions. Body
   stimuli triggered higher activation than face stimuli in a number of
   areas. These were the cuneus, fusiform gyrus (FG), extrastriate body
   area (EBA), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), superior parietal lobule
   (SPL), primary somatosensory cortex (SI), as well as the thalamus.
   Emotion-specific effects were found in TPJ and FG for bodies and faces

Abstract = {{Background: Research ethics and the measures deployed to ensure ethical
   oversight of research (e. g., informed consent forms, ethics review) are
   vested with extremely important ethical and practical goals.

   Methods: We examined approved consent forms for Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (MRI) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies
   approved by Canadian research ethics boards (REBs).
   Results: We found evidence of variability in consent forms in matters of
   physical and psychological risk reporting. Approaches used to tackle the
   emerging issue of incidental findings exposed extensive variability
   between and within research sites.
   Conclusion: The causes of variability in approved consent forms and
   studies need to be better understood. However, mounting evidence of
   administrative and practical hurdles within current ethics governance
   systems combined with potential sub-optimal provision of information to
   and protection of research subjects support other calls for more
   scrutiny of research ethics practices and applicable revisions.}},

Title = {{Predicting Individual Differences in Placebo Analgesia: Contributions of

Abstract = {{Recent studies have identified brain correlates of placebo analgesia,
   but none have assessed how accurately patterns of brain activity can
   predict individual differences in placebo responses. We reanalyzed data
   from two fMRI studies of placebo analgesia (N = 47), using patterns of
   fMRI activity during the anticipation and experience of pain to predict
   new subjects' scores on placebo analgesia and placebo-induced changes in
   pain processing. We used a cross-validated regression procedure,
   LASSO-PCR, which provided both unbiased estimates of predictive accuracy
   and interpretable maps of which regions are most important for
   prediction. Increased anticipatory activity in a frontoparietal network
   and decreases in a posterior insular/temporal network predicted placebo
   analgesia. Patterns of anticipatory activity across the cortex predicted
   a moderate amount of variance in the placebo response (similar to 12\%
   overall, similar to 40\% for study 2 alone), which is substantial
   considering the multiple likely contributing factors. The most
   predictive regions were those associated with emotional appraisal,
   rather than cognitive control or pain processing. During pain, decreases
   in limbic and paralimbic regions most strongly predicted placebo
   analgesia. Responses within canonical pain-processing regions explained
   significant variance in placebo analgesia, but the pattern of effects
   was inconsistent with widespread decreases in nociceptive processing.
   Together, the findings suggest that engagement of emotional appraisal
   circuits drives individual variation in placebo analgesia, rather than
   early suppression of nociceptive processing. This approach provides a
   framework that will allow prediction accuracy to increase as new studies
   provide more precise information for future predictive models.}},

Abstract = {{Episodic memories can be retrieved by an intentional search for certain
   information. Alternatively, a past episode may enter our consciousness
   without any intention to retrieve it, prompted by a stimulus in our
   surroundings. Incidental retrieval does not occur upon each encounter
   with a familiar stimulus, suggesting that a gating mechanism exists
   which regulates incidental retrieval activity. We analyzed data from a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study on incidental retrieval in
   healthy young adults and found that failure to incidentally retrieve was
   selectively associated with reduced activation of lateral and medial
   parietal regions as well as ventromedial frontal cortex, areas
   implicated in default mode network. This is the first demonstration that
   relative deactivation of the brain regions associated with the default
   mode gates the consciousness from currently irrelevant memories. (C)

Title = {{Recruitment of Both the Mirror and the Mentalizing Networks When

   Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Understanding social interactions requires the ability to
   accurately interpret conspecifics' actions, sometimes only on the basis
   of subtle body language analysis. Here we address an important issue
   that has not yet received much attention in social neuroscience, that of
   an interaction between two agents. We attempted to isolate brain
   responses to two individuals interacting compared to two individuals
   acting independently.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We used minimalistic point-light
   displays to depict the characters, as they provide the most
   straightforward way to isolate mechanisms used to extract information
   from motion per se without any interference with other visual
   information. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method was
   used to determine which brain regions were recruited during the
   observation of two interacting agents, mimicking everyday social scenes.
   While the mirror and mentalizing networks are rarely concurrently
   active, we found that both of them might be needed to catch the social
   intentions carried by whole-body motion.
   Conclusions/Significance: These findings shed light on how motor
   cognition contributes to social cognition when social information is
   embedded in whole-body motion only. Finally, the approach described here
   provides a valuable and original tool for investigating the brain
   networks responsible for social understanding, in particular in
   psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with developmental dyslexia vary in their ability to improve
   reading skills, but the brain basis for improvement remains largely
   unknown. We performed a prospective, longitudinal study over 2.5 y in
   children with dyslexia (n = 25) or without dyslexia (n = 20) to discover
   whether initial behavioral or brain measures, including functional MRI
   (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can predict future long-term
   reading gains in dyslexia. No behavioral measure, including widely used
   and standardized reading and language tests, reliably predicted future
   reading gains in dyslexia. Greater right prefrontal activation during a
   reading task that demanded phonological awareness and right superior
   longitudinal fasciculus (including arcuate fasciculus) white-matter
   organization significantly predicted future reading gains in dyslexia.
   Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of these two brain measures, using
   linear support vector machine (SVM) and cross-validation, predicted
   significantly above chance (72\% accuracy) which particular child would
   or would not improve reading skills (behavioral measures were at
   chance). MVPA of whole-brain activation pattern during phonological
   processing predicted which children with dyslexia would improve reading
   skills 2.5 y later with > 90\% accuracy. These findings identify right
   prefrontal brain mechanisms that may be critical for reading improvement
   in dyslexia and that may differ from typical reading development. Brain
   measures that predict future behavioral outcomes (neuroprognosis) may be
   more accurate, in some cases, than available behavioral measures.}},

   Testosterone levels in saliva were measured by Enzyme-Linked
   Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).
   RESULTS: The results showed that testosterone and loneliness have a
   positive relevance to impulsivity in adolescent females, whereas there
   was no relationship between loneliness and testosterone levels.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that testosterone and loneliness

Abstract = {{Single cell recordings in monkeys provide strong evidence for an
   important role of the motor system in action understanding. This
   evidence is backed up by data from studies of the (human) mirror neuron
   system using neuroimaging or TMS techniques, and behavioral experiments.
   Although the data acquired from single cell recordings are generally
   considered to be robust, several debates have shown that the
   interpretation of these data is far from straightforward. We will show
   that research based on single-cell recordings allows for unlimited
   content attribution to mirror neurons. We will argue that a theoretical
   analysis of the mirroring process, combined with behavioral and brain
   studies, can provide the necessary limitations. A complexity analysis of
   the type of processing attributed to the mirror neuron system can help
   formulate restrictions on what mirroring is and what cognitive functions
   could, in principle, be explained by a mirror mechanism. We argue that
   processing at higher levels of abstraction needs assistance of
   non-mirroring processes to such an extent that subsuming the processes
   needed to infer goals from actions under the label `mirroring' is not

Abstract = {{Head direction is a salient cue to the focus of other people's
   attention. Electrophysiology in macaques has shown head-selective cells
   in the superior temporal sulcus that are mostly tuned to different
   directions (up, down, left, right, front, back, etc.). However, there
   has been no systematic investigation into the visual representation of
   head direction in both the horizontal (left-right) and vertical
   (up-down) planes in humans. We addressed whether the coding of head
   direction is best accounted for by a multichannel system, with distinct
   pools of cells (or channels) tuned to different head views (i.e., left,
   right, direct, up, and down), or an opponent-coding system with two
   broadly tuned pools of cells responding to two extremes (i.e.,
   left-right and up-down) and ``direct{''} represented as the equilibrium
   state in the system. In a series of four experiments, we carried out two
   adaptation procedures for which multichannel and opponent coding predict
   distinct outcomes. The results support multichannel coding of head
   direction in both the vertical and horizontal axes.}},

Abstract = {{Drawing on Williams' distinction between thin and thick ethical
   concepts, I argue that current moral neuroscience and psychology
   unwarrantedly restrict their researches to thin morality only.
   Experiments typically investigate subjects' judgments about rightness,
   appropriateness, or permissibility, that is, thin concepts. The nature
   and workings of thick concepts - e. g., dignity, integrity, humanness,
   cruelty, pettiness, exploitation, or fanaticism - have not been
   empirically investigated; hence, they are absent from recent theories
   about morality. This may seem like a minor oversight, which some
   additional research can redress. I argue that the fix is not that
   simple: thick concepts challenge one of the theoretical backbones of
   much moral psychology and neuroscience; they challenge the conception of
   a hardwired and universal moral capacity in a way that thin concepts do
   not. In the conclusion I argue that the burgeoning science of morality
   should include both thin and thick, and that it should include the
   contributions of psychologists and neuroscientists as well as those of
   anthropologists, historians, and sociologists.}},

Journal = {{ACTA NEUROBIOLOGIAE EXPERIMENTALIS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{71}},

Pages = {{479-495}},
Abstract = {{Previous imaging studies have identified many brain regions activated
   during reasoning, but there are differences among the findings
   concerning specific regions engaged in reasoning and the contribution of
   language areas. Also, little is known about the relation between task
   complexity and neural activation during reasoning. The present fMRI
   study investigated brain activity during complex four-term transitive
   reasoning with abstract material (determinate or partially
   indeterminate) and compared the resulting images to those obtained
   during a memorization task. The memory condition required subjects to
   memorize unrelated elements whereas the reasoning conditions required
   them to integrate information from premises and to infer relations
   between elements. After contrasting the two kinds of reasoning
   conditions with the memory condition we found that right prefrontal and
   bilateral parietal regions are specifically activated during reasoning.
   We also demonstrated that different reasoning requirements - the
   possibility of constructing one (determined reasoning) versus several
   (undetermined reasoning) models of a situation during task solving -
   lead to different patterns of brain activity, with higher prefrontal
   (PFC) activity accompanying undetermined reasoning. We interpret the PFC
   activity as a reflection of simultaneous maintenance and manipulation of
   information in reasoning. These findings provide new evidence that
   specific forms of reasoning (abstract and undetermined) demand
   recruitment of right PFC and hemispheric coordination and lend new
   support to the mental model theory of relational reasoning.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:
   This study examined the neural pathophysiology of the theory of mind
   network by eliciting self-referential processing during an idea of
   reference evocating situation in patients with schizophrenia.
   Method:
   Functional MRI was conducted on 14 schizophrenic in-patients with the
   idea of reference and 15 healthy participants while viewing video
   vignettes of referential conversations, non-referential conversations or
   no conversations between two people, which were filmed at varying
   distances of 1, 5 or 10 m.
   Results:
   The patient group did not show normal patterns of superior temporal
   sulcus activation to conversational context, and reciprocal deactivation
   and activation of the ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex to
   referential conversational context. Instead, the patient group showed
   overall greater ventromedial prefrontal activities across different
   conversational contexts and inverse correlation between superior
   temporal sulcus activity and delusional severity. Differential
   activations of the temporal pole and its posterior extension to varying
   distances were observed in the control group but not in the patient
   group.
   Conclusion:
   The present study demonstrates that theory of mind-related responses of
   the medial prefrontal-superior temporal network are attenuated during
   the self-referential processing in patients with schizophrenia and that
   these abnormalities may be related to the formation of their referential
   or persecutory delusion.}},

Abstract = {{The functional organization of human primary visual and auditory
   cortices is influenced by sensory experience and exhibits cross-modal
   plasticity in the absence of input from one modality. However, it
   remains debated whether the functional architecture of the prefrontal
   cortex, when engaged in social cognitive processes, is shaped by sensory
   experience. The present study investigated whether activity in the
   medial prefrontal cortex underlying self-reflective thinking of one's
   own traits is modality-specific and whether it undergoes cross-modal
   plasticity in the absence of visual input. We scanned 47 sighted
   participants and 21 congenitally blind individuals using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging during trait judgements of the self and a
   familiar other. Sighted participants showed medial prefrontal activation
   and enhanced functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal and
   visual cortices during self-judgements compared to other-judgements on
   visually but not aurally presented trait words, indicating that medial
   prefrontal activity underlying self-representation is visual
   modality-specific in sighted people. In contrast, blind individuals
   showed medial prefrontal activation and enhanced functional connectivity
   between the medial prefrontal and occipital cortices during
   self-judgements relative to other-judgements on aurally presented
   stimuli, suggesting that visual deprivation leads to functional
   reorganization of the medial prefrontal cortex so as to be tuned by
   auditory inputs during self-referential processing. The medial
   prefrontal activity predicted memory performances on trait words used
   for self-judgements in both subject groups, implicating a similar
   functional role of the medial prefrontal cortex in self-referential
   processing in sighted and blind individuals. Together, our findings
   indicate that self-representation in the medial prefrontal cortex is
   strongly shaped by sensory experience.}},

Abstract = {{Faces convey a multitude of information in social interaction, among
   which are trustworthiness and attractiveness. Humans process and
   evaluate these two dimensions very quickly due to their great adaptive
   importance. Trustworthiness evaluation is crucial for modulating
   behavior toward strangers; attractiveness evaluation is a crucial factor
   for mate selection, possibly providing cues for reproductive success. As
   both dimensions rapidly guide social behavior, this study tests the
   hypothesis that both judgments may be subserved by overlapping brain
   networks. To this end, we conducted an activation likelihood estimation
   meta-analysis on 16 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies
   pertaining to facial judgments of trustworthiness and attractiveness.
   Throughout combined, individual, and conjunction analyses on those two
   facial judgments, we observed consistent maxima in the amygdala which
   corroborates our initial hypothesis. This finding supports the
   contemporary paradigm shift extending the amygdala's role from
   dominantly processing negative emotional stimuli to processing socially
   relevant ones. We speculate that the amygdala filters sensory
   information with evolutionarily conserved relevance. Our data suggest
   that such a role includes not only ``fight-or-flight{''} decisions but
   also social behaviors with longer term pay-off schedules, e.g.,
   trustworthiness and attractiveness evaluation.}},

   adults produced a greater left anterior negativity from 400 to 900 msec,
   whereas addition produced a greater right posterior negativity from 400
   to 900 msec. Adults showed larger left anterior negativities in the time
   window suggesting that adults rely more than children on a verbal
   processing system for solving these problems. Children showed larger
   right posterior negativities in the time window suggesting that they
   rely more on quantitative manipulation for solving these problems.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To create a German version of the Southampton Needle
   Sensation Questionnaire (SNSQ) in order to measure deqi (needling
   sensation) in subjects receiving different forms of acupuncture and to
   evaluate the translated questionnaire in an acupuncture study. Methods:
   A forward and backward translation procedure was applied to create a
   German version of the SNSQ. Discrepancies between translations were
   resolved by consensus. Healthy participants from an experimental
   acupuncture trial were asked to fill in the resulting questionnaire
   comprising of 17 items (none (0) to intense (3)) and a visual analogue
   scale (VAS) for pain (0-100 mm) after receiving either sham or real
   acupuncture with or without stimulation. The questionnaire was validated
   using factor analysis and correlation analysis. Results: Questionnaires
   from 63 subjects (mean 27.1 years; 69.8\% female) were included in the
   analysis. Participants tended to score toward the low end of each of the
   17 items (mean sum score (+/- SD): 8.9 +/- 7.0). Four factors with
   eigen-values > 1 were identified using exploratory factor analysis. Both
   of the original subscales, aching deqi (AD) and tingling deqi (TD),
   showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: AD: 0.71; TD: 0.78)
   and medium test-retest reliability (AD: r = 0.538, p = 0.002; TD: r =
   0.603, p < 0.001). AD feeling (r = 0.574, p < 0.001) and TD feeling (r =
   0.496, p < 0.001) correlated with the VAS for pain. Conclusion: Factor
   structure of the original questionnaire could not be reproduced with the
   German version of the SNSQ in an experimental setting. The questionnaire
   could not discriminate between pain and deqi. Further research is needed
   to create a German tool which is more suitable to measure deqi.}},

Title = {{Decision salience signals in posterior cingulate cortex}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Despite its phylogenetic antiquity and clinical importance, the
   posterior cingulate cortex (CGp) remains an enigmatic nexus of
   attention, memory, motivation, and decision making. Here we show that
   CGp neurons track decision salience - the degree to which an option
   differs from a standard - but not the subjective value of a decision. To
   do this, we recorded the spiking activity of CGp neurons in monkeys
   choosing between options varying in reward-related risk, delay to
   reward, and social outcomes, each of which varied in level of decision
   salience. Firing rates were higher when monkeys chose the risky option,
   consistent with their risk-seeking preferences, but were also higher
   when monkeys chose the delayed and social options, contradicting their
   preferences. Thus, across decision contexts, neuronal activity was
   uncorrelated with how much monkeys valued a given option, as inferred
   from choice. Instead, neuronal activity signaled the deviation of the
   chosen option from the standard, independently of how it differed. The
   observed decision salience signals suggest a role for CGp in the
   flexible allocation of neural resources to motivationally significant
   information, akin to the role of attention in selective processing of
   sensory inputs.}},

Title = {{Interoception drives increased rational decision-making in meditators
   playing the ultimatum game}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Human decision-making is often conceptualized as a competition between
   cognitive and emotional processes in the brain. Deviations from rational
   processes are believed to derive from inclusion of emotional factors in
   decision-making. Here, we investigate whether experienced Buddhist
   meditators are better equipped to regulate emotional processes compared
   with controls during economic decision-making in the Ultimatum Game. We
   show that meditators accept unfair offers on more than half of the
   trials, whereas controls only accept unfair offers on one-quarter of the
   trials. By applying fMRI we show that controls recruit the anterior
   insula during unfair offers. Such responses are powerful predictors of
   rejecting offers in social interaction. By contrast, meditators display
   attenuated activity in high-level emotional representations of the
   anterior insula and increased activity in the low-level interoceptive
   representations of the posterior insula. In addition we show that a
   subset of control participants who play rationally (i.e., accepts > 85\%
   unfair offers) recruits the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex presumably
   reflecting increased cognitive demands, whereas rational meditators by
   contrast display elevated activity in the somatosensory cortex and
   posterior superior temporal cortex. In summary, when assessing
   unfairness in the Ultimatum Game, meditators activate a different
   network of brain areas compared with controls enabling them to uncouple
   negative emotional reactions from their behavior. These findings
   highlight the clinically and socially important possibility that
   sustained training in mindfulness meditation may impact distinct domains
   of human decision-making.}},

Title = {{A generative model of speech production in Broca's and Wernicke's areas}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Speech production involves the generation of an auditory signal from the
   articulators and vocal tract. When the intended auditory signal does not
   match the produced sounds, subsequent articulatory commands can be
   adjusted to reduce the difference between the intended and produced
   sounds. This requires an internal model of the intended speech output
   that can be compared to the produced speech. The aim of this functional
   imaging study was to identify brain activation related to the internal
   model of speech production after activation related to vocalization,
   auditory feedback, and movement in the articulators had been controlled.
   There were four conditions: silent articulation of speech, non-speech
   mouth movements, finger tapping, and visual fixation. In the speech
   conditions, participants produced the mouth movements associated with
   the words ``one{''} and ``three.{''} We eliminated auditory feedback
   from the spoken output by instructing participants to articulate these
   words without producing any sound. The non-speech mouth movement
   conditions involved lip pursing and tongue protrusions to control for
   movement in the articulators. The main difference between our speech and
   non-speech mouth movement conditions is that prior experience producing
   speech sounds leads to the automatic and covert generation of auditory
   and phonological associations that may play a role in predicting
   auditory feedback. We found that, relative to non-speech mouth
   movements, silent speech activated Broca's area in the left dorsal pars
   opercularis and Wernicke's area in the left posterior superior temporal
   sulcus. We discuss these results in the context of a generative model of
   speech production and propose that Broca's and Wernicke's areas may be
   involved in predicting the speech output that follows articulation.
   These predictions could provide a mechanism by which rapid movement of
   the articulators is precisely matched to the intended speech outputs
   during future articulations.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Hundreds of studies have investigated the early ERPs to faces and
   objects using scalp and intracranial recordings. The vast majority of
   these studies have used uncontrolled stimuli, inappropriate designs,
   peak measurements, poor figures, and poor inferential and descriptive
   group statistics. These problems, together with a tendency to discuss
   any effect p < 0.05 rather than to report effect sizes, have led to a
   research field very much qualitative in nature, despite its quantitative
   inspirations, and in which predictions do not go beyond condition A >
   condition B. Here we describe the main limitations of face and object
   ERP research and suggest alternative strategies to move forward. The
   problems plague intracranial and surface ERP studies, but also studies
   using more advanced techniques - e. g., source space analyses and
   measurements of network dynamics, as well as many behavioral, fMRI, TMS,
   and LFP studies. In essence, it is time to stop amassing binary results

Abstract = {{Experts of abacus, who have the skills of abacus-based mental
   calculation (AMC), are able to manipulate numbers via an imagined abacus
   in mind and demonstrate extraordinary ability in mental calculation.
   Behavioral studies indicated that abacus experts utilize visual strategy
   in solving numerical problems, and fMRI studies confirmed the enhanced
   involvement of visuospatial-related neural resources in AMC. This study
   aims to explore the possible changes in brain white matter induced by
   long-term training of AMC. Two matched groups participated: the abacus
   group consisting of 25 children with over 3-year training in abacus
   calculation and AMC, the controls including 25 children without any
   abacus experience. We found that the abacus group showed higher average
   fractional anisotropy (FA) in whole-brain fiber tracts, and the regions
   with increased FA were found in corpus callosum, left occipitotemporal
   junction and right premotor projection. No regions, however, showed
   decreased FA in the abacus group. Further analysis revealed that the
   differences in FA values were mainly driven by the alternation of radial
   rather than axial diffusivities. Furthermore, in forward digit and
   letter memory span tests, AMC group showed larger digit/letter memory
   spans. Interestingly, individual differences in white matter tracts were
   found positively correlated with the memory spans, indicating that the
   widespread increase of FA in the abacus group result possibly from the
   AMC training. In conclusion, our findings suggested that long-term AMC
   training from an early age may improve the memory capacity and enhance
   the integrity in white matter tracts related to motor and visuospatial
   processes. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 10-21, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{It was recently observed that dehydration causes shrinkage of brain
   tissue and an associated increase in ventricular volume. Negative
   effects of dehydration on cognitive performance have been shown in some
   but not all studies, and it has also been reported that an increased
   perceived effort may be required following dehydration. However, the
   effects of dehydration on brain function are unknown. We investigated
   this question using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 10
   healthy adolescents (mean age = 16.8, five females). Each subject
   completed a thermal exercise protocol and nonthermal exercise control
   condition in a cross-over repeated measures design. Subjects lost more
   weight via perspiration in the thermal exercise versus the control
   condition (P < 0.0001), and lateral ventricle enlargement correlated
   with the reduction in body mass (r = 0.77, P = 0.01). Dehydration
   following the thermal exercise protocol led to a significantly stronger
   increase in fronto-parietal blood-oxygen- level-dependent (BOLD)
   response during an executive function task (Tower of London) than the
   control condition, whereas cerebral perfusion during rest was not
   affected. The increase in BOLD response after dehydration was not
   paralleled by a change in cognitive performance, suggesting an
   inefficient use of brain metabolic activity following dehydration. This
   pattern indicates that participants exerted a higher level of neuronal
   activity in order to achieve the same performance level. Given the
   limited availability of brain metabolic resources, these findings
   suggest that prolonged states of reduced water intake may adversely
   impact executive functions such as planning and visuo-spatial
   processing. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 71-79, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Humans commonly understand the unobservable mental states of others by
   observing their actions. Embodied simulation theories suggest that this
   ability may be based in areas of the fronto-parietal mirror neuron
   system, yet neuroimaging studies that explicitly investigate the human
   ability to draw mental state inferences point to the involvement of a
   ``mentalizing{''} system consisting of regions that do not overlap with
   the mirror neuron system. For the present study, we developed a novel
   action identification paradigm that allowed us to explicitly investigate
   the neural bases of mentalizing observed actions. Across repeated
   viewings of a set of ecologically valid video clips of ordinary human
   actions, we manipulated the extent to which participants identified the
   unobservable mental states of the actor (mentalizing) or the observable
   mechanics of their behavior (mechanizing). Although areas of the mirror
   neuron system did show an enhanced response during action
   identification, its activity was not significantly modulated by the
   extent to which the observers identified mental states. Instead, several
   regions of the mentalizing system, including dorsal and ventral aspects
   of medial pFC, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporal poles, were
   associated with mentalizing actions, whereas a single region in left
   lateral occipito-temporal cortex was associated with mechanizing
   actions. These data suggest that embodied simulation is insufficient to
   account for the sophisticated mentalizing that human beings are capable
   of while observing another and that a different system along the
   cortical midline and in anterior temporal cortex is involved in
   mentalizing an observed action.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Pages = {{45-51}},
Abstract = {{Merely viewing the faces of famous athletes affects the observers' motor
   system, suggesting that action-based information is a core feature of
   person representations, even when no specific action is visible (Bach \&
   Tipper, 2006). Unexpectedly, these person-based motor priming effects
   were inhibitory. Foot responses were slower when identifying
   footballers, and hand responses for tennis players. Here, we demonstrate
   that these inhibitory effects are only evoked when action is implicitly
   associated with the athletes; when the athletes are seen performing
   their skilled actions the effect reverses towards facilitation. The
   contrast between inhibition evoked by implicit action priming and
   facilitation evoked by the explicit presentation of an action supports
   the notion of inhibitory control in the motor system. We hypothesise
   that when no specific action is perceived, a range of actions are
   activated triggering lateral inhibition, whereas when a specific action
   is viewed, there is no competition and excitation facilitates similar
   responses.}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The growing insights from neuropsychological research,
   including within biosocial criminology, have not yet been systematically
   incorporated into the study of correctional rehabilitation. Given
   developments in related fields, we argue that moving toward a biosocial
   theory of offender rehabilitation or neurocriminology will enrich our
   understanding and effectiveness of these interventions. A particularly
   promising area to investigate is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). In
   this regard, we examine research on the neural correlates of skills that
   are addressed in correctional cognitive skills programs.
   Results: A review of the literature reveals that social skills, coping
   skills, and problem-solving skills are consistently associated with
   activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
   orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, insula, and temporo-parietal
   junction.
   Conclusions: CBT programs that effectively target social skills, coping
   skills, and problem-solving skills should correspond to increased
   activity in these regions. The implications of this research are
   discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Variation in the human cannabinoid receptor CNR1 gene modulates gaze
   duration for happy faces}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Background: From an early age, humans look longer at preferred stimuli
   and also typically look longer at facial expressions of emotion,
   particularly happy faces. Atypical gaze patterns towards social stimuli
   are common in autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, it is unknown
   whether gaze fixation patterns have any genetic basis. In this study, we
   tested whether variations in the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) gene are
   associated with gaze duration towards happy faces. This gene was
   selected because CNR1 is a key component of the endocannabinoid system,
   which is involved in processing reward, and in our previous functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we found that variations in
   CNR1 modulate the striatal response to happy (but not disgust) faces.
   The striatum is involved in guiding gaze to rewarding aspects of a
   visual scene. We aimed to validate and extend this result in another
   sample using a different technique (gaze tracking).
   Methods: A total of 30 volunteers (13 males and 17 females) from the
   general population observed dynamic emotional expressions on a screen
   while their eye movements were recorded. They were genotyped for the
   identical four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CNR1 gene
   tested in our earlier fMRI study.
   Results: Two SNPs (rs806377 and rs806380) were associated with
   differential gaze duration for happy (but not disgust) faces.
   Importantly, the allelic groups associated with a greater striatal
   response to happy faces in the fMRI study were associated with longer
   gaze duration at happy faces.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that CNR1 variations modulate the
   striatal function that underlies the perception of signals of social
   reward, such as happy faces. This suggests that CNR1 is a key element in
   the molecular architecture of perception of certain basic emotions. This
   may have implications for understanding neurodevelopmental conditions
   marked by atypical eye contact and facial emotion processing, such as
   ASC.}},

   judgments about own-age than other-age individuals. Additionally, across
   target age and participant age, there was greater activity in a more
   anterior region of ventral mPFC (largely medial frontal gyrus, anterior
   cingulate) when participants rated others than when they rated
   themselves. We discuss potential interpretations of these findings in
   the context of previous results suggesting functional specificity of

Abstract = {{Savants and prodigies are individuals with exceptional skills in
   particular mental domains. In the present study we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to examine neural correlates of calendar
   calculation in two individuals, a savant with Asperger's disorder and a
   self-taught mathematical prodigy. If there is a modular neural
   organization of exceptional performance in a specific mental domain,
   calendar calculation should be reflected in a considerable overlap in
   the recruitment of brain circuits across expert individuals. However,
   considerable individual differences in activation patterns during
   calendar calculation were noted. The present results indicate that
   activation patterns produced by complex mental processing, such as
   calendar calculation, seem to be influenced strongly by learning history
   and idiosyncratic strategy usage rather than a modular neural
   organization. Thus, well-known individual differences in complex
   cognition play a major role even in experts with exceptional abilities
   in a particular mental domain and should in particular be considered
   when examining the neural architecture of complex mental processes and

Abstract = {{Theories of specific phobias consider classical conditioning as a
   central mechanism in the pathogenesis and maintenance of the disorder.
   Although the neuronal network underlying human fear conditioning is
   understood in considerable detail, no study to date has examined the
   neuronal correlates of fear conditioning directly in patients with
   specific phobias. Using functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI) we
   investigated conditioned responses using phobia-relevant and
   non-phobia-relevant unconditioned stimuli in patients with specific
   phobias (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 14) by means of a
   differential picture-picture conditioning paradigm: three neutral
   geometric figures (conditioned stimuli) were followed by either pictures
   of spiders, highly aversive scenes or household items (unconditioned
   stimuli), respectively. Enhanced activations within the fear network
   (medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala, insula
   and thalamus) were observed in response to the phobia-related
   conditioned stimulus. Further, spider phobic subjects displayed higher
   amygdala activation in response to the phobia-related conditioned
   stimulus than to the non-phobia-related conditioned stimulus. Moreover,
   no differences between patients and healthy controls emerged regarding
   the non-phobia-related conditioned stimulus. The results imply that
   learned phobic fear is based on exaggerated responses in structures
   belonging to the fear network and emphasize the importance of the
   amygdala in the processing of phobic fear. Further, altered responding
   of the fear network in patients was only observed in response to the
   phobia-related conditioned stimulus but not to the non-phobia-related
   conditioned stimulus indicating no differences in general
   conditionability between patients with specific phobias and healthy
   controls. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{fMRI evidence of neural abnormalities in the subcortical face processing

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{697-704}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that a rapid, automatic face detection system
   is supported by subcortical structures including the amygdala, pulvinar,
   and superior colliculus. Early-emerging abnormalities in these
   structures may be related to reduced social orienting in children with
   autism, and subsequently, to aberrant development of cortical circuits
   involved in face processing. Our objective was to determine whether
   functional abnormalities in the subcortical face processing system are
   present in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) during
   supraliminal fearful face processing. Participants included twenty-eight
   individuals with ASD and 25 controls group-matched on age, IQ and
   behavioral performance. The ASD group met diagnostic criteria on the
   ADI-R, ADOS-G, and DSM-IV. Both the ASD and control groups showed
   significant activation in bilateral fusiform gyri. The control group
   exhibited additional significant responses in the right amygdala, right
   pulvinar, and bilateral superior colliculi. In the direct group
   comparison, the controls showed significantly greater activation in the
   left amygdala, bilateral fusiform gyrus, right pulvinar, and bilateral
   superior colliculi. No brain region showed significantly greater
   activation in the ASD group compared to the controls. Thus, basic rapid
   face identification mechanisms appear to be functional in ASD. However,
   individuals with ASD failed to engage the subcortical brain regions
   involved in face detection and automatic emotional face processing,
   suggesting a core mechanism for impaired socioemotional processing in
   ASD. Neural abnormalities in this system may contribute to
   early-emerging deficits in social orienting and attention, the putative
   precursors to abnormalities in social cognition and cortical face
   processing specialization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The human amygdala responds to first impressions of people as judged
   from their faces, such as normative judgments about the trustworthiness

   first impressions can be validated by objective criteria. Here, we
   examined amygdala responses to faces of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs)
   where real-world outcomes could be measured objectively by the amounts
   of profits made by each CEO's company. During fMRI scanning,
   participants made incidental judgments about the symmetry of each CEO's
   face. After scanning, participants rated each CEO's face on leadership
   ability. Parametric analyses showed that greater left amygdala response
   to the CEOs' faces was associated with higher post-scan ratings of the
   CEOs' leadership ability. In addition, greater left amygdala response
   was also associated with greater profits made by the CEOs' companies and
   this relationship was statistically mediated by external raters'
   perceptions of arousal. Thus, amygdala response reflected both
   subjective judgments and objective measures of leadership ability based
   on first impressions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Brain mapping of psychological processes with psychometric scales: An

Abstract = {{Introduction: The functional neuroimaging literature has used many
   stimuli (e. g., games, pictures, sounds) in fMRI studies to induce
   activation in brain areas related to psychological processes. To improve
   the link among psychological processes and their brain mapping, this
   study integrates the theory of measurement in the social sciences with
   the functional neuroimaging literature to propose a simple method that
   localizes the neural correlates of psychological processes using
   psychometric scales as stimuli to induce brain activation.
   Materials and methods: Two fMRI studies were performed to illustrate
   this method with 30 subjects who responded to psychometric scales for
   four psychological processes on 7-point Likert-type anchors while their
   brains were being scanned in an fMRI. The first study examined two
   psychological processes-trust and distrust-whose neural correlates are
   known. The second study examined two psychological processes specific to
   technology use context-perceived usefulness and perceived ease of
   use-whose neural correlates are still unknown.
   Results: Results from the first fMRI study confirmed the neural
   correlates of trust in the caudate nucleus, putamen, anterior
   paracingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex and of distrust in the
   amygdala and insular cortex, thus confirming the literature. The second
   fMRI study identified the neural correlates of perceived usefulness in
   the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, and insular cortex and
   perceived ease of use in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which are
   consistent with the technology use literature.
   Discussion: The proposed brain mapping method with psychometric scales
   can inform the neurological nature of psychological processes, challenge
   existing measurement assumptions, and help advance brain mapping. (C)

   in Normal Adults Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-51}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The main purpose of this study was to evaluate whole-brain
   and hemispheric activation in normal adult volunteers to videos
   depicting positive and negative social encounters. There are few studies
   that have utilized dynamic social stimuli to evaluate brain activation.
   Method: Twenty young adults viewed videotaped vignettes during an
   functional magnetic resonance imaging procedure. The vignettes included
   positive and negative interaction scenes of social encounters. Results:
   Significant right greater than left activation for positive and negative
   conditions was found for the social interaction videos in the amygdaloid
   complex, the inferior frontal gyrus, the fusiform gyrus, and the
   temporal gyri (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: These findings support the
   hypothesis that the regions of the right hemisphere are more active in
   the interpretation of social information processing than those regions
   in the left hemisphere. This study is a first step in understanding
   processing of dynamic stimuli using ecologically appropriate stimuli

Abstract = {{Previous functional neuroimaging studies found that the amygdala and
   other limbic regions may play a substantial role in social anxiety
   disorder (SAD). However, more widely distributed large-scale brain
   systems may be involved in cognitive processing in SAD patients when
   confronted with social situations. We employed functional MRI (fMRI) to
   investigate local brain activation of patients with SAD (n =6) and
   healthy controls (HC, n =9) during cognitive work. During fMRI scanning,
   subjects performed a social situation task using a block design paradigm
   in which the task and control trials were performed by turn. The
   patients with SAD showed higher anxiety levels during scanning in all
   social situations. The HC group showed greater common activation in the
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), cuneus, occipital gyrus, and
   cerebellum. Although the patients with SAD showed activation patterns
   similar to that of the HC group, they showed comparatively significant
   decreased activation in the left cerebellum, left precuneus, and
   bilateral PCC. The present study demonstrates that SAD may involve
   dysfunction of a broad neuronal network including the limbic system,
   parieto-posterior cortex and cerebellum. The findings contribute to
   previous findings that revealed abnormal activities of emotion-related
   regions including the amygdala and insular cortex during facial
   perception in SAD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan

Abstract = {{This article introduces a conceptual model of the adolescent development
   based on the theory of positive disintegration combined with theory of
   self-organization. Dabrowski's theory of positive disintegration, which
   was created almost a half century ago, still attracts psychologists' and
   educators' attention, and is extensively applied into studies of gifted
   and talented people. The positive disintegration is the mental
   development described by the process of transition from lower to higher
   levels of mental life and stimulated by tension, inner conflict, and
   anxiety. This process can be modeled by a sequence of patterns of
   organization (attractors) as a developmental potential (a control
   parameter) changes. Three levels of disintegration (unilevel
   disintegration, spontaneous multilevel disintegration, and organized
   multilevel disintegration) are analyzed in detail and it is proposed
   that they represent behaviour of early, middle and late periods of
   adolescence. In the discussion, recent research on the adolescent brain
   development is included.}},

Abstract = {{We present the case for a role of biologically plausible neural network
   modeling in bridging the gap between physiology and behavior. We argue
   that spiking-level networks can allow ``vertical{''} translation between
   physiological properties of neural systems and emergent
   ``whole-system{''} performance enabling psychological results to be
   simulated from implemented networks and also inferences to be made from
   simulations concerning processing at a neural level. These models also
   emphasize particular factors (e.g., the dynamics of performance in
   relation to real-time neuronal processing) that are not highlighted in
   other approaches and that can be tested empirically. We illustrate our
   argument from neural-level models that select stimuli by biased
   competition. We show that a model with biased competition dynamics can
   simulate data ranging from physiological studies of single-cell activity
   (Study 1) to whole-system behavior in human visual search (Study 2),
   while also capturing effects at an intermediate level, including
   performance breakdown after neural lesion (Study 3) and data from brain
   imaging (Study 4). We also show that, at each level of analysis, novel
   predictions can be derived from the biologically plausible parameters
   adopted, which we proceed to test (Study 5). We argue that, at least for
   studying the dynamics of visual attention, the approach productively
   links single-cell to psychological data.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is characterized by the emergence of advanced forms of

   Yet little is known about how changes in social cognition are related to
   changes in brain function during adolescence. In this study, we
   investigated the neural correlates of social behavior during three
   phases of adolescence, carrying out functional magnetic resonance
   imaging of participants' brains while they were Player 2 in the Trust
   Game. We found that with age, adolescents were increasingly sensitive to
   the perspective of the other player, as indicated by their reciprocal
   behavior. These advanced forms of social perspective-taking behavior
   were associated with increased involvement of the left temporo-parietal
   junction and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast,
   young adolescents showed more activity in the anterior medial prefrontal
   cortex, a region previously associated with self-oriented processing and
   mentalizing. These findings suggest that the asynchronous development of
   these neural systems may underlie the shift from thinking about self to
   thinking about the other.}},

Abstract = {{If people are shown a dynamic movie of an action such as kicking a
   soccer ball or hitting a tennis ball, they will respond to it faster if
   it requires the same effector. This standard congruency effect was
   reported to reverse when participants viewed static images of famous
   athletes not actually performing an action. It was suggested that the
   congruent response was inhibited because of a social contrast effect,
   based on an implied action, whereby responders viewed themselves as
   comparatively worse than the professional athlete. The present study
   recorded hand and foot responses when identifying static images of both
   famous and novice athletes in soccer and tennis. The action was either
   explicit or implied. In Experiment 1, a standard congruency effect was
   found for all images. In Experiment 2, when a response was based on the
   identity of the athlete rather than their expertise, the standard
   congruency effect was enhanced for images of novice athletes, but was
   eliminated for experts, suggesting a social contrast effect. Our study
   is the first to show that embodiment effects can be seen for implied and
   explicit action images of both novices and experts, and that static
   images are capable of eliciting priming effects associated with

   attention deficit disorder and the impulsive aggression in children: An

Abstract = {{Attention deficit disorder (ADD) refers to a neurobehavioral condition
   commonly initiated in childhood. Its clinical diagnosis involves poor
   attention, distractibility, difficulties to inhibit motor behaviors and
   cognitive impulsivity.
   It is suggested that ADD is classified in two general types correlated
   with different neurocognitive qualities. One is manifested in executive
   frontal dysfunctions (ADD: In the other type dominates
   hyperactivity/impulsivity (ADHD) and it is associated with deficiencies
   in working memory and alterations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
   Results obtained by using eledroencephalography, event-related potential
   paradigms and voxel brain morphometry suggest anomalies in the brain
   structure and function correlated with ADD, particularly in the frontal,
   parietal and temporal cortices, in addition to regions involved in the
   fronto-estiiatal connections.
   On the other hand, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   constitutes a technique to obtain brain images which can be interpreted
   as regions and networks of neural activity elicited during the
   performance of a cognitive process. Based on the information that the
   ADD patients are susceptible to cognitive interferences, some researches
   have applied the classical and the counting versions of the Stroop task
   paradigms in fMRI. In comparison with control subjects, adult patients
   show alack of neural activation in the anterior cingulated cortex.
   Nevertheless, results in children are more controversial and a attribute
   neurobiological and social factors in the ADD etiology.
   The anterior cingulated cortex and prefrontal region of the human brain
   conform the execution system of attention and their function is
   essential for emotional processes. The neurocognitive relation between
   attention and emotion involves the influence of the affective system in
   the alert and execution systems of attention through reciprocal
   connections between limbic and frontal regions, which permit a mnemonic
   and affective valuation of the attended environment.
   Understanding the relations between attention and emotion is essential
   in basic and clinical approaches, due to the co-morbidity of ADD with
   some emotional disorders, such as the oppositional defiant disorder,
   anxiety and impulsive aggression, the last one elicited by uncontrolled
   experiences of anger. In this sense, some studies describe that the
   metabolic: brain activity correlated with the experience identified in
   this patient in the treatment trial was similar to that identified in
   the unaggressive ADD patient.
   In both cases, ADHD without medication and ADD, a lack of activity was
   identified in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Nevertheless,
   activation in ACC, in parietal and temporal regions was present in the
   aggressive patient under treatment but not in the suspension condition.
   These results may suggest that an inadequate attention process distort
   the environment stimuli, which is necessary for the subject's correct
   affective evaluation of the situation.
   During the experience of anger, the patient under treatment manifested
   activity in the parahippocampal region, as well as in the anterior and
   posterior cingulate cortices.
   Results discussed in this work agree with those previously reported and
   offer cues to complement the diagnosis and treatment of ADD/ADHD and
   their relations with emotional disorders. Particularly, the design used
   here could be used for the analysis and evaluation of some
   pharmacological and behavioral treatments clinically applied in ADD. In
   addition, it helps to understand the participation of multipotential
   brain regions and neural networks involved in several cognitive
   processes, such as attention, working memory and emotion.
   Finally, we proposed some ideas to interpret these results using fMRI
   and ADD:
   1. It is necessary a consensual and standard integration of
   neuropsychological tests which identify different cognitive qualities of
   ADD.
   2. The selection of children samples to study the neurobiology of ADD
   must include several variables associated with its etiology, such as
   parental relations, social and scholar environments.
   3. Experimental paradigms could be designed to be performed using
   different neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI or event-related
   potential. Thus, the results of the same test can be used to complement
   different approaches.
   4. Results obtained by fMRI must not be understood in a phrenologycal
   and deterministic approach, but as brain region activations indicating
   dynamic neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{A cardinal feature of schizophrenia is the poor comprehension, or
   misinterpretation, of the emotional meaning of social interactions and
   events, which can sometimes take the form of a persecutory delusion. It
   has been shown that the comprehension of the emotional meaning of the
   social world involves a midline paralimbic cortical network. However,
   the function of this network during emotional appraisals in patients
   with schizophrenia is not well understood. In this study, hemodynamic
   responses were measured in 14 patients with schizophrenia and 18 healthy
   subjects during the evaluation of descriptions of social situations with
   negative, positive, and neutral affective valence. The healthy and
   schizophrenia groups displayed opposite patterns of responses to
   emotional and neutral social situations within the medial prefrontal and
   posterior cingulate cortices-healthy participants showed greater
   activity to the emotional compared to the neutral situations, while
   patients exhibited greater responses to the neutral compared to the
   emotional situations. Moreover, the magnitude of the response within
   bilateral cingulate gyri to the neutral social stimuli predicted
   delusion severity in the patients with schizophrenia. These findings
   suggest that impaired functioning of cortical midline structures in
   schizophrenia may underlie faulty interpretations of social events,
   contributing to delusion formation.}},

Abstract = {{Perception of faces and voices plays a prominent role in human social
   interaction, making multisensory integration of cross-modal speech a
   topic of great interest in cognitive neuroscience. How to define
   potential sites of multisensory integration using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently under debate, with three
   statistical criteria frequently used (e.g., super-additive, max and mean
   criteria). In the present fMRI study, 20 participants were scanned in a
   block design under three stimulus conditions: dynamic unimodal face,
   unimodal voice and bimodal face voice. Using this single dataset, we
   examine all these statistical criteria in an attempt to define loci of
   face voice integration. While the super-additive and mean criteria
   essentially revealed regions in which one of the unimodal responses was
   a deactivation, the max criterion appeared stringent and only
   highlighted the left hippocampus as a potential site of face-voice
   integration. Psychophysiological interaction analysis showed that
   connectivity between occipital and temporal cortices increased during
   bimodal compared to unimodal conditions. We concluded that, when
   investigating multisensory integration with fMRI, all these criteria
   should be used in conjunction with manipulation of stimulus
   signal-to-noise ratio and/or cross-modal congruency. (C) Koninklijke

Abstract = {{Color percept induction in synaesthetes by hearing words was previously
   shown to involve activation of visual and specifically color processing
   cortex areas. While this provides a rationale for the origin of the
   anomalous color percept the question of mechanism of this crossmodal
   activation remains unclear. We pursued this question with fMRI in color
   hearing synaesthetes by exposing subjects to words and tones. Brain
   activations in word condition accompanied by highly reliable color
   percepts were compared with activations in tone condition with only
   occasional color percepts and both contrasted to activations in normal
   subjects under the same stimulus conditions. This revealed that already
   the tone condition similar to the word condition caused abnormally high
   activations in various cortical areas even though synaesthetic percepts
   were more rare. Such tone activations were significantly larger than in
   normal subjects in visual areas of the right occipital lobe, the fusi
   form gyros, and the left middle temporal gyros and in auditory areas of
   the left superior temporal gyms. These auditory areas showed strong word
   and tone activation alike and not the typically lower tone than word
   activation in normal subjects. Taken together these results are
   interpreted in favour of the disinhibited feedback hypothesis as the
   neurophysiological basis of genuine synaesthesia. (C) Koninklijke Brill

Abstract = {{Aggressive behavior is common during adolescence. Although
   aggression-related functional changes in the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC) and frontopolar cortex (FPC) have been reported in
   adults, the neural correlates of aggressive behavior in adolescents,
   particularly in the context of structural neurodevelopment, are obscure.
   We used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
   measure the blood oxygenation level-depended signal and cortical
   thickness. In a block-designed experiment, 14-17-year old adolescents
   imagined aggressive and non-aggressive interactions with a peer. We show
   reduced vmPFC activation associated with imagined aggressive behavior as
   well as enhanced aggression-related activation and cortical thinning in
   the FPC with increasing age. Changes in FPC activation were also
   associated with judgments of the severity of aggressive acts. Reduced
   vmPFC activation was associated with greater aggression indicating its
   normal function is to exert inhibitory control over aggressive impulses.
   Concurrent FPC activation likely reflects foresight of harmful
   consequences that result from aggressive acts. The correlation of
   age-dependent activation changes and cortical thinning demonstrates
   ongoing maturation of the FPC during adolescence towards a refinement of
   social and cognitive information processing that can potentially
   facilitate mature social behavior in aggressive contexts.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated age-related differences in the amygdala
   and other nodes of face-processing networks in response to facial
   expression and familiarity. fMRI data were analyzed from 31 children
   (3.5-8.5 years) and 14 young adults (18-33 years) who viewed pictures of
   familiar (mothers) and unfamiliar emotional faces. Results showed that
   amygdala activation for faces over a scrambled image baseline increased
   with age. Children, but not adults, showed greater amygdala activation
   to happy than angry faces; in addition, amygdala activation for angry
   faces increased with age. In keeping with growing evidence of a
   positivity bias in young children, our data suggest that children find
   happy faces to be more salient or meaningful than angry faces. Both
   children and adults showed preferential activation to mothers' over
   strangers' faces in a region of rostral anterior cingulate cortex
   associated with self-evaluation, suggesting that some nodes in frontal
   evaluative networks are active early in development. This study presents
   novel data on neural correlates of face processing in childhood and
   indicates that preferential amygdala activation for emotional
   expressions changes with age.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the influence of emotional valence and type of item to be
   remembered on brain activity during recognition, using faces and scenes.
   We used multivariate analyses of event-related fMRI data to identify
   whole-brain patterns, or networks of activity. Participants demonstrated
   better recognition for scenes vs faces and for negative vs neutral and
   positive items. Activity was increased in extrastriate cortex and
   inferior frontal gyri for emotional scenes, relative to neutral scenes
   and all face types. Increased activity in these regions also was seen
   for negative faces relative to positive faces. Correct recognition of
   negative faces and scenes (hits vs correct rejections) was associated
   with increased activity in amygdala, hippocampus, extrastriate, frontal
   and parietal cortices. Activity specific to correctly recognized
   emotional faces, but not scenes, was found in sensorimotor areas and
   rostral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that emotional valence
   and type of visual stimulus both modulate brain activity at recognition,
   and influence multiple networks mediating visual, memory and emotion
   processing. The contextual information in emotional scenes may
   facilitate memory via additional visual processing, whereas memory for
   emotional faces may rely more on cognitive control mediated by
   rostrolateral prefrontal regions.}},

Abstract = {{This exploratory study examined the extent to which individual

   physical sensitivity, are associated with neural response in visual
   areas in response to subtle changes in visual scenes. Sixteen
   participants completed the Highly Sensitive Person questionnaire, a
   standard measure of SPS. Subsequently, they were tested on a change
   detection task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). SPS was associated with significantly greater activation in
   brain areas involved in high-order visual processing (i.e. right
   claustrum, left occipitotemporal, bilateral temporal and medial and
   posterior parietal regions) as well as in the right cerebellum, when
   detecting minor (vs major) changes in stimuli. These findings remained
   strong and significant after controlling for neuroticism and
   introversion, traits that are often correlated with SPS. These results
   provide the first evidence of neural differences associated with SPS,
   the first direct support for the sensory aspect of this trait that has
   been studied primarily for its social and affective implications, and
   preliminary evidence for heightened sensory processing in individuals

   life. We extended the scrutiny of social cognitive neuroscience into the
   domain of legal decisions, investigating two groups, lawyers and other
   academics, during moral and legal decision-making. While we found
   activation of brain areas comprising the so-called `moral brain' in both
   conditions, there was stronger activation in the left dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus particularly when subjects
   made legal decisions, suggesting that these were made in respect to more
   explicit rules and demanded more complex semantic processing. Comparing
   both groups, our data show that behaviorally lawyers conceived
   themselves as emotionally less involved during normative decision-making
   in general. A group x condition interaction in the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex suggests a modulation of normative decision-making by
   attention based on subjects' normative expertise.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia patients display impaired performance and brain activity
   during facial affect recognition. These impairments may reflect
   stimulus-driven perceptual decrements and evaluative processing
   abnormalities. We differentiated these two processes by contrasting
   responses to identical stimuli presented under different contexts.
   Seventeen healthy controls and 16 schizophrenia patients performed an
   fMRI facial affect detection task. Subjects identified an affective
   target presented amongst foils of differing emotions. We hypothesized
   that targeting affiliative emotions (happiness, sadness) would create a
   task demand context distinct from that generated when targeting threat
   emotions (anger, fear). We compared affiliative foil stimuli within a
   congruent affiliative context with identical stimuli presented in an
   incongruent threat context. Threat foils were analysed in the same
   manner. Controls activated right orbitofrontal cortex
   (OFC)/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) more to affiliative foils
   in threat contexts than to identical stimuli within affiliative
   contexts. Patients displayed reduced OFC/VLPFC activation to all foils,
   and no activation modulation by context. This lack of context modulation
   coincided with a 2-fold decrement in foil detection efficiency. Task
   demands produce contextual effects during facial affective processing in
   regions activated during affect evaluation. In schizophrenia, reduced
   modulation of OFC/VLPFC by context coupled with reduced behavioural
   efficiency suggests impaired ventral prefrontal control mechanisms that
   optimize affective appraisal.}},

Abstract = {{Anticipation is a central component of anxiety and the anterior insula
   appears to be an important neural substrate in which this process is
   mediated. The anterior insula is also thought to underlie the
   interoceptive representation of one's affective state. However, the
   degree to which individual differences in anticipation-related insula
   reactivity are associated with variability in the subjective experience
   of anxious anticipation is untested. To assess this possibility,
   functional magnetic resonance images were acquired while participants
   completed an auditory anticipation task with trial-by-trial self-report
   ratings of anxious anticipation. We hypothesized that the anterior
   insula would be positively associated with an individual's subjective
   experience of anticipatory anxiety. The results provide evidence for an
   amygdalo-insular system involved in anxious auditory anticipation.
   Reactivity in the right anterior insula was predictive of individuals'
   subjective experience of anxious anticipation for both aversive and
   neutral stimuli, whereas the amygdala was predictive of anticipatory
   anxiety for aversive stimuli. In addition, anxious anticipatory
   activation in the left insula and left amygdala covaried with
   participants' level of trait anxiety, particularly when the anticipated
   event was proximal.}},

Abstract = {{This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how
   assumptions about speakers' abilities changed the evoked BOLD response
   in secular and Christian participants who received intercessory prayer.
   We find that recipients' assumptions about senders' charismatic
   abilities have important effects on their executive network. Most
   notably, the Christian participants deactivated the frontal network
   consisting of the medial and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   bilaterally in response to speakers who they believed had healing
   abilities. An independent analysis across subjects revealed that this
   deactivation predicted the Christian participants' subsequent ratings of
   the speakers' charisma and experience of God's presence during prayer.
   These observations point to an important mechanism of authority that may
   facilitate charismatic influence, a mechanism which is likely to be
   present in other interpersonal interactions as well.}},

Abstract = {{The Beauty-is-Good stereotype refers to the assumption that attractive
   people possess sociably desirable personalities and higher moral
   standards. The existence of this bias suggests that the neural
   mechanisms for judging facial attractiveness and moral goodness overlap.
   To investigate this idea, we scanned participants with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging while they made attractiveness judgments
   about faces and goodness judgments about hypothetical actions. Activity
   in the medial orbitofrontal cortex increased as a function of both
   attractiveness and goodness ratings, whereas activity in the insular
   cortex decreased with both attractiveness and goodness ratings. Within
   each of these regions, the activations elicited by attractiveness and
   goodness judgments were strongly correlated with each other, supporting
   the idea of similar contributions of each region to both judgments.
   Moreover, activations in orbitofrontal and insular cortices were
   negatively correlated with each other, suggesting an opposing
   relationship between these regions during attractiveness and goodness
   judgments. These findings have implications for understanding the neural
   mechanisms of the Beauty-is-Good stereotype.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Abstract = {{The present study aimed at identifying dysfunctions in brain networks
   that may underlie disturbed empathic behavior in autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD). During functional magnetic resonance imaging, subjects
   were asked to identify the emotional state observed in a facial stimulus
   (other-task) or to evaluate their own emotional response (self-task).
   Behaviorally, ASD subjects performed equally to the control group during
   the other-task, but showed less emotionally congruent responses in the
   self-task. Activations in brain regions related to theory of mind were
   observed in both groups. Activations of the medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC) were located in dorsal subregions in ASD subjects and in ventral
   areas in control subjects. During the self-task, ASD subjects activated
   an additional network of frontal and inferior temporal areas. Frontal
   areas previously associated with the human mirror system were activated
   in both tasks in control subjects, while ASD subjects recruited these
   areas during the self-task only. Activations in the ventral MPFC may
   provide the basis for one's oemotional bondo with other persons'
   emotions. Such atypical patterns of activation may underlie disturbed
   empathy in individuals with ASD. Subjects with ASD may use an atypical
   cognitive strategy to gain access to their own emotional state in
   response to other people's emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Our own name, due to its high social relevance, is supposed to have a
   unique status in our information processing. However, demonstrating this
   phenomenon empirically proves difficult as famous and unknown names, to
   which self-name is often compared in the studies, may differ from
   self-name not only in terms of the `me vs. not-me' distinction, but also
   as regards their emotional content and frequency of occurrence in
   everyday life. In this fMRI study, apart from famous and unknown names
   we used the names of the most important persons in our subjects' lives.
   When compared to famous or unknown names recognition, self-name
   recognition was associated with robust activations in widely distributed
   bilateral network including fronto-temporal, limbic and subcortical
   structures, however, when compared to significant other's name, the
   activations were present specifically in the right inferior frontal
   gyrus. In addition, the significant other's name produced a similar
   pattern of activations to the one activated by self-name. These results
   suggest that the differences between own and other's name processing may
   rather be quantitative than qualitative in nature.}},

   activate only its core areas}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{123-138}},
Abstract = {{This fMRI study analyzes inferences on other persons' traits, whereby
   half of the participants were given spontaneous (oreado) instructions
   while the other half were given intentional (oinfer the person's traito)
   instructions. Several sentences described the behavior of a target
   person from which a strong trait could be inferred (trait diagnostic) or
   not (trait nondiagnostic). A direct contrast between spontaneous and
   intentional instructions revealed no significant differences, indicating
   that the same social mentalizing network was recruited. There was,
   however, a difference with respect to different brain areas that passed
   the significance threshold, suggesting that this common network was
   recruited to a different degree. Specifically, spontaneous inferences
   significantly recruited only core mentalizing areas, including the
   temporo-parietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex, whereas
   intentional inferences additionally recruited other brain areas,
   including the (pre)cuneus, superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles, and
   parts of the premotor and parietal cortex. These results suggest that
   intentional instructions invite observers to think more about the
   material they read, and consider it in many ways besides its social
   impact. Future research on the neurological underpinnings of trait
   inference might profit from the use of spontaneous instructions to get
   purer results that involve only the core brain areas in social judgment.}},

Abstract = {{The oframing effecto (FE) describes the phenomenon whereby human choices
   are susceptible to the way they are presented rather than objective
   information. The present study extends common decision-making paradigms
   with frame variation by including inhibitory control, operationalized as
   vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) at rest and motor response
   inhibition during a stop-signal task (SST). We hypothesized that
   inhibitory control is inversely associated with susceptibility to
   framing effects. Forty adult volunteers performed a risky-choice framing
   task in which identical information about wins and losses was presented
   using loss or gain frames. As predicted, there was an inverse
   association between HRV and framing effects, accounting for 23\% of the
   variance in framing effects. Inhibitory control as indexed by
   performance in the SST was not associated with framing effects. These
   results are discussed in terms of the role of inhibitory processes (as
   indicated by vagal activity) for decision-making processes.}},

Title = {{Amygdala involvement in self-blame regret}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{178-189}},
Abstract = {{Regret-related brain activity is dependent on free choice, but it is
   unclear whether this activity is a function of more subtle differences
   in the degree of responsibility a decision-maker exerts over a
   regrettable outcome. In this experiment, we show that trial-by-trial
   subjective ratings of regret depend on a higher subjective sense of
   responsibility, as well as being dependent on objective responsibility.
   Using fMRI we show an enhanced amygdala response to regret-related
   outcomes when these outcomes are associated with high, as compared to
   low, responsibility. This enhanced response was maximal in participants
   who showed a greater level of enhancement in their subjective ratings of
   regret engendered by an objective increase in responsibility.
   Orbitofrontal and cingulate cortex showed opposite effects, with an
   enhanced response for regret-related outcomes when participants were not
   objectively responsible. The findings indicate that the way the brain
   processes regret-related outcomes depends on both objective and
   subjective aspects of responsibility, highlighting the critical
   importance of the amygdala.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{198-208}},
Abstract = {{Values are motivational constructs that determine what is important to
   us and which goals we choose to pursue. Cross-cultural research suggests
   that the structure of the human value system is universal, but people
   and cultures differ in terms of relative value priorities. Differences
   in psychological value hierarchies can be parsimoniously described using
   the orthogonal dimensions self-interest and openness to change. Using
   fMRI, we investigated whether individual differences in these universal
   dimensions are reflected in basic neural reward mechanisms during a
   donation task and a GO/NOGO-task. Individuals with high self-interest
   value sacrificed less money for charitable donations and showed higher
   activation of the ventral striatum when receiving monetary rewards.
   Furthermore, individuals with high openness to change value showed a
   greater sensitivity of the dorsal striatum when trying to inhibit
   habitual prepotent responses. Our findings suggest that
   context-dependent neural reward sensitivity biases reflect (and may even
   determine) differences in individual value hierarchies and underlie the
   effects of values on decisions and behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to think about oneselfto self-reflectis one of the defining

   variety of different aspects of themselves, including their stable
   personality traits, current feelings, and physical attributes, no
   research has directly examined the extent to which these different forms
   of self-reflection are subserved by common mechanisms. To address this
   question, participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) while making judgments about their own personality
   traits, current mental states, and physical attributes as well as those
   of another person. Whereas some brain regions responded preferentially
   during only one form of self-reflection, a robust region of MPFC was
   engaged preferentially during self-reflection across all three types of

Abstract = {{Moral judgment depends critically on theory of mind (ToM), reasoning

   judgment of harmful vs. helpful actions. Is ToM deployed differently for
   judgments of blame vs. praise? Participants evaluated agents who
   produced a harmful, helpful, or neutral outcome, based on a harmful,
   helpful, or neutral intention; participants made blame and praise
   judgments. In the right temporo-parietal junction (right TPJ), and, to a
   lesser extent, the left TPJ and medial prefrontal cortex, the neural
   response reflected an interaction between belief and outcome factors,
   for both blame and praise judgments: The response in these regions was
   highest when participants delivered a negative moral judgment, i.e.,
   assigned blame or withheld praise, based solely on the agent's intent
   (attempted harm, accidental help). These results show enhanced attention

Title = {{Abnormal temporal and parietal magnetic activations during the early

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is associated with abnormal cortical activation during
   theory of mind (ToM), as demonstrated by several fMRI or PET studies.
   Electrical and temporal characteristics of these abnormalities,
   especially in the early stages, remain unexplored. Nineteen medicated
   schizophrenic patients and 21 healthy controls underwent
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording to measure brain response evoked
   by nonverbal stimuli requiring mentalizing. Three conditions based on
   comic-strips were contrasted: attribution of intentions to others (AI),
   physical causality with human characters (PCCH), and physical causality
   with objects (PCOB). Minimum norm localization was performed in order to
   select regions of interest (ROIs) within bilateral temporal and parietal
   regions that showed significant ToM-related activations in the control
   group. Time-courses of each ROI were compared across group and
   condition. Reduced cortical activation within the 200 to 600 ms
   time-window was observed in the selected regions in patients.
   Significant group by condition interactions (i.e., reduced modulation in
   patients) were found in right posterior superior temporal sulcus, right
   temporoparietal junction, and right inferior parietal lobule during
   attribution of intentions. As in healthy controls, the presence of
   characters elicited activation in patients' left posterior temporal
   regions and temporoparietal junction. No group difference on evoked
   responses' latencies in AI was found. In conclusion, ToM processes in
   the early stages are functionally impaired in schizophrenia. MEG
   provides a promising means to refine our knowledge on schizophrenic
   social cognitive disorders.}},

   evidence}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{327-335}},
Abstract = {{It has been proposed that the human mirror neuron system (MNS) plays an
   integral role in mediating empathy. In this review, we critically
   examine evidence from three bodies of research that have been cited as
   supporting this notion: (1) behavioral studies that have examined the
   relationship between imitation and empathy, (2) findings from functional
   neuroimaging studies that report a positive correlation between MNS
   activation and self-report on an empathy questionnaire, and (3)
   observations of impaired imitation and empathy in autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD). In addition, we briefly review lesion studies of the
   neural correlates of imitation and empathy. Current evidence suggests
   that the MNS is broadly involved in empathy, but at this stage there has
   been limited consideration of its various forms, including motor,
   emotional, and cognitive empathy. There are also various forms of
   imitation, encompassing emotional and non-emotional, automatic, and
   voluntary actions. We propose that the relationship between imitation
   and empathy may vary depending on the specific type of each of these
   abilities. Furthermore, these abilities may be mediated by partially
   distinct neural networks, which involve the MNS to a variable degree.}},

Abstract = {{The cognitive and neural mechanisms leading to deception were studied by
   the event-related brain potential (ERP) technique. In a simulated
   deception situation with graded monetary incentives, participants made a
   decision to lie or be truthful in each trial and held their response
   until a delayed imperative signal was presented. Spatiotemporal
   principal component analysis (PCA) and source analysis revealed that
   brain activities dominant in the left lateral frontal area approximately
   800-1,000 ms post-stimulus and over the central-frontal-parietal and
   right frontal areas after 1,300 ms were significantly more negative in
   the deceptive condition than in the truthful condition. These results
   suggest that two serial cognitive processes, decision making and
   response preparation, are related to deliberate deception.}},

   empathically experienced rejection}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{369-376}},
Abstract = {{Empathy is generally thought of as the ability to share the emotional
   experiences of others. In scientific terms, this is usually
   operationalized as an ability to vicariously feel others' mental and
   emotional experiences. Supporting this account, research demonstrates
   that watching others experience physical pain activates similar brain
   regions to the actual experience of pain itself. First-hand experience
   of social rejection also activates this network. The current work
   extends these findings by examining whether the ``pain{''} network is
   similarly implicated in witnessing rejection, and whether emotional
   closeness modulates this response. We provide evidence for each of these
   suppositions, demonstrating: (a) that the pain network is activated when
   watching a friend suffer social rejection, and (b) that interpersonal
   closeness with that friend modulates this response. Further, we found
   that the inferior frontal gyrus, critical for representing others'
   mental and emotional states, mediates the relationship between emotional
   closeness and neural responses to watching the rejection of a friend.}},

Title = {{Understanding motor resonance}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{388-397}},
Abstract = {{The discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys, and the finding of motor
   activity during action observation in humans are generally regarded to
   support motor theories of action understanding. These theories take
   motor resonance to be essential in the understanding of observed actions
   and the inference of action goals. However, the notions of
   ``resonance,{''} ``action understanding,{''} and ``action goal{''}
   appear to be used ambiguously in the literature. A survey of the
   literature on mirror neurons and motor resonance yields two different
   interpretations of the term `` resonance,{''} three different
   interpretations of action understanding, and again three different
   interpretations of what the goal of an action is. This entails that,
   unless it is specified what interpretation is used, the meaning of any
   statement about the relation between these concepts can differ to a
   great extent. By discussing an experiment we will show that more precise
   definitions and use of the concepts will allow for better assessments of
   motor theories of action understanding and hence a more fruitful
   scientific debate. Lastly, we will provide an example of how the
   discussed experimental setup could be adapted to test other
   interpretations of the concepts.}},

Title = {{Neural basis of moral verdict and moral deliberation}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{398-413}},
Abstract = {{How people judge something to be morally right or wrong is a fundamental
   question of both the sciences and the humanities. Here we aim to
   identify the neural processes that underlie the specific conclusion that
   something is morally wrong. To do this, we introduce a novel distinction
   between ``moral deliberation,{''} or the weighing of moral
   considerations, and the formation of a `` moral verdict,{''} or the
   commitment to one moral conclusion. We predict and identify hemodynamic
   activity in the bilateral anterior insula and basal ganglia that
   correlates with committing to the moral verdict `` this is morally
   wrong{''} as opposed to `` this is morally not-wrong,{''} a finding that
   is consistent with research from economic decision-making. Using
   comparisons of deliberation-locked vs. verdict-locked analyses, we also
   demonstrate that hemodynamic activity in high-level cortical regions
   previously implicated in morality-including the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporoparietal
   junction-correlates primarily with moral deliberation as opposed to
   moral verdicts. These findings provide new insights into what types of
   processes comprise the enterprise of moral judgment, and in doing so
   point to a framework for resolving why some clinical patients, including
   psychopaths, may have intact moral judgment but impaired moral behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Successful human interaction is based on correct recognition,
   interpretation, and appropriate reaction to facial affect. In
   depression, social skill deficits are among the most restraining
   symptoms leading to social withdrawal, thereby aggravating social
   isolation and depressive affect. Dysfunctional approach and withdrawal
   tendencies to emotional stimuli have been documented, but the
   investigation of their neural underpinnings has received limited
   attention. We performed an fMRI study including 15 depressive patients
   and 15 matched, healthy controls. All subjects performed two tasks, an
   implicit joystick task as well as an explicit rating task, both using
   happy, neutral, and angry facial expressions. Behavioral data analysis
   indicated a significant group effect, with depressed patients showing
   more withdrawal than controls. Analysis of the functional data revealed
   significant group effects for both tasks. Among other regions, we
   observed significant group differences in amygdala activation, with
   patients showing less response particularly during approach to happy
   faces. Additionally, significant correlations of amygdala activation
   with psychopathology emerged, suggesting that more pronounced symptoms
   are accompanied by stronger decreases of amygdala activation. Hence, our
   results demonstrate that depressed patients show dysfunctional social
   approach and withdrawal behavior, which in turn may aggravate the
   disorder by negative social interactions contributing to isolation and
   reinforcing cognitive biases.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies investigating emotion recognition in schizophrenia have
   focused on facial expressions and neglected bodily and vocal
   expressions. Furthermore, little is known about affective multisensory
   integration in schizophrenia. In the first experiment, the authors
   investigated recognition of static, face-blurred, whole-body expressions
   (instrumental, angry, fearful, and sad) with a two-alternative,
   forced-choice, simultaneous matching task in a sample of schizophrenia
   patients, nonschizophrenic psychotic patients, and matched controls. In
   the second experiment, dynamic, face-blurred, whole-body expressions
   (fearful and happy) were presented simultaneously with either congruent
   or incongruent human or animal vocalizations to schizophrenia patients
   and controls. Participants were instructed to categorize the emotion
   expressed by the body and to ignore the auditory information. The
   results of Experiment 1 show an emotion recognition impairment in the
   schizophrenia group and to a lesser extent in the nonschizophrenic
   psychosis group, and this for all four expressions. The findings of
   Experiment 2 show that schizophrenia patients are more influenced by the
   auditory information than controls, but only when the auditory
   information consists of human vocalizations. This shows that
   schizophrenia patients are impaired in recognizing whole-body
   expressions, and they show abnormal affective multisensory integration
   of bimodal stimuli originating from the same source.}},

   attribution}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5-6, SI}},
Pages = {{569-581}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although previous behavioral studies have shown that
   schizophrenia patients have impaired theory of mind (ToM), the neural
   mechanisms associated with this impairment are poorly understood. This
   study aimed to identify the neural mechanisms of ToM in schizophrenia,
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a belief
   attribution task.
   Methods: In the scanner, 12 schizophrenia patients and 13 healthy
   control subjects performed the belief attribution task with three
   conditions: a false belief condition, a false photograph condition, and
   a simple reading condition.
   Results: For the false belief versus simple reading conditions,
   schizophrenia patients showed reduced neural activation in areas
   including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) compared with controls. Further, during the false belief
   versus false photograph conditions, we observed increased activations in
   the TPJ and the MPFC in healthy controls, but not in schizophrenia
   patients. For the false photograph versus simple reading condition, both
   groups showed comparable neural activations.
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia patients showed reduced task-related
   activation in the TPJ and the MPFC during the false belief condition
   compared with controls, but not for the false photograph condition. This
   pattern suggests that reduced activation in these regions is associated
   with, and specific to, impaired ToM in schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Brain activation during a social attribution task in adolescents with
   moderate to severe traumatic brain injury}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5-6, SI}},
Pages = {{582-598}},
Abstract = {{The ability to make accurate judgments about the mental states of
   others, sometimes referred to as theory of mind (ToM), is often impaired
   following traumatic brain injury (TBI), and this deficit may contribute
   to problems with interpersonal relationships. The present study used an
   animated social attribution task (SAT) with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine structures mediating ToM in
   adolescents with moderate to severe TBI. The study design also included
   a comparison group of matched, typically developing (TD) adolescents.
   The TD group exhibited activation within a number of areas that are
   thought to be relevant to ToM, including the medial prefrontal and
   anterior cingulate cortex, fusiform gyrus, and posterior temporal and
   parietal areas. The TBI subjects had significant activation within many
   of these same areas, but their activation was generally more intense and
   excluded the medial prefrontal cortex. Exploratory regression analyses
   indicated a negative relation between ToM-related activation and
   measures of white matter integrity derived from diffusion tensor
   imaging, while there was also a positive relation between activation and
   lesion volume. These findings are consistent with alterations in the
   level and pattern of brain activation that may be due to the combined
   influence of diffuse axonal injury and focal lesions.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background: Theory of mind (ToM) functioning develops during certain
   phases of childhood. Factors such as language development and
   educational style seem to influence its development. Some studies that
   have focused on transcultural aspects of ToM development have found
   differences between Asian and Western cultures. To date, however, little
   is known about transcultural differences in neural activation patterns
   as they relate to ToM functioning.
   Experimental methods: The aim of our study was to observe ToM
   functioning and differences in brain activation patterns, as assessed by
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This study included a
   sample of 18 healthy Japanese and 15 healthy Caucasian subjects living
   in Japan. We presented a ToM task depicting geometrical shapes moving in
   social patterns. We also administered questionnaires to examine empathy
   abilities and cultural background factors.
   Results: Behavioral data showed no significant group differences in the
   subjects' post-scan descriptions of the movies. The imaging results
   displayed stronger activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in
   the Caucasian sample during the presentation of ToM videos. Furthermore,
   the task-associated activation of the MPFC was positively correlated
   with autistic and alexithymic features in the Japanese sample.
   Discussion: In summary, our results showed evidence of culturally
   dependent sociobehavioral trait patterns, which suggests that they have
   an impact on brain activation patterns during information processing
   involving ToM.}},

   experimentally, as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging, one of
   the leading methods of behavioural and cognitive neuroscience. We relate
   this to general challenges within neuroethics, philosophy, and a

Pages = {{204-212}},
Abstract = {{The widespread use and novel applications of brain imaging techniques
   seem to open the possibility of new threats to one's privacy. Being in a
   situation where we cannot control what information about ourselves is
   available to others could restrict the jobs we can get, the business we
   conduct, the way we are seen by strangers, and the way we relate to our
   friends and family. While researchers and practitioners should be
   cautious about the ways they use brain imaging data, we argue that brain
   reading does not violate privacy in any way different from the already
   established psychological methods to determine mental phenomena, such as
   whether someone suffers from color blindness or is clinically depressed.
   For brain reading to constitute a new threat, we claim it would have to
   be possible to easily gather information about a subject's mental states
   in accidental or malicious ways without the knowledge of the subject.
   Against this possibility, we note that brain imaging techniques require
   (i) the researchers to intentionally seek a specific type of mental
   state to the exclusion of information about other states, (ii) the
   active cooperation and participation of subjects, and (iii) a method of
   analysis that depends on the already established psychological tests.
   Hence, while there should be policies that specify when brain imaging
   can be used and how, these policies should be treated within a broader
   context of privacy issues in psychology rather than as a special case.}},
