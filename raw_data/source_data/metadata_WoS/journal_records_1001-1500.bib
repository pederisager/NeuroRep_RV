Abstract = {{Learning and motivation are intrinsically related, and both have been
   linked to dopamine. Parkinson's disease results from a progressive loss
   of dopaminergic inputs to the striatum and leads to impairments in
   motivation and learning from feedback. However, the link between
   motivation and learning in Parkinson's disease is not well understood.
   To address this gap, we leverage a well-established psychological theory
   of motivation, regulatory mode theory, which distinguishes between two
   functionally independent motivational concerns in regulating behavior: a
   concern with having an effect by initiating and maintaining movement (
   Locomotion) and a concern with establishing what is correct by
   critically evaluating goal pursuit means and outcomes ( Assessment). We
   examined Locomotion and Assessment in patients with Parkinson's disease
   and age-matched controls. Parkinson's disease patients demonstrated a
   selective decrease in Assessment motivation but no change in Locomotion
   motivation, suggesting that Parkinson's disease leads to a reduced
   tendency to evaluate and monitor outcomes. Moreover, weaker Assessment
   motivation was correlated with poorer performance on a feedback-based
   learning task previously shown to depend on the striatum. Together,
   these findings link a questionnaire-based personality inventory with
   performance on a well-characterized experimental task, advancing our
   understanding of how Parkinson's disease affects motivation with
   implications for well-being and treatment outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit impairment in
   reciprocal social interactions, including play, which can manifest as
   failure to show social preference or discrimination between social and
   nonsocial stimuli. To explore mechanisms underlying these deficits, we
   collected salivary cortisol from 42 children 8-12 years with ASD or
   typical development during a playground interaction with a confederate
   child. Participants underwent functional MRI during a prisoner's dilemma
   game requiring cooperation or defection with a human (confederate) or
   computer partner. Search region of interest analyses were based on
   previous research (e.g. insula, amygdala, temporal parietal
   junction-TPJ). There were significant group differences in neural
   activation based on partner and response pattern. When playing with a
   human partner, children with ASD showed limited engagement of a social
   salience brain circuit during defection. Reduced insula activation
   during defection in the ASD children relative to TD children, regardless
   of partner type, was also a prominent finding. Insula and TPJ BOLD
   during defection was also associated with stress responsivity and
   behavior in the ASD group under playground conditions. Children with ASD
   engage social salience networks less than TD children during conditions
   of social salience, supporting a fundamental disturbance of social
   engagement.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is the time of peak onset for many anxiety disorders,
   particularly Social Anxiety Disorder. Research using simulated social
   interactions consistently finds differential activation in several brain
   regions in anxious (vs non-anxious) youth, including amygdala, striatum
   and medial prefrontal cortex. However, few studies examined the
   anticipation of peer interactions, a key component in the etiology and
   maintenance of anxiety disorders. Youth completed the Chatroom Task
   while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Patterns of
   neural activation were assessed in anxious and non-anxious youth as they
   were cued to anticipate social feedback from peers. Anxious participants
   evidenced greater amygdala activation and rostral anterior cingulate
   (rACC)<-> amygdala coupling than non-anxious participants during
   anticipation of feedback from peers they had previously rejected;
   anxious participants also evidenced less nucleus accumbens activation
   during anticipation of feedback from selected peers. Finally, anxiety
   interacted with age in rACC: in anxious participants, age was positively
   associated with activation to anticipated feedback from rejected peers
   and negatively for selected peers, whereas the opposite pattern emerged
   for non-anxious youth. Overall, anxious youth showed greater reactivity
   in anticipation of feedback from rejected peers and thus may ascribe
   greater salience to these potential interactions and increase the
   likelihood of avoidance behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Human body postures convey useful information for understanding others'
   emotions and intentions. To investigate at which stage of visual
   processing emotional and movement-related information conveyed by bodies
   is discriminated, we examined event-related potentials elicited by
   laterally presented images of bodies with static postures and
   implied-motion body images with neutral, fearful or happy expressions.
   At the early stage of visual structural encoding (N190), we found a
   difference in the sensitivity of the two hemispheres to observed body
   postures. Specifically, the right hemisphere showed a N190 modulation
   both for the motion content (i.e. all the observed postures implying
   body movements elicited greater N190 amplitudes compared with static
   postures) and for the emotional content (i.e. fearful postures elicited
   the largest N190 amplitude), while the left hemisphere showed a
   modulation only for the motion content. In contrast, at a later stage of
   perceptual representation, reflecting selective attention to salient
   stimuli, an increased early posterior negativity was observed for
   fearful stimuli in both hemispheres, suggesting an enhanced processing
   of motivationally relevant stimuli. The observed modulations, both at
   the early stage of structural encoding and at the later processing
   stage, suggest the existence of a specialized perceptual mechanism tuned
   to emotion-and action-related information conveyed by human body
   postures.}},

Abstract = {{Dysfunctional processing of reward and punishment may play an important
   role in depression. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) studies have shown heterogeneous results for reward processing in
   fronto-striatal regions. We examined neural responsivity associated with
   the processing of reward and loss during anticipation and receipt of
   incentives and related prediction error (PE) signalling in depressed
   individuals. Thirty medication-free depressed persons and 28 healthy
   controls performed an fMRI reward paradigm. Regions of interest analyses
   focused on neural responses during anticipation and receipt of gains and
   losses and related PE-signals. Additionally, we assessed the
   relationship between neural responsivity during gain/loss processing and
   hedonic capacity. When compared with healthy controls, depressed
   individuals showed reduced fronto-striatal activity during anticipation
   of gains and losses. The groups did not significantly differ in response
   to reward and loss outcomes. In depressed individuals, activity
   increases in the orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens during
   reward anticipation were associated with hedonic capacity. Depressed
   individuals showed an absence of reward-related PEs but encoded
   loss-related PEs in the ventral striatum. Depression seems to be linked
   to blunted responsivity in fronto-striatal regions associated with
   limited motivational responses for rewards and losses. Alterations in PE
   encoding might mirror blunted reward-and enhanced loss-related
   associative learning in depression.}},

Abstract = {{Food is an innate reward stimulus related to energy homeostasis and
   survival, whereas money is considered a more general reward stimulus
   that gains a rewarding value through learning experiences. Although the
   underlying neural processing for both modalities of reward has been
   investigated independently from one another, a more detailed
   investigation of neural similarities and/or differences between food and
   monetary reward is still missing. Here, we investigated the neural
   processing of food compared with monetary-related rewards in 27 healthy,
   normal-weight women using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We
   developed a task distinguishing between the anticipation and the receipt
   of either abstract food or monetary reward. Both tasks activated the
   ventral striatum during the expectation of a reward. Compared with
   money, greater food-related activations were observed in prefrontal,
   parietal and central midline structures during the anticipation and
   lateral orbitofrontal cortex (IOFC) during the receipt of food reward.
   Furthermore, during the receipt of food reward, brain activation in the
   secondary taste cortex was positively related to the body mass index.
   These results indicate that food-dependent activations encompass to a
   greater extent brain regions involved in self-control and
   self-reflection during the anticipation and phylogenetically older parts
   of the IOFC during the receipt of reward.}},

Abstract = {{Successful human social interactions depend upon the transmission of
   verbal and non-verbal signals from one individual to another. Non-verbal
   social communication is realized through our ability to read and
   understand information present in other people's actions. It has been
   proposed that employing the same motor programs, we use to execute an
   action when observing the same action underlies this action
   understanding. The main prediction of this framework is that action
   perception should be strongly correlated with parameters of action
   execution. Here, we demonstrate that subjects' sensitivity to observed
   movement speeds is dependent upon how quickly they themselves executed
   the observed action. This result is consistent with the motor theory of
   social cognition and suggests that failures in non-verbal social
   interactions between individuals may in part result from differences in
   how those individuals move.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have investigated how attentional control is affected by
   transient affective states while taking individual differences in
   affective traits into consideration. In this study, participants
   completed a color-word Stroop task immediately after undergoing a
   positive, neutral or negative affective context manipulation (ACM).
   Behavioral performance was unaffected by any ACM considered in
   isolation. For individuals high in trait negative affect (NA),
   performance was impaired by the negative but not the positive or neutral
   ACM. Neuroimaging results indicate that activity in primarily top-down
   control regions of the brain (inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex) was suppressed in the presence of emotional arousal
   (both negative and positive ACMs). This effect appears to have been
   exacerbated or offset by co-occurring activity in other top-down control
   regions (parietal) and emotion processing regions (orbitofrontal cortex,
   amygdala and nucleus accumbens) as a function of the valence of state
   affect (positive or negative) and trait affect (trait NA or trait PA).
   Neuroimaging results are consistent with behavioral findings. In
   combination, they indicate both additive and interactive influences of
   trait and state affect on top-down control of attention.}},

Abstract = {{Powerful speeches can captivate audiences, whereas weaker speeches fail
   to engage their listeners. What is happening in the brains of a
   captivated audience? Here, we assess audience-wide functional brain
   dynamics during listening to speeches of varying rhetorical quality. The
   speeches were given by German politicians and evaluated as rhetorically
   powerful or weak. Listening to each of the speeches induced similar
   neural response time courses, as measured by inter-subject correlation
   analysis, in widespread brain regions involved in spoken language
   processing. Crucially, alignment of the time course across listeners was
   stronger for rhetorically powerful speeches, especially for bilateral
   regions of the superior temporal gyri and medial prefrontal cortex.
   Thus, during powerful speeches, listeners as a group are more coupled to
   each other, suggesting that powerful speeches are more potent in taking
   control of the listeners' brain responses. Weaker speeches were
   processed more heterogeneously, although they still prompted
   substantially correlated responses. These patterns of coupled neural
   responses bear resemblance to metaphors of resonance, which are often
   invoked in discussions of speech impact, and contribute to the
   literature on auditory attention under natural circumstances. Overall,
   this approach opens up possibilities for research on the neural
   mechanisms mediating the reception of entertaining or persuasive
   messages.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive body of literature has indicated that there is increased
   activity in the frontoparietal control network (FPC) and decreased
   activity in the default mode network (DMN) during working memory (WM)
   tasks. The FPC and DMN operate in a competitive relationship during
   tasks requiring externally directed attention. However, the association
   between this FPC-DMN competition and performance in social WM tasks has
   rarely been reported in previous studies. To investigate this question,
   we measured FPC-DMN connectivity during resting state and two emotional
   face recognition WM tasks using the 2-back paradigm. Thirty-four
   individuals were instructed to perform the tasks based on either the
   expression {[} emotion (EMO)] or the identity (ID) of the same set of
   face stimuli. Consistent with previous studies, an increased
   anti-correlation between the FPC and DMN was observed during both tasks
   relative to the resting state. Specifically, this anti-correlation
   during the EMO task was stronger than during the ID task, as the former
   has a higher social load. Intriguingly, individual differences in
   self-reported empathy were significantly correlated with the FPC-DMN
   anti-correlation in the EMO task. These results indicate that the
   top-down signals from the FPC suppress the DMN to support social WM and
   empathy.}},

Abstract = {{A single-nucleotide polymorphism on the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR),
   rs53576, involving a guanine (G) to adenine (A) substitution has been
   associated with altered prosocial features. Specifically, individuals
   with the GG genotype (i.e. the absence of the polymorphism) display
   beneficial traits including enhanced trust, empathy and self-esteem.
   However, because G carriers might also be more socially sensitive, this
   may render them more vulnerable to the adverse effects of a negative
   social stressor. The current investigation, conducted among 128 white
   female undergraduate students, demonstrated that relative to individuals
   with AA genotype, G carriers were more emotionally sensitive (lower
   self-esteem) in response to social ostracism promoted through an on-line
   ball tossing game (Cyberball). Furthermore, GG individuals also
   exhibited altered blood pressure and cortisol levels following
   rejection, effects not apparent among A carriers. The data support the
   view that the presence of the G allele not only promotes prosocial
   behaviors but also favors sensitivity to a negative social stressor.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescent heavy alcohol drinking increases the risk for alcohol use
   disorders in adulthood, yet mechanisms conferring increased risk are not
   well understood. We propose that adolescent alcohol drinking shapes
   alcohol's aversive or appetitive properties in adulthood. Alcohol
   normally drives aversive learning and alcohol-predictive cues are
   avoided. We hypothesize that through adolescent heavy drinking alcohol
   gains access to appetitive learning. A primary consequence is that
   alcohol-predictive cues become valued and sought out. To test this
   hypothesis, we gave genetically heterogeneous, male Long Evans rats
   voluntary, chronic intermittent access to water or alcohol throughout
   adolescence and then identified moderate and heavy alcohol drinkers.
   After a short abstinence period, we assessed the aversive or appetitive
   properties of alcohol using flavor learning procedures. We compared
   alcohol to the known appetitive properties of sugar. Flavor learning in
   adult rats who were alcohol-naive or adolescent moderate alcohol
   drinkers revealed alcohol to be aversive and sugar to be appetitive. The
   same flavor learning procedures revealed both alcohol and sugar to be
   appetitive in adult rats who were adolescent heavy drinkers. The results
   demonstrate that alcohol gains access to neurobehavioral circuits for
   appetitive learning through adolescent heavy alcohol drinking.}},

Abstract = {{Heroin addiction is a disease of chronic relapse affecting over half of
   its users. Therefore, modeling individual differences in addiction-like
   behavior is needed to better reflect the human condition. In a rodent
   model, avoidance of a cocaine-paired saccharin cue is associated with
   greater cocaine seeking and taking. Here, we tested whether rats would
   avoid a saccharin cue when paired with the opportunity to
   self-administer heroin and whether the rats that most greatly avoid the
   heroin-paired taste cue would exhibit the greatest drug escalation over
   time, the greatest willingness to work for drug, and the greatest
   heroin-induced relapse. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received 5 min
   access to a 0.15\% saccharin solution followed by the opportunity to
   self-administer either saline or heroin for 3 hr (short access) or 6 hr
   (extended access). Following 16 to 18 pairings, terminal saccharin
   intake was used to categorize the rats into small (>200 licks/5min) or
   large (<200 licks/5min) suppressors and responding for drug was examined
   accordingly. Only 5\% of the short access rats reached the criteria for
   large suppressors. This large suppressor did not differ from the small
   suppressors in drug-taking behavior. On the other hand, 50\% of the
   extended access saccharin-heroin rats were large suppressors and showed
   the largest escalation of drug intake, drug-loading behavior, and the
   greatest relapse-like behaviors. Extended access small suppressors
   displayed drug-taking behaviors that were similar to rats in the short
   access heroin condition. Avoidance of a heroin-paired taste cue reliably
   identifies individual differences in addiction-like behavior for heroin
   using extended drug access.}},

Abstract = {{Standard dopamine therapies for schizophrenia are not efficacious for
   negative symptoms of the disease, including asociality. This reduced
   social behavior may be due to glutamatergic dysfunction within the
   amygdala, leading to increased fear and social anxiety. Several studies
   have demonstrated the prosocial effects of oxytocin in schizophrenia
   patients. Therefore, this study evaluates the effect of subchronic
   oxytocin on EEG activity in amygdala of mice during performance of the
   three-chamber social choice and open field tests following acute
   ketamine as a model of glutamatergic dysfunction. Oxytocin did not
   restore social deficits introduced by ketamine but did significantly
   increase sociality in comparison to the control group. Ketamine had no
   effect on time spent in the center during the open field trials, whereas
   oxytocin increased overall center time across all groups, suggesting a
   reduction in anxiety. Amygdala activity was consistent across all drug
   groups during social and nonsocial behavioral trials. However, oxytocin
   reduced overall amygdala EEG power during the two behavioral tasks.
   Alternatively, ketamine did not significantly affect EEG power
   throughout the tasks. Decreased EEG power in the amygdala, as caused by
   oxytocin, may be related to both reduced anxiety and increased social
   behaviors. Data suggest that separate prosocial and social anxiety
   pathways may mediate social preference.}},

Abstract = {{The noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist
   (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo {[}a, d] cyclohepten-5-10-imine
   maleate (MK-801) has been shown to increase the probability of operant
   responding during extinction and reduce infralimbic prefrontal cortical
   activation, possibly modeling the cognitive dysfunction symptomology,
   and underlying cause, in patients with schizophrenia. The present study
   sought to determine if typical and/or atypical antipsychotics would
   attenuate the MK-801-induced behavioral perseveration and whether this
   would be associated with concomitant changes in phosphorylated ERK1/2
   (pERK1/2) labeling in the infralimbic cortex (IL). Male, Long Evans rats
   were pretreated with the typical antipsychotic, Flupenthixol (0, 0.125,
   0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg) or the atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole (0, 0.3,
   1.0, 3.0 mg/kg), then given 0.1 mg/kg MK-801 followed by a 60-min
   appetitive operant extinction session. Flupenthixol produced a
   dose-dependent decrease in MK-801-induced bar pressing behavior and
   locomotor activity and a dose-dependent increase in IL pERK1/2 labeling.
   Aripiprazole produced a U-shaped dose-response curve on MK-801-induced
   bar pressing behavior, a dose-dependent decrease in locomotor activity
   but no changes in IL pERK1/2 labeling. The attenuation of the
   MK-801-induced behavioral (bar pressing, locomotion) profile by
   Flupenthixol indicates a clear dopaminergic contribution to this
   behavior. The behavioral effect of aripiprazole may be due to its a)
   binding to presynaptic dopamine receptors at the midrange dose
   decreasing dopamine output and b) binding to postsynaptic dopamine
   receptors at the higher dose increasing dopamine tone. While both
   classes of antipsychotics can normalize perseverative behavioral
   symptoms, the underlying prefrontal cortical dysregulation seems to
   persist.}},

Abstract = {{Based on work done in animal models showing that autism-like symptoms
   are ameliorated following exposure to an enriched sensorimotor
   environment, we attempted to develop a comparable therapy for children
   with autism. In an initial randomized controlled trial, children with
   autism who received sensorimotor enrichment at home for 6 months had
   significant improvements in both their cognitive ability and the
   severity of their autism symptoms (Woo \& Leon, 2013). We now report the
   outcomes of a similar randomized controlled trial in which children with
   autism, 3 to 6 years old, were randomly assigned to groups that received
   either daily sensorimotor enrichment, administered by their parents,
   along with standard care, or they received standard care alone. After 6
   months, enriched children showed statistically significant gains in
   their IQ scores, a decline in their atypical sensory responses, and an
   improvement in their receptive language performance, compared to
   controls. Furthermore, after 6 months of enrichment therapy, 21\% of the
   children who initially had been given an autism classification, using
   the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, improved to the point that,
   although they remained on the autism spectrum, they no longer met the
   criteria for classic autism. None of the standard care controls reached
   an equivalent level of improvement. Finally, the outcome measures for
   children who received only a subset of sensory stimuli were similar to
   those receiving the full complement of enrichment exercises.
   Sensorimotor enrichment therapy therefore appears to be a cost-effective
   means of treating a range of symptoms for children with autism.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to set up (a) a large primary motor cortex
   (M1) lesion in rodent and (b) the conditions for evaluating a
   long-lasting motor deficit in order to propose a valid model to test
   neuronal replacement therapies aimed at improving motor deficit
   recovery. A mitochondrial toxin, malonate, was injected to induce
   extensive destruction of the forelimb M1 cortex. Three key motor
   functions that are usually evaluated following cerebral lesion in the
   clinic-strength, target reaching, and fine dexterity-were assessed in
   rats by 2 tests, a forelimb grip strength test and a skilled reaching
   task (staircase) for reaching and dexterity. The potential enhancement
   of postlesion recovery induced by a neuronal cell transplantation was
   then explored and confirmed by histological analyses. Both tests showed
   a severe functional impairment 2 days post lesion, however, reaching
   remained intact. Deficits in forelimb strength were long lasting (up to
   3 months) but spontaneously recovered despite the extensive lesion size.
   This natural grip strength recovery could be enhanced by cell therapy.
   Histological analyses confirmed the presence of grafted cells 3 months
   postgraft and showed partial tissue reconstruction with some living
   neuronal cells in the graft. In contrast, fine dexterity never recovered
   in the staircase test even after grafting. These results suggest that
   cell replacement was only partially effective and that the forelimb M1
   area may be a node of the sensorimotor network, where compensation from
   secondary pathways could account for strength recovery but recovery of
   forelimb fine dexterity requires extensive tissue reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is downregulated by numerous
   lifestyle factors including chronic stress. While the functional
   significance of AHN remains elusive, computational models and empirical
   evidence implicate immature neurons in minimizing interference between
   similar memories-a process termed pattern separation. The role of
   neurogenesis in remote memory is less clear. Some have proposed that
   neurogenesis promotes the clearance of old memories from the
   hippocampus, while others have proposed that neurogenesis promotes
   long-term retention of memories within the hippocampus. We used a
   modified version of the behavioral pattern separation task originally
   described by Kirwan and Stark (2007). In this task, some objects are
   repeated across trials, some are similar lures and the rest are novel.
   Participants are asked to classify each object as old, new, or similar.
   The correct classification of lures as similar may tax pattern
   separation processes in the hippocampus and AHN. To investigate the
   potential role of AHN in remote memory, we introduced a 2-week delay
   between the presentation and recognition of certain stimuli. As in
   previous studies, we found that those with higher depression scores made
   significantly more errors at identifying lures as similar when
   presentation and recognition were separated by a brief delay. When
   presentation and recognition trials were separated by a longer delay,
   the correct classification of lures dropped to chance levels for all
   groups, but now lower stress and depression scores were associated with
   superior identification of exact repetitions. Our data suggest a role
   for AHN in the stabilization of remote memories.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments used an associative blocking design to study the role of
   dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) and core
   (AcbC) in fear prediction error. Rats in the experimental groups were
   trained to a visual fear-conditioned stimulus (conditional stimulus
   {[}CS]) A in Stage I, whereas rats in the control groups were not. In
   Stage II, all rats received compound fear conditioning of the visual CSA
   and an auditory CSB. Rats were later tested for their fear responses to
   CSB. All rats received microinjections of saline or the D1-D2 receptor
   antagonist cis-(z)-flupenthixol prior to Stage II. These microinjections
   targeted either the AcbSh (Experiment 1) or the AcbC (Experiment 2). In
   each experiment, Stage I fear conditioning of CSA blocked fear learning
   to CSB. Microinjection of cis-(z)-flupenthixol (10 or 20 mu g) into the
   AcbSh (Experiment 1) had no effect on fear learning or associative
   blocking. In contrast, microinjection of cis-(z)-flupenthixol (10 or 20
   mu g) into the AcbC (Experiment 2) attenuated blocking and so enabled
   fear learning to CSB. These results identify the AcbC as the critical

Abstract = {{Voluntary wheel running in rats provides a preclinical model of exercise
   motivation in humans. We hypothesized that rats run because this
   activity has positive incentive salience in both the acquisition and
   habitual stages of wheel running and that gender differences might be
   present. Additionally, we sought to determine which forebrain regions
   are essential for the motivational processes underlying wheel running in
   rats. The motivation for voluntary wheel running in male and female
   Sprague-Dawley rats was investigated during the acquisition (Days 1-7)
   and habitual phases (after Day 21) of running using conditioned place
   preference (CPP) and the reinstatement (rebound) response after forced
   abstinence, respectively. Both genders displayed a strong CPP for the
   acquisition phase and a strong rebound response to wheel deprivation
   during the habitual phase, suggesting that both phases of wheel running
   are rewarding for both sexes. Female rats showed a 1.5 times greater
   rebound response than males to wheel deprivation in the habitual phase
   of running, while during the acquisition phase, no gender differences in
   CPP were found. We transiently inactivated the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) or the nucleus accumbens (NA), hypothesizing that because these
   regions are involved in the acquisition and reinstatement of
   self-administration of both natural and pharmacological stimuli, they
   might also serve a role in the motivation to wheel run. Inactivation of
   either structure decreased the rebound response in the habitual phase of
   running, demonstrating that these structures are involved in the
   motivation for this behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The precise encoding of temporal features of auditory stimuli by the
   mammalian auditory system is critical to the perception of biologically
   important sounds, including vocalizations, speech, and music. In this
   study, auditory gap-detection behavior was evaluated in adult pigmented
   ferrets (Mustelid putorius furo) using bandpassed stimuli designed to
   widely sample the ferret's behavioral and physiological audiogram.
   Animals were tested under positive operant conditioning, with
   psychometric functions constructed in response to gap-in-noise lengths
   ranging from 3 to 270 ms. Using a modified version of this gap-detection
   task, with the same stimulus frequency parameters, we also tested a
   cohort of normal-hearing human subjects. Gap-detection thresholds were
   computed from psychometric curves transformed according to signal
   detection theory, revealing that for both ferrets and humans, detection
   sensitivity was worse for silent gaps embedded within low-frequency
   noise compared with high-frequency or broadband stimuli. Additional
   psychometric function analysis of ferret behavior indicated effects of
   stimulus spectral content on aspects of behavioral performance related
   to decision-making processes, with animals displaying improved
   sensitivity for broadband gap-in-noise detection. Reaction times derived
   from unconditioned head-orienting data and the time from stimulus onset
   to reward spout activation varied with the stimulus frequency content
   and gap length, as well as the approach-to-target choice and reward
   location. The present study represents a comprehensive evaluation of
   gap-detection behavior in ferrets, while similarities in performance
   with our human subjects confirm the use of the ferret as an appropriate
   model of temporal processing.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the role of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic projection
   in anxiety, spatial novelty preference, and differential reward for low
   rates of responding (DRL) performance. Cholinergic neurons of the rat
   medial septum (MS) and the vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca
   (VDB) were lesioned using the selective immunotoxin, 192 IgG-saporin.
   Rats were then tested on several behavioral tests previously shown to be
   sensitive to either (a) hippocampal lesions or (b) nonselective MS/VDB
   lesions which target both cholinergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid
   (GABA)-ergic projections, or both. Saporin lesions substantially reduced
   hippocampal cholinergic innervation, resulting in an absence of acetyl
   cholinesterase staining and markedly reduced choline acetyltransferase
   activity (mean reduction: 80 +/- 5\%; range: 50-97\%). However, the
   saporin-lesioned rats did not differ from control rats in any of the
   behavioral tests. Thus we found no evidence from these lesion studies
   that the septo-hippocampal cholinergic projection plays an essential
   role in anxiety, spatial novelty preference, or DRL.}},

Abstract = {{Amphetamine and stress can sensitize mesolimbic dopamine-related
   systems. In Pavlovian autoshaping, repeated exposure to uncertainty of
   reward prediction can enhance motivated sign-tracking or attraction to a
   discrete reward-predicting cue (lever-conditioned stimulus; CS +), as
   well as produce cross-sensitization to amphetamine. However, it remains
   unknown how amphetamine sensitization or repeated restraint stress
   interact with uncertainty in controlling CS + incentive salience
   attribution reflected in sign-tracking. Here rats were tested in 3
   successive phases. First, different groups underwent either induction of
   amphetamine sensitization or repeated restraint stress, or else were not
   sensitized or stressed as control groups (either saline injections only,
   or no stress or injection at all). All next received Pavlovian
   autoshaping training under either certainty conditions (100\% CS-UCS
   association) or uncertainty conditions (50\% CS-UCS association and
   uncertain reward magnitude). During training, rats were assessed for
   sign-tracking to the CS + lever versus goal-tracking to the sucrose
   dish. Finally, all groups were tested for psychomotor sensitization of
   locomotion revealed by an amphetamine challenge. Our results confirm
   that reward uncertainty enhanced sign-tracking attraction toward the
   predictive CS + lever, at the expense of goal-tracking. We also reported
   that amphetamine sensitization promoted sign-tracking even in rats
   trained under CS-UCS certainty conditions, raising them to sign-tracking
   levels equivalent to the uncertainty group. Combining amphetamine
   sensitization and uncertainty conditions did not add together to elevate
   sign-tracking further above the relatively high levels induced by either
   manipulation alone. In contrast, repeated restraint stress enhanced
   subsequent amphetamine-elicited locomotion, but did not enhance CS +
   attraction.}},

   acquisition and retention of trace-conditioned responses, and of
   declarative memory more globally. We discuss the expansion of the
   conditioning paradigm to species other than the rabbit, the
   heterogeneity of responses among hippocampal neurons during trace
   conditioning, the responsivity of hippocampal neurons following
   consolidation of conditioning, the role of awareness in conditioning,
   how blink conditioning can be used as a translational tool by assaying
   potential therapeutics for cognitive enhancement, how trace and delay
   classical conditioning may be used to investigate neurological disorders

Volume = {{129}},

Abstract = {{The role of the hippocampus (HFC) in trace eye-blink conditioning was
   evaluated using a 100-ms tone conditioned stimulus (CS), a 300-or 500-ms
   trace interval, and a 150-ms air puff unconditioned stimulus (UCS).
   Rabbits received complete hippocampectomy (dorsal \& ventral), sham
   lesions, or neocortical lesions. Hippocampectomy produced differential
   effects in relation to the trace interval used. With a 300-ms trace
   interval, HPC-lesioned Ss showed profound resistance to extinction after
   acquisition. With a 500-ms trace interval, HPC-lesioned Ss did not learn
   the task (only 22\% conditioned responses (CRs) after 25 sessions,
   whereas controls showed >80\% after 10 sessions), and on the few trials
   in which a CR occurred, most were ``nonadaptive{''} short-latency CRs
   (i.e., they started during or just after the CS and always terminated
   prior to UCS onset). The authors conclude that the HPC encodes a
   temporal relationship between CS and UCS, and when the trace interval is
   long enough (e.g., 500 ms), that the HPC is necessary for associative
   learning of the conditioned eye-blink response.}},

Abstract = {{The Morris water maze was developed in 1981 and quickly became the
   standard task for assessing spatial memory and spatial navigation.
   Twenty years ago, Gallagher, Burwell, and Burchinal (1993) reported new
   variables and measures, including a spatial learning index, that greatly
   enhanced the utility of the Morris water maze for assessing subtle
   differences in performance on the task. The learning index provided a
   single number that could be used to elucidate neurobiological measures
   of hippocampal dysfunction, for example, correlation of learning
   performance with a biomarker of aging. In this review, as part of the
   commemoration of the 30th anniversary of Behavioral Neuroscience, we
   describe how the spatial learning index has contributed to the field of
   learning and memory, how it has advanced our understanding of normal and
   pathological cognitive aging, and how it has contributed to translation
   of findings into other species. Finally, we provide instruction into how
   the learning index can be extended to other tasks and data sets.}},

Abstract = {{The Morris water maze task was originally designed to assess the rat's
   ability to learn to navigate to a specific location in a relatively
   large spatial environment. This article describes new measures that
   provide information about the spatial distribution of the rat's search
   during both training and probe trial performance. The basic new measure
   optimizes the use of computer tracking to identify the rat's position
   with respect to the target location. This proximity measure was found to
   be highly sensitive to age-related impairment in an assessment of young
   and aged male Long-Evans rats. Also described is the development of a
   learning index that provides a continuous, graded measure of the
   severity of age-related impairment in the task. An index of this type
   should be useful in correlational analyses with other neurobiological or
   behavioral measures for the study of individual differences in

Abstract = {{Social perception is an important prerequisite for successful social
   interaction, because it helps to gain information about behaviors,
   thoughts, and feelings of interaction partners. Previous pharmacological
   studies have emphasized the relevance of the oxytocin system for social
   perception abilities, while knowledge on genetic contributions is still
   scarce. In the endeavor to fill this gap in the literature, the current
   study searches for associations between participants' social perception
   abilities as measured by the interpersonal perception task (IPT) and the
   rs2268498 polymorphism on the OXTR-gene, which has repeatedly been
   linked to processes relevant to social functioning. N=105 healthy
   participants were experimentally tested with the IPT and genotyped for
   the rs2268498 polymorphism. T-allele carriers (TT and TC genotypes)
   exhibited significantly better performance in the IPT than carriers of
   the CC-genotype. This difference was also significant for the subscales
   measuring the strength of social bonding (kinship and intimacy). As in
   previous studies, T-allele carriers exhibited better performance in
   measures of social processing indicating that the rs2268498 polymorphism
   is an important candidate for understanding the genetic basis of social
   functioning.}},

Abstract = {{An inherent feature of social interactions is the use of social space or
   interpersonal distance-the space between one individual and another.
   Because social deficits are core symptoms of Autistic Spectrum Disorder
   (ASD), we hypothesized that individuals on this spectrum will exhibit
   abnormal interpersonal distance preferences. The literature on
   interpersonal distance in ASD is not conclusive. While some studies show
   preferences for closer distances among this group, others show
   preferences for farther distances than controls. A common symptom of ASD
   that may explain the variance in responses to interpersonal distance in
   this population is social anxiety (SA), which has been shown to
   correlate with interpersonal distance preferences. In the current study,
   we investigated interpersonal distance preferences in a group of
   individuals with ASD using both behavioral and ERP measures. We found
   greater variance in interpersonal distance preferences in the ASD group
   than in the control group. Furthermore, we showed that this variance can
   be explained by differences in SA level and can be predicted by the N1
   amplitude, an early ERP component related to attention and
   discrimination processes. These results hint at the early sensory and
   attentional processes that may be affecting higher social behaviors,
   both in subclinical and in clinical populations.}},

Abstract = {{Asymmetrical frontal electroencephalography (EEG) activity is associated
   with motivational neural systems of approach/withdrawal behaviors.
   Greater left frontal EEG has been linked to increased appetitive
   tendencies whereas increased right frontal activity is related to the
   activation of avoidance mechanisms. Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic
   condition characterized by a highly sociable personality manifested by a
   propensity to approach strangers and decreased social fear.
   Consequently, the current study was designed to investigate the frontal
   cortical activity during resting state, indexed by relative alpha power,
   in adults with WS as compared to typically developing (TD) controls, and
   a subgroup of TD extraverts. Results indicated that participants with WS
   produced attenuated left frontal activity relative to TD peers, or TD
   extraverts in particular; yet, no groups differed in their degree of
   right frontal activity. Finally, while both TD group and the extravert
   subset showed trends of greater left over right frontal activity, the WS
   participants demonstrated opposing effect of increased right over left
   frontal EEG. Importantly, individuals with WS produced deviating frontal
   activity patterns compared to TD extraverts despite exhibiting common
   social-affiliative tendencies, underscoring that neural mechanisms that
   give rise to extraversion in WS may not function similarly to those
   subserving this personality trait expressed in TD.}},

Abstract = {{The ``mere ownership effect{''} refers to individuals' tendency to
   evaluate objects they own more favorably than comparable objects they do
   not own. There are numerous behavioral demonstrations of the mere
   ownership effect, but the neural mechanisms underlying the expression of
   this self-positivity bias during the evaluation of self-associated
   objects have not been identified. The present study aimed to identify
   the neurobiological expression of the mere ownership effect and to
   assess the potential influence of motivational context. During fMRI
   scanning, participants made evaluations of objects after ownership had
   been assigned under the presence or absence of self-esteem threat. In
   the absence of threat, the mere ownership effect was associated with
   brain regions implicated in processing personal/affective significance
   and valence (ventromedial prefrontal cortex {[}vMPFC], ventral anterior
   cingulate cortex {[}vACC], and medial orbitofrontal cortex {[}mOFC]). In
   contrast, in the presence of threat, the mere ownership effect was
   associated with brain regions implicated in selective/inhibitory
   cognitive control processes (inferior frontal gyrus {[}IFG], middle
   frontal gyrus {[}MFG], and lateral orbitofrontal cortex {[}lOFC]). These
   findings indicate that depending on motivational context, different
   neural mechanisms (and thus likely different psychological processes)
   support the behavioral expression of self-positivity bias directed
   toward objects that are associated with the self.}},

Abstract = {{Chronometric properties of theory of mind and intentions understanding
   more specifically are well documented. Notably, it was demonstrated
   using magnetoencephalography that the brain regions involved were
   recruited as soon as 200ms post-stimulus. We used event-related
   potentials (ERPs) to characterize an electrophysiological marker of
   attribution of intentions. We also explored the robustness of this ERP
   signature under two conditions corresponding to either explicit
   instructions to focus on others' intentions or implicit instructions
   with no reference to mental states. Two matched groups of 16 healthy
   volunteers each received either explicit or no instructions about
   intentions and performed a nonverbal attribution of intentions task
   based on sequential four-image comic strips depicting either intentional
   or physical causality. A bilateral posterior positive component, ranging
   from 250 to 650ms post-stimulus, showed greater amplitude in intentional
   than in physical condition (the intention ERP effect). This effect
   occurs during the third image only, suggesting that it reflects the
   integration of information depicted in the third image to the contextual
   cues given by the first two. The intention effect was similar in the two
   groups of subjects. Overall, our results identify a clear ERP marker of
   the first hundreds of milliseconds of intentions processing probably
   related to a contextual integrative mechanism and suggest its robustness
   by showing its blindness to task demands manipulation.}},

   amplitudes for congruent trials when compared with incongruent trials.
   In addition, the N2 amplitude differences were significantly correlated
   with individual prosocial behavior (the amount of donation). Our

Abstract = {{The emotional consequences of our own and others' actions can influence
   our agentive self-awareness in social contexts. Positive outcomes are
   usually linked to the self and used for self-enhancement, whereas
   negative outcomes are more often attributed to others. In most
   situations, these causal attribution tendencies seem to be immediately
   present instead of involving reflective interpretations of the action
   experience. To address the question at which level of the cognitive
   hierarchy emotions and action perception interact, we adopted a social
   reward anticipation paradigm. Here, participants or their interaction
   partner received positive or negative action outcomes and performed
   speeded attribution choices regarding causation of the action outcome.
   Event-Related Potential (ERP) results showed that the emotional value of
   an outcome already influenced the classical N1 self-attenuation effect,
   with reduced embodied agentive self-awareness for negative outcomes at
   initial sensorimotor stages. At the level of the N300, the degree of
   updating and affective evaluation associated with the respective
   attributive decision was reflected and particularly associated to
   attribution tendencies for positive events. Our results show an early
   interaction between emotion and agency processes, and suggest that
   self-serving cognition can be grounded in embodied knowledge from
   low-level sensorimotor mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Reactions to individuals who possess features associated with multiple

   an extrinsic race-label cue not only changed evaluative associations
   activated by a racially ambiguous face, but also changed quickly
   occurring neural responses sensitive to racial perception. Behaviorally,
   prototypical Black faces and racially ambiguous faces labeled as Black
   activated more negative implicit associations than prototypical White
   faces and racially ambiguous faces labeled as White. Neurally,
   prototypical faces and racially ambiguous faces cued with the same race
   elicited similar responses. Specifically, prototypical Black and
   racially ambiguous faces labeled as Black elicited larger P200s but

Abstract = {{People evaluate members of their own social group more favorably and
   empathize more strongly with their ingroup members. Using
   electroencephalography (EEG), we explored whether resonant responses of
   sensorimotor cortex to the pain of others are modulated by the ethnicity
   of these others. White participants watched video clips of ethnic
   ingroup and outgroup hands, being either penetrated by a needle syringe
   or touched by a cotton swab, while EEG was recorded. Time/frequency
   analysis was applied to Laplacian-transformed signals from the sensors
   overlying sensorimotor cortex in order to assess event-related
   desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) of sensorimotor mu (7-12
   Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) rhythms. When watching needle injections, beta
   ERD was significantly stronger for ingroup compared with outgroup hands.
   This ethnicity bias was restricted to painful actions, as beta ERD for
   ingroup and outgroup hands neither differed when observing no-pain
   videos, nor during presentation of the hands without any treatment. Such
   vicarious sensorimotor activation could play a role in social
   interaction by enhancing the understanding of the feelings and reactions
   of others and hence facilitating behavioral coordination among group
   members.}},

Abstract = {{Parental criticism can have positive and negative effects on children's
   and adolescents' behavior; yet, it is unclear how youth react to,
   understand and process parental criticism. We proposed that youth would
   engage three sets of neural processes in response to parental criticism
   including the following: (i) activating emotional reactions, (ii)
   regulating those reactions and (iii) social cognitive processing (e.g.
   understanding the parent's mental state). To examine neural processes
   associated with both emotional and social processing of parental
   criticism in personally relevant and ecologically valid social contexts,
   typically developing youth were scanned while they listened to their
   mother providing critical, praising and neutral statements. In response
   to maternal criticism, youth showed increased brain activity in
   affective networks (e.g. subcortical-limbic regions including lentiform
   nucleus and posterior insula), but decreased activity in cognitive
   control networks (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudal
   anterior cingulate cortex) and social cognitive networks (e.g.
   temporoparietal junction and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus).
   These results suggest that youth may respond to maternal criticism with
   increased emotional reactivity but decreased cognitive control and
   social cognitive processing. A better understanding of children's
   responses to parental criticism may provide insights into the ways that
   parental feedback can be modified to be more helpful to behavior and
   development in youth.}},

Abstract = {{Attention bias modification (ABM) procedures typically reduce anxiety
   symptoms, yet little is known about the neural changes associated with
   this behavioral treatment. Healthy adults with high social anxiety
   symptoms (n = 53) were randomized to receive either active or placebo
   ABM. Unlike placebo ABM, active ABM aimed to train individuals'
   attention away from threat. Using the dot-probe task, threat-related
   attention bias was measured during magnetic resonance imaging before and
   after acute and extended training over 4 weeks. A subset of participants
   completed all procedures (n = 30, 15 per group). Group differences in
   neural activation were identified using standard analyses. Linear
   regression tested predictive factors of symptom reduction (i.e.,
   training group, baseline indices of threat bias). The active and placebo
   groups exhibited different patterns of right and left amygdala
   activation with training. Across all participants irrespective of group,
   individuals with greater left amygdala activation in the threat-bias
   contrast prior to training exhibited greater symptom reduction. After
   accounting for baseline amygdala activation, greater symptom reduction
   was associated with assignment to the active training group. Greater
   left amygdala activation at baseline predicted reductions in social
   anxiety symptoms following ABM. Further research is needed to clarify
   brain-behavior mechanisms associated with ABM training.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{921-928}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies using the social-exclusion paradigm Cyberball
   indicate increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right
   insula activity as a function of exclusion. However, comparatively less
   work has been done on how social status factors may moderate this
   finding. This study used the Cyberball paradigm with 85 (45 females)
   socio-economically diverse participants from a larger longitudinal
   sample. We tested whether neighborhood quality during adolescence would
   predict subsequent neural responding to social exclusion in young
   adulthood. Given previous behavioral studies indicating greater social
   vigilance and negative evaluation as a function of lower status, we
   expected that lower adolescent neighborhood quality would predict
   greater dACC activity during exclusion at young adulthood. Our findings
   indicate that young adults who lived in low-quality neighborhoods in
   adolescence showed greater dACC activity to social exclusion than those
   who lived in higher quality neighborhoods. Lower neighborhood quality
   also predicted greater prefrontal activation in the superior frontal
   gyrus, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and the middle frontal gyrus,
   possibly indicating greater regulatory effort. Finally, this effect was
   not driven by subsequent ratings of distress during exclusion. In sum,
   adolescent neighborhood quality appears to potentiate neural responses
   to social exclusion in young adulthood, effects that are independent of
   felt distress.}},

Abstract = {{In search of causative factors of social anxiety disorder (SAD),
   classical conditioning has been discussed as a potential trigger
   mechanism for many years. Recent findings suggest that the social
   relevance of the unconditioned stimulus (US) might play a major role in
   learning theories of SAD. Thus, this study applied a social conditioning
   paradigm with disorder-relevant US to examine the electrocortical
   correlates of affective learning. Twenty-four high socially anxious
   (HSA) and 23 age-and gender-matched low socially anxious (LSA) subjects
   were conditioned to 3 different faces flickering at a frequency of 15 Hz
   which were paired with auditory insults, compliments or neutral comments
   (US). The face-evoked electrocortical response was measured via
   steady-state visually evoked potentials and subjective measures of
   valence and arousal were obtained. Results revealed a significant
   interaction of social anxiety and conditioning, with LSA showing highest
   cortical activity to faces paired with insults and lowest activity to
   faces paired with compliments, while HSA did not differentiate between
   faces. No group differences were discovered in the affective ratings.
   The findings indicate a potentially impaired ability of HSA to
   discriminate between relevant and irrelevant social stimuli, which may
   constitute a perpetuating factor of SAD.}},

Abstract = {{As a social species in a constantly changing environment, humans rely
   heavily on the informational richness and communicative capacity of the
   face. Thus, understanding how the brain processes information about
   faces in real-time is of paramount importance. The N170 is a
   high-temporal resolution electrophysiological index of the brain's early
   response to visual stimuli that is reliably elicited in carefully
   controlled laboratory-based studies. Although the N170 has often been
   reported to be of greatest amplitude to faces, there has been debate
   regarding whether this effect might be an artefact of certain aspects of
   the controlled experimental stimulation schedules and materials. To
   investigate whether the N170 can be identified in more realistic
   conditions with highly variable and cluttered visual images and
   accompanying auditory stimuli we recorded EEG `in the wild', while
   participants watched pop videos. Scene-cuts to faces generated a clear
   N170 response, and this was larger than the N170 to transitions where
   the videos cut to non-face stimuli. Within participants, wild-type face
   N170 amplitudes were moderately correlated to those observed in a
   typical laboratory experiment. Thus, we demonstrate that the face N170
   is a robust and ecologically valid phenomenon and not an artefact
   arising as an unintended consequence of some property of the more
   typical laboratory paradigm.}},

Abstract = {{Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with
   decreased ventral-striatal responsiveness during reward anticipation.
   However, previous research mostly focused on adults with heterogeneous
   ADHD subtype and divers drug treatment status while studies in children
   with ADHD are sparse. Moreover, it remains unclear to what degree ADHD
   is characterized by a delay of normal brain structure or function
   maturation. We therefore attempt to determine whether results from
   structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are
   associated with childhood and adult ADHD combined subtype (ADHD-CT).
   This study used fMRI to compare VS structure and function of 30
   participants with ADHD-CT (16 adults, 14 children) and 30 controls (20
   adults, 10 children), using a monetary incentive delay task. Joint
   analyses of structural and functional imaging data were conducted with
   Biological Parametric Mapping. Reward anticipation elicited decreased
   ventral-striatal responsiveness in adults but not in children with
   ADHD-CT. Children and adults with ADHD showed reduced ventral-striatal
   volume. Taking these gray matter differences into account, the results
   remained the same. These results suggest that decreased ventral-striatal
   responsiveness during reward anticipation is present in adults but not
   in children with ADHD-CT, irrespective of structural characteristics.
   The question arises whether ventral-striatal hypoactivity is an ADHD
   correlate that develops during the course of illness.}},

Abstract = {{Although much attention has been directed towards life satisfaction that
   refers to an individual's general cognitive evaluations of his or her
   life as a whole, little is known about the neural basis underlying
   global life satisfaction. In this study, we used voxel-based morphometry
   to investigate the structural neural correlates of life satisfaction in
   a large sample of young healthy adults (n = 299). We showed that
   individuals' life satisfaction was positively correlated with the
   regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in the right parahippocampal gyrus
   (PHG), and negatively correlated with the rGMV in the left precuneus and
   left ventromedial prefrontal cortex. This pattern of results remained
   significant even after controlling for the effect of general positive
   and negative affect, suggesting a unique structural correlates of life
   satisfaction. Furthermore, we found that self-esteem partially mediated
   the association between the PHG volume and life satisfaction as well as
   that between the precuneus volume and global life satisfaction. Taken
   together, we provide the first evidence for the structural neural basis
   of life satisfaction, and highlight that self-esteem might play a
   crucial role in cultivating an individual's life satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the functional connectivity of the subgenual anterior
   cingulate cortex (SGC) have been linked with depressive symptoms. The
   aim of this study was to map this relationship across mid to late
   adolescence. Employing a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) design, associations between patterns of resting-state
   SGC functional connectivity and symptoms of depression were examined at
   two time points in an initial sample of 72 adolescents. Using a
   region-of-interest approach, these associations were evaluated
   cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Cross-sectionally, weaker SGC
   functional connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),
   angular gyrus and dorsal prefrontal cortex at baseline, and weaker SGC
   connectivity with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex at follow-up, were associated with higher
   depressive symptoms. Longitudinally, a decrease in SGC functional
   connectivity with DMPFC, PCC, angular gyrus and middle temporal gyrus
   was associated with higher depressive symptoms at follow-up. The
   observation of weaker SGC connectivity predicting increased symptoms
   contrasts with the majority of resting-state fMRI studies in clinically
   depressed populations. Taken together with these past studies, our
   findings suggest depression-related changes in SGC functional
   connectivity may differ across developmental and illness stages.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety disorder patients were repeatedly found to overestimate the
   association between disorder-relevant stimuli and aversive outcomes
   despite random contingencies. Such an illusory correlation (IC) might
   play an important role in the return of fear after extinction learning;
   yet, little is known about how this cognitive bias emerges in the brain.
   In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 18 female patients
   with spider phobia and 18 healthy controls were exposed to pictures of
   spiders, mushrooms and puppies followed randomly by either a painful
   electrical shock or nothing. In advance, both patients and healthy
   controls expected more shocks after spider pictures. Importantly, only
   patients with spider phobia continued to overestimate this association
   after the experiment. The strength of this IC was predicted by increased
   outcome aversiveness ratings and primary sensory motor cortex activity
   in response to the shock after spider pictures. Moreover, increased
   activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) to spider
   pictures predicted the IC. These results support the theory that
   phobia-relevant stimuli amplify unpleasantness and sensory motor
   representations of aversive stimuli, which in turn may promote their
   overestimation. Hyper-activity in dlPFC possibly reflects a
   pre-occupation of executive resources with phobia-relevant stimuli, thus
   complicating the accurate monitoring of objective contingencies and the
   unlearning of fear.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Thought disorders such as rumination or flight of ideas are
   frequent in patients with mood disorders, and not systematically linked
   to mood state. These symptoms point to anomalies in cognitive processes
   mediating the generation and control of thoughts; for example,
   associative thinking and inhibition. However, their neural substrates
   are not known. Method: To obtain an ecological measure of neural
   processes underlying the generation and suppression of spontaneous
   thoughts, we designed a free word association task during fMRI allowing
   us to explore verbal associative patterns in patients with mood
   disorders and matched controls. Participants were presented with
   emotionally negative, positive or neutral words, and asked to produce
   two words either related or unrelated to these stimuli. Results:
   Relative to controls, patients produced a reverse pattern of answer
   typicality for the related vs unrelated conditions. Controls activated
   larger semantic and executive control networks, as well as basal
   ganglia, precuneus and middle frontal gyrus. Unlike controls, patients
   activated fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and medial prefrontal
   cortex for emotional stimuli. Conclusions: Mood disorder patients are
   impaired in automated associative processes, but prone to produce more
   unique/personal associations through activation of memory and
   self-related areas.}},

Abstract = {{Moral decisions and social relationships are often characterized by
   strong feelings of ambivalence which can be a catalyst for emotional
   distress and several health-related problems. The anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC) has been identified as a key brain region in monitoring
   conflicting information, but the neurobiological substrates of
   ambivalence processing are still widely unknown. We have conducted two
   randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging experiments involving 70 healthy male volunteers to
   investigate the effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) on neural and
   behavioral correlates of ambivalence. We chose moral decision-making and
   the imagery of partner infidelity as examples to probe volitional and
   emotional ambivalence. In both experiments, intranasal OXT diminished
   neural responses in the ACC to ambivalence. Under OXT, moral dilemma
   vignettes also elicited a reduced activation in the orbitofrontal
   cortex, and the imagery of partner infidelity was rated as less
   arousing. Interestingly, the OXT-induced differential activation in the
   ACC predicted the magnitude of arousal reduction. Taken together, our
   findings reveal an unprecedented role of OXT in causing a domain-general
   decrease of neural responses to ambivalence. By alleviating emotional
   distress, OXT may qualify as a treatment option for psychiatric
   disorders with heightened ambivalence sensitivity such as schizophrenia
   or obsessive-compulsive disorder.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed whether individual differences in self-oriented
   neural processing were associated with performance perceptions of
   minority students under stereotype threat. Resting
   electroencephalographic activity recorded in white and minority
   participants was used to predict later estimates of task errors and
   self-doubt on a presumed measure of intelligence. We assessed
   spontaneous phase-locking between dipole sources in left lateral
   parietal cortex (LPC), precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (P/PCC), and
   medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC); three regions of the default mode
   network (DMN) that are integral for self-oriented processing. Results
   revealed that minorities with greater LPC-P/PCC phase-locking in the
   theta band reported more accurate error estimations. All individuals
   experienced less self-doubt to the extent they exhibited greater
   LPC-MPFC phase-locking in the alpha band but this effect was driven by
   minorities. Minorities also reported more self-doubt to the extent they

Abstract = {{The control of neurological networks supporting social cognition is
   crucially important for social interaction. In particular, the control
   of imitation is directly linked to interaction quality, with impairments
   associated with disorders characterized by social difficulties. Previous
   work suggests inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and the temporoparietal
   junction (TPJ) are involved in controlling imitation, but the functional
   roles of these areas remain unclear. Here, transcranial direct current
   stimulation (tDCS) was used to enhance cortical excitability at IFC and
   the TPJ prior to the completion of three tasks: (i) a naturalistic
   social interaction during which increased imitation is known to improve
   rapport, (ii) a choice reaction time task in which imitation needs to be
   inhibited for successful performance and (iii) a non-imitative control
   task. Relative to sham stimulation, stimulating IFC improved the
   context-dependent control of imitation-participants imitated more during
   the social interaction and less during the imitation inhibition task. In
   contrast, stimulating the TPJ reduced imitation in the inhibition task
   without affecting imitation during social interaction. Neither
   stimulation site affected the non-imitative control task. These data
   support a model in which IFC modulates imitation directly according to
   task demands, whereas TPJ controls task-appropriate shifts in attention
   toward representation of the self or the other, indirectly impacting
   upon imitation.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work indicates that intranasal inhalation of oxytocin improves
   face recognition skills, raising the possibility that it may be used in
   security settings. However, it is unclear whether oxytocin directly acts
   upon the core face-processing system itself or indirectly improves face
   recognition via affective or social salience mechanisms. In a
   double-blind procedure, 60 participants received either an oxytocin or
   placebo nasal spray before completing the One-in-Ten task-a standardized
   test of unfamiliar face recognition containing target-present and
   target-absent line-ups. Participants in the oxytocin condition
   outperformed those in the placebo condition on target-present trials,
   yet were more likely to make false-positive errors on target-absent
   trials. Signal detection analyses indicated that oxytocin induced a more
   liberal response bias, rather than increasing accuracy per se. These
   findings support a social salience account of the effects of oxytocin on
   face recognition and indicate that oxytocin may impede face recognition
   in certain scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive literature shows that greater left, relative to right,
   frontal cortical activity (LFA) is involved in approach-motivated
   affective states and reflects stable individual differences in approach
   motivation. However, relatively few studies have linked LFA to
   behavioral indices of approach motivation. In this study, we examine the
   relation between LFA and effort expenditure for reward, a behavioral
   index of approach motivation. LFA was calculated for 51 right-handed
   participants (55\% female) using power spectral analysis of
   electroencephalogram recorded at rest. Participants also completed the
   effort expenditure for rewards task (EEfRT), which presents a series of
   trials requiring a choice between a low-reward low-effort task and a
   high-reward high-effort task. We found that individuals with greater
   resting LFA were more willing to expend greater effort in the pursuit of
   larger rewards, particularly when reward delivery was less likely. Our
   findings offer a more nuanced understanding of the motivational
   significance of LFA, in terms of processes that mitigate the effort-and
   uncertainty-related costs of pursuing rewarding goals.}},

Abstract = {{Withdrawal from peers during childhood may reflect disruptions in reward
   functioning that heighten vulnerability to affective disorders during
   adolescence. The association between socially withdrawn behavior and
   reward functioning may depend on traits that influence this withdrawal,
   such as fearfulness or unsociability. In a study of 129 boys, we
   evaluated how boys' fearfulness and sociability at age 5 and social
   withdrawal at school at ages 6 to 10 and during a summer camp at age
   9/10 were associated with their neural response to reward at age 20.
   Greater social withdrawal during childhood was associated with
   heightened striatal and mPFC activation when anticipating rewards at age
   20. Fearfulness moderated this effect to indicate that social withdrawal
   was associated with heightened reward-related response in the striatum
   for boys high on fearfulness. Altered striatal response associated with
   social withdrawal and fearfulness predicted greater likelihood to have a
   lifetime history of depression and social phobia at age 20. These
   findings add greater specificity to previous findings that children high
   in traits related to fear of novelty show altered reward responses, by
   identifying fearfulness (but not low levels of sociability) as a
   potential underlying mechanism that contributes to reward alterations in
   withdrawn children.}},

Abstract = {{Physical size and strength are associated with dominance and threat. The
   current study tested (i) whether men's evaluations of male strangers
   would be negatively influenced by cues indicating physical
   formidability, and (ii) whether these evaluations would be influenced by

   social anxiety. In a placebo-controlled double-blind design, we
   administered either oxytocin (24 I.U.) or placebo intranasally to 100
   healthy males and assessed their responses to an image of either a
   physically formidable (strong) or physically non-formidable (weak) male
   peer. Whereas participants receiving placebo expressed dislike and
   avoidance of the strong male relative to the weak male, oxytocin
   selectively improved social evaluation of the strong male. These results
   provide first evidence that oxytocin regulates social evaluation of

Abstract = {{Humans have a strong tendency to affiliate with other people, especially
   in emotional situations. Here, we suggest that a critical mechanism
   underlying this tendency is that socially sharing emotional experiences
   is in itself perceived as hedonically positive and thereby contributes
   to the regulation of individual emotions. We investigated the effect of
   social sharing of emotions on subjective feelings and neural activity by
   having pairs of friends view emotional (negative and positive) and
   neutral pictures either alone or with the friend. While the two friends
   remained physically separated throughout the experiment-with one
   undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and the other
   performing the task in an adjacent room-they were made aware on a
   trial-by-trial basis whether they were seeing pictures simultaneously
   with their friend (shared) or alone (unshared). Ratings of subjective
   feelings were improved significantly when participants viewed emotional
   pictures together than alone, an effect that was accompanied by activity
   increase in ventral striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex, two
   important components of the reward circuitry. Because these effects
   occurred without any communication or interaction between the friends,
   they point to an important proximate explanation for the basic human
   motivation to affiliate with others, particularly in emotional
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{Reciprocal exchanges can be understood as the updating of an initial
   belief about a partner. This initial level of trust is essential when it
   comes to establishing cooperation with an unknown partner, as
   cooperation cannot arise without a minimum of trust not justified by
   previous successful exchanges with this partner. Here we demonstrate the
   existence of a representation of the initial trust level before an
   exchange with a partner has occurred. Specifically, we can predict the
   Investor's initial investment-i.e. his initial level of trust toward the
   unknown trustee in Round 1 of a standard 10-round Trust Game-from
   resting-state functional connectivity data acquired several minutes
   before the start of the Trust Game. Resting-state functional
   connectivity is, however, not significantly associated with the level of
   trust in later rounds, potentially mirroring the updating of the initial
   belief about the partner. Our results shed light on how the initial
   level of trust is represented. In particular, we show that a person's
   initial level of trust is, at least in part, determined by brain
   electrical activity acquired well before the beginning of an exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Is moral beauty different from facial beauty? Two functional magnetic
   resonance imaging experiments were performed to answer this question.
   Experiment 1 investigated the network of moral aesthetic judgments and
   facial aesthetic judgments. Participants performed aesthetic judgments
   and gender judgments on both faces and scenes containing moral acts. The
   conjunction analysis of the contrasts `facial aesthetic judgment >
   facial gender judgment' and `scene moral aesthetic judgment > scene
   gender judgment' identified the common involvement of the orbitofrontal
   cortex (OFC), inferior temporal gyrus and medial superior frontal gyrus,
   suggesting that both types of aesthetic judgments are based on the
   orchestration of perceptual, emotional and cognitive components.
   Experiment 2 examined the network of facial beauty and moral beauty
   during implicit perception. Participants performed a non-aesthetic
   judgment task on both faces (beautiful vs common) and scenes (containing
   morally beautiful vs neutral information). We observed that facial
   beauty (beautiful faces > common faces) involved both the cortical
   reward region OFC and the subcortical reward region putamen, whereas
   moral beauty (moral beauty scenes > moral neutral scenes) only involved
   the OFC. Moreover, compared with facial beauty, moral beauty spanned a
   larger-scale cortical network, indicating more advanced and complex
   cerebral representations characterizing moral beauty.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient implicit emotion regulation processes, which run without
   awareness, are important for human well-being. In this study, to
   investigate the influence of implicit emotion regulation on
   psychological and electrophysiological responses to gains and losses,
   participants were required to select between two Chinese four-character
   idioms to match the meaning of the third one before they performed a
   monetary gambling task. According to whether their meanings were related
   to emotion regulation, the idioms fell into two categories.
   Event-related potentials and self-rating emotional experiences to
   outcome feedback were recorded during the task. Priming emotion
   regulation reduced subjective emotional experience to both gains and
   losses and the amplitudes of the feedback-related negativity, while the
   P3 component was not influenced. According to these results, we suggest
   that the application of implicit emotion regulation effectively
   modulated the subjective emotional experience and the motivational
   salience of current outcomes without the cost of cognitive resources.
   This study implicates the potential significance of implicit emotion
   regulation in decision-making processes.}},

Abstract = {{A predominant expectation that social relationships with others are safe
   (a secure attachment style), has been linked with reduced threat-related
   amygdala activation. Experimental priming of mental representations of
   attachment security can modulate neural responding, but the effects of
   attachment-security priming on threat-related amygdala activation
   remains untested. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the
   present study examined the effects of trait and primed attachment
   security on amygdala reactivity to threatening stimuli in an emotional
   faces and a linguistic dot-probe task in 42 healthy participants. Trait
   attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were positively correlated
   with amygdala activation to threatening faces in the control group, but
   not in the attachment primed group. Furthermore, participants who
   received attachment-security priming showed attenuated amygdala
   activation in both the emotional faces and dot-probe tasks. The current
   findings demonstrate that variation in state and trait attachment
   security modulates amygdala reactivity to threat. These findings support
   the potential use of attachment security-boosting methods as
   interventions and suggest a neural mechanism for the protective effect
   of social bonds in anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Different emotion regulation strategies are distinctly represented in
   the brains of younger adults. Decreasing a reaction to a negative
   situation by reinterpreting it (reappraisal) relies on cognitive control
   regions in the prefrontal cortex, while distracting away from a stressor
   involves more posterior medial structures. In this study, we used
   Multi-Voxel pattern analyses (MVPA) to examine whether reappraisal and
   distraction strategies have distinct representations in the older adult
   brain, or whether emotion regulation strategies become more
   dedifferentiated in later life. MVPA better differentiated the two
   emotion regulation strategies for younger adults than for older adults,
   and revealed the greatest age-related differences in differentiation in
   the posterior medial cortex (PMC). Univariate analyses revealed equal
   PMC recruitment across strategies for older adults, but greater activity
   during distraction than reappraisal for younger adults. The PMC is
   central to self-focused processing, and thus our findings are consistent
   with the possibility that focusing on the self may be a default
   mechanism across emotion regulation strategies for older people.}},

Abstract = {{Interpreting others' actions relies on an understanding of their current
   mental state. Emerging research has begun to identify a number of
   factors that give rise to individual differences in this ability. We
   report an event-related brain potential study where participants (N =
   28) read contexts that described a character having a true belief (TB)
   or false belief (FB) about an object's location. A second sentence
   described where that character would look for the object. Critically,
   this sentence included a sentence-final noun that was either consistent
   or inconsistent with the character's belief. Participants also completed
   the Empathy Quotient questionnaire. Analysis of the N400 revealed that
   when the character held a TB about the object's location, the N400
   waveform was more negative-going for belief inconsistent vs belief
   consistent critical words. However, when the character held an FB about
   the object's location the opposite pattern was found. Intriguingly,
   correlations between the N400 inconsistency effect and individuals'
   empathy scores showed a significant correlation for FB but not TB. This
   suggests that people who are high in empathy can successfully interpret
   events according to the character's FB, while low empathizers bias their
   interpretation of events to their own egocentric view.}},

Abstract = {{Socially anxious individuals tend to shift their attention away from
   external socially threatening cues and instead become highly
   self-focused. Such heightened self-focused attention has been suggested
   to be involved in the development and maintenance of social anxiety
   disorder. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   investigate the neural correlates of self-focused attention in 16 high
   socially anxious (HSA) and 16 low socially anxious (LSA) individuals.
   Participants were instructed to focus their attention either inwardly or
   outwardly during a simulated social situation. Results indicate
   hyperactivation of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), temporo-parietal
   junction (TPJ) and temporal pole during inward vs outward attention in
   HSA compared with LSA participants. Furthermore, activation of mPFC,
   right anterior insula, TPJ and posterior cingulate cortex was positively
   correlated with the trait of self-focused attention in HSA subjects.
   Results highlight the prominent role of the mPFC and other cortical
   structures in abnormal self-focused attention in social anxiety.
   Finally, findings for the insula suggest increased processing of bodily
   states that is related to the amount of habitual self-focused attention

Abstract = {{Although recent research has begun to describe the neural and genetic
   processes underlying variability in responses to trauma, less is known
   about how these processes interact. We addressed this issue by using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the relationship
   between posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS), a common genetic
   polymorphism of the serotonin transporter {[}5-HTT (5-hydroxy
   tryptamine)] gene and neural activity in response to viewing images
   associated with the 9/11 terrorist attack among a rare sample of
   high-exposure 9/11 survivors (n = 17). Participants varied in whether
   they carried a copy of the short allele in the promoter region of the
   5-HTT gene. During scanning, participants viewed images of the 9/11
   attack, non-9/11 negative and neutral images. Three key findings are
   reported. First, carriers of the short allele displayed higher levels of
   PTSS. Second, both PTSS and the presence of the short allele correlated
   negatively with activity in a network of cortical midline regions (e.g.
   the retrosplenal and more posterior cingulate cortices (PCCs))
   implicated in episodic memories and self-reflection when viewing 9/11 vs
   non-9/11 negative control images. Finally, exploratory analyses
   indicated that PCC activity mediated the relationship between genotype
   and PTSS. These results highlight the role of PCC in distress following
   trauma.}},

Abstract = {{Humans have a fundamental need for strong interpersonal bonds, yet
   individuals differ appreciably in their degree of social integration.
   That these differences are also substantially heritable has spurred
   interest in biological mechanisms underlying the quality and quantity of
   individuals' social relationships. We propose that polymorphic variation
   in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) associates with complex social
   behaviors and social network composition through intermediate effects on
   negative affectivity and the psychological processing of socially
   relevant information. We tested a hypothesized social cascade from the
   molecular level (OXTR variation) to the social environment, through
   negative affectivity and inhibited sociality, in a sample of 1295 men
   and women of European American (N = 1081) and African American (N = 214)
   ancestry. Compared to European Americans having any T allele of
   rs1042778, individuals homozygous for the alternate G allele reported
   significantly lower levels of negative affectivity and inhibited
   sociality, which in turn predicted significantly higher levels of social
   support and a larger/more diverse social network. Moreover, the effect
   of rs1042778 variation on social support was fully accounted for by
   associated differences in negative affectivity and inhibited sociality.
   Results replicated in the African American sample. Findings suggest that
   OXTR variation modulates levels of social support via proximal impacts
   on individual temperament.}},

Abstract = {{The disposition for prosocial conduct, which contributes to cooperation
   as arising during social interaction, requires cortical network dynamics
   responsive to the development of social ties, or care about the
   interests of specific interaction partners. Here, we formulate a dynamic
   computational model that accurately predicted how tie formation, driven
   by the interaction history, influences decisions to contribute in a
   public good game. We used model-driven functional MRI to test the
   hypothesis that brain regions key to social interactions keep track of
   dynamics in tie strength. Activation in the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex tracked the individual's public
   good contributions. Activation in the bilateral posterior superior
   temporal sulcus (pSTS), and temporo-parietal junction was modulated
   parametrically by the dynamically developing social tie-as estimated by
   our model-supporting a role of these regions in social tie formation.
   Activity in these two regions further reflected inter-individual
   differences in tie persistence and sensitivity to behavior of the
   interaction partner. Functional connectivity between pSTS and mPFC
   activations indicated that the representation of social ties is
   integrated in the decision process. These data reveal the brain
   mechanisms underlying the integration of interaction dynamics into a
   social tie representation which in turn influenced the individual's
   prosocial decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Rats with perirhinal cortex lesions received multiple object recognition
   trials within a continuous session to examine whether they show false
   memories. Experiment 1 focused on exploration patterns during the first
   object recognition test postsurgery, in which each trial contained 1
   novel and 1 familiar object. The perirhinal cortex lesions reduced time
   spent exploring novel objects, but did not affect overall time spent
   exploring the test objects (novel plus familiar). Replications with
   subsequent cohorts of rats (Experiments 2, 3, 4.1) repeated this pattern
   of results. When all recognition memory data were combined (Experiments
   1-4), giving totals of 44 perirhinal lesion rats and 40 surgical sham
   controls, the perirhinal cortex lesions caused a marginal reduction in
   total exploration time. That decrease in time with novel objects was
   often compensated by increased exploration of familiar objects.
   Experiment 4 also assessed the impact of proactive interference on
   recognition memory. Evidence emerged that prior object experience could
   additionally impair recognition performance in rats with perirhinal
   cortex lesions. Experiment 5 examined exploration levels when rats were
   just given pairs of novel objects to explore. Despite their perirhinal
   cortex lesions, exploration levels were comparable with those of control
   rats. While the results of Experiment 4 support the notion that
   perirhinal lesions can increase sensitivity to proactive interference,
   the overall findings question whether rats lacking a perirhinal cortex
   typically behave as if novel objects are familiar, that is, show false
   recognition. Rather, the rats retain a signal of novelty but struggle to
   discriminate the identity of that signal.}},

Volume = {{129}},

Abstract = {{Activation of the amygdala either during emotional arousal or by direct
   stimulation is thought to enhance memory in part by modulating
   plasticity in the hippocampus. However, precisely how the amygdala
   influences hippocampal activity to improve memory remains unclear. In
   the present study, brief electrical stimulation delivered to the
   basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) following encounters with some
   novel objects led to better memory for those objects 1 day later.
   Stimulation also elicited field-field and spike-field CA3-CA1 synchrony
   in the hippocampus in the low gamma frequency range (30-55 Hz), a range
   previously associated with spike timing and good memory. In addition,
   the hippocampal spiking patterns observed during BLA stimulation
   reflected recent patterns of activity in the hippocampus. Thus, the
   results indicate that amygdala activation can prioritize memory
   consolidation of specific object encounters by coordinating the precise
   timing of CA1 membrane depolarization with incoming CA3 spikes to
   initiate long-lasting spike-timing dependent plasticity at putative
   synapses between recently active neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies in our lab and others have demonstrated age-related
   declines in mnemonic discrimination during a recognition memory paradigm
   using repeated items, similar lures, and novel foils. In particular,
   older adults exhibit a shift in lure discriminability, identifying
   similar lures as old items at a greater rate than young adults. This
   shift likely reflects deficits in pattern separation processing as a
   result of underlying changes in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
   Here, we explored whether alterations in the task design could rescue
   the age-related impairment or whether it was ubiquitous as one might
   expect if the neurobiological mechanisms were truly disturbed by typical
   aging. Despite overt instructions to study item details during encoding,
   we replicated the age-related deficit in mnemonic discrimination. We
   established reliable effects with short lists of stimuli and with
   repeated testing. Altering the task design from a study/test to a
   continuous recognition paradigm replicated the age-related shift in lure
   discrimination as well. Modifying the task to an old/new response
   (rather than old/similar/new) showed the same effect and a d' analysis
   showed that lure items were more akin to target items in older adults.
   Finally, we varied the test instructions in order to promote gist or
   veridical responses in the old/new task. Even these overt veridical test
   instructions did not ameliorate older adults' lure discrimination
   problems. Together, these findings demonstrate the robust nature of this
   age-related deficit and support the hypothesis that typical aging
   results in neurobiological changes that underlie this impairment.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation serves 2 important functions: It guides actions to be
   goal-directed, and it provides the energy and vigor required to perform
   the work necessary to meet those goals. Dissociating these 2 processes
   with existing behavioral assays has been a challenge. In this article,
   we report a novel experimental strategy to distinguish the 2 processes
   in mice. First, we characterize a novel motivation assay in which
   animals must hold down a lever for progressively longer intervals to
   earn each subsequent reward; we call this the progressive hold-down
   (PHD) task. We find that performance on the PHD task is sensitive to
   both food deprivation level and reward value. Next, we use a dose of
   methamphetamine (METH) 1.0 mg/kg, to evaluate behavior in both the
   progressive ratio (PR) and PHD tasks. Treatment with METH leads to more
   persistent lever pressing for food rewards in the PR. In the PHD task,
   we found that METH increased arousal, which leads to numerous bouts of
   hyperactive responding but neither increases nor impairs goal-directed
   action. The results demonstrate that these tools enable a more precise
   understanding of the underlying processes being altered in manipulations
   that alter motivated behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In humans, places or contexts previously associated with alcohol use
   often provoke relapse during abstinence. This phenomenon is modeled in
   laboratory animals using the ABA renewal procedure, in which extinction
   training in context (B) suppresses alcohol seeking, and renewal of this
   seeking occurs when the animal returns to the original training context
   (A). However, extinction training does not adequately capture the
   motivation for abstinence in human alcoholics who typically
   self-initiate abstinence in response to the negative consequences of
   excessive use. We recently developed a procedure to study renewal in
   laboratory rats after abstinence imposed by negative consequences
   (footshock punishment). The mechanisms of renewal of punished alcohol
   seeking are largely unknown. Here, we used the D1-family receptor
   antagonist SCH 23390 to examine the role of nucleus accumbens (NAc)
   shell and core dopamine in renewal of alcohol seeking after
   punishment-imposed abstinence. We trained alcohol-preferring ``P
   rats{''} to self-administer 20\% alcohol in Context A and subsequently
   suppressed alcohol taking via response-contingent footshock punishment
   in Context B. We tested the effects of systemic, NAc shell, or NAc core
   injections of SCH 23390 on renewal of alcohol seeking after
   punishment-imposed abstinence. We found that both systemic and NAc shell
   and core injections of SCH 23390 decreased renewal of punished alcohol
   seeking. Our results demonstrate a critical role of NAc dopamine in
   renewal of alcohol seeking after punishment-imposed abstinence. We
   discuss these results in reference to the brain mechanisms of renewal of
   alcohol seeking after extinction versus punishment.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between motivation and cognition are implicated in
   producing functional impairments and poor quality of life in psychiatric
   patients. This interaction, however, is not well understood at either
   the behavioral or neural level. We developed a procedure for mice in
   which a cognitive measure, sustained attention, is modulated by a
   motivationally relevant signal that predicts reward probability on a
   trial-by-trial basis. Using this paradigm, we tested the interaction
   between motivation and cognition in mice that model the increased
   striatal D2 receptor activity observed in schizophrenia patients (D2R-OE
   mice). In control mice, attention was modulated by signaled-reward
   probability. In D2R-OE mice, however, attention was not modulated by
   reward-related cues. This impairment was not due to any global deficits
   in attention or maintenance of the trial-specific information in working
   memory. Turning off the transgene in D2R-OE mice rescued the
   motivational modulation of attention. These results indicate that
   deficits in motivation impair the ability to use reward-related cues to
   recruit attention and that improving motivation improves functional
   cognitive performance. These results further suggest that addressing
   motivational impairments in patients is critical to achieving
   substantive cognitive and functional gains.}},

Abstract = {{Adverse experiences during childhood are associated with the development
   of psychiatric disorders later in life. In particular, childhood abuse
   and neglect are risk factors for addictive disorders, such as substance
   misuse and pathological gambling. Impulsivity and compulsivity are key
   features of these disorders. Therefore, we investigated whether
   childhood adversity might increase vulnerability for addictive disorders
   through promotion of compulsive and impulsive behaviors. Rats were
   exposed to a brief, variable childhood or prepubertal stress protocol
   (Postnatal Days 25-27), and their behavior in a delay discounting task
   was compared with that of control animals in adulthood. Prepubertal
   stress produced compulsive-type behavior in females. Specifically,
   stressed females displayed inappropriate responses during a choice phase
   of the task, perseverating with nosepoke responding instead of choosing
   between 2 levers. Stressed females also showed learning impairments
   during task training. However, prepubertal stress was not associated
   with the development of impulsive behavior, as rates of delay
   discounting were not affected in either sex. Childhood adversity may
   contribute to the establishment and maintenance of addictive disorders
   by increasing perseveration in females. Perseverative behavior may
   therefore provide a viable therapeutic target for preventing the
   development of addictive disorders in individuals exposed to childhood
   adversity. These effects were not seen in males, highlighting sex
   differences in response to early life stress.}},

Abstract = {{Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be caused by genetic
   or environmental factors. Among environmental factors, perinatal
   complications are related, such as neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). Thus,
   the aim of this study was to investigate whether HI contributes to the
   development of characteristics related to ADHD in adult rats, and to
   correlate the behavioral results with brain damage volume. Male Wistar
   rats were divided into 2 groups: HI and control. The HI procedure
   consisted of a permanent occlusion of the right common carotid artery
   followed by a period of hypoxia (90 min; 8\% O-2 and 92\% N-2) on the
   7th postnatal day. Two months later, animals were evaluated in the open
   field test during a single 5-min session, and in the 5-choice serial
   reaction time task (5-CSRTT), over 25 weeks. Our results demonstrated
   that animals submitted to HI manifest cognitive impairments in task
   acquisition, deficits in sustained attention, and increases in
   impulsivity and compulsivity in response to task manipulation in the
   5-CSRTT. Locomotor activity observed in open field did not differ
   between groups. Moreover, brain volume loss in the total hemisphere,
   cerebral cortex, white matter, hippocampus, and striatum were observed
   in HI animals, especially on the side ipsilateral to the lesion. From
   these results, we can infer that neonatal HI is an environmental factor
   that could contribute to the development of behavioral characteristics
   observed in ADHD that are associated with general brain atrophy.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that metabolic stressors increase an
   organism's risk of depression. Chronic mild stress is a popular animal
   model of depression and several serendipitous findings have suggested
   that food deprivation prior to sucrose testing in this model is
   necessary to observe anhedonic behaviors. Here, we directly tested this
   hypothesis by exposing animals to chronic mild stress and used an
   overnight 2-bottle sucrose test (food ad libitum) on Day 5 and 10, then
   food and water deprive animals overnight and tested their sucrose
   consumption and preference in a 1-hr sucrose test the following morning.
   Approximately 65\% of stressed animals consumed sucrose and showed a
   sucrose preference similar to nonstressed controls in an overnight
   sucrose test, and 35\% showed a decrease in sucrose intake and
   preference. Following overnight food and water deprivation the
   previously ``resilient{''} animals showed a significant decrease in
   sucrose preference and greatly reduced sucrose intake. In addition, we
   evaluated whether the onset of anhedonia following food and water
   deprivation corresponds to alterations in corticosterone, epinephrine,
   circulating glucose, or interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) expression in
   limbic brain areas. Although all stressed animals showed adrenal
   hypertrophy and elevated circulating epinephrine, only stressed animals
   that were food deprived were hypoglycemic compared with food-deprived
   controls. Additionally, food and water deprivation significantly
   increased hippocampus IL-1 beta while food and water deprivation only
   increased hypothalamus IL-1 beta in stress-susceptible animals. These
   data demonstrate that metabolic stress of food and water deprivation
   interacts with chronic stressor exposure to induce physiological and
   anhedonic responses.}},

Abstract = {{Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) lack functional T and
   B lymphocytes, and have impaired cognitive abilities. We assessed social
   behaviors in male SCID and C57BL/6 (B6) juvenile mice. In a social
   preference task, SCID mice spent more time than B6 mice investigating a
   novel adult male mouse. In a social recognition task, SCID mice
   habituated to a novel ovariectomized mouse, but failed to show
   dishabituation when presented with an unfamiliar individual. We
   hypothesized that partial immune restoration could normalize behaviors.
   SCID pups (postnatal Day 7) received either saline or splenocytes from
   normal donors. Splenocyte-replaced SCID mice spent less time interacting
   with a novel mouse than saline-injected SCID or B6 control mice. Again,
   control SCID mice failed to dishabituate to a novel mouse, but
   splenocyte-replaced SCID mice showed dishabituation. In both of these
   studies, B6 and SCID pairs were used to produce offspring that remained
   with their dams until weaning. There are no studies of maternal behavior
   in SCID dams; therefore to investigate the potential role for this
   factor, we quantified maternal behavior in SCID and B6 dams; several
   significant differences were found. To control for differences in
   maternal care, we mated heterozygous SCIDs to produce offspring. These
   homozygous SCID and wild-type offspring reared by dams of the same
   genotypes displayed similar responses to a novel mouse; however, in the
   social recognition task, SCID males did not display dishabituation to a
   novel mouse. Taken together, our data indicate that Gene X Environment
   interactions influence social interactions in immune deficient mice.}},

Abstract = {{The social behavior in a cohort of adult animals who received ibotenic
   acid lesions of the amygdala (4 female, 3 male) or hippocampus (5
   female, 3 male) as neonates, and sham-operated controls (4 female, 4
   male) was evaluated in their home environments with the familiar
   opposite sex monkey (pair-mate) with whom they were housed.
   Amygdala-lesioned animals spent less time with their familiar partners
   and engaged in higher frequencies of stress-related behaviors than
   control animals. Hippocampus-lesioned animals spent significantly more
   time socially engaging their pair-mates than both control and
   amygdala-lesioned animals. These results suggest that early damage to
   the amygdala or hippocampus subtly alter patterns of adult social
   behavior in a familiar context and stand in sharp contrast to extant
   studies of early damage to the amygdala or hippocampus and to the more
   dramatically altered patterns of behavior observed after damage to the

Title = {{A Sex Difference in Circadian Food-Anticipatory Rhythms in Mice:
   Interaction With Dopamine D1 Receptor Knockout}},

Abstract = {{Restricted daily feeding schedules induce circadian rhythms of
   food-anticipatory activity (FAA) in mice and other species. The
   entrainment pathway(s) and location(s) of circadian oscillators driving
   these rhythms have not been definitively established. An important role
   for dopamine signaling and the dorsal striatum is suggested by a
   confluence of observations, including shifting of FAA rhythms by
   dopamine receptor agonists and attenuation by antagonists and D1
   receptor knockout (D1R KO). The dopamine reward system exhibits sexual
   dimorphisms in structure and function; if FAA rhythms are regulated by
   this system, then FAA may also be sexually dimorphic. To assess this
   prediction, disk running and general activity were recorded continuously
   in male and female C57BL/6J mice with food available ad libitum and then
   restricted to a 4-hr daily meal in the middle of the light period.
   Compared with male mice, FAA in female mice was significantly reduced in
   duration, total count, peak level, and ratio relative to nocturnal
   activity. To determine whether these differences were mediated by D1
   receptors, male and female homozygous D1R KO mice were examined.
   Compared with wild type and heterozygous mice, female and male D1R KO
   mice exhibited a marked attenuation of FAA parameters. The magnitude of
   the attenuation was greater in female mice. These results confirm an
   important role for dopamine D1 receptors in the circadian mechanism by
   which mice anticipate a daily meal, and they reveal a previously
   unreported sexual dimorphism in the expression of food-anticipatory
   rhythms that is amplified by D1R KO.}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), a commonly used animal model of
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, exhibit little habituation of
   the orienting response to repeated presentations of a nonreinforced
   visual stimulus. However, SHRs that have access to a running wheel for
   5, 10, or 21 days exhibit robust habituation that is indistinguishable
   from normo-active rats. Two days of exercise, in comparison, is not
   sufficient to affect habituation. Here we tested the hypothesis that the
   effect of exercise on orienting behavior in SHRs is mediated by changes
   in noradrenergic function. In Experiment 1, we found that 5, 10, or 21
   days of access to a running wheel, but not 2 days, significantly reduced
   levels of the norepinephrine transporter in medial prefrontal cortex. In
   Experiment 2, we tested for a causal relationship between changes in
   noradrenergic function and orienting behavior by blocking noradrenergic
   receptors during exercise. Rats that received propranolol (beta
   adrenergic/noradrenergic receptor blocker) during 10 days of exercise
   failed to exhibit an exercise-induced reduction in orienting behavior.
   The results inform a growing literature regarding the effects of
   exercise on behavior and the potential use of exercise as a treatment
   for mental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme is a major determinant of
   prefrontal dopamine levels. The Val(158)Met polymorphism affects COMT
   enzymatic activity and has been associated with variation in executive
   function and affective processing. This study investigated the effect of
   COMT genotype on the flexible modulation of the balance between
   processing self-generated and processing stimulus-oriented information,
   in the presence or absence of affective distractors. Analyses included
   124 healthy adult participants, who were also assessed on standard
   working memory (WM) tasks. Relative to Val carriers, Met homozygotes
   made fewer errors when selecting and manipulating self-generated
   thoughts. This effect was partly accounted for by an association between
   COMT genotype and visuospatial WM performance. We also observed a
   complex interaction between the influence of affective distractors, COMT
   genotype and sex on task accuracy: male, but not female, participants
   showed a sensitivity to the affective distractors that was dependent on
   COMT genotype. This was not accounted for by WM performance. This study
   provides novel evidence of the role of dopaminergic genetic variation on
   the ability to select and manipulate self-generated thoughts. The
   results also suggest sexually dimorphic effects of COMT genotype on the
   influence of affective distractors on executive function.}},

Abstract = {{Literature on mirror neurons has shown that seeing someone preparing to
   move generates in the motor areas of the observers a brain activity
   similar to that generated when the subject prepares his own actions.
   Thus, the mirroring of action would not be limited to the execution
   phase but also involves the preparation process. Here we confirm and
   extend this notion showing that, just as different brain activities
   prepare different voluntary actions, also different brain activities
   prepare to observe different predictable actions. Videos of two
   different actions from egocentric point of view were presented in
   separate blocks: (i) grasping of a cup and (ii) impossible grasping of a
   cup. Subjects had to passively observe the videos showing
   object-directed hand movements. Through the use of the event-related
   potentials, we found a cortical activity before observing the actions,
   which was very similar to the one recorded prior to the actual execution
   of that same action, in terms of both topography and latency. This
   anticipatory activity does not represent a general preparation state but
   an action-specific state, because being dependent on the specific
   meaning of the forthcoming action. These results reinforce our knowledge
   about the correspondence between action, perception and cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Social norms, such as treating others fairly regardless of kin
   relations, are essential for the functioning of human societies. Their
   existence may explain why humans, among all species, show unique
   patterns of prosocial behaviour. The maintenance of social norms often
   depends on external enforcement, as in the absence of credible
   sanctioning mechanisms prosocial behaviour deteriorates quickly. This
   sanction-dependent prosocial behaviour suggests that humans
   strategically adapt their behaviour and act selfishly if possible but
   control selfish impulses if necessary. Recent studies point at the role
   of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in controlling selfish
   impulses. We test whether the DLPFC is indeed involved in the control of
   selfish impulses as well as the strategic acquisition of this control
   mechanism. Using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, we
   provide evidence for the causal role of the right DLPFC in strategic
   fairness. Because the DLPFC is phylogenetically one of the latest
   developed neocortical regions, this could explain why complex norm
   systems exist in humans but not in other social animals.}},

Abstract = {{Mental health problems, such as depression, are increasingly common
   among workers. Job-related stresses, including psychological demands and
   a lack of discretion in controlling one's own work environment, are
   important causal factors. However, the mechanisms through which
   job-related stress may affect brain function remain unknown. We sought
   to identify the relationship between job-related stress and
   frontotemporal cortex activation using near-infrared spectroscopy.
   Seventy-nine (45 females, 34 males) Japanese employees, aged 26-51years,
   were recruited from respondents to the Japanese Study of Stratification,
   Health, Income, and Neighborhood survey. Job-related stress was measured
   using the Japanese version of Job Content Questionnaire, which can index
   ``job demand{''} and ``job control{''}. We found a significant
   correlation between higher ``job demand{''} and smaller oxygenated
   hemoglobin {[}oxy-Hb] changes in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   in female (r=-.54 to -.44). Significant correlations between higher
   ``job control{''} and greater {[}oxy-Hb] changes in the right temporal
   cortex were observed among male, and in the combined sample (r=.46-.64).
   This initial cross-sectional observation suggests that elevated
   job-related stress is related to decrease frontotemporal cortex
   activation among workers. Integrating social epidemiology and
   neuroscience may be a powerful strategy for understanding how
   individuals' brain functions may mediate between the job-related stress
   or psychosocial work characteristics and public mental health.}},

Abstract = {{Compassion is a human feeling towards an individual who is suffering.
   However, the responses toward a victim are not always compassionate and
   may, for example, be moderated by the perceived responsibility of the
   victim. In the present study, we investigated the neural correlates of
   compassion and specifically differentiated the responses to other
   individuals' misfortunes depending on whether the victim was responsible
   for the event that occurred. In particular, we identified increased
   activation of the left insula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and
   adjacent anterior cingulate cortex when the participants read sentences
   with innocent compared with responsible victims. The reverse contrast
   revealed increased activation of the bilateral temporoparietal junction,
   right precuneus, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Using
   a psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis, we demonstrated that
   in the responsible condition, right dlPFC activation was accompanied by
   decreased activation in the left insula, anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC), and mPFC. This inverse effective connectivity illustrates the
   antagonism of the dlPFC and mPFC in compassion-related appraisal of
   external events. More specifically, our results imply that regulatory
   mechanisms of compassion are related to the perception of
   responsibility.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{253-267}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Neuroscience research suggests that inferring neutral intentions of
   other people recruits a specific brain network within the inferior
   fronto-parietal action observation network as well as a putative social
   network including brain areas subserving theory of mind, such as the
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), the temporo-parietal junction
   (TPJ), and also the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Recent studies on
   harmful intentions have refined this network by showing the specific
   involvement of the ACC, amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC) in early stages (within 200ms) of information processing.
   However, the functional dynamics for kind intentions within and among
   these networks remains unclear. To address this question, we measured
   electrical brain activity from 18 healthy adult participants while they
   were performing an intention inference task with three different types
   of intentions: kind, hostile and non-interactive. Electrophysiological
   results revealed that kind intentions were characterized by
   significantly larger peak amplitudes of N2 over the frontal sites than
   those for hostile and non-interactive intentions. On the other hand,
   there were no significant differences between hostile and
   non-interactive intentions at N2. The source analysis suggested that the
   vicinity of the left cingulate gyrus contributed to the N2 effect by
   subtracting the kindness condition from the non-interactive condition
   within 250-350ms. At a later stage (i.e., during the 270-500ms epoch),
   the peak amplitude of the P3 over the parietal sites and the right
   hemisphere was significantly larger for hostile intentions compared to
   the kind and non-interactive intentions. No significant differences were
   observed at P3 between kind and non-interactive intentions. The source
   analysis showed that the vicinity of the left anterior cingulate cortex
   contributed to the P3 effect by subtracting the hostility condition from
   the non-interactive condition within 450-550ms. The present study
   provides preliminary evidence of the spatio-temporal dynamics sustaining
   the dissociation between the understandings of different types of social
   intentions.}},

Title = {{Cognitive dissonance induction in everyday life: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{268-281}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explored the
   neural substrates of cognitive dissonance during dissonance induction. A
   novel task was developed based on the results of a separate item
   selection study (n=125). Items were designed to generate dissonance by
   prompting participants to reflect on everyday personal experiences that
   were inconsistent with values they had expressed support for. One
   experimental condition (dissonance) and three control conditions
   (justification, consonance, and non-self-related inconsistency) were
   used for comparison. Items of all four types were presented to each
   participant (n=14) in a randomized design. The fMRI analysis used a
   whole-brain approach focusing on the moments dissonance was induced.
   Results showed that in comparison with the control conditions the
   dissonance experience led to higher levels of activation in several
   brain regions. Specifically dissonance was associated with increased
   neural activation in key brain regions including the anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus.
   This supports current perspectives that emphasize the role of anterior
   cingulate and insula in dissonance processing. Less extensive activation
   in the prefrontal cortex than in some previous studies is consistent
   with this study's emphasis on dissonance induction, rather than
   reduction. This article also contains a short review and comparison with
   other fMRI studies of cognitive dissonance.}},

Abstract = {{Aim of the present study was to investigate the time course of brain
   processes involved in the visual perception of different gaze
   interactions in woman-child dyads and the association between attachment
   dimensions and brain activation during the presentation of gaze
   interactions. The hypothesis was that the woman avoidance will produce a
   greater activation of primary somatosensory and limbic areas. The
   attachment styles dimensions avoidant-related will be associated with
   fronto-limbic brain intensity during the convergence of gaze.
   Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded using a 256-channel
   HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net in 44 female subjects (age: 24 +/- 2years).
   Event-related potential (ERP) components and standardized low-resolution
   electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) were analyzed. Participants were
   administered the attachment style questionnaire before EEG task. A lower
   P350 latency was found in the fronto-central montage in response to
   woman avoidance. sLORETA analysis showed a greater intensity of limbic
   and primary somatosensory areas in response to woman avoidance compared
   to the others gaze interactions. In response to convergence gaze, the
   confidence attachment dimension was negatively correlated with the
   intensities of the right temporal and limbic areas, and the
   relationships as secondary attachment dimension were positively
   correlated with the intensities of the bilateral frontal areas and of
   the left parietal area.}},

Title = {{Concepts in context: Processing mental state concepts with internal or

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{294-307}},

Abstract = {{According to embodied cognition theories, concepts are contextually
   situated and grounded in neural systems that produce experiential
   states. This view predicts that processing mental state concepts
   recruits neural regions associated with different aspects of experience
   depending on the context in which people understand a concept. This
   neuroimaging study tested this prediction using a set of sentences that
   described emotional (e.g., fear, joy) and nonemotional (e.g., thinking,
   hunger) mental states with internal focus (i.e., focusing on bodily
   sensations and introspection) or external focus (i.e., focusing on
   expression and action). Consistent with our predictions, data suggested
   that the inferior frontal gyrus, a region associated with action
   representation, was engaged more by external than internal sentences. By
   contrast, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region associated with
   the generation of internal states, was engaged more by internal emotion
   sentences than external sentence categories. Similar patterns emerged
   when we examined the relationship between neural activity and
   independent ratings of sentence focus. Furthermore, ratings of emotion
   were associated with activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, whereas
   ratings of activity were associated with activation in the inferior
   frontal gyrus. These results suggest that mental state concepts are
   represented in a dynamic way, using context-relevant interoceptive and
   sensorimotor resources.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{308-319}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{The goal of the current study was to examine whether differential neural
   attentional capture and evaluative responses for out-group homosexual
   relative to in-group heterosexual targets occur during social
   categorization. To this end, 36 heterosexual participants were presented
   with pictures of heterosexual and homosexual couples in a
   picture-viewing task that was designed to assess implicit levels of
   discomfort toward homosexuality and explicit evaluations of pleasantness
   toward the images. Neural activity in the form of electroencephalogram
   was recorded during the presentation of the pictures, and event-related
   potentials resulting from these stimuli were examined. Participants also
   completed questionnaires that assessed the degree to which they
   socialized with gays and lesbians. Results demonstrated that relative to
   straight couples, larger P2 amplitude was observed in response to gay
   but not to lesbian couples. However, both gay and lesbian couples
   yielded a larger late positive potential than straight couples.
   Moreover, the degree to which participants differentially directed early
   neural attention to out-group lesbian versus in-group straight couples
   was related to their familiarity with homosexual individuals. This work,
   which provides an initial understanding of the neural underpinnings of
   attention toward homosexual couples, suggests that differences in the
   processing of sexual orientation can occur as early as 200ms and may be
   moderated by familiarity.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to abstract trait words which describe people's general
   personality, gossip is about personal affairs of others. Although neural
   correlates underlying processing self-related trait words have been well
   documented, it remains poorly understood how the human brain processes
   gossip. In the present fMRI study, participants were instructed to rate
   their online emotional states upon hearing positive and negative gossip
   about celebrities, themselves, and their best friends. Explicit
   behavioral ratings suggested that participants were happier to hear
   positive gossip and more annoyed to hear negative gossip about
   themselves than about celebrities and best friends. At the neural level,
   dissociated neural networks were involved in processing the positive
   gossip about self and the negative gossip about celebrities. On the one
   hand, the superior medial prefrontal cortex responded not only to
   self-related gossip but also to moral transgressions, and neural
   activity in the orbital prefrontal cortex increased linearly with
   pleasure ratings on positive gossip about self. On the other hand,
   although participants' ratings did not show they were particularly happy
   on hearing negative gossip about celebrities, the significantly enhanced
   neural activity in the reward system suggested that they were indeed
   amused. Moreover, via enhanced functional connectivity, the prefrontal
   executive control network was involved in regulating the reward system
   by giving explicit pleasure ratings according to social norm compliance,
   rather than natural true feelings.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to perceive social intentions from people's eyes is present
   from an early age, yet little is known about whether this skill is fully
   developed in childhood or that subtle changes may still occur across
   adolescence. This fMRI study investigated the ability to read mental
   states by using an adapted version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes
   task within adolescents (aged 12-19 years) over a 2-year test-retest
   interval. This longitudinal setup provides the opportunity to study both
   stability over time as well as age-related changes. The behavioral
   results showed that participants who performed well in the mental state
   condition at the first measurement also performed well at the second
   measurement. fMRI results revealed positive test-retest correlations of
   neural activity in the right superior temporal sulcus and right inferior
   frontal gyrus for the contrast mental state > control, suggesting
   stability within individuals over time. Besides stability of activation,
   dorsal medial prefrontal cortex showed a dip in mid-adolescence for the
   mental state > control condition and right inferior frontal gyrus
   decreased linearly with age for the mental state > control condition.
   These findings underline changes in the slope of the developmental
   pattern depending on age, even in the existence of relatively stable
   activation in the social brain network.}},

Abstract = {{Several prominent theories spanning clinical, social and developmental
   psychology suggest that people are motivated to see the world as a
   sensible orderly place. These theories presuppose that randomness is
   aversive because it is associated with unpredictability. If this is the
   case, thinking that the world is random should lead to increased anxiety
   and heightened monitoring of one's actions and their consequences. Here,
   we conduct experimental tests of both of these ideas. Participants read
   one of three passages: (i) comprehensible order, (ii) incomprehensible
   order and (iii) randomness. In Study 1, we examined the effects of these
   passages on self-reported anxiety. In Study 2, we examined the effects
   of the same manipulation on the error-related negativity (ERN), an
   event-related brain potential associated with performance monitoring. We
   found that messages about randomness increased self-reported anxiety and
   ERN amplitude relative to comprehensible order, whereas incomprehensible
   order had intermediate effects. These results lend support to the
   theoretically important idea that randomness is unsettling because it
   implies that the world is unpredictable.}},

Abstract = {{In temporal lobe epilepsy and lobectomy, deficits in emotion
   identification have been found consistently, but there is limited
   evidence for complex social inference skills such as theory of mind.
   Furthermore, risk factors and the specific neural underpinnings of these
   deficits in this population are unclear. We investigated these issues
   using a comprehensive range of social inference tasks (emotion
   identification and comprehension of sincere, deceitful and sarcastic
   social exchanges) in individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy or
   lobectomy (n = 87). We observed deficits across patient groups which
   were partly related to the presence of mesial temporal lobe sclerosis,
   early age of seizure onset and left lobectomy. A voxel-based morphometry
   analysis conducted in the pre-operative group confirmed the importance
   of the temporal lobe by showing a relationship between left hippocampal
   atrophy and overall social inference abilities, and between left
   anterior neocortex atrophy and sarcasm comprehension. These findings are
   in keeping with theoretical proposals that the hippocampus is critical
   for binding diverse elements in cognitive domains beyond canonical
   episodic memory operations, and that the anterior temporal cortex is a
   convergence zone of higher-order perceptual and emotional processes, and
   of stored representations. As impairments were frequent, we require
   further investigation of this behavioural domain and its impact on the
   lives of people with epilepsy.}},

Abstract = {{Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that involves
   impaired regulation of the fear response to traumatic reminders. This
   study tested how women with male-perpetrated interpersonal
   violence-related PTSD (IPV-PTSD) differed in their brain activation from
   healthy controls (HC) when exposed to scenes of male-female interaction
   of differing emotional content. Sixteen women with symptoms of IPV-PTSD
   and 19 HC participated in this study. During magnetic resonance imaging,
   participants watched a stimulus protocol of 23 different 20 s silent
   epochs of male-female interactions taken from feature films, which were
   neutral, menacing or prosocial. IPV-PTSD participants compared with HC
   showed (i) greater dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activation in response to
   menacing vs prosocial scenes and (ii) greater anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC), right hippocampus activation and lower ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC) activty in response to emotional vs neutral scenes. The
   fact that IPV-PTSD participants compared with HC showed lower activity
   of the ventral ACC during emotionally charged scenes regardless of the
   valence of the scenes suggests that impaired social perception among
   IPV-PTSD patients transcends menacing contexts and generalizes to a
   wider variety of emotionally charged male-female interactions.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that depressed individuals have difficulty
   directing attention away from negative distractors, a phenomenon known
   as affective interference. However, findings are mixed regarding the
   neural mechanisms and network dynamics of affective interference. The
   present study addressed these issues by comparing neural activation
   during emotion-word and color-word Stroop tasks in participants with
   varying levels of (primarily subclinical) depression. Depressive
   symptoms predicted increased activation to negative distractors in areas
   of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC), regions implicated in cognitive control and internally
   directed attention, respectively. Increased dACC activity was also
   observed in the group-average response to incongruent distractors,
   suggesting that dACC activity during affective interference is related
   to overtaxed cognitive control. In contrast, regions of PCC were
   deactivated across the group in response to incongruent distractors,
   suggesting that PCC activity during affective interference represents
   task-independent processing. A psychophysiological interaction emerged
   in which higher depression predicted more positively correlated activity
   between dACC and PCC during affective interference, i.e. greater
   connectivity between cognitive control and internal-attention systems.
   These findings suggest that, when individuals high in depression are
   confronted by negative material, increased attention to internal
   thoughts and difficulty shifting resources to the external world
   interfere with goal-directed behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most abundant neutrophin
   in the mammalian central nervous system, is critically involved in
   synaptic plasticity. In both rodents and humans, BDNF has been
   implicated in hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent learning and memory
   and has more recently been linked to fear extinction processes.
   Fifty-nine healthy participants, genotyped for the functional
   BDNFval66met polymorphism, underwent a fear conditioning and 24h-delayed
   extinction protocol while skin conductance and blood oxygenation level
   dependent (BOLD) responses (functional magnetic resonance imaging) were
   acquired. We present the first report of neural activation pattern
   during fear acquisition `and' extinction for the BDNFval66met
   polymorphism using a differential conditioned stimulus (CS)+ > CS-
   comparison. During conditioning, we observed heightened allele
   dose-dependent responses in the amygdala and reduced responses in the
   subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in BDNFval66met met-carriers. During
   early extinction, 24h later, we again observed heightened responses in
   several regions ascribed to the fear network in met-carriers as opposed
   to val-carriers (insula, amygdala, hippocampus), which likely reflects
   fear memory recall. No differences were observed during late extinction,
   which likely reflects learned extinction. Our data thus support previous
   associations of the BDNFval66met polymorphism with neural activation in
   the fear and extinction network, but speak against a specific
   association with fear extinction processes.}},

Abstract = {{Two studies examined whether social identity processes, i.e. group
   identification and social identity threat, amplify the degree to which
   people attend to social category information in early perception
   {[}assessed with event-related brain potentials (ERPs)]. Participants
   were presented with faces of Muslims and non-Muslims in an evaluative
   priming task while ERPs were measured and implicit evaluative bias was
   assessed. Study 1 revealed that non-Muslims showed stronger
   differentiation between ingroup and outgroup faces in both early (N200)
   and later processing stages (implicit evaluations) when they identified
   more strongly with their ethnic group. Moreover, identification effects
   on implicit bias were mediated by intergroup differentiation in the
   N200. In Study 2, social identity threat (vs control) was manipulated
   among Muslims. Results revealed that high social identity threat
   resulted in stronger differentiation of Muslims from non-Muslims in
   early (N200) and late (implicit evaluations) processing stages, with
   N200 effects again predicting implicit bias. Combined, these studies
   reveal how seemingly bottom-up early social categorization processes are
   affected by individual and contextual variables that affect the meaning
   of social identity. Implications of these results for the social
   identity perspective as well as social cognitive theories of person
   perception are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{It is unclear whether reflective awareness of emotions is related to
   extent and intensity of implicit affective reactions. This study is the
   first to investigate automatic brain reactivity to emotional stimuli as
   a function of trait emotional awareness. To assess emotional awareness
   the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) was administered. During
   scanning, masked happy, angry, fearful and neutral facial expressions
   were presented to 46 healthy subjects, who had to rate the fit between
   artificial and emotional words. The rating procedure allowed assessment
   of shifts in implicit affectivity due to emotion faces. Trait emotional
   awareness was associated with increased activation in the primary
   somatosensory cortex, inferior parietal lobule, anterior cingulate
   gyrus, middle frontal and cerebellar areas, thalamus, putamen and
   amygdala in response to masked happy faces. LEAS correlated positively
   with shifts in implicit affect caused by masked happy faces. According
   to our findings, people with high emotional awareness show stronger
   affective reactivity and more activation in brain areas involved in
   emotion processing and simulation during the perception of masked happy
   facial expression than people with low emotional awareness. High
   emotional awareness appears to be characterized by an enhanced positive
   affective resonance to others at an automatic processing level.}},

Abstract = {{Social cues conveyed by the human face, such as eye gaze direction, are
   evaluated even before they are consciously perceived. While there is
   substantial individual variability in such evaluation, its neural basis
   is unknown. Here we asked whether individual differences in preconscious
   evaluation of social face traits were associated with local variability
   in brain structure. Adult human participants (n = 36) monocularly viewed
   faces varying in dominance and trustworthiness, which were suppressed
   from awareness by a dynamic noise pattern shown to the other eye. The
   time taken for faces to emerge from suppression and become visible (t2e)
   was used as a measure of potency in competing for visual awareness. Both
   dominant and untrustworthy faces resulted in slower t2e than neutral
   faces, with substantial individual variability in these effects.
   Individual differences in t2e were correlated with gray matter volume in
   right insula for dominant faces, and with gray matter volume in medial
   prefrontal cortex, right temporoparietal junction and bilateral fusiform
   face area for untrustworthy faces. Thus, individual differences in
   preconscious social processing can be predicted from local brain
   structure, and separable correlates for facial dominance and
   untrustworthiness suggest distinct mechanisms of preconscious
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Strong evidence links the 5-HTTLPR genotype to the modulation of
   amygdala reactivity during fear conditioning, which is considered to
   convey the increased vulnerability for anxiety disorders in s-allele
   carriers. In addition to amygdala reactivity, the 5-HTTLPR has been
   shown to be related to alterations in structural and effective
   connectivity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of
   5-HTTLPR genotype on amygdala reactivity and effective connectivity
   during fear conditioning, as well as structural connectivity {[}as
   measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)]. To integrate different
   classification strategies, we used the bi-allelic (s-allele vs
   l/l-allele group) as well as the tri-allelic (low-functioning vs
   high-functioning) classification approach. S-allele carriers showed
   exaggerated amygdala reactivity and elevated amygdala-insula coupling
   during fear conditioning (CS + > CS-) compared with the l/l-allele
   group. In addition, DTI analysis showed increased fractional anisotropy
   values in s-allele carriers within the uncinate fasciculus. Using the
   tri-allelic classification approach, increased amygdala reactivity and
   amygdala insula coupling were observed in the low-functioning compared
   with the high-functioning group. No significant differences between the
   two groups were found in structural connectivity. The present results
   add to the current debate on the influence of the 5-HTTLPR on brain
   functioning. These differences between s-allele and l/l-allele carriers
   may contribute to altered vulnerability for psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{We used human electroencephalogram to study early audiovisual
   integration of dynamic angry and neutral expressions. An auditory-only
   condition served as a baseline for the interpretation of integration
   effects. In the audiovisual conditions, the validity of visual
   information was manipulated using facial expressions that were either
   emotionally congruent or incongruent with the vocal expressions. First,
   we report an N1 suppression effect for angry compared with neutral
   vocalizations in the auditory-only condition. Second, we confirm early
   integration of congruent visual and auditory information as indexed by a
   suppression of the auditory N1 and P2 components in the audiovisual
   compared with the auditory-only condition. Third, audiovisual N1
   suppression was modulated by audiovisual congruency in interaction with
   emotion: for neutral vocalizations, there was N1 suppression in both the
   congruent and the incongruent audiovisual conditions. For angry
   vocalizations, there was N1 suppression only in the congruent but not in
   the incongruent condition. Extending previous findings of dynamic
   audiovisual integration, the current results suggest that audiovisual N1
   suppression is congruency- and emotion-specific and indicate that
   dynamic emotional expressions compared with non-emotional expressions
   are preferentially processed in early audiovisual integration.}},

Abstract = {{Human cooperation and competition is modulated by oxytocin, a
   hypothalamic neuropeptide that functions as both hormone and
   neurotransmitter. Oxytocin's functions can be captured in two
   explanatory yet largely contradictory frameworks: the fear-dampening
   (FD) hypothesis that oxytocin has anxiolytic effects and reduces
   fear-motivated action; and the social approach/avoidance (SAA)
   hypothesis that oxytocin increases cooperative approach and facilitates
   protection against aversive stimuli and threat. We tested derivations
   from both frameworks in a novel predator-prey contest game. Healthy
   males given oxytocin or placebo invested as predator to win their prey's
   endowment, or as prey to protect their endowment against predation.
   Neural activity was registered using 3T-MRI. In prey, (fear-motivated)
   investments were fast and conditioned on the amygdala. Inconsistent with
   FD, oxytocin did not modulate neural and behavioral responding in prey.
   In predators, (greed-motivated) investments were slower, and conditioned
   on the superior frontal gyrus (SFG). Consistent with SAA, oxytocin
   reduced predator investment, time to decide and activation in SFG. Thus,
   whereas oxytocin does not incapacitate the impulsive ability to protect
   and defend oneself, it lowers the greedy and more calculated appetite
   for coming out ahead.}},

Abstract = {{For successful communication, conversational partners need to estimate
   each other's current knowledge state. Nonverbal facial and bodily cues
   can reveal relevant information about how confident a speaker is about
   what they are saying. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   aimed to identify brain regions that encode how confident a speaker is
   perceived to be. Participants viewed videos of people answering general
   knowledge questions and judged each respondent's confidence in their
   answer. Our results suggest a distinct role of two neural networks known
   to support social inferences, the so-called mentalizing and the
   mirroring network. While activation in both networks underlies the
   processing of nonverbal cues, only activity in the mentalizing network,
   most notably the medial prefrontal cortex and the bilateral
   temporoparietal junction, is modulated by how confident the respondent
   is judged to be. Our results support an integrative account of the
   mirroring and mentalizing network, in which the two systems support each
   other in aiding pragmatic processing.}},

Abstract = {{When we are learning to associate novel cues with outcomes, learning is
   more efficient if we take advantage of previously learned associations
   and thereby avoid redundant learning. The blocking effect represents
   this sort of efficiency mechanism and refers to the phenomenon in which
   a novel stimulus is blocked from learning when it is associated with a
   fully predicted outcome. Although there is sufficient evidence that this
   effect manifests itself when individuals learn about their own rewards,
   it remains unclear whether it also does when they learn about others'
   rewards. We employed behavioral and neuroimaging methods to address this
   question. We demonstrate that blocking does indeed occur in the social
   domain and it does so to a similar degree as observed in the individual
   domain. On the neural level, activations in the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) show a specific contribution to blocking and learning-related
   prediction errors in the social domain. These findings suggest that the
   efficiency principle that applies to reward learning in the individual
   domain also applies to that in the social domain, with the mPFC playing
   a central role in implementing it.}},

Abstract = {{Attentional control difficulties likely underlie rumination, a core
   cognitive vulnerability in major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Abnormalities in the default mode, executive and salience networks are
   implicated in both rumination and attentional control difficulties in
   MDD. In the current study, individuals with MDD (n = 16) and healthy
   controls (n = 16) completed tasks designed to elicit self-focused
   (ruminative) and externally-focused thinking during fMRI scanning. The
   MDD group showed greater default mode network connectivity and less
   executive and salience network connectivity during the external-focus
   condition. Contrary to our predictions, there were no differences in
   connectivity between the groups during the self-focus condition. Thus,
   it appears that when directed to engage in self-referential thinking,
   both depressed and non-depressed individuals similarly recruit networks
   supporting this process. In contrast, when instructed to engage in
   non-self-focused thought, non-depressed individuals show a pattern of
   network connectivity indicative of minimized self-referential
   processing, whereas depressed individuals fail to reallocate neural
   resources in a manner consistent with effective down regulation of
   self-focused thought. This is consistent with difficulties in regulating
   self-focused thinking in order to engage in more goal-directed behavior
   that is seen in individuals with MDD.}},

Abstract = {{Reward seeking is ubiquitous and adaptive in humans. But excessive
   reward seeking behavior, such as chasing monetary rewards, may lead to
   diminished subjective well-being. This study examined whether
   individuals trained in mindfulness meditation show neural evidence of
   lower susceptibility to monetary rewards. Seventy-eight participants (34
   meditators, 44 matched controls) completed the monetary incentive delay
   task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The groups
   performed equally on the task, but meditators showed lower neural
   activations in the caudate nucleus during reward anticipation, and
   elevated bilateral posterior insula activation during reward
   anticipation. Meditators also evidenced reduced activations in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex during reward receipt compared with
   controls. Connectivity parameters between the right caudate and
   bilateral anterior insula were attenuated in meditators during incentive
   anticipation. In summary, brain regions involved in reward
   processing-both during reward anticipation and receipt of
   reward-responded differently in mindfulness meditators than in
   nonmeditators, indicating that the former are less susceptible to
   monetary incentives.}},

Abstract = {{Reward comparison in the brain is thought to be achieved through the use
   of a `common currency', implying that reward value representations are
   computed on a unique scale in the same brain regions regardless of the
   reward type. Although such a mechanism has been identified in the
   ventro-medial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum in the context of
   decision-making, it is less clear whether it similarly applies to
   non-choice situations. To answer this question, we scanned 38
   participants with fMRI while they were presented with single cues
   predicting either monetary or erotic rewards, without the need to make a
   decision. The ventral striatum was the main brain structure to respond
   to both cues while showing increasing activity with increasing expected
   reward intensity. Most importantly, the relative response of the
   striatum to monetary vs erotic cues was correlated with the relative
   motivational value of these rewards as inferred from reaction times.
   Similar correlations were observed in a fronto-parietal network known to
   be involved in attentional focus and motor readiness. Together, our
   results suggest that striatal reward value signals not only obey to a
   common currency mechanism in the absence of choice but may also serve as
   an input to adjust motivated behaviour accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{Early life experience differentially shapes later stress reactivity, as
   evidenced by both animal and human studies. However, early
   experience-related changes in the function of central visceral neural
   circuits that control stress responses have not been well characterized,
   particularly in humans. The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
   (PVN), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), amygdala (Amyg) and
   subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) form a core visceral
   stress-responsive circuit. The goal of this study is to examine how
   childhood emotional and physical abuse relates to adulthood
   stressor-evoked activity within these visceral brain regions. To evoke
   acute states of mental stress, participants (n = 155) performed
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-adapted versions of the
   multi-source interference task (MSIT) and the Stroop task with
   simultaneous monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate.
   Regression analyses revealed that childhood physical abuse correlated
   positively with stressor-evoked changes in MAP, and negatively with
   unbiased, a priori extractions of fMRI blood-oxygen level-dependent
   signal change values within the sgACC, BNST, PVN and Amyg (n = 138).
   Abuse-related changes in the function of visceral neural circuits may
   reflect neurobiological vulnerability to adverse health outcomes
   conferred by early adversity.}},

Abstract = {{The neural and cognitive mechanisms by which primed constructs can
   impact on social behavior are poorly understood. In the present study,
   we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how
   scrambled sentence priming can impact on mimicry behavior. Sentences
   involving pro/antisocial events from a first/third-person point of view
   were presented in short blocks, followed by a reaction-time assessment
   of mimicry. Behavioral results showed that both prosociality and
   viewpoint impact on mimicry, and fMRI analysis showed this effect is
   implemented by anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC). We suggest
   that social primes may subtly modulate processing in amPFC in a manner
   linked to the later behavior, and that this same region also implements
   the top-down control of mimicry responses. This priming may be linked to
   processing of self-schemas in amPFC. Our findings demonstrate how social
   priming can be studied with fMRI, and have important implications for
   our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of prime-to-behavior
   effects as well as for current theories in social psychology.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Well-being and subjective experience of a coherent world depend on our
   sense of `self' and relations between the self and the environment (e.g.
   people, objects and ideas). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC)
   is involved in self-related processing, and disrupted vMPFC activity is
   associated with disruptions of emotional/social functioning (e.g.
   depression and autism). Clarifying precise function(s) of vMPFC in
   self-related processing is an area of active investigation. In this
   study, we sought to more specifically characterize the function of vMPFC
   in self-related processing, focusing on two alternative accounts: (i)
   assignment of positive subjective value to self-related information and
   (ii) assignment of personal significance to self-related information.
   During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants
   imagined owning objects associated with either their perceived ingroup
   or outgroup. We found that for ingroup-associated objects, vMPFC showed
   greater activity for objects with increased than decreased
   post-ownership preference. In contrast, for outgroup-associated objects,
   vMPFC showed greater activity for objects with decreased than increased
   post-ownership preference. Our findings support the idea that the
   function of vMPFC in self-related processing may not be to
   represent/evaluate the `positivity' or absolute preference of
   self-related information but to assign personal significance to it based
   on its meaning/function for the self.}},

Abstract = {{Animal studies reveal that the amygdala promotes attention and emotional
   memory, in part, by driving activity in downstream target regions
   including the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Prior work has
   demonstrated that the amygdala influences these regions directly through
   monosynaptic glutamatergic signaling, and indirectly by driving activity
   of the cholinergic basal forebrain and subsequent downstream
   acetylcholine release. Yet to date, no work has addressed the functional
   relevance of the cholinergic basal forebrain in facilitating signaling
   from the amygdala in humans. We set out to determine how blood oxygen
   level-dependent signal within the amygdala and cholinergic basal
   forebrain interact to predict neural responses within downstream
   targets. Here, we use functional connectivity analyses to demonstrate
   that the cholinergic basal forebrain moderates increased amygdala
   connectivity with both the PFC and the hippocampus during the processing
   of biologically salient stimuli in humans. We further demonstrate that
   functional variation within the choline transporter gene predicts the
   magnitude of this modulatory effect. Collectively, our results provide
   novel evidence for the importance of cholinergic signaling in modulating
   neural pathways supporting arousal, attention and memory in humans.
   Further, our results may shed light on prior association studies linking
   functional variation within the choline transporter gene and diagnoses
   of major depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{508-516}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Inhibiting impulsive reactions while still defending one's vital
   resources is paramount to functional self-control and successful
   development in a social environment. However, this ability of
   successfully inhibiting, and thus controlling one's impulsivity, often
   fails, leading to consequences ranging from motor impulsivity to
   aggressive reactions following provocation. Although inhibitory failure
   represents the underlying mechanism, the neurocognition of social
   aggression and motor response inhibition have traditionally been
   investigated in separation. Here, we aimed to directly investigate and
   compare the neural mechanisms underlying the failure of inhibition
   across those different modalities of self-control. We used functional
   imaging to reveal the overlap in neural correlates between failed motor
   response inhibition (measured by a go/no-go task) and reactive
   aggression (measured by the Taylor aggression paradigm) in healthy
   males. The core overlap of neural correlates was located in the anterior
   insula, suggesting common anterior insula involvement in motor
   impulsivity as well as reactive aggression. This evidence regarding an
   overarching role of the anterior insula across different modalities of
   self-control enables an integrative perspective on insula function and a
   better integration of cognitive, social and emotional factors into a
   comprehensive model of impulsivity. Furthermore, it can eventually lead
   to a better understanding of clinical syndromes involving inhibitory
   deficits.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Social rejection elicits distress through the brain's alarm system, the
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The distress of rejection
   facilitates subsequent inclusion. As a result, traits that blunt this
   dACC response to social rejection might then threaten group membership,
   leading to further subsequent rejection. Alexithymia, the inability to
   identify and describe affective states, is associated with social
   impairment and reduced dACC activity under conditions of negative
   affect. Thus, we expected that alexithymia would relate to less dACC
   activation during rejection and that this blunted response would explain
   an association between alexithymia and greater rejection in everyday
   life. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and daily diaries, we
   found that subclinical individual differences in the core feature of
   alexithymia, difficulty identifying affect, was associated with a
   blunted dACC response to social rejection. Deficits in affect
   identification were also associated with greater daily rejection and
   that this effect was mediated and suppressed by dACC activation to
   rejection. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of the dACC in
   response to social rejection and extend the literature on alexithymia's
   ability to dampen neural responses and contribute to poor social
   functioning. The suppressing role of the dACC suggests future directions
   for clinical interventions on those with affective disorders.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The opinion of mind-body interaction has been increasingly acknowledged
   in recent years, as exemplified by accumulating evidence indicating that
   physical health (body) is associated with emotion and emotion regulation
   (mind). Yet, the neural basis linking emotion regulation with physical
   health remains largely uninvestigated. Here we used magnetic resonance
   imaging to investigate the neural basis of this pathway in a large
   population of healthy young adults. With a systematic study revealing
   the association of self-reported physical health and emotion traits of
   personality and general affective experiences, we further demonstrated
   that, for better physical health, individuals needed to regulate their
   emotion more effectively. Importantly, individuals who had larger gray
   matter (GM) volume in the amygdala reported not only a higher ability of
   emotion regulation but also better physical health. Further, GM volume
   in the amygdala mediated the correlation between emotion regulation
   ability and physical health. Our findings suggest that the amygdala
   plays a critical role in the neural circuit through which emotion
   regulation may influence physical health. Therefore, our study takes the
   first step toward exploring the neuroanatomical basis for body-mind
   interaction and may inform interventions aimed at promoting physical
   health by augmenting skills of emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{According to a widely held view, basic emotions such as happiness or
   anger are reflected in facial expressions that are invariant and
   uniquely defined by specific facial muscle movements. Accordingly,
   expression perception should not be vulnerable to influences outside the
   face. Here, we test this assumption by manipulating the emotional
   valence of biographical knowledge associated with individual persons.
   Faces of well-known and initially unfamiliar persons displaying neutral
   expressions were associated with socially relevant negative, positive or
   comparatively neutral biographical information. The expressions of faces
   associated with negative information were classified as more negative
   than faces associated with neutral information. Event-related brain
   potential modulations in the early posterior negativity, a component
   taken to reflect early sensory processing of affective stimuli such as
   emotional facial expressions, suggest that negative affective knowledge
   can bias the perception of faces with neutral expressions toward
   subjectively displaying negative emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Social referencing paradigms in humans and observational learning
   paradigms in animals suggest that emotional expressions are important
   for communicating valence. It has been proposed that these expressions
   initiate stimulus-reinforcement learning. Relatively little is known
   about the role of emotional expressions in reinforcement learning,
   particularly in the context of social referencing. In this study, we
   examined object valence learning in the context of a social referencing
   paradigm. Participants viewed objects and faces that turned toward the
   objects and displayed a fearful, happy or neutral reaction to them,
   while judging the gender of these faces. Notably, amygdala activation
   was larger when the expressions following an object were less expected.
   Moreover, when asked, participants were both more likely to want to
   approach, and showed stronger amygdala responses to, objects associated
   with happy relative to objects associated with fearful expressions. This
   suggests that the amygdala plays two roles in social referencing: (i)
   initiating learning regarding the valence of an object as a function of
   prediction errors to expressions displayed toward this object and (ii)
   orchestrating an emotional response to the object when value judgments

Abstract = {{Humans are biased toward social interaction. Behaviorally, this bias is
   evident in the rapid effects that self-relevant communicative signals
   have on attention and perceptual systems. The processing of
   communicative cues recruits a wide network of brain regions, including
   mentalizing systems. Relatively less work, however, has examined the
   timing of the processing of self-relevant communicative cues. In the
   present study, we used multivariate pattern analysis (decoding) approach
   to the analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the processing
   dynamics of social-communicative actions. Twenty-four participants
   viewed images of a woman performing actions that varied on a continuum
   of communicative factors including self-relevance (to the participant)
   and emotional valence, while their brain activity was recorded using
   MEG. Controlling for low-level visual factors, we found early
   discrimination of emotional valence (70 ms) and self-relevant
   communicative signals (100 ms). These data offer neural support for the
   robust and rapid effects of self-relevant communicative cues on
   behavior.}},

Title = {{Distinctive and common neural underpinnings of major depression, social

Abstract = {{Assessing neural commonalities and differences among depression, anxiety
   and their comorbidity is critical in developing a more integrative
   clinical neuroscience and in evaluating currently debated categorical vs
   dimensional approaches to psychiatric classification. Therefore, in this
   study, we sought to identify patterns of anomalous neural responding to
   criticism and praise that are specific to and common among major
   depressive disorder (MDD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and comorbid
   MDD-SAD. Adult females who met formal diagnostic criteria for MDD, SAD
   or MDD-SAD and psychiatrically healthy participants underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging as they listened to statements directing
   praise or criticism at them or at another person. MDD groups showed
   reduced responding to praise across a distributed cortical network, an
   effect potentially mediated by thalamic nuclei undergirding
   arousal-mediated attention. SAD groups showed heightened anterior insula
   and decreased default-mode network response to criticism. The MDD-SAD
   group uniquely showed reduced responding to praise in the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, all groups with psychopathology
   showed heightened response to criticism in a region of the superior
   frontal gyrus implicated in attentional gating. The present results
   suggest novel neural models of anhedonia in MDD, vigilance-withdrawal
   behaviors in SAD, and poorer outcome in MDD-SAD. Importantly, in
   identifying unique and common neural substrates of MDD and SAD, these
   results support a formulation in which common neural components
   represent general risk factors for psychopathology that, due to factors
   that are present at illness onset, lead to distinct forms of
   psychopathology with unique neural signatures.}},

Abstract = {{Brain reward systems mediate liking and wanting for food reward. Here,
   we explore the differential involvement of the following structures for
   these two components: the ventral and dorsal striatopallidal area,
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior insula and anterior cingulate.
   Twelve healthy female participants were asked to rate pleasantness
   (liking of food and non-food odors) and the desire to eat (wanting of
   odor-evoked food) during event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). The subjective ratings and fMRI were performed in hunger
   and satiety states. Activations of regions of interest were compared as
   a function of task (liking vs wanting), odor category (food vs non-food)
   and metabolic state (hunger vs satiety). We found that the nucleus
   accumbens and ventral pallidum were differentially involved in liking or
   wanting during the hunger state, which suggests a reciprocal inhibitory
   influence between these structures. Neural activation of OFC subregions
   was correlated with either liking or wanting ratings, suggesting an OFC
   role in reward processing magnitude. Finally, during the hunger state,
   participants with a high body mass index exhibited less activation in
   neural structures underlying food reward processing. Our results suggest
   that food liking and wanting are two separable psychological constructs
   and may be functionally segregated within the cortico-striatopallidal
   circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Humans often evaluate their abilities by comparing their personal
   performance with that of others. For this process, it is critical
   whether the comparison turns out in one's favor or against it. Here, we
   investigate how social comparisons of performance are encoded and
   integrated on the neural level. We collected functional magnetic
   resonance images while subjects answered questions in a knowledge quiz
   that was related to their profession. After each question, subjects
   received a feedback about their personal performance, followed by a
   feedback about the performance of a reference group who had been quizzed
   beforehand. Based on the subjects' personal performance, we divided
   trials in downward and upward comparisons. We found that upward
   comparisons correlated with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex and the anterior insula. Downward comparisons were associated
   with increased activation in the ventral striatum (VS), the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
   The extent to which subjects outperformed the reference group modulated
   the activity in the VS and in the dorsal ACC. We suggest that the
   co-activation of the VS and the dorsal ACC contributes to the
   integration of downward comparisons into the evaluation of personal
   performance.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Threatening stimuli have been shown to preferentially capture attention
   using a range of tasks and measures. However, attentional bias to threat
   has not typically been found in unselected individuals using behavioral
   measures in the dot-probe task, one of the most common ways of examining
   attention to threat. The present study leveraged event-related
   potentials (ERPs) in conjunction with behavioral measures in the
   dot-probe task to examine whether more direct measures of attention
   might reveal an attentional bias to threat in unselected individuals. As
   in previous dot-probe studies, we found no evidence of an attentional
   bias to threat using reaction time; additionally, this measure exhibited
   poor internal reliability. In contrast, ERPs revealed an initial shift
   of attention to threat-related stimuli, reflected by the N2pc, which
   showed moderate internal reliability. However, there was no evidence of
   sustained engagement with the threat-related stimuli, as measured by the
   late positive potential (LPP). Together, these results demonstrate that
   unselected individuals do initially allocate attention to threat in the
   dot-probe task, and further, that this bias is better characterized by
   neural measures of attention than traditional behavioral measures. These
   results have implications for the study of attention to threat in both
   unselected and anxious populations.}},

Abstract = {{Informational cascades can occur when rationally acting individuals
   decide independently of their private information and follow the
   decisions of preceding decision-makers. In the process of updating
   beliefs, differences in the weighting of private and publicly available
   social information may modulate the probability that a cascade starts in
   a decisive way. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   examined neural activity while participants updated their beliefs based
   on the decisions of two fictitious stock market traders and their own
   private information, which led to a final decision of buying one of two
   stocks. Computational modeling of the behavioral data showed that a
   majority of participants overweighted private information. Overweighting
   was negatively correlated with the probability of starting an
   informational cascade in trials especially prone to conformity. Belief
   updating by private information was related to activity in the inferior
   frontal gyrus/anterior insula, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
   the parietal cortex; the more a participant overweighted private
   information, the higher the activity in the inferior frontal
   gyrus/anterior insula and the lower in the parietal-temporal cortex.
   This study explores the neural correlates of overweighting of private
   information, which underlies the tendency to start an informational
   cascade.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the attention modulation of disgust in
   comparison with anger in a dot-probe task. Results indicated a two-stage
   processing of attention modulation by threats. When participants viewed
   the cues that were represented by Chinese faces (i.e. the in-group
   condition), it was found at the early processing stage that an angry
   face elicited a larger occipital P1 component whereas a disgusted face
   elicited a smaller P1 for validly than for invalidly cued targets.
   However, the result pattern was reversed at the later processing stage:
   the P3 amplitudes were larger for valid disgust cues but were smaller
   for valid angry cues, when both were compared with invalid cue
   conditions. In addition, when participants viewed the cues that were
   represented by foreign faces (i.e. the out-group condition), the
   attention modulation of disgust/anger diminished at the early stage,
   whereas enhanced P3 amplitudes were observed in response to validly cued
   targets in both disgusting and angry conditions at the later stage. The
   current result implied that although people can perceptually
   differentiate the emotional categories of out-group faces as accurately
   as in-group faces, they may still be not able to psychologically
   understand the subtle differences behind different categories of
   out-group facial expressions.}},

Abstract = {{The neural correlates of anxious anticipation have been primarily
   studied with aversive and neutral stimuli. In this study, we examined
   the effect of valence on anticipation by using high arousal aversive and
   positive stimuli and a condition of uncertainty (i.e. either positive or
   aversive). The task consisted of predetermined cues warning participants
   of upcoming aversive, positive, `uncertain' (either aversive or
   positive) and neutral movie clips. Anticipation of all affective clips
   engaged common regions including the anterior insula, dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex, thalamus, caudate, inferior parietal and prefrontal
   cortex that are associated with emotional experience, sustained
   attention and appraisal. In contrast, the nucleus accumbens and medial
   prefrontal cortex, regions implicated in reward processing, were
   selectively engaged during anticipation of positive clips (depicting
   sexually explicit content) and the mid-insula, which has been linked to
   processing aversive stimuli, was selectively engaged during anticipation
   of aversive clips (depicting graphic medical procedures); these three
   areas were also activated during anticipation of `uncertain' clips
   reflecting a broad preparatory response for both aversive and positive
   stimuli. These results suggest that a common circuitry is recruited in
   anticipation of affective clips regardless of valence, with additional
   areas preferentially engaged depending on whether expected stimuli are
   negative or positive.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies on HIV risk perception suggest that people rely on

   the HIV risk for each presented person. Contrasting responses for high
   and low HIV risk revealed that risky stimuli evoked enhanced activity in
   the anterior insula and medial prefrontal regions, which are involved in
   salience processing and frequently activated by threatening and negative
   affect-related stimuli. Importantly, neural regions responding to
   explicit HIV risk judgments were also enhanced in the implicit

Abstract = {{Function of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is critical to 2
   aspects of attention in associative learning: the conditioning of
   orienting responses (ORs) to cues paired with food, and the enhancement
   of cue salience by the surprising omission of expected events. Such
   salience enhancements have been found to depend on interactions within a
   circuit that includes CeA, the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the
   substantia innominata (SI), and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). The
   acquisition and expression of conditioned ORs requires interactions
   among CeA, SNc, and the dorsal lateral striatum (DLS), but not SI or
   PPC. Here, we considered whether CeA-DLS interactions are also important
   in surprise-induced salience enhancements in a serial prediction task.
   Rats received unilateral lesions of CeA and DLS, either contralaterally,
   which disrupted interactions between those structures, or ipsilaterally,
   which produced comparable damage to each structure but permitted
   interactions between them in 1 hemisphere. Rats with ipsilateral lesions
   of CeA and DLS showed the salience enhancements normally observed in
   this task, but rats with contralateral lesions of those structures did
   not. Thus, convergence of information processing by CeA and DLS is
   essential for surprise-induced salience enhancements, as well as for
   conditioned ORs.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to the primary disease-defining symptoms, approximately half
   of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from postural
   instability, impairments in gait control and a propensity for falls.
   Consistent with evidence from patients, we previously demonstrated that
   combined striatal dopamine (DA) and basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic
   cell loss causes falls in rats traversing dynamic surfaces. Because
   evidence suggests that degeneration of brainstem cholinergic neurons
   arising from the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) also contributes to
   impaired gait and falls, here we assessed the effects of selective
   cholinergic PPN lesions in combination with striatal DA loss or BF
   cholinergic cells loss as well as losses in all 3 regions. Results
   indicate that all combination losses that included the BF cholinergic
   system slowed traversal and increased slips and falls. However, the
   performance of rats with losses in all 3 regions (PPN, BF, and DA) was
   not more severely impaired than following combined BF cholinergic and
   striatal DA lesions. These results confirm the hypothesis that BF
   cholinergic-striatal disruption of attentional-motor interactions is a
   primary source of falls. Additional losses of PPN cholinergic neurons
   may worsen posture and gait control in situations not captured by the
   current testing conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to attend to appropriate stimuli, to plan actions and then
   alter those actions when environmental conditions change, is essential
   for an organism to thrive. There is increasing evidence that these
   executive control processes are mediated in part by N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptors ( NMDAR). NMDAR subunits confer different physiological
   properties to the receptor, interact with distinct intracellular
   postsynaptic scaffolding and signaling molecules and are differentially
   expressed during development. Recent findings have suggested that the
   GluN2B subunit may play a unique role in both the acquisition of
   adaptive choice and the behavioral flexibility required to shift between
   choices. Here we investigated the role of GluN2B containing NMDARs in
   the ability to learn, reverse and shift between stimulus dimensions.
   Mutant mice (floxed-GluN2B x CaMKII-Cre) lacking GluN2B in the dorsal
   CA1 of the hippocampus and throughout the cortex were tested on an
   attentional set-shifting task. To explore the role that alterations in
   motor behavior may have on these behaviors, gross and fine motor
   behaviors were analyzed in mutant and floxed-control mice. Results show
   that corticohippocampal loss of GluN2B selectively impaired an initial
   reversal in a stimulus specific manner and impaired the ability of
   mutant mice to form an attentional set. Further, GluN2B mice showed
   normal motor behavior in both overall movement and individual limb
   behaviors. Together, these results further support the role of NMDAR,
   and GluN2B in particular, in aspects of executive control including
   behavioral flexibility and attentional processes.}},

Abstract = {{Head Direction (HD) cells of the rodent Papez circuit are thought to
   reflect the spatial orientation of the animal. Because NMDA transmission
   is important for spatial behavior, we sought to determine the effects of
   NMDA blockade on the basic directional signal carried by HD cells and on
   experience-dependent modification of this system. In Experiment 1, HD
   cells were recorded from the anterior dorsal thalamus in female
   Long-Evans rats while they foraged in a familiar enclosure following
   administration of the NMDA antagonist CPP or saline. While the drug
   produced a significant decrease in peak firing rates, it failed to
   affect the overall directional specificity and landmark control of HD
   cells. Experiment 2 took place over 2 days and assessed whether the NMDA
   antagonist would interfere with the stabilization of the HD network in a
   novel environment. On Day 1 the animal was administered CPP or saline
   and placed in a novel enclosure to allow the stabilization of the HD
   signal relative to the new environmental landmarks. On Day 2 the animal
   was returned to the formerly novel enclosure to determine if the
   enclosure specific direction-dependent activity established on Day 1 was
   maintained. In contrast to HD cells from control animals, cells from
   animals receiving CPP during the initial exposure to the novel enclosure
   did not maintain the same direction-dependent activity relative to the
   enclosure in the subsequent drug-free exposure. These findings
   demonstrate that plasticity in the HD system is dependent on NMDA
   transmission similar to many other forms of spatial learning.}},

Abstract = {{Search strategies in the Morris water maze provide useful insights on
   cognitive function that may reveal genotype differences not reflected by
   escape latency or distance. Its analysis is pointed out as a
   complementary tool to better define the phenotype and the effect of
   treatments in animal models in which both cognitive impairment and
   behavioral symptoms reproduce the clinical complexity of the Alzheimer's
   disease patient. Here, we studied the performance of 13-month-old male
   3xTg-AD mice in 3 different paradigms (cue learning, place task, and
   probe trial) and as compared with age-matched nontransgenic mice. The
   quantitative analysis (escape latency, distance, and speed) showed that
   in all tasks, the cognitive performance of 3xTg-AD mice was interfered
   with by a persistent hyperactive pattern. Their worse cognitive function
   was revealed by the qualitative features of nonsearch behaviors
   (floating and circling) and search strategies (single and /mixed, goal
   directed and nongoal directed). The search pattern was based on mixed
   and nongoal-directed strategies, in contrast to the single and
   goal-directed strategies used by controls. In the place task, poor
   cognitive flexibility of 3xTg-AD mice was also shown in persistence of
   search in the cue-trained position and the need to correct the strategy
   to find the new location. Trials involving a naive situation (first
   trial of the cue task) or the difficulty of a new task (first trial of
   the place task and the probe trial) were the most suitable to show the
   deficits. This qualitative analysis may also be useful in the assessment
   of preventive or therapeutical treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of the effects of aging on decision making suggest that choices
   can be altered in a variety of ways depending on the situation, the
   nature of the outcome and risk, or certainty levels. To better
   characterize how aging impacts decision making in rodents, young and
   aged Fischer 344 rats underwent a series of probabilistic discounting
   tasks in which reward magnitude and probabilities were manipulated.
   Young rats tended to choose 1 of 2 different strategies: (a) to press
   for the large/uncertain reward, regardless of the reward probability; or
   (b) to continually adapt their behavior according to the odds of
   winning. The first strategy was adopted by about half of the younger
   rats, the second by the remaining young animals and the entire group of
   aged rats. Additionally, we found that when the odds of winning were
   varied from uncertain to certain during a session, aged rats chose most
   often the lever associated with the small/certain reward. This is
   consistent with an interpretation of increased risk aversion. When this
   behavior was further characterized using a lose-shift analysis, it
   appears that older rats exhibited an increased sensitivity to negative
   feedback. In contrast, sensitivity to wins was unaltered in aged rats
   compared with young, suggesting that aging selectively impacts rat's
   behavior following losses. In line with some human aging studies, it
   appears that aged rats are either more risk averse or have a greater
   certainty bias, which may result from age differences in emotion
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{The consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained during late
   adolescence (7 weeks old) on spontaneous object recognition memory and
   on anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze were tested in rats
   during adulthood. Testing took place at 2 different postinjury times, in
   separate groups: 3 and 6 weeks, when animals were 10 and 13 weeks old,
   respectively. The rats were either submitted to controlled cortical
   impact injury, an experimental model of focal TBI with contusion, or
   were sham-operated. TBI animals failed to remember the familiar object
   and had a significantly lower performance than sham-operated animals,
   indicating memory disruption, when the retention delay was 24 hr, but
   not when it was 3 hr. TBI did not have any significant effect on the
   main anxiety-related behaviors, but it reduced time in the central
   platform of the elevated plus maze. The effects of TBI on memory and on
   anxiety-like behaviors were similar at the 2 postinjury times. In both
   TBI and sham-operated groups, animals tested 6 weeks after surgery had
   lower anxiety-related indices than those tested at 3 weeks, an effect
   that might be indicative of reduced anxiety levels with increasing age.
   In summary, focal TBI with contusion sustained during late adolescence
   led to object recognition memory deficits in a 24-hr test during
   adulthood but did not have a major impact on anxiety-like behaviors.
   Memory deficits persisted for at least 6 weeks after injury, indicating
   that spontaneous modifications of these functional disturbances did not
   take place along this time span.}},

Title = {{Inhibition of Motor-Related Activation During a Simple Reaction Time
   Task Requiring Visuomotor Mental Rotation}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{129}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated whether differences in reaction time (RT)
   between movements initiated to a visual cue (directly cued) versus
   movements initiated to a location other than the visual cue (indirectly
   cued) arise because of varying levels of inhibition within the motor
   system during response preparation. Unlike typical visuomotor mental
   rotation (VMR) experiments, this study employed a simple RT paradigm to
   allow response preparation to occur in advance of the imperative
   stimulus (IS). Participants responded to the IS by either moving
   directly to the location of a visual cue or to a location that required
   a mental transformation between the visual cue and the intended movement
   goal (i.e., a location 60, 90, or 120 degrees rotated with respect to
   the visual cue). To probe motor-related activation during response
   preparation, a startling acoustic stimulus (SAS, 124 dB) was randomly
   presented 500 ms, 1,000 ms, or 1,500 ms after visual cue onset, but
   before the IS. Results showed similar RTs during nonstartle control
   trials regardless of rotation angle and whether trials were completed in
   a random or blocked design. Additionally, SAS trials showed a low
   incidence of early response triggering across all time points regardless
   of whether the movement was directly or indirectly cued. In contrast,
   directly cued movements performed outside of the VMR context showed a
   high incidence of SAS response triggering. These results suggest that
   when a stimulus to target-goal transformation might be required,
   inhibitory suppression of motor-related activation arises regardless of
   whether the final movement is directly or indirectly cued.}},

Abstract = {{Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is a widely used animal model for
   identifying the biological basis of excessive exercise and starvation, 2
   hallmarks of anorexia nervosa (AN). Anxiety is correlated with exercise
   in AN. Yet the anxiety level of animals in ABA has not been reported. We
   asked: Does food restriction as part of ABA induction change the anxiety
   level of animals? If so, is the degree of anxiety correlated with degree
   of hyperactivity? We used the open field test before food restriction
   and the elevated plus maze test (EPM) during food restriction to
   quantify anxiety among singly housed adolescent female mice and
   determined whether food restriction alone or combined with exercise
   (i.e., ABA induction) abates or increases anxiety. We show that food
   restriction, with or without exercise, reduced anxiety significantly, as
   measured by the proportion of entries into the open arms of EPM
   (35.73\%, p = .04). Moreover, ABA-induced individuals varied in their
   open arm time measure of anxiety and this value was highly and
   negatively correlated to the individual's food restriction-evoked wheel
   activity during the 24 hr following the anxiety test (R = -.75, p =
   .004, N = 12). This correlation was absent among the exercise-only
   controls. In addition, mice with higher increase in anxiety ran more
   following food restriction. Our data suggest that food
   restriction-evoked wheel running hyperactivity can be used as a reliable
   and continuous measure of anxiety in ABA. The parallel relationship
   between anxiety level and activity in AN and ABA-induced female mice
   strengthens the animal model.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol-related aggression is a complex and problematic phenomenon with
   profound public health consequences. We examined neural correlates
   potentially moderating the relationship between human aggressive
   behavior and chronic alcohol use. Thirteen subjects meeting DSM-IV
   criteria for past alcohol-dependence in remission (AD) and 13 matched
   healthy controls (CONT) participated in an fMRI study adapted from a
   laboratory model of human aggressive behavior (Point Subtraction
   Aggression Paradigm, or PSAP). Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
   activation was measured during bouts of operationally defined aggressive
   behavior, during postprovocation periods, and during monetary-reinforced
   behavior. Whole brain voxelwise random-effects analyses found group
   differences in brain regions relevant to chronic alcohol use and
   aggressive behavior (e.g., emotional and behavioral control).
   Behaviorally, AD subjects responded on both the aggressive response and
   monetary response options at significantly higher rates than CONT. Whole
   brain voxelwise random-effects analyses revealed significant group
   differences in response to provocation (monetary subtractions), with
   CONT subjects showing greater activation in frontal and prefrontal
   cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. Collapsing data across all subjects,
   regression analyses of postprovocation brain activation on aggressive
   response rate revealed significant positive regression slopes in
   precentral gyrus and parietal cortex; and significant negative
   regression slopes in orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, caudate,
   thalamus, and middle temporal gyrus. In these collapsed analyses,
   response to provocation and aggressive behavior were associated with
   activation in brain regions subserving inhibitory and emotional control,
   sensorimotor integration, and goal directed motor activity.}},

Abstract = {{In pubertal male Syrian hamsters, exposure to anabolic/androgenic
   steroids (AAS) during adolescence facilitates a high level of offensive
   aggression modulated by the enhanced development and activity of the
   vasopressin (AVP) and dopamine (DA) neural systems within the
   latero-anterior hypothalamus (LAH), that is, a brain region implicated
   in the control of aggression. The present studies provide a detailed
   report of the pharmacologic interactions between AVP and DA D2 receptor
   signaling within the LAH in the control of adolescent AAS-induced
   offensive aggression. Male Syrian hamsters were treated with AAS
   throughout adolescence and tested for aggression after local infusion of
   the DA D2 receptor antagonist eticlopride (ETIC) alone, or in
   combination with AVP in the LAH in an effort to determine the influence
   of DA D2 receptors relative to AVP-receptor mediated aggression
   mechanisms. As previously shown, ETIC infusion into the LAH suppressed
   adolescent AAS-induced aggressive responding; however, the AAS-induced
   aggressive phenotype was rescued by the coinfusion of AVP into the LAH.
   These behavioral data indicate that interactions between AVP and DA
   neural systems within the LAH modulate the control of aggression
   following adolescent exposure to AAS and that DA D2 receptor signaling
   functions upstream of AVP in the LAH to control this behavioral
   response.}},

Abstract = {{The winner effect is an accumulation of previous wins that increase
   future winning. A primary unanswered question about the winner effect is
   how do individuals integrate information about previous wins? Dopamine
   (DA) has been implicated because phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase
   (pTH), the rate-limiting enzyme for DA biosynthesis, is elevated
   following multiple winning experiences. Moreover, DA receptor blockers
   and agonists influence aggression when administered prior to male-male
   contests. In the current study, we administered D1- and D2-like DA
   receptor antagonists immediately after a contest and examined the
   development of the winner effect in the territorial California mouse,
   Peromyscus californicus. During a 3-contest training phase, resident
   males experienced winning contests, followed immediately by a peripheral
   injection of either a DA receptor antagonist or vehicle or a handling
   experience (without injection). The DA receptor antagonists used in this
   study did not influence locomotion. To assess the cumulative effects of
   previous winning, males were subjected to a final test contest with a
   more competitive intruder. The winner effect was significantly decreased
   by both D1- and D2-like receptor antagonists administered during
   training. During the test contest, attack behavior was significantly
   reduced by previous administration of both types of DA receptor
   antagonists compared with controls. D1-like receptor blockade also
   diminished chasing behavior, whereas D2-antagonist treated animals
   continued to pursue opponents. During training against a less
   competitive intruder, there was no difference in aggressive behaviors
   between experimental and controls males. Our data indicate that DA
   activity between contests is concomitant with the competitive advantage
   gained from multiple winning experiences.}},

Title = {{Side of Basal Ganglia Degeneration Influences Freezing of Gait in

Abstract = {{Although the role of hemispheric laterality in freezing of gait (FOG)
   remains a topic of debate, important new evidence has suggested that
   individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) who experience freezing of
   gait (PD-FOG) may have decreased activity in the circuitry of the right
   fronto-parietal cortices, irrespective of the side of basal ganglia (BG)
   degeneration. Because the right hemisphere plays an important role in
   monitoring sensorimotor information during movements, and cortical
   regions interact with BG loops, one could expect that right cortical
   dysfunction in PD-FOG might be exacerbated by right sided BG damage
   (compared to left). The current study aimed to evaluate the influence of
   asymmetrical BG degeneration on self-paced gait in PD-FOG and PD-nonFOG.
   This study compared gait performance in predominantly left-or right-side
   affected PD patients with or without freezing of gait (LFOG = 11, RFOG =
   10, LPD = 15, RPD = 11). Participants were instructed to walk 10 m on a
   GaitRite (R) carpet. As expected, gait parameters in PD-FOG were worse
   compared to PD-nonFOG. The spatiotemporal aspects of gait did not differ
   between LPD and RPD (nonFOG patients). Contrary to our hypothesis, RFOG
   (predominantly right side symptoms) had a shorter step length, increased
   step time variability and tended to walk slower compared with LFOG.
   Thus, rather than severely impaired right hemisphere circuitries
   exacerbating gait impairments, worse gait may be a consequence of both
   hemispheres being affected in PD-FOG.}},

Abstract = {{Binge eating disorder is characterized by excessive consumption of
   highly palatable food within short periods of time accompanied by loss
   of control over eating. Extensive evidence provides support for the
   consideration of binge eating disorder as an addiction-like disorder. In
   this study, we wanted to determine whether rats undergoing an operant
   binge-like eating procedure could develop maladaptive forms of
   conditioned feeding behaviors. For this purpose, we trained male rats to
   self-administer either a sugary, highly palatable diet
   ({''}Palatable{''} rats) or a chow diet ({''}Chow{''} rats) for 1 hour a
   day. After escalation and stabilization of palatable food intake, we
   tested Chow and Palatable rats in (a) a conditioned place preference
   test, (b) a second-order schedule of reinforcement, (c) a cue-induced
   suppression of feeding test. In the conditioned place preference task,
   Palatable rats spent significantly more time in the compartment that was
   previously paired with the palatable food, compared to Chow controls.
   Furthermore, in the second-order schedule of reinforcement task,
   Palatable rats exhibited active lever responding 4- to 6-fold higher
   than Chow control rats. Finally, in the cue-induced suppression of
   feeding test, although Chow control subjects reduced responding by 32\%
   in the presence of the conditioned punishment, Palatable rats persevered
   in responding despite the aversive cue. These results further
   characterize this animal model of binge-like eating and provide
   additional evidence for the addictive properties of highly palatable
   food.}},

   actions of people elicited more intense positive emotions. However, the
   networks underlying the moral decisions about corporations and people
   are strikingly similar, including regions of the canonical theory of
   mind network. In analyzing the activity in these networks, we found
   differences in the emotional processing of these two types of vignettes:
   neutral actions of corporations showed neural correlates that more
   closely resembled negative actions than positive actions. Collectively,
   these findings indicate that our brains understand and analyze the

Abstract = {{We investigated whether greed would predict risky decision-making and
   recorded neural responses during a monetary gambling task using the
   electroencephalogram. We found that individuals high in trait-greed took
   higher risks to maximize monetary outcome. Furthermore, this relation
   was moderated by state-greed; specifically, trait-greed had a stronger
   impact on risky decision-making when activated by situational
   characteristics. On the neural level, greedy individuals showed a
   specific response to favorable and unfavorable outcomes. Specifically,
   they had a reduced feedback-related negativity-difference score to these
   events, indicating that they might have difficulty in learning from
   experience, especially from mistakes and negative feedback. It is
   concluded that greed may explain risky and reckless behavior in diverse
   settings, such as investment banking, and may account for phenomena such

Abstract = {{In the present research, we manipulated the perceived superior/inferior
   status during a competitive cognitive task. In two experiments, we
   created an explicit and strongly reinforced social hierarchy based on
   incidental rating on an attentional task. Based on our hypotheses,
   social rank may influence nonverbal cues (such as facial mimic related
   to emotional response), cortical lateralized activity in frontal areas
   (brain oscillations), and cognitive outcomes in response to rank
   modulation. Thus, the facial mimic (corrugators vs. zygomatic muscle
   activity), frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta), and real
   cognitive performance {[}(error rate (ER); response times (RTs)] were
   considered. Specifically, a peer-group comparison was enrolled and an
   improved (experiment 1, N=29) or decreased (experiment 2, N=31)
   performance was artificially manipulated by the experimenter. Results
   showed a significant improved cognitive performance (decreased ER and
   RTs), an increased zygomatic activity (positive emotions), and a more
   prefrontal left-lateralized cortical response in the case of a perceived
   increased social ranking. On the contrary, a significant decreased
   cognitive performance (increased ER and RTs), an increased corrugators
   activity (negative emotions), and a less left-lateralized cortical
   response were observed as a consequence of a perceived decreased social
   ranking. Moreover, the correlational values revealed a consistent trend
   between behavioral (RTs) and EMG and EEG measures for both experiments.
   The present results suggest that social status not only guides social
   behavior, but it also influences cognitive processes and subjects'
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Decision-making in social dilemmas is suggested to rely on three
   factors: the valuation of a choice option, the relative judgment of two
   or more choice alternatives, and individual factors affecting the ease
   at which judgments and decisions are made. Here, we test whether
   empathy-an individual's relative ability to understand others' thoughts,
   emotions, and intentions-acts as an individual factor that alleviates
   conflict resolution in social decision-making. We test this by using a
   framed, iterated prisoners' dilemma (PD) game in two settings. In a
   behavioral experiment, we find that individual differences in empathic
   ability (the Empathy Quotient, EQ) were related to lower response times
   in the PD game, suggesting that empathy is related to faster social
   choices, independent of whether they choose to cooperate or defect. In a
   subsequent neuroimaging experiment, using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we find that EQ is positively related to individual differences
   in the engagement of brain structures implemented in mentalizing,
   including the precuneus, superior temporal sulcus, and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that empathy is related to the
   individual difference in the engagement of mentalizing in social
   dilemmas and that this is related to the efficiency of decision-making
   in social dilemmas.}},

Abstract = {{In the dictator game, a proposer can share a certain amount of money
   between himself or herself and a receiver, who has no opportunity of
   influencing the offer. Rational choice theory predicts that dictators
   keep all money for themselves. But people often are offering money to
   receivers, despite their opportunity to maximize their own profit and
   therefore showing altruistic behavior. In this study, we investigated
   the influence of the altruism of the dictator, the anonymity of the
   decision and the income of the receiver on the offer made by a dictator.
   Additionally, we were interested in the influence of midfrontal theta
   activity prior to the offer, indicating the upcoming decision. The
   height of the offer made by the dictator was dependent on all variables
   investigated: Altruism of the dictator led to higher offers and income
   of the receiver led to higher offer the poorer the receivers are. The
   anonymity of the decision had two effects, depending on the altruism of
   the dictator, with higher offers for highly altruistic dictators, when
   they were not observed, and lower offers for less altruistic dictators
   in this condition. Finally, midfrontal theta activity predicts upcoming
   fair offers, maybe indicating altruistic motivation or empathy on
   physiological basis.}},

Abstract = {{Processes through which parental ideology is transmitted to
   children-especially at a young age prior to the formation of political
   beliefs-remain poorly understood. Given recent evidence that political
   ideology is associated with neural responses to cognitive conflict in
   adults, we tested the exploratory hypothesis that children's
   neurocognitive responses to conflict may also differ depending on their
   parents' ideology. We assessed relations between parental political
   ideology and children's neurocognitive responses to conflict, as
   measured by the N2 component of the event-related potential. Children
   aged 5-7 completed an age-appropriate flanker task while
   electroencephalography was recorded, and the N2 was scored to
   incongruent versus congruent flankers to index conflict processing.
   Because previous research documents heightened liberal-conservative
   differences in threat-relevant contexts, each trial of the task was
   preceded by an angry face (threat-relevant) or comparison face (happy or
   neutral). An effect of parental ideology on the conflict-related N2
   emerged in the threat condition, such that the N2 was larger among
   children of liberals compared with children of moderates and
   conservatives. These findings suggest that individual differences in
   neurocognitive responses to conflict, heightened in the context of
   threat, may reflect a more general pattern of individual differences
   that, in adults, relates to political ideology.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the degree of compassion-the feeling of
   warmth, understanding and kindness that motivates the desire to help
   others, is modulated by observers' views regarding the target's
   vulnerability and suffering. This study tested the hypothesis that as
   compassion developed to protect vulnerable kinships, hormones such as
   oxytocin, which have been suggested as playing a key role in
   `tend-and-befriend' behaviors among women, will enhance compassion
   toward women but not toward men. Thirty subjects participated in a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study. Following
   administration of oxytocin/placebo, participants listened to recordings
   of different female/male protagonists describing distressful emotional
   conflicts and were then asked to provide compassionate advice to the
   protagonist. The participants' responses were coded according to various
   components of compassion by two clinical psychologists who were blind to
   the treatment. The results showed that in women and men participants
   oxytocin enhanced compassion toward women, but did not affect compassion
   toward men. These findings indicate that the oxytocinergic system
   differentially mediates compassion toward women and toward men,
   emphasizing an evolutionary perspective that views compassion as a
   caregiving behavior designed to help vulnerable individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging studies have implicated the default mode network
   (DMN) in autobiographical memory (AM). Convergent evidence from a lesion
   approach would help clarify the role of the DMN in AM. In this study, we
   used a voxelwise lesion-deficit approach to test the hypothesis that
   regions of the DMN are necessary for AM. We also explored whether the
   neural correlates of semantic AM (SAM) and episodic AM (EAM) were
   overlapping or distinct. Using the Iowa Autobiographical Memory
   Questionnaire, we tested AM retrieval in 92 patients with focal, stable
   brain lesions. In support of our hypothesis, damage to regions within
   the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC; posterior cingulate cortex,
   PCC; inferior parietal lobule, IPL; medial temporal lobe, MTL) was
   associated with AM impairments. Within areas of effective lesion
   coverage, the neural correlates of SAM and EAM were largely distinct,
   with limited areas of overlap in right IPL. Whereas SAM deficits were
   associated with left mPFC and MTL damage, EAM deficits were associated
   with right mPFC and MTL damage. These results provide novel
   neuropsychological evidence for the necessary role of parts of the DMN
   in AM. More broadly, the findings shed new light on how the DMN
   participates in self-referential processing.}},

Abstract = {{Theory of mind (ToM)-or thinking about the mental states of others-is a
   cornerstone of successful everyday social interaction. However, the
   brain bases of ToM are most frequently measured via explicit laboratory
   tasks that pose direct questions about mental states (e.g. ``In this
   story, what does Steve think Julia believes?{''}). Neuroanatomical
   measures may provide a way to explore the brain bases of individual
   differences in more naturalistic everyday mentalizing. In the current
   study, we examined the relation between cortical thickness and
   spontaneous ToM using the novel Spontaneous Theory of Mind Protocol
   (STOMP), which measures participants' spontaneous descriptions of the
   beliefs, emotions and goals of characters in naturalistic videos. We
   administered standard ToM tasks and the STOMP to young adults (aged
   18-26 years) and collected structural magnetic resonance imaging data
   from a subset of these participants. The STOMP produced robust
   individual variability and was correlated with performance on
   traditional ToM tasks. Further, unlike the traditional ToM tasks, STOMP
   performance was related to cortical thickness for a set of brain regions
   that have been functionally linked to ToM processing. These findings
   offer novel insight into the brain bases of variability in naturalistic
   mentalizing performance, with implications for both typical and atypical
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Narcissism is a complex phenomenon, involving a level of defensive
   self-enhancement. Narcissists have avoidant attachment styles, maintain
   distance in relationships and claim not to need others. However, they
   are especially sensitive to others' evaluations, needing positive
   reflected appraisals to maintain their inflated self-views, and showing
   extreme responses (e.g. aggression) when rejected. The current study
   tested the hypothesis that narcissists also show hypersensitivity in
   brain systems associated with distress during exclusion. We measured
   individual differences in narcissism (Narcissistic Personality
   Inventory) and monitored neural responses to social exclusion
   (Cyberball). Narcissism was significantly associated with activity in an
   a priori anatomically defined social pain network (anterior insula,
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate
   cortex) during social exclusion. Results suggest hypersensitivity to
   exclusion in narcissists may be a function of hypersensitivity in brain
   systems associated with distress, and suggests a potential pathway that
   connects narcissism to negative consequences for longer-term physical
   and mental health-findings not apparent with self-report alone.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to form anticipatory representations of ongoing actions is
   crucial for effective interactions in dynamic environments. In sports,
   elite athletes exhibit greater ability than novices in predicting other
   players' actions, mainly based on reading their body kinematics. This
   superior perceptual ability has been associated with a modulation of
   visual and motor areas by visual and motor expertise. Here, we
   investigated the causative role of visual and motor action
   representations in experts' ability to predict the outcome of soccer
   actions. We asked expert soccer players (outfield players and
   goalkeepers) and novices to predict the direction of the ball after
   perceiving the initial phases of penalty kicks that contained or not
   incongruent body kinematics. During the task, we applied repetitive
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the superior temporal
   sulcus (STS) and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd). Results showed that
   STS-rTMS disrupted performance in both experts and novices, especially
   in those with greater visual expertise (i.e. goalkeepers). Conversely,
   PMd-rTMS impaired performance only in expert players (i.e. outfield
   players and goalkeepers), who exhibit strong motor expertise into facing
   domain-specific actions in soccer games. These results provide causative
   evidence of the complimentary functional role of visual and motor action
   representations in experts' action prediction.}},

Pages = {{352-356}},

Abstract = {{A vast body of research showed that social exclusion can trigger
   aggression. However, the neural mechanisms involved in regulating
   aggressive responses to social exclusion are still largely unknown.
   Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates the
   excitability of a target region. Building on studies suggesting that
   activity in the right ventrolateral pre-frontal cortex (rVLPFC) might
   aid the regulation or inhibition of social exclusion-related distress,
   we hypothesized that non-invasive brain polarization through tDCS over
   the rVLPFC would reduce behavioral aggression following social
   exclusion. Participants were socially excluded or included while they
   received tDCS or sham stimulation to the rVLPFC. Next, they received an
   opportunity to aggress. Excluded participants demonstrated cognitive
   awareness of their inclusionary status, yet tDCS (but not sham
   stimulation) reduced their behavioral aggression. Excluded participants
   who received tDCS stimulation were no more aggressive than included
   participants. tDCS stimulation did not influence socially included
   participants' aggression. Our findings provide the first causal test for
   the role of rVLPFC in modulating aggressive responses to social
   exclusion. Our findings suggest that modulating activity in a brain area
   (i.e. the rVLPFC) implicated in self-control and emotion regulation can
   break the link between social exclusion and aggression.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In religions where God is portrayed as both loving and wrathful,
   religious beliefs may be a source of fear as well as comfort. Here, we
   consider if God's love may be more effective, relative to God's wrath,
   for soothing distress, but less effective for helping control behavior.
   Specifically, we assess whether contemplating God's love reduces our
   ability to detect and emotionally react to conflict between one's
   behavior and overarching religious standards. We do so within a
   neurophysiological framework, by observing the effects of exposure to
   concepts of God's love vs punishment on the error-related negativity
   (ERN)-a neural signal originating in the anterior cingulate cortex that
   is associated with performance monitoring and affective responses to
   errors. Participants included 123 students at Brigham Young University,
   who completed a Go/No-Go task where they made `religious' errors (i.e.
   ostensibly exhibited pro-alcohol tendencies). Reflecting on God's love
   caused dampened ERNs and worse performance on the Go/No-Go task.
   Thinking about God's punishment did not affect performance or ERNs.
   Results suggest that one possible reason religiosity is generally linked
   to positive well-being may be because of a decreased affective response
   to errors that occurs when God's love is prominent in the minds of
   believers.}},

Abstract = {{A heightened sense of self-esteem is associated with a reduced risk for
   several types of affective and psychiatric disorders, including
   depression, anxiety and eating disorders. However, little is known about
   how brain systems integrate self-referential processing and positive
   evaluation to give rise to these feelings. To address this, we combined
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to test how frontostriatal connectivity reflects long-term trait
   and short-term state aspects of self-esteem. Using DTI, we found
   individual variability in white matter structural integrity between the
   medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum was related to trait
   measures of self-esteem, reflecting long-term stability of self-esteem
   maintenance. Using fMRI, we found that functional connectivity of these
   regions during positive self-evaluation was related to current feelings
   of self-esteem, reflecting short-term state self-esteem. These results
   provide convergent anatomical and functional evidence that self-esteem
   is related to the connectivity of frontostriatal circuits and suggest
   that feelings of self-worth may emerge from neural systems integrating
   information about the self with positive affect and reward. This
   information could potentially inform the etiology of diminished
   self-esteem underlying multiple psychiatric conditions and inform future
   studies of evaluative self-referential processing.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The amygdala is thought to play a critical role in detecting salient
   stimuli. Several studies have taken ecological approaches to
   investigating such saliency, and argue for domain-specific effects for
   processing certain natural stimulus categories, in particular faces and
   animals. Linking this to the amygdala, neurons in the human amygdala
   have been found to respond strongly to faces and also to animals.
   However, the amygdala's necessary role for such category-specific
   effects at the behavioral level remains untested. Here we tested four
   rare patients with bilateral amygdala lesions on an established
   change-detection protocol. Consistent with prior published studies,
   healthy controls showed reliably faster and more accurate detection of
   people and animals, as compared with artifacts and plants. So did all
   four amygdala patients: there were no differences in phenomenal change
   blindness, in behavioral reaction time to detect changes or in
   eye-tracking measures. The findings provide decisive evidence against a
   critical participation of the amygdala in rapid initial processing of
   attention to animate stimuli, suggesting that the necessary neural
   substrates for this phenomenon arise either in other subcortical
   structures (such as the pulvinar) or within the cortex itself.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has identified an important role for task switching, a
   cognitive control process often associated with executive functioning,
   in the Implicit Association Test (IAT). However, switching does not
   fully account for IAT effects, particularly when performance is scored
   using more recent d-score formulations. The current study sought to
   characterize multiple control processes involved in IAT performance
   through the use of event-related brain potentials (ERPs). Participants
   performed a race-evaluative IAT while ERPs were recorded. Behaviorally,
   participants experienced superadditive reaction time costs of
   incongruency and task switching, consistent with previous studies. The
   ERP showed a marked medial frontal negativity (MFN) 250-450 ms
   post-stimulus at midline fronto-central locations that were more
   negative for incongruent than congruent trials but more positive for
   switch than for no-switch trials, suggesting separable control processes
   are engaged by these two factors. Greater behavioral IAT bias was
   associated with both greater switch-related and congruency-related ERP
   activity. Findings are discussed in terms of the Dual Mechanisms of
   Control model of reactive and proactive cognitive control.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescents' peer culture plays a key role in the development and
   maintenance of risk-taking behavior. Despite recent advances in
   developmental neuroscience suggesting that peers may increase neural
   sensitivity to rewards, we know relatively little about how the quality
   of peer relations impact adolescent risk taking. In the current 2-year
   three-wave longitudinal study, we examined how chronic levels of peer
   conflict relate to risk taking behaviorally and neurally, and whether
   this is modified by high-quality peer relationships. Forty-six
   adolescents completed daily diaries assessing peer conflict across 2
   years as well as a measure of peer support. During a functional brain
   scan, adolescents completed a risk-taking task. Behaviorally, peer
   conflict was associated with greater risk-taking behavior, especially
   for adolescents reporting low peer support. High levels of peer support
   buffered this association. At the neural level, peer conflict was
   associated with greater activation in the striatum and insula,
   especially among adolescents reporting low peer support, whereas this
   association was buffered for adolescents reporting high peer support.
   Results are consistent with the stress-buffering model of social
   relationships and underscore the importance of the quality of
   adolescents' peer relationships for their risk taking.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic emotional expressions such as those communicated by faces and
   vocalizations have been shown to engage specific brain regions, such as
   the amygdala. Although music constitutes another powerful means to
   express emotions, the neural substrates involved in its processing
   remain poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown whether brain
   regions typically associated with processing `biologically relevant'
   emotional expressions are also recruited by emotional music. To address
   this question, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study in 47 healthy volunteers in which we directly
   compared responses to basic emotions (fear, sadness and happiness, as
   well as neutral) expressed through faces, non-linguistic vocalizations
   and short novel musical excerpts. Our results confirmed the importance
   of fear in emotional communication, as revealed by significant blood
   oxygen level-dependent signal increased in a cluster within the
   posterior amygdala and anterior hippocampus, as well as in the posterior
   insula across all three domains. Moreover, subject-specific amygdala
   responses to fearful music and vocalizations were correlated, consistent
   with the proposal that the brain circuitry involved in the processing of
   musical emotions might be shared with the one that have evolved for
   vocalizations. Overall, our results show that processing of fear
   expressed through music, engages some of the same brain areas known to
   be crucial for detecting and evaluating threat-related information.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence indicates that normative pubertal maturation is
   associated with increased threat reactivity, and this developmental
   shift has been implicated in the increased rates of adolescent affective
   disorders. However, the neural mechanisms involved in this pubertal
   increase in threat reactivity remain unknown. Research in adults
   indicates that testosterone transiently decreases amygdala-orbitofrontal
   cortex (OFC) coupling. Consequently, we hypothesized that increased
   pubertal testosterone disrupts amygdala-OFC coupling, which may
   contribute to developmental increases in threat reactivity in some
   adolescents. Hypotheses were tested in a longitudinal study by examining
   the impact of testosterone on functional connectivity. Findings were
   consistent with hypotheses and advance our understanding of normative
   pubertal changes in neural systems instantiating affect/motivation.
   Finally, potential novel insights into the neurodevelopmental pathways
   that may contribute to adolescent vulnerability to behavioral and
   emotional problems are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Stressful life events increase vulnerability to problematic alcohol use,
   and they may do this by disrupting reward-related neural circuitry. This
   is particularly relevant for adolescents because alcohol use rises
   sharply after mid-adolescence and alcohol abuse peaks at age 20.
   Adolescents also report more stressors compared with children, and
   neural reward circuitry may be especially vulnerable to stressors during
   adolescence because of prefrontal cortex remodeling. Using a large
   sample of male participants in a longitudinal functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study (N = 157), we evaluated whether cumulative
   stressful life events between the ages of 15 and 18 were associated with
   reward-related brain function and problematic alcohol use at age 20
   years. Higher cumulative stressful life events during adolescence were
   associated with decreased response in the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) during monetary reward anticipation and following the receipt of
   monetary rewards. Stress-related decreases in mPFC response during
   reward anticipation and following rewarding outcomes were associated
   with the severity of alcohol dependence. Furthermore, mPFC response
   mediated the association between stressful life events and later
   symptoms of alcohol dependence. These data are consistent with
   neurobiological models of addiction that propose that stressors during
   adolescence increase risk for problematic alcohol use by disrupting
   reward circuit function.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Affect-modulated event-related potentials (ERPs) are increasingly used
   to study psychopathology and individual differences in emotion
   processing. Many have suggested that variation in these neural responses
   reflects genetically mediated risk. However, to date, no studies have
   demonstrated genetic contributions to affect-modulated ERPs. The present
   study therefore sought to examine the heritability of a range of ERPs
   elicited during affective picture viewing. One hundred and thirty
   monozygotic and 124 dizygotic twin pairs passively viewed 30 pleasant,
   30 neutral and 30 unpleasant images for 6 s each. The early posterior
   negativity was scored for each subject; in addition, the P300/late
   positive potential (LPP) was scored in multiple time windows and sites.
   Results indicate that the centro-parietal P300 (occurring between 300
   and 600 ms) is subject to substantial genetic contributions.
   Furthermore, variance in the P300 elicited by affective stimuli was
   moderately heritable even after controlling for the P300 elicited by
   neutral stimuli. Later and more frontal activation (i.e. between 1000
   and 3000 ms) also showed evidence of heritablity. Early parietal, and
   perhaps later frontal portions of the P300/LPP complex, may therefore
   represent promising neurobehavioral markers of genetically influenced
   processing of emotional information.}},

Abstract = {{Talking about emotion and sharing emotional experiences is a key
   component of human interaction. Specifically, individuals often consider
   the reactions of other people when evaluating the meaning and impact of
   an emotional stimulus. It has not yet been investigated, however, how
   emotional arousal ratings and physiological responses elicited by
   affective stimuli are influenced by the rating of an interaction
   partner. In the present study, pairs of participants were asked to rate
   and communicate the degree of their emotional arousal while viewing
   affective pictures. Strikingly, participants adjusted their arousal
   ratings to match up with their interaction partner. In anticipation of
   the affective picture, the interaction partner's arousal ratings
   correlated positively with activity in anterior insula and prefrontal
   cortex. During picture presentation, social influence was reflected in
   the ventral striatum, that is, activity in the ventral striatum
   correlated negatively with the interaction partner's ratings. Results of
   the study show that emotional alignment through the influence of another
   person's communicated experience has to be considered as a complex
   phenomenon integrating different components including emotion
   anticipation and conformity.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its evident universality and high social value, the ultimate
   biological role of music and its connection to brain disorders remain
   poorly understood. Recent findings from basic neuroscience have shed
   fresh light on these old problems. New insights provided by clinical
   neuroscience concerning the effects of brain disorders promise to be
   particularly valuable in uncovering the underlying cognitive and neural
   architecture of music and for assessing candidate accounts of the
   biological role of music. Here we advance a new model of the biological
   role of music in human evolution and the link to brain disorders,
   drawing on diverse lines of evidence derived from comparative ethology,
   cognitive neuropsychology and neuroimaging studies in the normal and the
   disordered brain. We propose that music evolved from the call signals of
   our hominid ancestors as a means mentally to rehearse and predict
   potentially costly, affectively laden social routines in surrogate,
   coded, low-cost form: essentially, a mechanism for transforming
   emotional mental states efficiently and adaptively into social signals.
   This biological role of music has its legacy today in the disordered
   processing of music and mental states that characterizes certain
   developmental and acquired clinical syndromes of brain network
   disintegration.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal anxiety during pregnancy has been consistently shown to
   negatively affect offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, little
   is known about the impact of positive maternal traits/states during
   pregnancy on the offspring. The present study was aimed at investigating
   the effects of the mother's mindfulness and anxiety during pregnancy on
   the infant's neurocognitive functioning at 9 months of age. Mothers
   reported mindfulness using the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory and
   anxiety using the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) at +/- 20.7 weeks of
   gestation. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were measured from 79
   infants in an auditory oddball paradigm designed to measure auditory
   attention-a key aspect of early neurocognitive functioning. For the ERP
   responses elicited by standard sounds, higher maternal mindfulness was
   associated with lower N250 amplitudes (P < 0.01, eta(2) = 0.097),
   whereas higher maternal anxiety was associated with higher N250
   amplitudes (P < 0.05, eta(2) = 0.057). Maternal mindfulness was also
   positively associated with the P150 amplitudes (P < 0.01, eta(2) =
   0.130). These results suggest that infants prenatally exposed to higher
   levels of maternal mindfulness devote fewer attentional resources to
   frequently occurring irrelevant sounds. The results show that positive
   traits and experiences of the mother during pregnancy may also affect
   the unborn child. Emphasizing the beneficial effects of a positive
   psychological state during pregnancy may promote healthy behavior in
   pregnant women.}},

Abstract = {{People expect to be treated equivalently as others in like
   circumstances. The present study investigated that whether and how equal
   or unequal treatments of others in like circumstances affected
   individuals' responses to unfairness through justifying their reference
   points for fairness considerations. Twenty-five participants were
   scanned while they were playing an adapted version of the Ultimatum Game
   as responders. During the experiment, the participant was not only
   informed of the offer given by her/his proposer but also informed of the
   division scheme of another proposer-responder pair. It turned out that
   participants were more likely to accept unequal offers and reported
   higher fairness ratings when other responders received unequal offers
   compared with equal offers. Stronger bilateral anterior insula and
   dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus activities were observed when only
   participants (but not other responders) received equal offers, whereas
   greater right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity was found when
   both of them received unequal offers, especially when participants
   accepted the unequal offers. Taken together, the results demonstrated
   that whether others in like circumstances were offered equally also
   plays an important role in responders' fairness-related social decision
   making.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are thought to lack
   self-awareness and to experience difficulty empathizing with others.
   Although these deficits have been demonstrated in previous studies, most
   of the target stimuli were constructed for typically developing (TD)
   individuals. We employed judgment tasks capable of indexing
   self-relevant processing in individuals with and without ASD. Fourteen
   Japanese men and 1 Japanese women with high-functioning ASD (17-41 years
   of age) and 13 Japanese men and 2 TD Japanese women (22-40 years of
   age), all of whom were matched for age and full and verbal intelligence
   quotient scores with the ASD participants, were enrolled in this study.
   The results demonstrated that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was
   significantly activated in individuals with ASD in response to autistic
   characters and in TD individuals in response to non-autistic characters.
   Although the frontal-posterior network between the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus participated in the
   processing of non-autistic characters in TD individuals, an alternative
   network was involved when individuals with ASD processed autistic
   characters. This suggests an atypical form of empathy in individuals
   with ASD toward others with ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that experiencing events that represent a
   significant threat to social bonds activates a network of brain areas
   associated with the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain. In the
   present study, we investigated whether the same brain areas are involved
   when witnessing social exclusion threats experienced by others. Using a
   within-subject design, we show that an ecologically valid experience of
   social exclusion recruits areas coding the somatosensory components of
   physical pain (posterior insular cortex and secondary somatosensory
   cortex). Furthermore, we show that this pattern of activation not only
   holds for directly experienced social pain, but also during empathy for
   social pain. Finally, we report that subgenual cingulate cortex is the
   only brain area conjointly active during empathy for physical and social
   pain. This supports recent theories that affective processing and
   homeostatic regulation are at the core of empathic responses.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional speech comprises of complex multimodal verbal and non-verbal
   information that allows deducting others' emotional states or thoughts
   in social interactions. While the neural correlates of verbal and
   non-verbal aspects and their interaction in emotional speech have been
   identified, there is very little evidence on how we perceive and resolve
   incongruity in emotional speech, and whether such incongruity extends to
   current concepts of task-specific prediction errors as a consequence of
   unexpected action outcomes ('negative surprise'). Here, we explored this
   possibility while participants listened to congruent and incongruent
   angry, happy or neutral utterances and categorized the expressed
   emotions by their verbal (semantic) content. Results reveal
   valence-specific incongruity effects: negative verbal content expressed
   in a happy tone of voice increased activation in the dorso-medial
   prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) extending its role from conflict moderation to
   appraisal of valence-specific conflict in emotional speech. Conversely,
   the caudate head bilaterally responded selectively to positive verbal
   content expressed in an angry tone of voice broadening previous accounts
   of the caudate head in linguistic control to moderating valence-specific
   control in emotional speech. Together, these results suggest that
   control structures of the human brain (dmPFC and subcompartments of the
   basal ganglia) impact emotional speech differentially when conflict
   arises.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most effective strategies for regulating emotional responses
   is cognitive reappraisal. While prior work has made great strides in
   characterizing reappraisal's neural mechanisms and behavioral outcomes,
   the key issue of how regulation varies as a function of emotional
   intensity remains unaddressed. We compared the behavioral and neural
   correlates of reappraisal of high- and low-intensity emotional responses
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that
   successful reappraisal of both high- and low-intensity emotions depends
   upon recruitment of dorsomedial (dmPFC) as well as left dorsolateral
   (dlPFC) and ventrolateral (vlPFC) prefrontal cortex. However,
   reappraisal of high-intensity emotions more strongly activated left
   dlPFC, and in addition, activated right lateral and dorsomedial PFC
   regions not recruited by low-intensity reappraisal. No brain regions
   were more strongly recruited during reappraisal of low when compared
   with high-intensity emotions. Taken together, these results suggest that
   reappraisal of high-intensity emotion requires greater cognitive
   resources as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative differences in
   prefrontal recruitment. These data have implications for understanding
   how and when specific PFC systems are needed to regulate different types
   of emotional responses.}},

Abstract = {{Inertia, together with intensity and valence, is an important component
   of emotion. We tested whether positive and negative events generate
   lingering changes in subsequent brain responses to unrelated threat
   stimuli and investigated the impact of individual anxiety. We acquired
   fMRI data while participants watched positive or negative movie-clips
   and subsequently performed an unrelated task with fearful and neutral
   faces. We quantified changes in amygdala reactivity to fearful faces as
   a function of the valence of preceding movies and cumulative neural
   activity evoked during them. We demonstrate that amygdala responses to
   emotional movies spill over to subsequent processing of threat
   information in a valence-specific manner: negative movies enhance later
   amygdala activation whereas positive movies attenuate it. Critically,
   the magnitude of such changes is predicted by a measure of cumulative
   amygdala responses to the preceding positive or negative movies. These
   effects appear independent of overt attention, are regionally limited to
   amygdala, with no changes in functional connectivity. Finally,
   individuals with higher state anxiety displayed stronger modulation of
   amygdala reactivity by positive movies. These results suggest that
   intensity and valence of emotional events as well as anxiety levels
   promote local changes in amygdala sensitivity to threat, highlighting
   the importance of past experience in shaping future affective
   reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{Creativity is crucial to the progression of human civilization and has
   led to important scientific discoveries. Especially, individuals are
   more likely to have scientific discoveries if they possess certain
   personality traits of creativity (trait creativity), including
   imagination, curiosity, challenge and risk-taking. This study used
   voxel-based morphometry to identify the brain regions underlying
   individual differences in trait creativity, as measured by the Williams
   creativity aptitude test, in a large sample (n = 246). We found that
   creative individuals had higher gray matter volume in the right
   posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), which might be related to
   semantic processing during novelty seeking (e.g. novel association,
   conceptual integration and metaphor understanding). More importantly,
   although basic personality factors such as openness to experience,
   extroversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness (as measured by the
   NEO Personality Inventory) all contributed to trait creativity, only
   openness to experience mediated the association between the right pMTG
   volume and trait creativity. Taken together, our results suggest that
   the basic personality trait of openness might play an important role in
   shaping an individual's trait creativity.}},

Abstract = {{Social phobia (SP) has been associated with amygdala hyperreactivity to
   fear-relevant stimuli. However, little is known about the neural basis
   of SP individuals' capacity to downregulate their responses to such
   stimuli and how such regulation varies as a function of comorbid
   depression and anxiety. We completed an functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study wherein SP participants without comorbidity (n =
   30), with comorbid depression (n = 18) and with comorbid anxiety (n =
   19) and healthy controls (n = 15) were scanned while completing an
   affect labeling emotion regulation task. Individuals with SP as a whole
   exhibited a reversal of the pattern observed in healthy controls in that
   they showed upregulation of amygdala activity during affect labeling.
   However, subsequent analyses revealed a more complex picture based on
   comorbidity type. Although none of the SP subgroups showed the normative
   pattern of amygdala downregulation, it was those with comorbid
   depression specifically who showed significant upregulation. Effects
   could not be attributed to differences in task performance, amygdala
   reactivity or right ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (RVLPFC)
   engagement, but may stem from dysfunctional communication between
   amygdala and RVLPFC. Furthermore, the particularly altered emotion
   regulation seen in those with comorbid depression could not be fully
   explained by symptom severity or state anxiety. Results reveal altered
   emotion regulation in SP, especially when comorbid with depression.}},

Abstract = {{This functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined the neural
   correlates of punishment and forgiveness of initiators of social
   exclusion (i.e. `excluders'). Participants divided money in a modified
   Dictator Game between themselves and people who previously either
   included or excluded them during a virtual ball-tossing game
   (Cyberball). Participants selectively punished the excluders by
   decreasing their outcomes; even when this required participants to give
   up monetary rewards. Punishment of excluders was associated with
   increased activation in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and
   bilateral anterior insula. Costly punishment was accompanied by higher
   activity in the pre-SMA compared with punishment that resulted in gains
   or was non-costly. Refraining from punishment (i.e. forgiveness) was
   associated with self-reported perspective-taking and increased
   activation in the bilateral temporoparietal junction, dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and ventrolateral
   and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that social
   exclusion can result in punishment as well as forgiveness of excluders
   and that separable neural networks implicated in social cognition and
   cognitive control are recruited when people choose either to punish or
   to forgive those who excluded them.}},

Abstract = {{Remembering emotional autobiographical memories (AMs) is important for
   emotional well-being, and investigation of the role of emotion
   regulation (ER) during AM recollection has relevance for understanding
   mental health issues. Although significant progress has been made in
   understanding the brain mechanisms underlying ER and AM, less is known
   about the role of ER during AM recollection. The present study
   investigated how focusing away (or `distracting') from the emotional
   content during AM recollection influences the subjective re-experiencing
   of emotions and the associated neural correlates, by manipulating the
   retrieval focus of participants who remembered emotional AMs while fMRI
   data were recorded. First, focusing away from emotion led to decreased
   self-reported emotional responses, along with increased engagement of
   ER-related regions (ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, vmPFC), and reduced
   activity in emotion-related regions (amygdala, AMY). Second, increased
   vmPFC activity was linked to reduced emotional ratings, during the
   non-emotional focus. Third, mediation analysis identified vmPFC as a
   functional hub integrating affective signals from AMY and mediating
   their impact on the subjective re-experiencing of emotion, according to
   the current retrieval focus. Collectively, these findings shed light on
   the neural mechanisms underlying the ability to effectively switch
   attentional focus away from emotions during AM recollections and have
   direct relevance for understanding, preventing and treating affective
   disorders, characterised by reduced ability to regulate emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Older adults show a `positivity bias' in tasks involving emotion and
   self-referential processing. A critical network that is involved in
   self-referencing and shows age-related decline is the default network
   (DN). The purpose of the current study was to investigate age
   differences in pre- and post-task DN functional connectivity (FC) and
   signal variability, and to examine whether they are predictive of the
   positivity bias in self-referencing. We measured FC and within-subject
   variability of the DN in resting-state scans preceding and following
   tasks involving personality judgements on the self and a close other.
   Older adults endorsed more positive traits than younger adults on both
   tasks. FC was weaker post-task in older vs younger adults, and younger
   adults had greater variability than older adults in DN nodes. Younger
   adults with higher post-task DN variability had more negative
   self-ratings. For both age groups, greater FC in the DN was associated
   with more negative self-ratings. Neither FC nor variability was related
   to other ratings, despite the potential for self-processing when making
   other judgements. Our findings suggest that ageing leads to reduced FC
   and variability in the DN, which is most apparent after task, and may be
   one mechanism underlying the positive bias with age.}},

Abstract = {{Social decision making is guided by the ability to intuitively judge
   personal attributes, including analysis of facial features to infer the
   trustworthiness of others. Although the neural basis for trustworthiness
   evaluation is well characterized in adults, less is known about its
   development during adolescence. We used event-related functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to examine age-related changes in neural
   activation and functional connectivity during the evaluation of trust in
   faces in a sample of adolescent females. During scanning, participants
   viewed masked presentations of faces and rated their trustworthiness.
   Parametric modeling of trust ratings revealed enhanced activation in
   amygdala and insula to untrustworthy faces, effects which peaked during
   mid-adolescence. Analysis of amygdala functional connectivity
   demonstrated enhanced amygdala-insula coupling during the evaluation of
   untrustworthy faces. This boost in connectivity was attenuated during
   mid-adolescence, suggesting a functional transition within
   face-processing circuits. Together, these findings underscore
   adolescence as a period of reorganization in neural circuits underlying
   socioemotional behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often described as a disorder of
   aberrant neural connectivity. Although it is important to study the
   pathophysiology of ASD in the developing cortex, the functional
   connectivity in the brains of young children with ASD has not been well
   studied. In this study, brain activity was measured non-invasively
   during consciousness in 50 young human children with ASD and 50 age- and
   gender-matched typically developing human (TD) children. We employed a
   custom child-sized magnetoencephalography (MEG) system in which sensors
   were located as close to the brain as possible for optimal recording in
   young children. We focused on theta band oscillations because they are
   thought to be involved in long-range networks associated with higher
   cognitive processes. The ASD group showed significantly reduced
   connectivity between the left-anterior and the right-posterior areas,
   exhibiting a decrease in the coherence of theta band (6 Hz) oscillations
   compared with the TD group. This reduction in coherence was
   significantly correlated with clinical severity in right-handed children
   with ASD. This is the first study to demonstrate reduced long-range
   functional connectivity in conscious young children with ASD using a
   novel MEG approach.}},

Abstract = {{Recipients process information from speech and co-speech gestures, but
   it is currently unknown how this processing is influenced by the
   presence of other important social cues, especially gaze direction, a
   marker of communicative intent. Such cues may modulate neural activity
   in regions associated either with the processing of ostensive cues, such
   as eye gaze, or with the processing of semantic information, provided by
   speech and gesture. Participants were scanned (fMRI) while taking part
   in triadic communication involving two recipients and a speaker. The
   speaker uttered sentences that were and were not accompanied by
   complementary iconic gestures. Crucially, the speaker alternated her
   gaze direction, thus creating two recipient roles: addressed (direct
   gaze) vs unaddressed (averted gaze) recipient. The comprehension of
   Speech\&Gesture relative to SpeechOnly utterances recruited middle
   occipital, middle temporal and inferior frontal gyri, bilaterally. The
   calcarine sulcus and posterior cingulate cortex were sensitive to
   differences between direct and averted gaze. Most importantly,
   Speech\&Gesture utterances, but not SpeechOnly utterances, produced
   additional activity in the right middle temporal gyrus when participants
   were addressed. Marking communicative intent with gaze direction
   modulates the processing of speech-gesture utterances in cerebral areas
   typically associated with the semantic processing of multi-modal
   communicative acts.}},

Abstract = {{Whether human beings have free will has been a philosophical question
   for centuries. The debate about free will has recently entered the
   public arena through mass media and newspaper articles commenting on
   scientific findings that leave little to no room for free will. Previous
   research has shown that encouraging such a deterministic perspective
   influences behavior, namely by promoting cursory and antisocial
   behavior. Here we propose that such behavioral changes may, at least
   partly, stem from a more basic neurocognitive process related to
   response monitoring, namely a reduced error detection mechanism. Our
   results show that the error-related negativity, a neural marker of error
   detection, was reduced in individuals led to disbelieve in free will.
   This finding shows that reducing the belief in free will has a specific
   impact on error detection mechanisms. More generally, it suggests that
   abstract beliefs about intentional control can influence basic and
   automatic processes related to action control.}},

Abstract = {{The reinforcing effects of aversive outcomes on avoidance behaviour are
   well established. However, their influence on perceptual processes is
   less well explored, especially during the transition from adolescence to
   adulthood. Using electroencephalography, we examined whether learning to
   actively or passively avoid harm can modulate early visual responses in
   adolescents and adults. The task included two avoidance conditions,
   active and passive, where two different warning stimuli predicted the
   imminent, but avoidable, presentation of an aversive tone. To avoid the
   aversive outcome, participants had to learn to emit an action (active
   avoidance) for one of the warning stimuli and omit an action for the
   other (passive avoidance). Both adults and adolescents performed the
   task with a high degree of accuracy. For both adolescents and adults,
   increased N170 event-related potential amplitudes were found for both
   the active and the passive warning stimuli compared with control
   conditions. Moreover, the potentiation of the N170 to the warning
   stimuli was stable and long lasting. Developmental differences were also
   observed; adolescents showed greater potentiation of the N170 component
   to danger signals. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that
   learned danger signals in an instrumental avoidance task can influence
   early visual sensory processes in both adults and adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{The core feature of separation anxiety is excessive distress when faced
   with actual or perceived separation from people to whom the individual
   has a strong emotional attachment. So far little is known about the
   neurobiological underpinnings of separation anxiety. Therefore, we
   investigated functional (amygdala responsiveness and functional
   connectivity during threat-related emotion processing) and structural
   (grey matter volume) imaging markers associated with separation anxiety
   as measured with the Relationship Scale Questionnaire in a large sample
   of healthy adults from the Munster Neuroimaging Cohort (N = 320). We
   used a robust emotional face-matching task and acquired high-resolution
   structural images for morphometric analyses using voxel-based
   morphometry. The main results were positive associations of separation
   anxiety scores with amygdala reactivity to emotional faces as well as
   increased amygdala grey matter volumes. A functional connectivity
   analysis revealed positive associations between separation anxiety and
   functional coupling of the amygdala with areas involved in visual
   processes and attention, including several occipital and somatosensory
   areas. Taken together, the results suggest a higher emotional
   involvement in subjects with separation anxiety while watching negative
   facial expressions, and potentially secondary neuro-structural adaptive
   processes. These results could help to understand and treat (adult)
   separation anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Alexithymia is a psychological construct that can be divided into a
   cognitive and affective dimension. The cognitive dimension is
   characterized by difficulties in identifying, verbalizing and analysing
   feelings. The affective dimension comprises reduced levels of emotional
   experience and imagination. Alexithymia is widely regarded to arise from
   an impairment of emotion regulation. This is the first functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to critically evaluate this by
   investigating the neural correlates of emotion regulation as a function
   of alexithymia levels. The aim of the current study was to investigate
   the neural correlates underlying the two alexithymia dimensions during
   emotion perception and emotion regulation. Using fMRI, we scanned 51
   healthy subjects while viewing, reappraising or suppressing negative
   emotional pictures. The results support the idea that cognitive
   alexithymia, but not affective alexithymia, is associated with lower
   activation in emotional attention and recognition networks during
   emotion perception. However, in contrast with several theories, no
   alexithymia-related differences were found during emotion regulation
   (neither reappraisal nor suppression). These findings suggest that
   alexithymia may result from an early emotion processing deficit rather
   than compromised frontal circuits subserving higher-order emotion
   regulation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Gaze and arrow cues automatically orient visual attention, even when
   they have no predictive value, but the neural circuitry by which they
   direct attention is not clear. Recent evidence has indicated that the
   ventral frontoparietal attention network is primarily engaged by
   breaches of a viewer's cue-related expectations. Accordingly, we
   hypothesized that to the extent that non-predictive gaze and arrow cues
   automatically engender expectations with regard to cue location, they
   should activate the ventral attention network when they cue attention
   invalidly. Using event-related fMRI, we found that invalid gaze but not
   arrow cues activated the ventral attention network, specifically in the
   area of the right temporal parietal junction (TPJ), as well as nodes
   along the dorsal attention network associated with a redirection of
   attention to the correct target location. In additional whole-brain
   analyses, facilitation of behavioral response time by valid gaze cues
   was linearly associated with the degree of activation in the right TPJ.
   We conclude from our findings that gaze direction elicits potent
   expectations in humans with regard to an actor's intention that engage
   attention networks if not differently from, at least more robustly than,
   arrow cues.}},

Abstract = {{Humans often judge others egocentrically, assuming that they feel or
   think similarly to themselves. Emotional egocentricity bias (EEB) occurs
   in situations when others feel differently to oneself. Using a novel
   paradigm, we investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the
   developmental capacity to overcome such EEB in children compared with
   adults. We showed that children display a stronger EEB than adults and
   that this correlates with reduced activation in right supramarginal
   gyrus (rSMG) as well as reduced coupling between rSMG and left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) in children compared with
   adults. Crucially, functional recruitment of rSMG was associated with
   age-related differences in cortical thickness of this region. Although
   in adults the mere presence of emotional conflict occurs between self
   and other recruited rSMG, rSMG-lDLPFC coupling was only observed when
   implementing empathic judgements. Finally, resting state analyses
   comparing connectivity patterns of rSMG with that of right
   temporoparietal junction suggested a unique role of rSMG for self-other
   distinction in the emotional domain for adults as well as for children.
   Thus, children's difficulties in overcoming EEB may be due to late
   maturation of regions distinguishing between conflicting socio-affective
   information and relaying this information to regions necessary for
   implementing accurate judgments.}},

Abstract = {{The ventral pallidum (VP) is a key component of the neural circuitry
   mediating relapse to drug seeking, but the critical afferent pathways to
   VP recruited during relapse remain poorly understood. We studied the
   role of the nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) -> VP pathway in ABA renewal
   and reacquisition of alcohol seeking. Rats received application of
   adenoviral vectors encoding eYFP, ChR2(H134R), or eNpHr3.0 to AcbC and
   implantation of fiber optic cannulas into VP to permit photostimulation
   of AcbC terminals there. Rats were then trained to self-administer
   alcoholic beer in 1 context (A), extinguished in a second context (B),
   tested in the extinction (ABB) and training (ABA) contexts, and were
   then tested for reacquisition of alcoholic beer seeking. There was ABA
   renewal of alcohol seeking, but neither optogenetic excitation nor
   inhibition of the AcbC -> VP pathway affected this renewal. In contrast,
   optogenetic inhibition of the AcbC -> VP striatopallidal pathway reduced
   reacquisition of alcohol seeking-measured either by the number of active
   nosepokes emitted or by the number of alcohol rewards earned and
   consumed. Moreover, optogenetic excitation of the AcbC -> VP
   striatopallidal pathway increased magazine entries during reacquisition
   test. This finding shows the importance of the AcbC -> VP pathway in
   controlling relapse when the drug reinforcer is present on test and is
   consistent with a role for the AcbC -> VP pathway in regulating the
   hedonic or incentive motivational properties of drug reinforcers.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) is an important molecule for the proper development
   and function of the central nervous system. In this study, we
   investigated the behavioral alterations in the neuronal NO synthase
   knockout mice (NOS1 KO) with a deficient NO production mechanism in the
   brain, characterizing it as a potential rodent model for attention
   deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). NOS1 KO exhibited higher
   locomotor activity than their wildtype counterparts in a novel
   environment, as measured by open field (OF) test. In a 2-way active
   avoidance paradigm (TWAA), we found sex-dependent effects, where male KO
   displayed deficits in avoidance and escape behavior, sustained higher
   incidences of shuttle crossings, and higher incidences of intertrial
   interval crossings, suggesting learning, and/or performance impairments.
   On the other hand, female KO demonstrated few deficits in TWAA.
   Molsidomine (MSD), a NO donor, rescued TWAA deficits in male KO when
   acutely administered before training. In a passive avoidance paradigm,
   KO of both sexes displayed significantly shorter step-through latencies
   after training. Further, abnormal spontaneous motor activity rhythms
   were found in the KO during the dark phase of the day, indicating
   dysregulation of rhythmic activities. These data indicate that NOS1 KO
   mimics certain ADHD-like behaviors and could potentially serve as a
   novel rodent model for ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{Stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) refers to the long-lasting
   nonassociative sensitization produced by intense stress (e. g., repeated
   and unpredictable footshock) that results in increased fear learning to
   a mild conditioning regimen (e. g., one shock). SEFL experiments suggest
   that one component of posttraumatic behavior is inappropriately strong
   fear conditioning occurring to relatively mild stressors. Past reports
   of SEFL have used the same intensity (1 mA) of footshock to cause both
   the sensitization and conditioning of new fear. SEFL would be a
   particularly problematic component of posttrauma behavior if intense
   stress results in substantial fear conditioning under conditions that
   would not normally support conditioning. Therefore, we determined if
   SEFL occurred when the conditioning shock was substantially milder than
   the SEFL-inducing shock. The results indicate that exposure to a
   sensitizing regimen of shock can convert a mild footshock that normally
   does not support measurable levels of fear conditioning into one that
   causes substantial learned fear. Moreover, as the intensity of single
   footshock increases, so does the capacity of the prior stressor to
   contribute to the sensitization of fear responses. Consistent with prior
   studies, males acquired and retained a greater level of fear
   conditioning than female rats, however the level of sensitization did
   not differ between sexes.}},

Abstract = {{While sexually experienced males copulate at a higher frequency than
   sexually inexperienced males, there is still a great deal of variability
   in their behavior. Within the medial preoptic area (mPOA) of the
   hypothalamus, glutamate modulates some of this variability. Glutamate
   levels, for example, increase during sexual activity, peaking with
   ejaculation and falling precipitously during the post-ejaculation
   interval. Whereas lower glutamate levels after ejaculation translates to
   longer post-ejaculatory intervals, administration of glutamate uptake
   inhibitors into the mPOA increases the number of ejaculations a male rat
   achieves over a mating bout, and reduces the latency to ejaculate once
   mating begins. Because astrocytes modulate the availability of neuronal
   glutamate, we hypothesized that differences in the number of
   GFAP-positive astrocytes in the mPOA may account for variability in
   sexual behavior. To this end, we examined whether the number of
   astrocytes in the mPOA related to ejaculation latency as well as to the
   duration of the post-ejaculatory interval (PEI) in sexually experienced
   and sexually inexperienced males. Results indicate that the number of
   astrocytes negatively correlated with latency to reach ejaculations in
   sexually inexperienced but not sexually experienced rats while the
   number of astrocytes and PEI were not related. Astrocyte numbers did not
   vary between inexperienced and experienced subjects indicating that
   astrocyte processes may differentially project to sex-relevant
   glutamatergic synapses or that glutamatergic innervation of the mPOA
   changes as a function of sexual experience.}},

   assessment of cognitive function has yet to be completed. Rats,
   containing a biallelic deletion of the NRNX1-alpha gene on a Sprague
   Dawley background were compared to littermate wild types across a range
   of tasks designed to test functional domains disrupted in ASD and other
   neurodevelopmental disorders, including sensory perception (prepulse
   inhibition), attention (latent inhibition), associative learning
   (instrumental and Pavlovian conditioning), and memory (rewarded
   alternation T maze and spatial discrimination). NRXN1 alpha KO rats were
   found to present with large and persistent nonsocial deficits, including
   hyperactivity, deficits in simple instrumental learning, latent
   inhibition, and spatial-dependent learning. No deficit in sensorimotor
   gating was observed, despite the presence of an exaggerated startle
   response. Although KO animals were also able to learn a simple Pavlovian
   conditioning discrimination, they did display impaired latent
   inhibition. The presence of pronounced impairments in several domains in
   NRXN1 alpha KO rats clearly suggests that nonsocial cognitive deficits
   can also be measured in an animal model of ASD. Further exploration of
   those deficits, both clinically and preclinically, as planned in the
   Innovative Medicines Initiative's European Autism Interventions: A
   Multicenter Study for Developing New Medications program, may help to
   better understand the brain circuitry involved in ASD and therefore open
   new avenues to advance novel therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Psychometric studies suggest that observed self-concept deficits in
   addicted massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) are
   compensated through the replacement of their ideal (i. e., how an
   individual would like to be) by their own avatar (i. e., graphical agent
   in the virtual world). Neurobiological studies indicate that increased
   identification with their own avatar in regular MMORPG gamers is
   possibly reflected by enhanced avatar-referential brain activation in
   the left angular gyrus (AG). However, the neurobiological correlates
   reflecting the relations of the avatar to addicted gamers' self and
   ideal are still unexplored. Therefore, we compare these relations
   between addicted and nonaddicted MMORPG gamers. A sample of n = 15
   addicted and n = 17 nonaddicted players underwent functional MRI (fMRI)
   while completing a Giessen-Test (GT)-derived paradigm assessing self-,
   ideal-, and avatar-related self-concept domains. Neurobiological
   analyses included the comparisons avatar versus self, avatar versus
   ideal, and avatar versus self, ideal. Psychometrically, addicts showed
   significantly lower scores on the self-concept subscale of `social
   resonance,' that is, social popularity. In all avatar-related contrasts,
   within-group comparisons showed addicted players to exhibit
   significantly higher brain activations in the left AG. The
   between-groups comparisons revealed avatar-related left AG
   hyperactivations in addicts. Our results may suggest that addicted
   MMORPG players identify significantly more with their avatar than
   nonaddicted gamers. The concrete avatar might increasingly replace the
   rather abstract ideal in the transition from normal-controlled to
   addictive-compulsive MMORPG usage.}},

Title = {{Age Differences in Prenatal Testosterone's Protective Effects on

Abstract = {{Prenatal testosterone exposure may be protective against disordered
   eating. However, prior studies have produced mixed results.
   Developmental differences in prenatal testosterone's protective effects
   on disordered eating may explain these discrepancies. Indeed, studies
   have differed in the age of participants assessed, with data supporting
   prenatal testosterone effects on disordered eating in early adolescent
   and young adult samples but not in late adolescence. The present studies
   are the first to investigate age differences in prenatal testosterone's
   protective effects on disordered eating. Two indirect markers of higher
   prenatal testosterone were examined: (a) lower finger-length ratios
   (Study 1: index {[}2D]/ring {[}4D] finger {[}2D: 4D]) and (b) lower
   disordered eating in female s from opposite-sex twin pairs (who are
   thought to be exposed to higher prenatal testosterone from their male
   co-twin) relative to female controls (Study 2). Participants were twins
   from the Michigan State University Twin Registry (Study 1: n = 409;
   Study 2: n = 1,538) in early adolescence, late adolescence, or young
   adulthood. Disordered eating was assessed with well-validated
   questionnaires. Finger-length ratios were measured from hand scans,
   using electronic computer calipers. Findings were consistent across both
   studies. Higher prenatal testosterone (lower 2D: 4D; females from
   opposite-sex twin pairs vs. controls) predicted lower disordered eating
   in early adolescence and young adulthood only. Prenatal
   testosterone-disordered eating associations were not observed during
   late adolescence. Results point to the possibility of developmental
   windows of expression for prenatal testosterone's protective effects on
   disordered eating and suggest that prior discrepant results may reflect
   age differences across samples.}},

Abstract = {{Nicotine addiction is most likely a result of a combination of factors
   including the rewarding effects of the drug; these effects, however,
   might be influenced by genetic background. Using a conditioned place
   preference (CPP) paradigm and 8 inbred mouse strains, we conducted an
   initial examination of the role of genetic background in the rewarding
   effects of nicotine. Following habituation and initial place preference
   test, inbred strains (A/J, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, CBA/J, DBA/1J,
   DBA/2J, and 129/SvEv) were trained and tested in CPP for nicotine (0.35
   mg/kg). Although several strains (C57BL/6J, CBA/J, and 129/SvEv) showed
   nicotine-induced CPP, 1 strain (DBA/1J) showed conditioned place
   aversion (CPA), and other strains (A/J, BALB/cByJ, C3H/HeJ, and DBA/2J)
   did not show CPP. Overall, these results indicate that nicotine's
   rewarding effects tested in CPP are differentially affected by the
   genetic background, and this trait has a relatively high heritability
   (42\%-57\%). This initial investigation lays the foundation for future
   studies examining the genetic substrates of nicotine reward.}},

Volume = {{129}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{42-49}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{An intense but task-irrelevant auditory accessory stimulus that is
   presented almost simultaneously with a visual imperative stimulus can
   reduce reaction times (RTs) to that stimulus. The information-processing
   locus and neural underpinnings underlying this phasic alerting effect
   are still poorly understood. The authors investigated a possible
   noradrenergic or cholinergic basis of the accessory stimulus effect in a
   double-blind pharmacological study (N = 18), in which healthy
   participants received a single dose of clonidine (an alpha(2)-adrenergic
   agonist), scopolamine (a muscarinic antagonist), and placebo in separate
   test sessions. A backward-masking procedure was used to examine, for the
   first time, the effect of accessory stimuli on perceptual sensitivity.
   The authors found that accessory stimuli enhanced perceptual sensitivity
   and decreased RTs to target stimuli, consistent with a recent hypothesis
   that phasic alerting speeds up stimulus encoding. In contrast to the
   authors' expectations, clonidine increased the accessory stimulus
   effect, a finding that seems at odds with earlier proposals that phasic
   alerting effects are mediated by a phasic noradrenergic response.
   Furthermore, the accessory stimulus effect was modulated to a similar
   extent by clonidine and scopolamine, suggesting that the effect of
   clonidine was not specific to the noradrenergic system. The results
   instead suggest that clonidine and scopolamine decrease general
   alertness and that these drug-related reductions in alertness yield room
   for compensatory performance improvements by phasic alerting.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{7-15}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT)
   facilitates various forms of sensitivity to others, but the mechanism by
   which OT enhances empathy in humans is unclear. In this study, we
   examined whether OT increases empathy by the way of blurring the
   distinction between self and other, or by enhancing the difference
   between self and other. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled,
   within-subject crossover design, empathic responses of healthy
   participants were compared when imagining oneself (i.e.,
   self-perspective empathy) versus when imagining the other (i.e.,
   other-perspective empathy) in painful and nonpainful situations. Under
   OT treatment, participants expressed more empathy when imagining others
   than when imagining oneself in pain. This was in contrast to the placebo
   condition where there were no differences between the empathic responses
   during the self- and the other-perspective. We propose that the
   modulatory effect of OT on empathy when taking the other-perspective may
   be mediated by its role in self- and other-distinctiveness and corollary
   by its role in increasing salience to social agents and cues.}},

Abstract = {{Although active listening is an influential behavior, which can affect
   the social responses of others, the neural correlates underlying its
   perception have remained unclear. Sensing active listening in social
   interactions is accompanied by an improvement in the recollected
   impressions of relevant experiences and is thought to arouse positive
   feelings. We therefore hypothesized that the recognition of active
   listening activates the reward system, and that the emotional appraisal
   of experiences that had been subject to active listening would be
   improved. To test these hypotheses, we conducted functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) on participants viewing assessments of their
   own personal experiences made by evaluators with or without active
   listening attitude. Subjects rated evaluators who showed active
   listening more positively. Furthermore, they rated episodes more
   positively when they were evaluated by individuals showing active
   listening. Neural activation in the ventral striatum was enhanced by
   perceiving active listening, suggesting that this was processed as
   rewarding. It also activated the right anterior insula, representing
   positive emotional reappraisal processes. Furthermore, the mentalizing
   network was activated when participants were being evaluated,
   irrespective of active listening behavior. Therefore, perceiving active
   listening appeared to result in positive emotional appraisal and to
   invoke mental state attribution to the active listener.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional processing deficits have recently been identified in
   individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI), specifically in the
   domain of facial affect recognition. However, the neural networks
   underlying these impairments have yet to be identified. In the current
   study, 42 individuals with moderate to severe TBI and 23 healthy
   controls performed a task of facial affect recognition (Facial Emotion
   Identification Test (FEIT)) in order to assess their ability to identify
   and discriminate six emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise,
   shame, and fear. These individuals also underwent structural
   neuroimaging including diffusion tensor imaging to examine white matter
   (WM) integrity. Correlational analyses were performed to determine where
   in the brain WM damage was associated with performance on the facial
   affect recognition task. Reduced performance on the FEIT was associated
   with reduced WM integrity (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity,
   axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity) in the inferior longitudinal
   fasciculus and inferior-fronto-occipital fasciculus in individuals with
   TBI. Poor performance on the task was additionally associated with
   reduced gray matter (GM) volume in lingual gyrus and parahippocampal
   gyrus. The results implicate a pattern of WM and GM damage in TBI that
   may play a role in emotional processing impairments.}},

Abstract = {{Although we often seek social feedback (SFB) from others to help us make
   decisions, little is known about how SFB affects decisions under risk,
   particularly from a close peer. We conducted two experiments using an
   established framing task to probe how decision-making is modulated by
   SFB valence (positive, negative) and the level of closeness with
   feedback provider (friend, confederate). Participants faced
   mathematically equivalent decisions framed as either an opportunity to
   keep (gain frame) or lose (loss frame) part of an initial endowment.
   Periodically, participants were provided with positive (e.g.,
   ``Nice!{''}) or negative (e.g., ``Lame!{''}) feedback about their
   choices. Such feedback was provided by either a confederate (Experiment
   1) or a gender-matched close friend (Experiment 2). As expected, the
   framing effect was observed in both experiments. Critically, an
   individual's susceptibility to the framing effect was modulated by the
   valence of the SFB, but only when the feedback provider was a close
   friend. This effect was reflected in the activation patterns of
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, regions
   involved in complex decision-making. Taken together, these results
   highlight social closeness as an important factor in understanding the
   impact of SFB on neural mechanisms of decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Social exclusion, ostracism, and rejection can be emotionally painful
   because they thwart the need to belong. Building on studies suggesting
   that the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) is associated
   with regulation of negative emotions, the present experiment tests the
   hypothesis that decreasing the cortical excitability of the rVLPFC may
   increase negative emotional reactions to social exclusion. Specifically,
   we applied cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over
   the rVLPFC and predicted an increment of negative emotional reactions to
   social exclusion. In Study 1, participants were either socially excluded
   or included, while cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation was applied over
   the rVLPFC. Cathodal stimulation of rVLPFC boosted the typical negative
   emotional reaction caused by social exclusion. No effects emerged from
   participants in the inclusion condition. To test the specificity of tDCS
   effects over rVLPFC, in Study 2, participants were socially excluded and
   received cathodal tDCS or sham stimulation over a control region (i.e.,
   the right posterior parietal cortex). No effects of tDCS stimulation
   were found. Our results showed that the rVLPFC is specifically involved
   in emotion regulation and suggest that cathodal stimulation can increase
   negative emotional responses to social exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Exclusionary social events are known to cause alterations in neural
   activity and attention-related processes. However, the precise nature of
   these neural adjustments remains unknown as previous research has been
   limited to examining social interactions and exclusionary events as
   unitary phenomena. To address this limitation, we assessed neural
   activity during both inclusionary and exclusionary social interactions
   by examining event-related brain potentials at multiple points within
   each social event. Our results show an initial enhancement of anterior
   cingulate cortex -related activation, indexed by the anterior N2, in
   response to specific exclusionary events followed by an enhanced
   attentional orienting response, indexed by the P3a, to later segments of
   each exclusionary event. Decreases in this P3a activation from social
   inclusion to social exclusion were associated with self-reported
   increases in anxiety, negative affect, and feelings of depression from
   inclusion to exclusion. Together, these findings provide novel insights
   into the dynamic and ongoing neural processes associated with
   attentional allocation toward social exclusion and the nature of the
   relationships between neural and behavioral reactions to exclusionary

Abstract = {{The relationship between autistic traits and gaze-oriented attention to
   fearful and happy faces was investigated at the behavioral and neuronal
   levels. Upright and inverted dynamic face stimuli were used in a
   gaze-cueing paradigm while event related potentials (ERPs) were
   recorded. Participants responded faster to gazed-at than to non-gazed-at
   targets, and this gaze orienting effect (GOE) diminished with inversion,
   suggesting it relies on facial configuration. It was also larger for
   fearful than happy faces but only in participants with high
   autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) scores. While the GOE to fearful faces was
   of similar magnitude regardless of AQ scores, a diminished GOE to happy
   faces was found in participants with high AQ scores. At the ERP level, a
   congruency effect on target-elicited P1 component reflected enhanced
   visual processing of gazed-at targets. In addition, cue-triggered early
   directing attention negativity and anterior directing attention
   negativity reflected, respectively, attention orienting and attention
   holding at gazed-at locations. These neural markers of spatial attention
   orienting were not modulated by emotion and were not found in
   participants with high AQ scores. Together, these findings suggest that

   descriptions elicited a larger positivity in the ERP than the names
   associated with negative descriptions. The results indicate that the
   emotional valence of person names attached to person perception can be
   dynamically influenced by short descriptions of the target person,

Abstract = {{We provide the first high-temporal resolution account of the self-esteem
   implicit association test (IAT; Greenwald \& Farnham, 2000) to highlight
   important similarities and differences between the cognitive processes
   corresponding to implicit valenced self-processing in high vs. low
   self-esteem individuals. We divided individuals into high and low
   self-esteem groups based on the Rosenberg self-esteem scale (Rosenberg,
   1965) and administered the self-esteem IAT while recording
   electroencephalographic data. We show that the P2 captured group (high
   vs. low self-esteem) differences, the N250 and the late parietal
   positivity (LPP) captured differences corresponding to category pairing
   (self/positive vs. self/negative pairing), and the N1, P2, and P300-400
   components captured interactions between self-esteem groups and whether
   the self was paired with positive or negative categories in the IAT.
   Overall, both high and low self-esteem groups were sensitive to the
   distinction between positive and negative information in relation to the
   self (me/negative generally displayed larger event-related potential
   amplitudes than me/positive), but for high self-esteem individuals, this
   difference was generally larger, earlier, and most pronounced over
   left-hemisphere electrodes. These electrophysiological differences may
   reflect differences in attentional resources devoted to teasing apart
   these two oppositely valenced associations. High self-esteem individuals
   appear to devote more automatic (early) attentional resources to
   strengthen the distinction between positively or negatively valenced
   information in relation to the self.}},

Title = {{OT promotes closer interpersonal distance among highly empathic

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{3-9}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The space between people, or `interpersonal distance', creates and
   defines the dynamics of social interactions and is a salient cue
   signaling responsiveness and feeling comfortable. This distance is
   implicit yet clearly felt, especially if someone stands closer or
   farther away than expected. Increasing evidence suggests that Oxytocin
   (OT) serves as a social hormone in humans, and that one of its roles may
   be to alter the perceptual salience of social cues. Considering that
   empathic ability may shape the way individuals process social stimuli,
   we predicted that OT will differentially affect preferred interpersonal
   distance depending on individual differences in empathy. Participants
   took part in two interpersonal distance experiments: In the first, they
   had to stop a (computer visualized) protagonist when feeling most
   comfortable; in the second, they were asked to choose the room in which
   they would later discuss intimate topics with another. Both experiments
   revealed an interaction between the effect of OT and empathy level.
   Among highly empathic individuals, OT promoted the choice of closer
   interpersonal distances. Yet, OT had an opposite effect on individuals
   with low empathic traits. We conclude that the enhancement of social
   cues following OT administration may have opposite effects on
   individuals with different empathic abilities.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{10-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Although numerous neuroimaging studies have examined what happens when
   individuals are instructed to regulate their emotions, we rarely receive
   such instruction in everyday life. This study sought to examine what
   underlies uninstructed modulation of negative affect by examining neural
   responses when `responding naturally' to negative stimuli-and for
   comparison-during instructed reappraisal of negative stimuli as well.
   Two analyses were conducted to identify how variability in negative
   affect related to neural responses when responding naturally. First, in
   a within-participant analysis, lower levels of self-reported negative
   affect on a given trial were associated with recruitment of dorsolateral
   and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC)-brain regions also active during
   instructed reappraisal-whereas higher levels of negative affect were
   associated with recruitment of the amygdala-a region that responded more
   strongly overall to negative than neutral stimuli. Second, in a
   between-participant analysis, lower levels of average self-reported
   negative affect were associated with recruitment of ventromedial PFC.
   These results suggest that uninstructed modulation of emotion involves a
   combination of two types of regulatory processes, with moment-to-moment
   modulation depending on prefrontal regions that support reappraisal and
   individual differences in modulation depending on ventromedial PFC, a
   region involved in fear extinction.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-27}},

Abstract = {{Many functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have explored the
   neural correlates of social pain that results from social threat,
   exclusion, rejection, loss or negative evaluation. Although activations
   have consistently been reported within the anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC), it remains unclear which ACC subdivision is particularly
   involved. To provide a quantitative estimation of the specific
   involvement of ACC subdivisions in social pain, we conducted a
   voxel-based meta-analysis. The literature search identified 46 articles
   that included 940 subjects, the majority of which used the cyberball
   task. Significant likelihoods of activation were found in both the
   ventral and dorsal ACC for both social pain elicitation and
   self-reported distress during social pain. Self-reported distress
   involved more specifically the subgenual and pregenual ACC than social
   pain-related contrasts. The cyberball task involved the anterior
   midcingulate cortex to a lesser extent than other experimental tasks.
   During social pain, children exhibited subgenual activations to a
   greater extent than adults. Finally, the ventro-dorsal gradient of ACC
   activations in cyberball studies was related to the length of exclusion
   phases. The present meta-analysis contributes to a better understanding
   of the role of ACC subdivisions in social pain, and it could be of
   particular importance for guiding future studies of social pain and its
   neural underpinnings.}},

Abstract = {{Most theories of emotion hold that negative stimuli are threatening and
   aversive. Yet in everyday experiences some negative sights (e.g. car
   wrecks) attract curiosity, whereas others repel (e.g. a weapon pointed
   in our face). To examine the diversity in negative stimuli, we employed
   four classes of visual images (Direct Threat, Indirect Threat, Merely
   Negative and Neutral) in a set of behavioral and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging studies. Participants reliably discriminated between
   the images, evaluating Direct Threat stimuli most quickly, and Merely
   Negative images most slowly. Threat images evoked greater and earlier
   blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activations in the amygdala and
   periaqueductal gray, structures implicated in representing and
   responding to the motivational salience of stimuli. Conversely, the
   Merely Negative images evoked larger BOLD signal in the
   para-hippocampal, retrosplenial, and medial prefrontal cortices, regions
   which have been implicated in contextual association processing.
   Ventrolateral as well as medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices were
   activated by both threatening and Merely Negative images. In conclusion,
   negative visual stimuli can repel or attract scrutiny depending on their
   current threat potential, which is assessed by dynamic shifts in
   large-scale brain network activity.}},

Abstract = {{Trait impulsivity is characterized by behavioral disinhibition and rash
   decision-making that contribute to many maladaptive behaviors. Previous
   research demonstrates that trait impulsivity is related to the activity
   of brain regions underlying reward sensitivity and emotion regulation,
   but little is known about this relationship in the context of
   immediately available primary reward. This is unfortunate, as
   impulsivity in these contexts can lead to unhealthy behaviors, including
   poor food choices, dangerous drug use and risky sexual practices. In
   addition, little is known about the relationship between integration of
   reward and affective neurocircuitry, as measured by resting-state
   functional connectivity, and trait impulsivity in everyday life, as
   measured with a commonly used personality inventory. We therefore asked
   healthy adults to undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging task
   in which they saw cues indicating the imminent oral administration of
   rewarding taste, as well as a resting-state scan. Trait impulsivity was
   associated with increased activation during anticipation of primary
   reward in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala.
   Additionally, resting-state functional connectivity between the ACC and
   the right amygdala was negatively correlated with trait impulsivity.
   These findings demonstrate that trait impulsivity is related not only to
   ACC-amygdala activation but also to how tightly coupled these regions
   are to one another.}},

   with relaxation influences the reaction of the participant to a correct
   solution. The event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging showed
   greater activity, mainly distributed in the right cingulate gyrus (CG),
   insula, putamen, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and the bilateral middle
   frontal gyrus (MFG), the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and the superior
   temporal gyrus (STG). This pattern of activation was greater following 5
   h of meditation training than the same amount of relaxation. Based on
   prior research, we speculate on the function of this pattern of brain
   activity: (i) CG may be involved in detecting conflict and breaking
   mental set, (ii) MFG/IFG may play an important role in restructuring of
   the problem representation, (iii) insula, IPL and STG may be associated
   with error detection, problem understanding or general attentive control
   and (iv) putamen may be activated by `Aha' feeling.}},

Abstract = {{Life satisfaction of migrants to Australia from 17 countries, assessed
   at 4-5 months, 16-17 months and 3 parts per thousand years after

   results indicated that migrants were more satisfied, if the national
   average life satisfaction was higher in their country of origin, after
   adjustment for individual-level income, age, and sex and a linear
   temporal trend. Simultaneously, the migrants were also happier if people
   in their country of origin had a higher frequency of 5-HTT long allele,
   a genotype known to be associated with resilience under life stresses.
   These two relationships were independent, suggesting that both culture

Abstract = {{Previous studies have revealed an increased fractional anisotropy and
   greater thickness in the anterior parts of the corpus callosum in
   meditation practitioners compared with control subjects. Altered
   callosal features may be associated with an altered inter-hemispheric
   integration and the degree of brain asymmetry may also be shifted in
   meditation practitioners. Therefore, we investigated differences in gray
   matter asymmetry as well as correlations between gray matter asymmetry
   and years of meditation practice in 50 long-term meditators and 50
   controls. We detected a decreased rightward asymmetry in the precuneus
   in meditators compared with controls. In addition, we observed that a
   stronger leftward asymmetry near the posterior intraparietal sulcus was
   positively associated with the number of meditation practice years. In a
   further exploratory analysis, we observed that a stronger rightward
   asymmetry in the pregenual cingulate cortex was negatively associated
   with the number of practice years. The group difference within the
   precuneus, as well as the positive correlations with meditation years in
   the pregenual cingulate cortex, suggests an adaptation of the default
   mode network in meditators. The positive correlation between meditation
   practice years and asymmetry near the posterior intraparietal sulcus may
   suggest that meditation is accompanied by changes in attention
   processing.}},

Title = {{Variety in emotional life: within-category typicality of emotional

Abstract = {{The tremendous variability within categories of human emotional
   experience receives little empirical attention. We hypothesized that
   atypical instances of emotion categories (e.g. pleasant fear of
   thrill-seeking) would be processed less efficiently than typical
   instances of emotion categories (e.g. unpleasant fear of violent threat)
   in large-scale brain networks. During a novel fMRI paradigm,
   participants immersed themselves in scenarios designed to induce
   atypical and typical experiences of fear, sadness or happiness (scenario
   immersion), and then focused on and rated the pleasant or unpleasant
   feeling that emerged (valence focus) in most trials. As predicted,
   reliably greater activity in the `default mode' network (including
   medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate) was observed for
   atypical (vs typical) emotional experiences during scenario immersion,
   suggesting atypical instances require greater conceptual processing to
   situate the socio-emotional experience. During valence focus, reliably
   greater activity was observed for atypical (vs typical) emotional
   experiences in the `salience' network (including anterior insula and
   anterior cingulate), suggesting atypical instances place greater demands
   on integrating shifting body signals with the sensory and social
   context. Consistent with emerging psychological construction approaches
   to emotion, these findings demonstrate that is it important to study the
   variability within common categories of emotional experience.}},

Abstract = {{Motor resonance (MR) contingent upon action observation is thought to
   occur largely automatically. Although recent studies suggest that this
   process is not completely impervious to top-down modulations, much less
   is known on the possible role of the moral connotation of observed
   action goal in modulating MR. Here, we explored whether observing
   actions with different moral connotations modulates MR and whether any
   modulation depends on the onlookers' personality. To this aim, we
   recorded motor potentials evoked by single-pulse transcranial magnetic
   stimulation from hand muscles of participants who were watching images
   of a model performing hand actions with the same postures and low-level
   goals (i.e. grasping an object) but with different moral connotations
   ('stealing a wallet' vs `picking up a notepaper'). Participants'
   personality traits were measured using the temperament and character
   inventory. Results show a selective suppression of corticospinal
   excitability during observation of immoral actions in individuals with
   high scores in harm avoidance, a personality trait characterized by
   excessive worrying and fearfulness. Thus, a combination of dispositional
   (personality traits) and situational (morality of an action) variables
   appears to influence MR with the observed actions.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined whether effortful emotion regulation has a
   protracted impact on subsequent affective appraisal, and even fewer have
   investigated this effect on a trial-by-trial basis. In this study, we
   hypothesized that engaging cognitive resources via reappraisal during a
   trial would result in a subsequent period of increased reactivity on the
   next trial, as quantified using event-related potentials and
   oscillations. Forty-eight healthy individuals passively viewed
   unpleasant and neutral pictures followed by an auditory instruction to
   either continue viewing normally or reappraise emotional response to
   pictures. Viewing unpleasant pictures yielded increased late positive
   potential (LPP) and decreased posterior alpha (8-13 Hz) compared with
   neutral pictures. A similar pattern was observed on trials that
   immediately `followed' emotion regulation instructions. Moreover,
   individuals with increased self-reported depressive symptoms showed
   greater LPP and alpha modulation following emotion regulation,
   suggesting that these responses may relate to compromised emotion
   regulation ability. This study demonstrates that cognitive reappraisal
   induces subsequent heightened reactivity that may reflect transient
   resource depletion, and these effects are more pronounced among those
   with increased depressive symptoms. Interventions that focus on emotion
   regulation might use these electrocortical markers to track changes in
   regulatory efficacy.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{When addicted individuals are exposed to drug-related stimuli, dopamine
   release is thought to mediate incentive salience attribution, increasing
   attentional bias, craving and drug seeking. It is unclear whether
   dopamine acts specifically on drug cues versus other rewards, and if
   these effects correspond with craving and other forms of cognitive bias.
   Here, we administered the dopamine D-2/D-3 agonist pramipexole (0.5 mg)
   to 16 tobacco smokers in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover
   design. Visual fixations on smoking and money images were recorded
   alongside smoking urges and fluency tasks. Pramipexole attenuated a
   marked bias in initial orienting towards smoking relative to money but
   did not alter a maintained attentional bias towards smoking. Pramipexole
   decreased urges to smoke retrospectively after the task but not on a
   state scale. Fewer smoking words were generated after pramipexole but
   phonological and semantic fluency were preserved. Although these
   treatment effects did not correlate with each other, changes in initial
   orienting towards smoking and money were inversely related to baseline
   scores. In conclusion, pramipexole can reduce the salience of an
   addictive drug compared with other rewards and elicit corresponding
   changes in smoking urges and cognitive bias. These reward-specific and
   baseline-dependent effects support an `inverted-U' shaped profile of
   dopamine in addiction.}},

   to sexual cues might lead a person to seek more intense, novel, possibly
   risky, sexual acts. In this study, event-related potentials were
   recorded in 64 men and women while they viewed a series of emotional,
   including explicit sexual, photographs. The motivational salience of the
   sexual cues was varied by including more and less explicit sexual
   images. Indeed, the more explicit sexual stimuli resulted in enhanced
   late positive potentials (LPP) relative to the less explicit sexual
   images. Participants with fewer sexual intercourse partners in the last
   year had reduced LPP amplitude to the less explicit sexual images than
   the more explicit sexual images, whereas participants with more partners
   responded similarly to the more and less explicit sexual images. This
   pattern of results is consistent with a greater responsivity model.
   Those who engage in more sexual behaviors consistent with risk are also
   more responsive to less explicit sexual cues.}},

Abstract = {{It is not clear whether self-stimuli are processed by the brain as
   highly familiar overlearned stimuli or as self-specific stimuli. This
   study examined the neural processes underlying discrimination of one's
   own voice (OV) compared with a familiar voice (FV) using
   electrophysiological methods. Event-related potentials were recorded
   while healthy subjects (n = 15) listened passively to oddball sequences
   composed of recordings of the French vowel /a/ pronounced either by the
   participant her/himself, or by a familiar person or an unknown person.
   The results indicated that, although mismatch negativity displayed
   similar peak latency and amplitude in both conditions, the amplitude of
   the subsequent P3a was significantly smaller in response to OV compared
   with a FV. This study therefore indicated that fewer pre-attentional
   processes are involved in the discrimination of one's OV than in the
   discrimination of FVs.}},

Abstract = {{This longitudinal study examines associations between baseline
   individual differences and developmental changes in reward {[}i.e.
   behavioral approach system (BAS)] sensitivity and relevant brain
   structures' volumes to prospective substance use initiation during
   adolescence. A community sample of adolescents ages 15-18 with no prior

   of regular alcohol use and/or any use of other substances) during a
   2-year follow-up period and for alcohol use frequency in the last year
   of the follow-up. Longitudinal `increases' in BAS sensitivity were
   associated with substance use initiation and increased alcohol use
   frequency during the follow-up. Moreover, adolescents with smaller left
   nucleus accumbens at baseline were more likely to initiate substance use
   during the follow-up period. This study provides support for the link
   between developmental increases in reward sensitivity and substance use
   initiation in adolescence. The study also emphasizes the potential
   importance of individual differences in volumes of subcortical regions

Abstract = {{This study compares brain activation during causal attribution to three
   different loci, the self, another person and the situation; and further
   explores correlations with clinical scales (i.e. depression, anxiety and
   autism) in a typical population. While they underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, 20 participants read short sentences about
   another person ('someone') who engaged in behaviors with the participant
   or made comments about the participant. The participants then attributed
   these behaviors to three attribution loci: themselves, the other person
   or the situation. The results revealed common activation across the
   three attribution loci in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ),
   left posterior superior temporal sulcus, precuneus and right temporal
   pole (TP). Comparisons between the attribution loci revealed very little
   differences, except for increased activation of the right TP while
   making attributions to the situation compared with the self. In
   addition, when making attributions to the situation or other persons for
   negative events, there were reliable correlations between low activity
   in the left TPJ and high levels of anxiety and problematic social
   interaction in autism. The results indicate that attributions to
   different loci are based on the same underlying brain process, which
   might be atypical among persons with anxiety or autism symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Somatic complaints can be important features of an individual's
   expression of anxiety. Anxiety-related traits are also risk factors for
   somatic symptoms. However, it is not known which neuroanatomical
   mechanisms may be responsible for this relationship. In this study, our
   first step was to use voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approaches to
   investigate the neuroanatomical basis underlying somatic complaints in a
   large sample of healthy subjects. We found a significant positive
   correlation between somatic complaints and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG)
   volume adjacent to the entorhinal cortex. Further analysis revealed that
   the interaction between PHG volume/entorhinal cortex and
   neuroticism-anxiety (N-Anx) predicted somatic complaints. Specifically,
   somatic complaints were associated with higher N-Anx for individuals
   with increased PHG volume. These findings suggest that increased PHG
   volume and higher trait anxiety can predict vulnerability to somatic
   complaints in the general population.}},

Abstract = {{Decades of research have demonstrated that a region of the right

   goal-directed actions, suggesting that these regions respond to
   characteristics of animate agents more generally. Here we propose a
   neural model for animacy detection composed of processing streams that
   are initially differentially sensitive to cues signaling animacy, but
   that ultimately act in concert to support reasoning about animate
   agents. We use dynamic causal modeling, a measure of effective
   connectivity, to demonstrate that the directional flow of information
   between the FG and pSTS is initially dependent on the characteristics of
   the animate agent presented, a key prediction of our proposed network

Abstract = {{Emotionally salient information is well attended and remembered. It has
   been shown that infatuated individuals have increased attention for
   their beloved. It is unknown whether this attention bias generalizes to
   information related to the beloved. Moreover, infatuated individuals
   report to remember trivial things about their beloved, but this has not
   yet been tested empirically. In two studies, we tested whether
   infatuated individuals have increased attention and memory for
   beloved-related information. In a passive viewing task (Study 1), the
   late positive potential, an event-related potential (ERP) component
   reflecting motivated attention, was enhanced for beloved-related vs
   friend-related words/phrases. In a recognition task (Study 2), memory
   performance and the frontal and parietal ERP old/new effects, reflecting
   familiarity and recollection, respectively, were not enhanced for
   beloved-related compared with friend-related words/phrases. In free
   recall tasks in both studies, memory was better for beloved-related than
   friend-related words/phrases. This research reveals that attention and
   memory are enhanced for beloved-related information. These attention and
   memory biases for beloved-related information were not due to valence,
   semantic relatedness, or experience, but to arousal. To conclude,
   romantic love has profound effects on cognition that play a clear role
   in daily life.}},

   action sequences exhibiting the range of our powers. In this paper, I
   present several arguments from cognitive neuropsychology, but also
   first-person analysis of experience, against this hypothesis. The claim
   that perceptual access to affordances is mediated by motor simulation
   processes rests on a misunderstanding of what affordances are, and comes
   up against a computational reality principle. Motor simulation cannot
   provide access to affordances because (i) the affordances we are aware
   of at each moment are too many for their realization to be simulated by
   the brain and (ii) affordances are not equivalent to currently or
   personally feasible actions. The explanatory significance of the
   simulation theory must then be revised downwards compared to what is
   claimed by most of its advocates. One additional challenge is to
   determine the prerequisite, in terms of cognitive processing, for the
   motor simulation mechanisms to work. To overcome the limitations of the
   simulation theory, I propose a new approach: the direct content
   specification hypothesis. This hypothesis states that, at least for the
   most basic actions of our behavioral repertoire, the action
   possibilities we are aware of through perception are directly specified
   by perceptual variables characterizing the content of our experience.
   The cognitive system responsible for the perception of action
   possibilities is consequently far more direct, in terms of cognitive
   processing, than what is stated by the simulation theory. To support
   this hypothesis I review evidence from current neuropsychological
   research, in particular data suggesting a phenomenon of `fossilization'
   of affordances. Fossilization can be defined as a gap between the
   capacities that are treated as available by the cognitive system and the
   capacities this system really has at its disposal. These considerations
   do not mean that motor simulation cannot contribute to explain how we
   gain perceptual knowledge of what we can do based on the memory of our
   past performances. However, when precisely motor simulation plays a role
   and what it is for exactly currently remain largely unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a common complication of central nervous
   system diseases such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and other
   neurological diseases, but it remains under-recognized and under-treated
   in the clinic. PBA caused by acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)
   has rarely been reported. Here, we report a 30-year-old Chinese woman
   who has experienced PBA from ADEM for 7 years. The patient's principal
   manifestations were extreme emotions or tears when she saw, heard, or
   spoke about sad news or other sad things; the durations of these
   unmanageable emotions were often less than 30 sec, and they occurred at
   frequencies that ranged from one to several times a day. Occasionally,
   she laughed uncontrollably while people were talking despite a lack of
   funny or sad stimuli in the conversation or the surrounding environment.
   Thus, her social functioning was impaired. This case indicates that the
   long-term PBA can occur secondarily to ADEM, and this possibility should
   be considered clinically to ensure timely identification and treatment.}},

   findings showing how the social context subtly influences the execution
   of object-oriented motor actions. Then, we show that the kinematic
   characteristics of object-oriented motor actions are modulated by the
   actor's social intention. Finally, we demonstrate that naive observers
   can implicitly take advantage of these kinematic effects for their own
   motor productions. Considered together, these data are compatible with
   the embodied cognition framework stating that cognition, and in our case

Title = {{Social interaction is associated with changes in infants' motor activity}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Background: In developmental research, infants are commonly assumed to
   be early stakeholders in interactions with their caregivers. The tools
   that infants can use to interact with others vary from visual contact to
   smiling or vocalizing, and also include motor activity. However,
   surprisingly few studies have explored how the nature and context of
   social interactions affect infants' engagement in motor activity.
   Methods: We investigated the kinematic properties of foot and face
   movements produced by 11 infants aged between 5 and 9 months during six
   contrasting dyadic episodes (i.e. passive presence of a stranger or the
   infant's mother, weak or intense interaction with the stranger/mother as
   she sings a nursery play song).
   Results: The infants' face and foot motor activity was significantly
   reduced during the interactive episodes, compared with the episodes
   without any interaction, in both the mother and stranger conditions.
   Furthermore, the level of their motor activity was significantly lower
   in the stranger condition than in the mother one for some parameters.
   Conclusion: These results are in line with those reported by previous
   studies and confirm the relevance of using motor activity to delineate
   the early forms of interactive episodes in infants.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the subject-performed task effect in healthy older adults:
   relationship with neuropsychological tests}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Background: An enhancement in recall of simple instructions is found
   when actions are performed in comparison to when they are verbally
   presented - the subject-performed task (SPT) effect. This enhancement
   has also been found with older adults. However, the reason why older
   adults, known to present a deficit in episodic memory, have a better
   performance for this type of information remains unclear. In this
   article, we explored this effect by comparing the performance on the SPT
   task with the performance on other tasks, in order to understand the
   underlying mechanisms that may explain this effect.
   Objective: We hypothesized that both young and older adult groups should
   show higher recall in SPT compared with the verbal learning condition,
   and that the differences between age groups should be lower in the SPT
   condition. We aimed to explore the correlations between these tasks and
   known neuropsychological tests, and we also measured source memory for
   the encoding condition.
   Design: A mixed design was used with 30 healthy older adults, comparing
   their performance with 30 healthy younger adults. Each participant was
   asked to perform 16 simple instructions (SPT condition) and to only read
   the other 16 instructions (Verbal condition - VT). The test phase
   included a free recall task. Participants were also tested with a set of
   neuropsychological measures (speed of processing, working memory and
   verbal episodic memory).
   Results: The SPT effect was found for both age groups; but even for SPT
   materials, group differences in recall persisted. Source memory was
   found to be preserved for the two groups. Simple correlations suggested
   differences in correlates of SPT performance between the two groups.
   However, when controlling for age, the SPT and VT tasks correlate with
   each other, and a measure of episodic memory correlated moderately with
   both SPT and VT performance.
   Conclusions: A strong effect of SPT was observed for all but one, which
   still displayed the expected aging deficit. The correlations and source
   memory data suggest that the SPTand VT are possibly related in respect
   to their underlying processes, and SPT, instead of being an isolated
   process, is in connection with both the episodic memory and executive
   function processes. Under these circumstances, the SPT seems to
   contribute to an enhancement of the episodic memory trace, presumably
   from the multimodality it provides, without involving a separated set of
   cognitive mechanisms. Future research using more pure measures of other
   cognitive processes that could be related to SPT is necessary.}},

   insights from children with typical and atypical development}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Motor memory is the process by which humans can adopt both persistent
   and flexible motor behaviours. Persistence and flexibility can be
   assessed through the examination of the cooperation/competition between
   new and old motor routines in the motor memory repertoire. Two paradigms
   seem to be particularly relevant to examine this
   competition/cooperation. First, a manual search task for hidden objects,
   namely the C-notB task, which allows examining how a motor routine may
   influence the selection of action in toddlers. The second paradigm is
   procedural learning, and more precisely the consolidation stage, which
   allows assessing how a previously learnt motor routine becomes resistant
   to subsequent programming or learning of a new - competitive - motor
   routine. The present article defends the idea that results of both
   paradigms give precious information to understand the evolution of motor
   routines in healthy children. Moreover, these findings echo some
   clinical observations in developmental neuropsychology, particularly in
   children with Developmental Coordination Disorder. Such studies suggest
   that the level of equilibrium between persistence and flexibility of
   motor routines is an index of the maturity of the motor system.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin is thought to play a central role in promoting close social
   bonds via influence on social interactions. The current investigation
   targeted interactions involving expressed gratitude between members of
   romantic relationships because recent evidence suggests gratitude and
   its expression provides behavioral and psychological `glue' to bind
   individuals closer together. Specifically, we took a genetic approach to
   test the hypothesis that social interactions involving expressed
   gratitude would be associated with variation in a gene, CD38, which has
   been shown to affect oxytocin secretion. A polymorphism (rs6449182) that
   affects CD38 expression was significantly associated with global
   relationship satisfaction, perceived partner responsiveness and positive
   emotions (particularly love) after lab-based interactions, observed
   behavioral expression of gratitude toward a romantic partner in the lab,
   and frequency of expressed gratitude in daily life. A separate
   polymorphism in CD38 (rs3796863) previously associated with plasma
   oxytocin levels and social engagement was also associated with perceived
   responsiveness in the benefactor after an expression of gratitude. The
   combined influence of the two polymorphisms was associated with a broad
   range of gratitude-related behaviors and feelings. The consistent
   pattern of findings suggests that the oxytocin system is associated with
   solidifying the glue that binds adults into meaningful and important

Abstract = {{Humans are willing to punish norm violations even at a substantial
   personal cost. Using fMRI and a variant of the ultimatum game and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated how the brain
   differentially responds to fairness in loss and gain domains.
   Participants (responders) received offers from anonymous partners
   indicating a division of an amount of monetary gain or loss. If they
   accept, both get their shares according to the division; if they reject,
   both get nothing or lose the entire stake. We used a computational model
   to derive perceived fairness of offers and participant-specific inequity
   aversion. Behaviorally, participants were more likely to reject unfair
   offers in the loss (vs gain) domain. Neurally, the positive correlation
   between fairness and activation in ventral striatum was reduced, whereas
   the negative correlations between fairness and activations in
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were enhanced in the loss domain.
   Moreover, rejection-related dorsal striatum activation was higher in the
   loss domain. Furthermore, the gain-loss domain modulates costly
   punishment only when unfair behavior was directed toward the
   participants and not when it was directed toward others. These findings
   provide neural and computational accounts of increased costly norm
   enforcement under adversity and advanced our understanding of the
   context-dependent nature of fairness preference.}},

Abstract = {{When facing strangers, one of the first evaluations people perform is to
   implicitly assess their trustworthiness. However, the underlying
   processes supporting trustworthiness appraisal are poorly understood. We
   hypothesized that visual working memory (VWM) maintains online face
   representations that are sensitive to physical cues of trustworthiness,
   and that differences among individuals in representing untrustworthy
   faces are associated with individual differences in anxiety.
   Participants performed a change detection task that required encoding
   and maintaining for a short interval the identity of one face
   parametrically manipulated to be either trustworthy or untrustworthy.
   The sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), an
   event-related component (ERP) time-locked to the onset of the face, was
   used to index the resolution of face representations in VWM. Results
   revealed greater SPCN amplitudes for trustworthy faces when compared
   with untrustworthy faces, indicating that VWM is sensitive to physical
   cues of trustworthiness, even in the absence of explicit trustworthiness
   appraisal. In addition, differences in SPCN amplitude between
   trustworthy and untrustworthy faces correlated with participants'
   anxiety, indicating that healthy college students with sub-clinical high
   anxiety levels represented untrustworthy faces in greater detail
   compared with students with sub-clinical low anxiety levels. This
   pattern of findings is discussed in terms of the high flexibility of
   aversive/avoidance and appetitive/approach motivational systems.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 60 years, human intracranial electrophysiology (HIE) has
   been used to characterize seizures in patients with epilepsy. Secondary
   to the clinical objectives, electrodes implanted intracranially have
   been used to investigate mechanisms of human cognition. In addition to
   studies of memory and language, HIE methods have been used to
   investigate emotions. The aim of this review is to outline the
   contribution of HIE (electrocorticography, single-unit recording and
   electrical brain stimulation) to our understanding of the neural
   representations of emotions. We identified 64 papers dating back to the
   mid-1950s which used HIE techniques to study emotional states. Evidence
   from HIE studies supports the existence of widely distributed networks
   in the neocortex, limbic/paralimbic regions and subcortical nuclei which
   contribute to the representation of emotional states. In addition,
   evidence from HIE supports hemispheric dominance for emotional valence.
   Furthermore, evidence from HIE supports the existence of overlapping
   neural areas for emotion perception, experience and expression. Lastly,
   HIE provides unique insights into the temporal dynamics of neural
   activation during perception, experience and expression of emotional
   states. In conclusion, we propose that HIE techniques offer important
   evidence which must be incorporated into our current models of emotion
   representation in the human brain.}},

Abstract = {{Past research suggests that feeling understood enhances both personal
   and social well-being. However, little research has examined the
   neurobiological bases of feeling understood and not understood. We
   addressed these gaps by experimentally inducing felt understanding and
   not understanding as participants underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. The results demonstrated that feeling understood
   activated neural regions previously associated with reward and social
   connection (i.e. ventral striatum and middle insula), while not feeling
   understood activated neural regions previously associated with negative
   affect (i.e. anterior insula). Both feeling understood and not feeling
   understood activated different components of the mentalizing system
   (feeling understood: precuneus and temporoparietal junction; not feeling
   understood: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex). Neural responses were
   associated with subsequent feelings of social connection and
   disconnection and were modulated by individual differences in rejection
   sensitivity. Thus, this study provides insight into the psychological
   processes underlying feeling understood (or not) and may suggest new
   avenues for targeted interventions that amplify the benefits of feeling
   understood or buffer individuals from the harmful consequences of not
   feeling understood.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid responses to emotional words play a crucial role in social
   communication. This study employed event-related potentials to examine
   the time course of neural dynamics involved in emotional word
   processing. Participants performed a dual-target task in which positive,
   negative and neutral adjectives were rapidly presented. The early
   occipital P1 was found larger when elicited by negative words,
   indicating that the first stage of emotional word processing mainly
   differentiates between non-threatening and potentially threatening
   information. The N170 and the early posterior negativity were larger for
   positive and negative words, reflecting the emotional/non-emotional
   discrimination stage of word processing. The late positive component not
   only distinguished emotional words from neutral words, but also
   differentiated between positive and negative words. This represents the
   third stage of emotional word processing, the emotion separation.
   Present results indicated that, similar with the three-stage model of
   facial expression processing; the neural processing of emotional words
   can also be divided into three stages. These findings prompt us to
   believe that the nature of emotion can be analyzed by the brain
   independent of stimulus type, and that the three-stage scheme may be a
   common model for emotional information processing in the context of
   limited attentional resources.}},

Abstract = {{Several brain regions are important for processing self-location and
   first-person perspective, two important aspects of bodily
   self-consciousness. However, the interplay between these regions has not
   been clarified. In addition, while self-location and first-person
   perspective in healthy subjects are associated with bilateral activity
   in temporoparietal junction (TPJ), disturbed self-location and
   first-person perspective result from damage of only the right TPJ.
   Identifying the involved brain network and understanding the role of
   hemispheric specializations in encoding self-location and first-person
   perspective, will provide important information on system-level
   interactions neurally mediating bodily self-consciousness. Here, we used
   functional connectivity and showed that right and left TPJ are
   bilaterally connected to supplementary motor area, ventral premotor
   cortex, insula, intraparietal sulcus and occipitotemporal cortex.
   Furthermore, the functional connectivity between right TPJ and right
   insula had the highest selectivity for changes in self-location and
   first-person perspective. Finally, functional connectivity revealed
   hemispheric differences showing that self-location and first-person
   perspective modulated the connectivity between right TPJ, right
   posterior insula, and right supplementary motor area, and between left
   TPJ and right anterior insula. The present data extend previous evidence
   on healthy populations and clinical observations in neurological
   deficits, supporting a bilateral, but right-hemispheric dominant,
   network for bodily self-consciousness.}},

Abstract = {{Theory-of-mind (ToM) ability is foundational for successful social
   relationships, and dependent on a neurocognitive system, which includes
   temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex. Schizophrenia is
   associated with ToM impairments, and initial studies demonstrate
   similar, though more subtle deficits, in unaffected first-degree
   relatives, indicating that ToM deficits are a potential biomarker for
   the disorder. Importantly, the social consequences of ToM deficits could
   create an additional vulnerability factor for individuals at familial
   high risk (FHR). However, behavioral studies of ToM are inconsistent and
   virtually nothing is known about the neural basis of ToM in FHR or the
   relationship between ToM and social functioning. Here, FHR and non-FHR
   control participants underwent functional MRI scanning while reasoning
   about a story character's thoughts, emotions or physical appearance.
   Afterwards, participants completed a 28-day online `daily-diary'
   questionnaire in which they reported daily social interactions and
   degree of ToM reasoning. FHR participants demonstrated less neural
   activity in bilateral temporoparietal junction when reasoning about
   thoughts and emotions. Moreover, across all participants, the degree of
   neural activity during ToM reasoning predicted several aspects of daily
   social behavior. Results suggest that vulnerability for schizophrenia is
   associated with neurocognitive deficits in ToM and the degree of deficit
   is related to day-to-day social functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a genetic syndrome characterized by the
   presence of an extra X chromosome that appears to increase the risk of
   psychopathology, such as autism symptoms. This study used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to determine underlying mechanisms related to
   this risk, with the aim of gaining insight into neural mechanisms behind
   social-cognitive dysfunction in KS and autism, and understanding
   similarities and differences in social information processing deficits.
   Fourteen boys with KS, seventeen boys with autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD) and nineteen non-clinical male controls aged 10-18 years were
   scanned while matching and labeling facial expressions (i.e. face
   processing and affect labeling, respectively). No group differences in
   neural activation were found during face processing. However, during
   affect labeling, the ASD group showed increased activation in the
   amygdala compared with controls, while the KS group showed increased
   activation in frontal areas compared with both controls and the ASD
   group. No group differences in task performance were found. Although
   behavioral symptoms of social dysfunction appear similar both in boys
   with KS and ASD, this is the first study to demonstrate different
   underlying etiologies. These results may aid in identifying different
   pathways to autism symptoms, which may help understanding variability
   within the ASD spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Mood states have a strong impact on how we process incoming information.
   It has been proposed that positive mood facilitates elaborative,
   relational encoding, whereas negative mood promotes a more careful,
   stimulus-driven encoding style. Previous electrophysiological studies
   have linked successful information encoding to power increases in slow
   (< 8 Hz) delta/theta and fast (> 30 Hz) gamma oscillations, as well as
   to power decreases in midrange (8-30 Hz) alpha/beta oscillations.
   Whether different mood states modulate encoding-related oscillations has
   not been investigated yet. In order to address this question, we used an
   experimental mood induction procedure and recorded electroencephalograms
   from 20 healthy participants while they performed a free recall memory
   task after positive and negative mood induction. We found distinct
   oscillatory patterns in positive and negative mood. Successful encoding
   in positive mood was accompanied by widespread power increases in the
   delta band, whereas encoding success in negative mood was specifically
   accompanied by frontal power decreases in the beta band. On the
   behavioral level, memory performance was enhanced in positive mood. Our
   findings show that mood differentially modulates the neural correlates
   of successful information encoding and thus contribute to an
   understanding of how mood shapes different processing styles.}},

Abstract = {{We spend much of our daily lives imagining how we can reach future goals
   and what will happen when we attain them. Despite the prevalence of such
   goal-directed simulations, neuroimaging studies on planning have mainly
   focused on executive processes in the frontal lobe. This experiment
   examined the neural basis of process simulations, during which
   participants imagined themselves going through steps toward attaining a
   goal, and outcome simulations, during which participants imagined events
   they associated with achieving a goal. In the scanner, participants
   engaged in these simulation tasks and an odd/even control task. We
   hypothesized that process simulations would recruit default and
   frontoparietal control network regions, and that outcome simulations,
   which allow us to anticipate the affective consequences of achieving
   goals, would recruit default and reward-processing regions. Our analysis
   of brain activity that covaried with process and outcome simulations
   confirmed these hypotheses. A functional connectivity analysis with
   posterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior
   inferior parietal lobule seeds showed that their activity was correlated
   during process simulations and associated with a distributed network of
   default and frontoparietal control network regions. During outcome
   simulations, medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala seeds covaried
   together and formed a functional network with default and
   reward-processing regions.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have investigated the neural substrates supporting
   cognitive reappraisal, identifying the importance of cognitive control
   processes implemented by prefrontal cortex (PFC). This study examined
   how valence and attention affect the processes used for cognitive
   reappraisal by asking participants to passively view or to cognitively
   reappraise positive and negative images with full or divided attention.
   When participants simply viewed these images, results revealed few
   effects of valence or attention. However, when participants engaged in
   reappraisal, there was a robust effect of valence, with the reappraisal
   of negative relative to positive images associated with more widespread
   activation, including within regions of medial and lateral PFC. There
   also was an effect of attention, with more lateral PFC recruitment when
   regulating with full attention and more medial PFC recruitment when
   regulating with divided attention. Within two regions of medial PFC and
   one region of ventrolateral PFC, there was an interaction between
   valence and attention: in these regions, divided attention reduced
   activity during reappraisal of positive but not negative images.
   Critically, participants continued to report reappraisal success even
   during the Divided Attention condition. These results suggest multiple
   routes to successful cognitive reappraisal, depending upon image valence
   and the availability of attentional resources.}},

Abstract = {{The social brain hypothesis proposes that the large size of the primate
   neocortex evolved to support complex and demanding social interactions.
   Accordingly, recent studies have reported correlations between the size
   of an individual's social network and the density of gray matter (GM) in
   regions of the brain implicated in social cognition. However, the
   reported relationships between GM density and social group size are
   somewhat inconsistent with studies reporting correlations in different
   brain regions. One factor that might account for these discrepancies is
   the use of different measures of social network size (SNS). This study
   used several measures of SNS to assess the relationships SNS and GM
   density. The second goal of this study was to test the relationship
   between social network measures and functional brain activity.
   Participants performed a social closeness task using photos of their
   friends and unknown people. Across the VBM and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging analyses, individual differences in SNS were
   consistently related to structural and functional differences in three
   regions: the left amygdala, right amygdala and the right
   entorhinal/ventral anterior temporal cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Human context conditioning studies have focused on acquisition and
   extinction. Subsequent long-term changes in fear behaviors not only
   depend on associative learning processes during those phases but also on
   memory consolidation processes and the later ability to retrieve and
   express fear and extinction memories. Clinical theories explain relapse
   after successful exposure-based treatment with return of fear memories
   and remission with stable extinction memory expression. We probed
   contextual fear and extinction memories 1 week (Day8) after conditioning
   (Day1) and subsequent extinction (Day2) by presenting conditioned
   contexts before (Test1) and after (Test2) a reinstatement manipulation.
   We find consistent activation patterns in two independent samples:
   activation of a subgenual part of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   before reinstatement (Test1) and (albeit with different temporal
   profiles between samples) of the amygdala after reinstatement (Test2) as
   well as up-regulation of anterior hippocampus activity after
   reinstatement (Test2 > Test1). These areas have earlier been implicated
   in the expression of cued extinction and fear memories. The present
   results suggest a general role for these structures in defining the
   balance between fear and extinction memories, independent of the
   conditioning mode. The results are discussed in the light of hypotheses
   implicating the anterior hippocampus in the processing of situational
   ambiguity.}},

Abstract = {{Both children and adults with bipolar disorder (BD) exhibit face emotion
   labeling deficits and neural circuitry dysfunction in response to
   emotional faces. However, few studies have compared these groups
   directly to distinguish effects of age and diagnosis. Such studies are
   important to begin to elucidate the developmental trajectory of BD and
   facilitate its diagnosis, prevention and treatment. This functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study compares 41 individuals with BD (19
   children; 22 adults) and 44 age-matched healthy individuals (25
   children; 19 adults) when making explicit or implicit judgments about
   angry or happy face morphs across a range of emotion intensity. Linear
   trend analyses revealed that BD patients, irrespective of age, failed to
   recruit the amygdala in response to increasing angry face. This finding
   was no longer significant when the group was restricted to euthymic
   youth or those without comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
   although this may reflect low statistical power. Deficits in subgenual
   anterior cingulate modulation were observed in both patient groups but
   were related to implicit processing for child patients and explicit
   processing for adult patients. Abnormalities in face emotion labeling
   and the circuitry mediating it may be biomarkers of BD that are present

Abstract = {{When organisms confront unpleasant objects in their natural
   environments, they engage in behaviors that allow them to avoid aversive
   outcomes. Here, we linked visual processing of threat to its behavioral
   consequences by including a motor response that terminated exposure to
   an aversive event. Dense-array steady-state visual evoked potentials
   were recorded in response to conditioned threat and safety signals
   viewed in active or passive behavioral contexts. The amplitude of
   neuronal responses in visual cortex increased additively, as a function
   of emotional value and action relevance. The gain in local cortical
   population activity for threat relative to safety cues persisted when
   aversive reinforcement was behaviorally terminated, suggesting a
   lingering emotionally based response amplification within the visual
   system. Distinct patterns of long-range neural synchrony emerged between
   the visual cortex and extravisual regions. Increased coupling between
   visual and higher-order structures was observed specifically during
   active perception of threat, consistent with a reorganization of
   neuronal populations involved in linking sensory processing to action

Abstract = {{Evidence is accruing that people can maintain their emotional states,
   but how they do it and which brain regions are responsible still remains
   unclear. We examined whether people maintain emotional states
   `actively', with explicit elaboration of the emotion, or `passively',
   without elaboration. Twenty-four participants completed an emotion
   maintenance task in which they either maintained the emotional intensity
   from the first picture of a pair to compare to that of the second
   picture ('maintain' condition), or only rated their emotional response
   to the second picture ('non-maintain' condition). Supporting the
   `active' maintenance hypothesis, when maintaining vs not maintaining
   emotion, participants exhibited increased height and width of activation
   in the dorsal medial frontal cortex (MFC) and lateral prefrontal cortex,
   regions associated with explicit emotion generation and manipulation of
   contents in working memory, respectively. Supporting the `passive'
   maintenance hypothesis, however, when viewing negative emotional
   pictures (vs neutral pictures) that were not explicitly maintained,
   participants exhibited greater duration of activity in the rostral MFC,
   a region associated with implicit emotion generation. Supported by
   behavioral findings, this evidence that people maintain emotional states
   both naturally in the rMFC and strategically in the dMFC may be critical
   for understanding normal as well as disordered emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Deficits in facial mimicry have been widely reported in autism. Some
   studies have suggested that these deficits are restricted to spontaneous
   mimicry and do not extend to volitional mimicry. We bridge these
   apparently inconsistent observations by testing the impact of reward
   value on neural indices of mimicry and how autistic traits modulate this
   impact. Neutral faces were conditioned with high and low reward.
   Subsequently, functional connectivity between the ventral striatum (VS)
   and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was measured while neurotypical adults
   (n = 30) watched happy expressions made by these conditioned faces. We
   found greater VS-IFG connectivity in response to high reward vs low
   reward happy faces. This difference was negatively proportional to
   autistic traits, suggesting that reduced spontaneous mimicry of social
   stimuli seen in autism, may be related to a failure in the modulation of
   the mirror system by the reward system rather than a circumscribed
   deficit in the mirror system.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{According to many studies, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)
   encodes the subjective value of disparate rewards on a common scale.
   Yet, a host of other reward factors-likely represented outside of
   VMPFC-must be integrated to construct such signals for valuation. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested whether the
   interactions between posterior VMPFC and functionally connected brain
   regions predict subjective value. During fMRI scanning, participants
   rated the attractiveness of unfamiliar faces. We found that activation
   in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior VMPFC and caudate
   increased with higher attractiveness ratings. Using data from a
   post-scan task in which participants spent money to view attractive
   faces, we quantified each individual's subjective value for
   attractiveness. We found that connectivity between posterior VMPFC and
   regions frequently modulated by social information-including the
   temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) and middle temporal gyrus-was
   correlated with individual differences in subjective value. Crucially,
   these additional regions explained unique variation in subjective value
   beyond that extracted from value regions alone. These findings indicate
   not only that posterior VMPFC interacts with additional brain regions
   during valuation, but also that these additional regions carry
   information employed to construct the subjective value for social
   reward.}},

Abstract = {{Childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) has adverse effects on medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) morphology, a structure that is crucial for
   cognitive functioning and (emotional) memory and which modulates the
   limbic system. In addition, CEM has been linked to amygdala
   hyperactivity during emotional face processing. However, no study has
   yet investigated the functional neural correlates of neutral and
   emotional memory in adults reporting CEM. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we investigated CEM-related differential activations
   in mPFC during the encoding and recognition of positive, negative and
   neutral words. The sample (N = 194) consisted of patients with
   depression and/or anxiety disorders and healthy controls (HC) reporting
   CEM (n = 96) and patients and HC reporting no abuse (n = 98). We found a
   consistent pattern of mPFC hypoactivation during encoding and
   recognition of positive, negative and neutral words in individuals
   reporting CEM. These results were not explained by psychopathology or
   severity of depression or anxiety symptoms, or by gender, level of
   neuroticism, parental psychopathology, negative life events,
   antidepressant use or decreased mPFC volume in the CEM group. These
   findings indicate mPFC hypoactivity in individuals reporting CEM during
   emotional and neutral memory encoding and recognition. Our findings
   suggest that CEM may increase individuals' risk to the development of
   psychopathology on differential levels of processing in the brain;
   blunted mPFC activation during higher order processing and enhanced
   amygdala activation during automatic/lower order emotion processing.
   These findings are vital in understanding the long-term consequences of
   CEM.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral studies suggest a relationship between autobiographical

   determine whether remitted depressed patients show alterations in
   connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, a node in the
   default mode network) with the parahippocampal gyri (PHG, a region
   associated with autobiographical memory) while intensively recalling
   negative memories and whether this is related to daily life symptoms and
   to the further course of depression. Sad mood was induced with keywords
   of personal negative life events in participants with remitted
   depression (n = 29) and matched healthy controls (n = 29) during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, daily life
   assessments of mood and rumination and a 6-month follow-up were
   conducted. Remitted depressed participants showed greater connectivity
   than healthy controls of the PCC with the PHG, which was even stronger
   in patients with more previous episodes. Furthermore, patients with
   increased PCC-PHG connectivity showed a sadder mood and more rumination
   in daily life and a worsening of rumination and depression scores during
   follow-up. A relationship of negative autobiographical memory
   processing, rumination, sad mood and depression on a neural level seems
   likely. The identified increased connectivity probably indicates a
   `scar' of recurrent depression and may represent a prognostic factor for
   future depression.}},

Abstract = {{During social bargain, one has to both figure out the others' intentions
   and behave strategically in such a way that the others' behaviors will
   be consistent with one's expectations. To understand the neurobiological
   mechanisms underlying these behaviors, we used electroencephalography
   while subjects played as proposers in a repeated ultimatum game. We
   found that subjects adapted their offers to obtain more acceptances in
   the last round and that this adaptation correlated negatively with
   prefrontal theta oscillations. People with higher prefrontal theta
   activity related to a rejection did not adapt their offers along the
   game to maximize their earning. Moreover, between-subject variation in
   posterior theta oscillations correlated positively with how individual
   theta activity influenced the change of offer after a rejection,
   reflecting a process of behavioral adaptation to the others' demands.
   Interestingly, people adapted better their offers when they knew that
   they where playing against a computer, although the behavioral
   adaptation did not correlate with prefrontal theta oscillation.
   Behavioral changes between human and computer games correlated with
   prefrontal theta activity, suggesting that low adaptation in human games
   could be a strategy. Taken together, these results provide evidence for
   specific roles of prefrontal and posterior theta oscillations in social
   bargaining.}},

Abstract = {{Children born with an inhibited temperament are at heightened risk for
   developing anxiety, depression and substance use. Inhibited temperament
   is believed to have a biological basis; however, little is known about
   the structural brain basis of this vulnerability trait. Structural MRI
   scans were obtained from 84 (44 inhibited, 40 uninhibited) young adults.
   Given previous findings of amygdala hyperactivity in inhibited
   individuals, groups were compared on three measures of amygdala
   structure. To identify novel substrates of inhibited temperament, a
   whole brain analysis was performed. Functional activation and
   connectivity were examined across both groups. Inhibited adults had
   larger amygdala and caudate volume and larger volume predicted greater
   activation to neutral faces. In addition, larger amygdala volume
   predicted greater connectivity with subcortical and higher order visual
   structures. Larger caudate volume predicted greater connectivity with
   the basal ganglia, and less connectivity with primary visual and
   auditory cortex. We propose that larger volume in these salience
   detection regions may result in increased activation and enhanced
   connectivity in response to social stimuli. Given the strong link
   between inhibited temperament and risk for psychiatric illness, novel
   therapeutics that target these brain regions and related neural circuits
   have the potential to reduce rates of illness in vulnerable individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Neurobiological and behavioral findings suggest that the development of
   delinquent behavior is associated with atypical social-affective
   processing. However, to date, no study has examined neural processes
   associated with social interactions in severely antisocial adolescents.
   In this study we investigated the behavioral and neural processes
   underlying social interactions of juvenile delinquents and a matched
   control group. Participants played the mini-Ultimatum Game as a
   responder while in the MRI scanner. Participants rejected unfair offers
   significantly less when the other player had `no alternative' compared
   with a `fair' alternative, suggesting that they took the intentions of
   the other player into account. However, this effect was reduced in the
   juvenile delinquents. The neuroimaging results revealed that juvenile
   delinquents showed less activation in the temporal parietal junction
   (TPJ) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, the groups showed
   similar activation levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
   and the right anterior insula (AI) when norms were violated. These
   results indicate that juvenile delinquents with severe antisocial
   behavior process norm violations adequately, but may have difficulties
   with attending spontaneously to relevant features of the social context
   during interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The arousal-biased competition model predicts that arousal increases the
   gain on neural competition between stimuli representations. Thus, the
   model predicts that arousal simultaneously enhances processing of
   salient stimuli and impairs processing of relatively less-salient
   stimuli. We tested this model with a simple dot-probe task. On each
   trial, participants were simultaneously exposed to one face image as a
   salient cue stimulus and one place image as a non-salient stimulus. A
   border around the face cue location further increased its bottom-up
   saliency. Before these visual stimuli were shown, one of two tones
   played: one that predicted a shock (increasing arousal) or one that did
   not. An arousal-by-saliency interaction in category-specific brain
   regions (fusiform face area for salient faces and parahippocampal place
   area for non-salient places) indicated that brain activation associated
   with processing the salient stimulus was enhanced under arousal whereas
   activation associated with processing the non-salient stimulus was
   suppressed under arousal. This is the first functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study to demonstrate that arousal can enhance
   information processing for prioritized stimuli while simultaneously
   impairing processing of non-prioritized stimuli. Thus, it goes beyond
   previous research to show that arousal does not uniformly enhance
   perceptual processing, but instead does so selectively in ways that
   optimizes attention to highly salient stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{The rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in
   working memory function; lesions and inactivation of this region have
   been shown to result in impairments in spatial working memory (WM)
   tasks. Our laboratory has developed a tactile-visual conditional
   discrimination (CD) task, which uses floor insert cues to signal the
   correct goal-arm choice in a T maze. This task can be manipulated by
   altering the floor insert cues to be present throughout the trial
   (CDSTANDARD) or to be present only at the beginning of the trial (CDWM),
   thus making the task either WM-independent or WM-dependent,
   respectively. This ability to manipulate the working memory demand of
   the task while holding all other task features constant allows us to
   rule out the possibility that confounding performance variables
   contribute to the observed impairment. A previous study from our lab
   showed that mPFC inactivation did not impair performance on CDSTANDARD,
   confirming that mPFC inactivation does not induce sensorimotor or
   motivational deficits that could impact task performance. To examine
   whether mPFC inactivation impairs CDWM, the current study transiently
   inactivated the mPFC with bilateral microinfusions of muscimol
   immediately prior to testing on the CDWM task. As predicted, CDWM task
   performance was significantly impaired during the muscimol-infusion
   session compared with the control saline-infusion sessions. Together
   with our previous demonstration that the mPFC in not required for
   CDSTANDARD, these results not only confirm that the mPFC is crucial for
   working memory, but also set the stage for using the task-comparison
   approach to investigate corticolimbic interactions during working
   memory.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have considered the process by which individuals learn to
   omit a response, which is an essential aspect of adaptive behavior.
   Several lines of evidence indicate that two regions of the medial
   prefrontal cortex have disparate roles in behavioral flexibility. In
   particular, the prelimbic cortex (PL) is thought to facilitate the
   generation of a strategy to inhibit a prepotent response, whereas the
   infralimbic cortex (IL) appears to be more important for maintaining
   extensively trained inhibitory behaviors. The present experiments were
   designed to elucidate the contributions of PL and IL to the acquisition
   and maintenance of Pavlovian conditioned inhibition. In Experiment 1,
   damage to PL before training in a compound feature negative
   discrimination task impaired inhibitory learning. By comparison, lesions
   of IL had little effect. In Experiment 2, lesions of PL or IL occurred
   after overtraining, and damage to IL significantly impaired subsequent
   performance in the task, suggesting that this region is involved in the
   continued expression of Pavlovian conditioned inhibition after thorough
   training. PL may also be involved in maintaining inhibition, as
   evidenced by a marginally significant lesion-induced performance
   deficit. These data support the notion that PL and IL have
   distinguishable roles in modulating inhibition, while contributing
   important information about the specific role for PL in acquisition of
   an inhibitory response and IL in performance.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the role of the head direction (HD) cell circuit in

   postsubiculum (PoS; Experiment 1) or the anterior dorsal nucleus of the
   thalamus (ADN; Experiment 2) were compared to sham controls on 2 tasks
   that could be solved using directional heading. Rats were first trained
   on a direction problem in a water T maze where they learned to travel
   either east or west from 2 locations in the experimental room. ADN
   lesioned rats were impaired relative to sham controls on the first block
   of 8 trials, but not on the total trials taken to reach criterion. This
   transient deficit was not observed in rats with lesions to the PoS. In
   the food-foraging task, rats were trained to leave a home cage at the
   periphery of a circular table, find food in the center of the table, and
   return to the home cage. Both PoS and ADN lesioned rats showed
   impairments on this task relative to sham rats, making more errors on
   the return component of the foraging trip. The spatial deficits produced
   by lesions to the PoS and the ADN, downstream structures in the HD cell
   circuit, are not as severe as those observed in earlier studies in rats

Abstract = {{The hippocampus is particularly susceptible to age-related degeneration
   that, like hippocampal lesions, is thought to lead to age-related
   decline in spatial memory and navigation. Lesions to the avian
   hippocampal formation (HF) also result in impaired spatial memory and
   navigation, but the relationship between aging and HF-dependent spatial
   cognition is unknown. To investigate possible age-related decline in
   avian spatial cognition, the current study investigated spatial working
   memory performance in older homing pigeons (10+ years of age). Pigeons
   completed a behavioral procedure nearly identical to the delayed
   spatial, win-shift procedure in a modified radial arm maze that has been
   previously used to study spatial working memory in rats and pigeons. The
   results revealed that the older pigeons required a greater number of
   choices to task completion and were less accurate with their first 4
   choices as compared to younger pigeons (1-2 years of age). In addition,
   older pigeons were more likely to adopt a stereotyped sampling strategy,
   which explained in part their impaired performance. To the best of our
   knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate an age-related
   impairment of HF-dependent, spatial memory in birds. Implications and
   future directions of the findings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Age-related cognitive impairments are particularly prevalent in forms of
   learning that require a functionally intact hippocampal formation, such
   as spatial and declarative learning. However, there is notable
   heterogeneity in the cognitive abilities of aged subjects. To date, few
   studies have determined whether age-related impairments on one learning
   task relate to impairments on different learning tasks that engage
   overlapping cognitive processes. Here, we hypothesized that aged animals
   that were impaired on 1 hippocampal-dependent behavioral procedure would
   be impaired on a second hippocampal-dependent procedure. Conversely,
   aged animals that were unimpaired on 1 hippocampal-dependent task would
   be unimpaired with a subsequent hippocampal-dependent form of learning.
   To test these hypotheses, we trained young (2-3 months old) and aged
   (28-29 months old) F344XBN male rats with trace eyeblink conditioning,
   followed by the Morris water maze. Half of aged rats were impaired
   during trace conditioning. Nearly half of aged animals were also
   impaired during water maze probe testing. Performance during trace
   conditioning correlated with performance during water maze testing in
   aged animals. Further analyses revealed that, as a group, aged animals
   that were impaired on 1 hippocampal-dependent task were impaired on both
   tasks. Conversely, aged animals that were unimpaired on 1 task were
   unimpaired on both tasks. Together, these results suggest that
   aged-related impairments on 1 hippocampal-dependent task predict
   age-related impairments on a second hippocampal-dependent procedure.
   These results have implications for assigning personalized therapeutics
   to ameliorate age-related cognitive decline.}},

Abstract = {{Rats can anticipate a daily feeding time. This has been interpreted as a
   rhythm controlled by food-entrainable circadian oscillators, because the
   rhythm persists during several cycles of total food deprivation and
   fails to track mealtimes if the feeding schedule deviates substantially
   from 24. These and other properties distinguish anticipation of daily
   meals from anticipation of food rewards provided at intervals in the
   seconds-to-minutes range, suggesting distinct mechanisms. It has been
   reported that rats can anticipate meals at long, but noncircadian,
   intervals if they are required to work for food, and that anticipation
   of daily meals, expressed in operant behavior, shows the scalar
   property, a hallmark of timing intervals in the seconds-to-minutes
   range. These observations raise the possibility of a universal timing
   system, rather than unique mechanisms for circadian and noncircadian
   intervals. To test whether circadian constraints on daily meal timing
   depend on the measure of behavior, we re-examined formal properties of
   food anticipation using lever pressing and motion sensors. We observed
   robust anticipation in both measures to meals at 24-hr intervals but no
   anticipation of meals at 18-hr intervals in light-dark or constant light
   and no evidence that the duration of anticipation scales with the
   interval between lighting transitions and mealtime. We are therefore
   unable to confirm reports that operant measures can reveal timing at
   long, but noncircadian, intervals. If timing processes exist that do
   permit anticipation of events at long, but noncircadian, intervals, the
   conditions under which these can be revealed are evidently highly
   constrained.}},

Abstract = {{This study determined the duration of exercise and amount of
   methylphenidate that is needed to affect attentional function and social
   behavior in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), a commonly used
   animal model of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
   Attention was assessed by measuring the orienting response to repeated
   presentations of a nonreinforced visual cue. Social behavior was
   examined by allowing rats to freely explore a large arena containing an
   unfamiliar conspecific rat. Consistent with their hyper-responsive
   phenotype, nonexercising SHRs exhibited a high level of orienting
   behavior and little habituation, as well as hyper-social behavior
   compared with normo-active rats. Exercise or methylphenidate decreased
   orienting behavior and social behavior in a dose-dependent fashion. In
   addition, we found an additive effect of combining doses of exercise and
   methylphenidate that alone were ineffective in altering behavior. These
   data indicate that physical exercise and methylphenidate can reduce
   hyper-responsiveness to irrelevant stimuli and reduce hyper-social
   behavior in SHR. Moreover, subthreshold doses of methylphenidate can be
   used in combination with moderate amounts of exercise to reduce
   distractibility, supporting the notion that exercise may be useful as an
   adjunctive or replacement therapy in ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{Cotinine, the predominant metabolite of nicotine, appears to act as an
   antidepressant. We have previously shown that cotinine reduced immobile
   postures in Porsolt's forced swim (FS) and tail suspension tests while
   preserving the synaptic density in the hippocampus as well as prefrontal
   and entorhinal cortices of mice subjected to chronic restraint stress.
   In this study, we investigated the effect of daily oral cotinine (5
   mg/kg) on depressive-like behavior induced by repeated, FS stress for 6
   consecutive days in adult, male C57BL/6J mice. The results support our
   previous report that cotinine administration reduces depressive-like
   behavior in mice subjected or not to high salience stress. In addition,
   cotinine enhanced the expression of the vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) in the hippocampus of mice subjected to repetitive FS
   stress. Altogether, the results suggest that cotinine may be an
   effective antidepressant positively influencing mood through a mechanism
   involving the preservation of brain homeostasis and the expression of
   critical growth factors such as VEGF.}},

Abstract = {{Human and nonhuman adolescents have impaired retention of extinction of
   learned fear, relative to juveniles and adults. It is unknown whether
   exposure to stress affects extinction differently in adolescents versus
   adults. These experiments compared the short-and long-term effects of
   exposure to the stress-related hormone corticosterone (CORT) on the
   extinction of learned fear in adolescent and adult rats. Across all
   experiments, adolescent and adult rats were trained to exhibit good
   extinction retention by giving extinction training across 2 consecutive
   days. Despite this extra training, adolescents exposed to 1 week of CORT
   (200 mu g/ml) in their drinking water showed impaired extinction
   retention when trained shortly after the CORT was removed (Experiment
   1a). In contrast, adult rats exposed to CORT (200 mu g/ml) for the same
   duration did not exhibit deficits in extinction retention (Experiment
   1b). Exposing adolescents to half the amount of CORT (100 mu g/ml;
   Experiment 1c) for 1 week similarly disrupted extinction retention.
   Extinction impairments in adult rats were only observed after 3 weeks,
   rather than 1 week, of CORT (200 mu g/ml; Experiment 1d). Remarkably,
   however, adult rats showed impaired extinction retention if they had
   been exposed to 1 week of CORT (200 mu g/ml) during adolescence
   (Experiment 2). Finally, exposure to 3 weeks of CORT (200 mu g/ml) in
   adulthood led to long-lasting extinction deficits after a 6-week
   drug-free period (Experiment 3). These findings suggest that although
   CORT disrupts both short-and long-term extinction retention in
   adolescents and adults, adolescents may be more vulnerable to these
   effects because of the maturation of stress-sensitive brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{Rat dams show natural variations in maternal care, licking and grooming
   (LG), that are associated with distinct behavioral and neural phenotypes
   in offspring. However, there has been limited research on the effects of
   differences in LG received by female pups and of variations in maternal
   care within the litter. Here, we investigated LG received by measuring
   active maternal care after pup retrieval of female offspring. We then
   examined locomotor activity, open field exploration, and restraint
   stress reactivity in adult female offspring. We also investigated the
   expression of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and glucocorticoid
   receptor (GR) and DNA methylation of the GR1(7) promoter in the
   hippocampus. High compared with low LG siblings and female offspring
   from high compared with low LG dams showed increased locomotor activity.
   High compared with low LG siblings also showed reduced anxiety behavior
   regardless of the overall level of LG received in the litter.
   Unexpectedly, both the lowest licked offspring from low LG litters and
   the highest licked offspring from high LG litters showed suppressed
   corticosterone (CORT) responses to stress. However, high LG offspring
   within litters also showed increased expression of the GR gene, which
   was negatively correlated with the CORT response to restraint. DNA
   methylation at 2 CpG sites within GR1(7) promoter was significantly
   higher in high LG offspring. These differences in the response to
   maternal care both within-and between-litters were distinct in part from
   previous reports of between litter effects, potentially a result of the
   sex studied or the methods used to observe maternal care.}},

Title = {{L-Dopa Reverses Behavioral Deficits in the Pitx3 Mouse Fetus}},

Abstract = {{Studies of fetal rodents have provided evidence that early emerging
   behaviors, such as the suckling response, are dependent on the
   developing dopaminergic system. Although connections have been made
   between manipulations of dopamine and altered behavioral responses, the
   specific neural pathways involved have yet to be discovered. In this
   study, we examined the neurobehavioral output of the nigrostriatal
   pathway, using the Pitx3(ak)/2J mouse model (Pitx3). Used extensively in
   the study of Parkinson's disease, the Pitx3 mouse has very specific
   prenatal loss of dopaminergic neurons solely in the nigrostriatal
   pathway. Because of this specificity, we hypothesized that behavioral
   deficits specific to the nigrostriatal pathway would be reversed with
   administration of the dopamine precursor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
   (L-dopa). To test this hypothesis, homozygous mutant and heterozygous
   control fetal subjects were administered 1 of 4 doses (0, 25, 50, or 75
   mg/kg) of L-dopa on the day before birth. Quantification of fetal
   behavior was scored from video recordings of behavioral observations.
   The behavioral measures used were (a) spontaneous movement activity; (b)
   state organization, from quantifications of high-and low-amplitude
   movements; (c) interlimb movement synchrony, a measure of limb
   coordination; and (d) oral grasp, similar to a newborn infant suckling
   response. Specific behavioral deficits observed in the Pitx3 mutants
   were reversed by L-dopa administration in a dose-dependent manner.
   However, different deficits required dissimilar doses for reversal,
   suggesting that some early emerging behaviors may be more sensitive to
   the administration of L-dopa. Taken together, this study provides
   valuable information about prenatal behaviors dependent on the
   nigrostriatal pathway.}},

Abstract = {{How does our brain organize knowledge? Traditional theories assume that
   our knowledge is represented abstractly in an amodal conceptual network
   of formal logic symbols. The theory of embodied cognition challenges
   this view and argues that conceptual representations that constitute our
   knowledge are grounded in sensory and motor experiences. We tested this
   hypothesis by examining how the concept of social coordination is
   grounded metaphorically in the tactile sensation of roughness.
   Participants experienced rough or smooth touch before being asked to
   judge an ambiguous social interaction. Results revealed that rough touch
   made social interactions appear more difficult and adversarial,
   consistent with the rough metaphor. This impact of tactile cues on
   social impressions was accompanied by a network including primary and
   secondary somatosensory cortices, amygdala, hippocampus and inferior
   prefrontal cortex. Thus, the roughness of tactile stimulation affected
   metaphor-relevant (but not metaphor-irrelevant) behavioral and neural
   responses. Receiving touch from a rough object seems to trigger the
   application of associated ontological concepts (or scaffolds) even for
   unrelated people and situations (but not to unrelated or more general
   feelings). Since this priming was based on somatosensory brain areas,
   our results provide support for the theory that sensorimotor grounding
   is intrinsic to cognitive processes.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral habituation during repeated exposure to aversive stimuli is
   an adaptive process. However, the way in which changes in self-reported
   emotional experience are related to the neural mechanisms supporting
   habituation remains unclear. We probed these mechanisms by repeatedly
   presenting negative images to healthy adult participants and recording
   behavioral and neural responses using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. We were particularly interested in investigating patterns of
   activity in insula, given its significant role in affective integration,
   and in amygdala, given its association with appraisal of aversive
   stimuli and its frequent coactivation with insula. We found significant
   habituation behaviorally along with decreases in amygdala, occipital
   cortex and ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity with repeated
   presentation, whereas bilateral posterior insula, dorsolateral PFC and
   precuneus showed increased activation. Posterior insula activation
   during image presentation was correlated with greater negative affect
   ratings for novel presentations of negative images. Further, repeated
   negative image presentation was associated with increased functional
   connectivity between left posterior insula and amygdala, and increasing
   insula-amygdala functional connectivity was correlated with increasing
   behavioral habituation. These results suggest that habituation is
   subserved in part by insula-amygdala connectivity and involves a change
   in the activity of bottom-up affective networks.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Depending on threat proximity, different defensive behaviours are
   mediated by a descending neural network involving forebrain (distal
   threat) vs midbrain areas (proximal threat). Compared to healthy
   subjects, it can be assumed that phobics are characterized by shortened
   defensive distances on a behavioural and neural level. This study aimed
   at characterizing defensive reactivity in two subtypes of specific
   phobia {[}snake (SP) and dental phobics (DP)]. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), n = 39 subjects (13 healthy controls, HC; 13
   SP; 13 DP) underwent an event-related fMRI task employing an
   anticipation (5-10 s) and immediate perception phase (phobic pictures
   and matched neutral stimuli; 1250 ms) to modulate defensive distance.
   Although no differential brain activity in any comparisons was observed
   in DP, areas associated with defensive behaviours (e.g. amygdala,
   hippocampus, midbrain) were activated in SP. Decreasing defensive
   distance in SP was characterized by a shift to midbrain activity.
   Present findings substantiate differences between phobia types in their
   physiological and neural organization that can be expanded to early
   stages of defensive behaviours. Findings may contribute to a better
   understanding of the dynamic organization of defensive reactivity in
   different types of phobic fear.}},

Abstract = {{Proneness to specific moral sentiments (e.g. pride, gratitude, guilt,
   indignation) has been linked with individual variations in functional
   MRI (fMRI) response within anterior brain regions whose lesion leads to
   inappropriate behaviour. However, the role of structural anatomical
   differences in rendering individuals prone to particular moral
   sentiments relative to others is unknown. Here, we investigated grey
   matter volumes (VBM8) and proneness to specific moral sentiments on a
   well-controlled experimental task in healthy individuals. Individuals
   with smaller cuneus, and precuneus volumes were more pride-prone,
   whereas those with larger right inferior temporal volumes experienced
   gratitude more readily. Although the primary analysis detected no
   associations with guilt- or indignation-proneness, subgenual cingulate
   fMRI responses to guilt were negatively correlated with grey matter
   volumes in the left superior temporal sulcus and anterior dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortices (right > left). This shows that individual
   variations in functional activations within critical areas for moral
   sentiments were not due to grey matter volume differences in the same
   areas. Grey matter volume differences between healthy individuals may
   nevertheless play an important role by affecting posterior cortical
   brain systems that are non-critical but supportive for the experience of
   specific moral sentiments. This may be of particular relevance when
   their experience depends on visuo-spatial elaboration.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala is known to play an important role in the response to
   facial expressions that convey fear. However, it remains unclear whether
   the amygdala's response to fear reflects its role in the interpretation
   of danger and threat, or whether it is to some extent activated by all
   facial expressions of emotion. Previous attempts to address this issue
   using neuroimaging have been confounded by differences in the use of
   control stimuli across studies. Here, we address this issue using a
   block design functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm, in which we
   compared the response to face images posing expressions of fear, anger,
   happiness, disgust and sadness with a range of control conditions. The
   responses in the amygdala to different facial expressions were compared
   with the responses to a non-face condition (buildings), to mildly happy
   faces and to neutral faces. Results showed that only fear and anger
   elicited significantly greater responses compared with the control
   conditions involving faces. Overall, these findings are consistent with
   the role of the amygdala in processing threat, rather than in the
   processing of all facial expressions of emotion, and demonstrate the
   critical importance of the choice of comparison condition to the pattern
   of results.}},

Abstract = {{The different temporal dynamics of emotions are critical to understand
   their evolutionary role in the regulation of interactions with the
   surrounding environment. Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics
   underlying the perception of four basic emotions from complex scenes
   varying in valence and arousal (fear, disgust, happiness and sadness)
   with the millisecond time resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG).
   Event-related potentials were computed and each emotion showed a
   specific temporal profile, as revealed by distinct time segments of
   significant differences from the neutral scenes. Fear perception
   elicited significant activity at the earliest time segments, followed by
   disgust, happiness and sadness. Moreover, fear, disgust and happiness
   were characterized by two time segments of significant activity, whereas
   sadness showed only one long-latency time segment of activity.
   Multidimensional scaling was used to assess the correspondence between
   neural temporal dynamics and the subjective experience elicited by the
   four emotions in a subsequent behavioral task. We found a high coherence
   between these two classes of data, indicating that psychological
   categories defining emotions have a close correspondence at the brain
   level in terms of neural temporal dynamics. Finally, we localized the
   brain regions of time-dependent activity for each emotion and time
   segment with the low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Fear
   and disgust showed widely distributed activations, predominantly in the
   right hemisphere. Happiness activated a number of areas mostly in the
   left hemisphere, whereas sadness showed a limited number of active areas
   at late latency. The present findings indicate that the neural signature
   of basic emotions can emerge as the byproduct of dynamic spatiotemporal
   brain networks as investigated with millisecond-range resolution, rather
   than in time-independent areas involved uniquely in the processing one
   specific emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Although evolution has shaped human infant crying and the corresponding
   response from caregivers, there is marked variation in paternal
   involvement and caretaking behavior, highlighting the importance of
   understanding the neurobiology supporting optimal paternal responses to
   cries. We explored the neural response to infant cries in fathers of
   children aged 1-2, and its relationship with hormone levels, variation
   in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, parental attitudes and parental
   behavior. Although number of AR CAG trinucleotide repeats was positively
   correlated with neural activity in brain regions important for empathy
   (anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus), restrictive attitudes were
   inversely correlated with neural activity in these regions and with
   regions involved with emotion regulation (orbitofrontal cortex).
   Anterior insula activity had a non-linear relationship with paternal
   caregiving, such that fathers with intermediate activation were most
   involved. These results suggest that restrictive attitudes may be
   associated with decreased empathy and emotion regulation in response to
   a child in distress, and that moderate anterior insula activity reflects
   an optimal level of arousal that supports engaged fathering.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments in financial decision-making point to two complementary
   processes that encode prospective gain and loss preceding the choice to
   purchase consumer goods. These processes involve the nucleus accumbens
   (NAcc) and the right anterior insula, respectively. The current
   experiment used functional MRI to investigate whether these regions
   served a similar function during an analogous social decision-making
   task without the influence of monetary outcomes. In this task, subjects
   chose partners based on face stimuli of varying attractiveness
   (operationalizing value) and ratings of compatibility with the
   participant (operationalizing likelihood of rejection). The NAcc
   responded to anticipated gain; the right anterior insula responded to
   compatibility, but not in a manner that suggests an analogy to
   anticipated cost. Logistic regression modeling demonstrated that both
   regions predicted subsequent choice above and beyond the influence of
   group attractiveness ratings or compatibility alone. Although the
   function of the insula may differ between tasks, these results suggest
   that financial and social decision-making recruit a similar network of

Abstract = {{Investigations of fear conditioning in rodents and humans have
   illuminated the neural mechanisms of fear acquisition and extinction.
   However, the neural mechanism of memory consolidation of fear
   conditioning is not well understood. To address this question, we
   measured brain activity and the changes in functional connectivity
   following fear acquisition using resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. The amygdala-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
   and hippocampus-insula functional connectivity were enhanced, whereas
   the amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) functional coupling was
   decreased during fear memory consolidation. Furthermore, the
   amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity was negatively correlated with the
   subjective fear ratings. These findings suggest the amygdala functional
   connectivity with dACC and mPFC may play an important role in memory
   consolidation of fear conditioning. The change of amygdala-mPFC
   functional connectivity could predict the subjective fear. Accordingly,
   this study provides a new perspective for understanding fear memory
   consolidation.}},

Abstract = {{Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging and event-related brain
   potential studies revealed that performing a cognitive task may suppress
   the preferential processing of emotional stimuli. However, these studies
   utilized simple and artificial tasks (i.e. letter, shape or orientation
   discrimination tasks), unfamiliar to the participants. The present
   event-related potential study examined the emotion-attention interaction
   in the context of a comparably more natural scene categorization task.
   Deciding whether a natural scene contains an animal or not is a familiar
   and meaningful task to the participants and presumed to require little
   attentional resources. The task images were presented centrally and were
   overlaid upon emotional or neutral background pictures. Thus, implicit
   emotion and explicit semantic categorization may compete for processing
   resources in neural regions implicated in object recognition.
   Additionally, participants passively viewed the same stimulus materials
   without the demand to categorize task images. Significant interactions
   between task condition and emotional picture valence were observed for
   the occipital negativity and late positive potential. In the passive
   viewing condition, emotional background images elicited an increased
   occipital negativity followed by an increased late positive potential.
   In contrast, during the animal-/non-animal-categorization task,
   emotional modulation effects were replaced by strong target
   categorization effects. These results suggest that explicit semantic
   categorization interferes with implicit emotion processing when both
   processes compete for shared resources.}},

Abstract = {{Social information influences decision-making through an integration of
   information derived from individual experience with that derived from
   observing the actions of others. This raises the question as to which
   extent one should utilize social information. One strategy is to make
   use of uncertainty estimates, leading to a copy-when-uncertain strategy
   that weights information from individual and social sources based on
   their respective reliabilities. Here, we investigate this integration
   process by extending models of Bayes optimal integration of sensory
   information to a social decision context. We then use a key parameter of
   our behavioral model in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to identify the neural substrate that is specifically linked to
   the fidelity of this integration process. We show that individuals
   behave near Bayes optimal when integrating two distinct sources of
   social information but systematically deviate from Bayes optimal choice
   when integrating individual with social information. This systematic
   behavioral deviation from optimality is linked to activity of left
   inferior frontal gyrus. Thus, an ability to optimally exploit social
   information depends on processes that overcome an egocentric bias, and
   this regulatory role involves the left inferior prefrontal cortex. The
   findings provide a mechanistic explanation for observations wherein
   individuals neglect the benefits from exploiting social information.}},

Abstract = {{According to terror management theory, self-esteem serves as a buffer
   against existential anxiety. This proposition is well supported
   empirically, but its neuronal underpinnings are poorly understood.
   Therefore, in the present neuroimaging study, our aim was to test how
   self-esteem affects our neural circuitry activation when death-related
   material is processed. Consistent with previous findings, the bilateral
   insula responded less to death-related stimuli relative to similarly
   unpleasant, but death-unrelated sentences, an effect that might reflect
   a decrease in the sense of oneself in the face of existential threat. In
   anterior parts of the insula, this `deactivation' effect was more
   pronounced for high self-esteem individuals, suggesting that the insula
   might be of core importance to understanding the anxiety-buffering
   effect of self-esteem. In addition, low self-esteem participants
   responded with enhanced activation to death-related over unpleasant
   stimuli in bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal and medial orbitofrontal
   cortex, suggesting that regulating death-related thoughts might be more
   effortful to these individuals. Together, this suggests that the
   anxiety-buffering effect of self-esteem might be implemented in the
   brain in the form of both insula-dependent awareness mechanisms and
   prefrontal cortex-dependent regulation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Mirroring neurons fire both when an individual moves and observes
   another move in kind. This simulation of others' movements is thought to
   effortlessly and ubiquitously support empathetic connection and social
   understanding. However, at times this could be maladaptive. How could a
   boxer mirror a losing opponent's expressions of fatigue, feeling his
   weariness, precisely when strength is required? Clearly, the boxer must
   emotionally disconnect from his opponent and those expressions of
   fatigue must become irrelevant and not mirrored. But, movements that
   inform of his opponent's intentions to deliver an incoming blow are
   quite relevant and still should require mirroring. We tested these
   dimensions of emotional connectedness and relevance of movement in an
   electroencephalography experiment, where participants' desires to
   socially connect with a confederate were manipulated. Before
   manipulation, all participants mirrored the confederate's purely
   kinematic (a hand opening and closing) and goal-directed (a hand opening
   and closing around a token that the participant desired) hand movements.
   After manipulation, unfairly treated subjects ceased to mirror the
   purely kinematic movements but continued to mirror goal-relevant
   movements. Those treated fairly continued to mirror all movements. The
   results suggest that social mirroring can be adaptive in order to meet
   the demands of a varied social environment.}},

Abstract = {{While watching movies, the brain integrates the visual information and
   the musical soundtrack into a coherent percept. Multisensory integration
   can lead to emotion elicitation on which soundtrack valences may have a
   modulatory impact. Here, dynamic kissing scenes from romantic comedies
   were presented to 22 participants (13 females) during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging scanning. The kissing scenes were either
   accompanied by happy music, sad music or no music. Evidence from
   cross-modal studies motivated a predefined three-region network for
   multisensory integration of emotion, consisting of fusiform gyrus (FG),
   amygdala (AMY) and anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG). The
   interactions in this network were investigated using dynamic causal
   models of effective connectivity. This revealed bilinear modulations by
   happy and sad music with suppression effects on the connectivity from FG
   and AMY to aSTG. Non-linear dynamic causal modeling showed a suppressive
   gating effect of aSTG on fusiform-amygdalar connectivity. In conclusion,
   fusiform to amygdala coupling strength is modulated via feedback through
   aSTG as region for multisensory integration of emotional material. This
   mechanism was emotion-specific and more pronounced for sad music.
   Therefore, soundtrack valences may modulate emotion elicitation in
   movies by differentially changing preprocessed visual information to the
   amygdala.}},

Abstract = {{Self-concept is deeply affected in schizophrenia. Positive symptoms in
   particular are related to disturbed self/other distinctions. The neural
   networks underlying self-evaluation in schizophrenia have barely been
   investigated. The study reported here involved 13 patients with
   schizophrenia and 13 matched controls. During functional MRI,
   participants decided in three conditions whether the presented positive
   and negative personality traits characterized themselves, an intimate
   person, or included a certain letter. Based on the responses, each
   experimental condition was designed using a flexible factorial model.
   Controls and patients showed a similar behavioral pattern during
   self-evaluation, with group comparison revealing decreased activation in
   patients in the left inferior temporal gyrus and both temporal poles
   during self-ascription of traits, and in the anterior medial prefrontal
   cortex during evaluation of an intimate person. In patients, positive
   symptoms correlated positively with brain activation in the left
   parahippocampus during trait self-ascription. Hence, while evaluating
   themselves, schizophrenia patients revealed decreased activation in
   areas related to self-awareness overlapping with networks involved in
   theory of mind, empathy and social knowledge. Moreover, patients' brain
   activation during self-reflection was affected by the current positive
   symptomatology. The close interaction between self and other highlights
   the clinical and social relevance of self-processing deficits in
   schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{An intense fear of abandonment or rejection is a central feature of
   social relationships for individuals with borderline personality
   disorder (BPD). A total of 20 unmedicated BPD patients and 20 healthy
   participants (HC, matched for age and education) played a virtual
   ball-tossing game including the three conditions: exclusion, inclusion
   and a control condition with predefined game rules, whereas cerebral
   activity was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Subjective experiences of exclusion were assessed after each blocked
   condition. Both groups felt similarly excluded during the exclusion
   condition; however, BPD subjects felt more excluded than HC during the
   inclusion and control conditions. In all three conditions, BPD patients
   showed a stronger engagement of the dorsal anterior cingulate and medial
   prefrontal cortex. For HC, activation in several cerebral regions such
   as the insula and the precuneus differed depending on the interaction
   situation, whereas for BPD subjects activation in these regions was not
   modulated by experimental conditions. Subjects with BPD differed from HC
   in both their subjective reactions to and their neural processing of
   social interaction situations. Our data suggest that individuals with
   BPD have difficulty in discriminating between social situations, and
   tend to hypermentalize during social encounters that are not determined

Abstract = {{Sensitivity to social evaluation has been proposed as a potential marker
   or risk factor for depression, and has also been theorized to increase
   with pubertal maturation. This study utilized an ecologically valid
   paradigm to test the hypothesis that adolescents with major depressive
   disorder (MDD) would show altered reactivity to peer rejection and
   acceptance relative to healthy controls in a network of ventral brain
   regions implicated in affective processing of social information. A
   total of 48 adolescents (ages 11-17), including 21 with a current
   diagnosis of MDD and 27 age- and gender-matched controls, received
   rigged acceptance and rejection feedback from fictitious peers during a
   simulated online peer interaction during functional neuroimaging. MDD
   youth showed increased activation to rejection relative to controls in
   the bilateral amygdala, subgenual anterior cingulate, left anterior
   insula and left nucleus accumbens. MDD and healthy youth did not differ
   in response to acceptance. Youth more advanced in pubertal maturation
   also showed increased reactivity to rejection in the bilateral
   amygdala/parahippocampal gyrus and the caudate/subgenual anterior
   cingulate, and these effects remained significant when controlling for
   chronological age. Findings suggest that increased reactivity to peer
   rejection is a normative developmental process associated with pubertal
   development, but is particularly enhanced among youth with depression.}},

Abstract = {{There are two distinct modes of self-focus: analytical self-focus is
   abstract, general and evaluative whereas experiential self-focus is
   concrete, specific and non-evaluative. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the neural bases of these two
   modes of self-focus in relation with brooding, the maladaptive form of
   rumination. Forty-one French-speaking right-handed healthy young adults
   (10 men, mean age +/- s.d.: 21.8 +/- 2.3 years) engaged in analytical
   and experiential self-focus triggered by verbal stimuli during fMRI.
   Brooding was measured with the 22-item Rumination Response Style scale.
   Individuals with lower brooding scores showed greater activation of the
   posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus during analytical than experiential
   self-focus, whereas individuals with higher brooding scores did not.
   This is consistent with the hypothesis that brooding is associated with
   less control over the nature of the self-focus engaged. These findings
   may help to refine our understanding of how rumination promotes
   depression through maladaptive self-focus.}},

Abstract = {{Processing self-related material recruits similar neural networks
   regardless of whether the self-relevance is made explicit or not.
   However, when considering the neural mechanisms that distinctly underlie
   cognitive and affective components of self-reflection, it is still
   unclear whether the same mechanisms are involved when self-reflection is
   explicit or implicit, and how these mechanisms may be modulated by
   individual personality traits, such as self-esteem. In the present
   functional MRI study, 25 participants were exposed to positive and
   negative words that varied with respect to the degree of self-relevance
   for each participant; however, the participants were asked to make a
   judgment about the color of the words. Regions-of-interest analysis
   showed that medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate
   cortex were associated with gauging the self-relevance of information.
   However, no main effect of valence or an interaction effect between
   self-relevance and valence was observed. Further, positive correlations
   were observed between levels of self-esteem and response within dorsal
   mPFC (dmPFC) both in the contrast positive-high in self-relevance trials
   vs positive-low in self-relevance trials and in the contrast
   negative-low in self-relevance trials vs positive-low in self-relevance
   trials. These results suggested that the activation of dmPFC may be
   particularly associated with the processes of self-positivity bias.}},

Abstract = {{While non-verbal affective voice cues are generally recognized as a
   crucial behavioral guide in any day-to-day conversation their role as a
   powerful source of information may extend well beyond close-up personal
   interactions and include other modes of communication such as written
   discourse or literature as well. Building on the assumption that
   similarities between the different `modes' of voice cues may not only be
   limited to their functional role but may also include cerebral
   mechanisms engaged in the decoding process, the present functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at exploring brain responses
   associated with processing emotional voice signals described in literary
   texts. Emphasis was placed on evaluating `voice' sensitive as well as
   task- and emotion-related modulations of brain activation frequently
   associated with the decoding of acoustic vocal cues. Obtained findings
   suggest that several similarities emerge with respect to the perception
   of acoustic voice signals: results identify the superior temporal,
   lateral and medial frontal cortex as well as the posterior cingulate
   cortex and cerebellum to contribute to the decoding process, with
   similarities to acoustic voice perception reflected in a `voice'-cue
   preference of temporal voice areas as well as an emotion-related
   modulation of the medial frontal cortex and a task-modulated response of
   the lateral frontal cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Early life stress (ELS) is associated with altered stress responsivity,
   structural and functional brain changes and an increased risk for the
   development of psychopathological conditions in later life. Due to its
   behavioral and physiological effects, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is
   a useful tool to investigate stress responsivity, even though the
   neurobiological underpinnings of its effects are still unknown. Here we
   investigate the effects of OXT on cortisol stress response and neural
   activity during psychosocial stress. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging in healthy subjects with and without a history of ELS, we found
   attenuated hormonal reactivity and significantly reduced limbic
   deactivation after OXT administration in subjects without a history of
   ELS. Subjects who experienced ELS showed both blunted stress reactivity
   and limbic deactivation during stress. Furthermore, in these subjects
   OXT had opposite effects with increased hormonal reactivity and
   increased limbic deactivation. Our results might implicate that reduced
   limbic deactivation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsivity
   during psychosocial stress are markers for biological resilience after
   ELS. Effects of OXT in subjects with a history of maltreatment could
   therefore be considered detrimental and suggest careful consideration of
   OXT administration in such individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The perception of oneself as absorbed in the thoughts, feelings and
   happenings of a fictive character (e.g. in a novel or film) as if the
   character's experiences were one's own is referred to as identification.
   We investigated whether individual variation in the personality trait of
   identification is associated with individual variation in the structure
   of specific brain regions, using surface and volume-based morphometry.
   The hypothesized regions of interest were selected on the basis of their
   functional role in subserving the cognitive processing domains
   considered important for identification (i.e. mental imagery, empathy,
   theory of mind and merging) and for the immersive experience called
   `presence'. Controlling for age, sex, whole-brain volume and other
   traits, identification covaried significantly with the left hippocampal
   volume, cortical thickness in the right anterior insula and the left
   dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, and with gray matter volume in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that trait
   identification is associated with structural variation in specific brain
   regions. The findings are discussed in relation to the potential
   functional contribution of these regions to identification.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a crucial period for the development of adaptive emotion
   regulation strategies. Despite the fact that structural maturation of
   the prefrontal cortex during adolescence is often assumed to underlie
   the maturation of emotion regulation strategies, no longitudinal studies
   have directly assessed this relationship. This study examined whether
   use of cognitive reappraisal strategies during late adolescence was
   predicted by (i) absolute prefrontal cortical thickness during early
   adolescence and (ii) structural maturation of the prefrontal cortex
   between early and mid-adolescence. Ninety-two adolescents underwent
   baseline and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans when they were
   aged approximately 12 and 16 years, respectively. FreeSurfer software
   was used to obtain cortical thickness estimates for three prefrontal
   regions {[}anterior cingulate cortex; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (dlPFC); ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)]. The Emotion
   Regulation Questionnaire was completed when adolescents were aged
   approximately 19 years. Results showed that greater cortical thinning of
   the left dlPFC and left vlPFC during adolescence was significantly
   associated with greater use of cognitive reappraisal in females, though
   no such relationship was evident in males. Furthermore, baseline left
   dlPFC thickness predicted cognitive reappraisal at trend level. These
   findings suggest that cortical maturation may play a role in the
   development of adaptive emotion regulation strategies during
   adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, `ecstasy') releases serotonin
   and norepinephrine. MDMA is reported to produce empathogenic and
   prosocial feelings. It is unknown whether MDMA in fact alters empathic
   concern and prosocial behavior. We investigated the acute effects of
   MDMA using the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET), dynamic Face Emotion
   Recognition Task (FERT) and Social Value Orientation (SVO) test. We also
   assessed effects of MDMA on plasma levels of hormones involved in social
   behavior using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, random-order,
   cross-over design in 32 healthy volunteers (16 women). MDMA enhanced
   explicit and implicit emotional empathy in the MET and increased
   prosocial behavior in the SVO test in men. MDMA did not alter cognitive
   empathy in the MET but impaired the identification of negative emotions,
   including fearful, angry and sad faces, in the FERT, particularly in
   women. MDMA increased plasma levels of cortisol and prolactin, which are
   markers of serotonergic and noradrenergic activity, and of oxytocin,
   which has been associated with prosocial behavior. In summary, MDMA
   sex-specifically altered the recognition of emotions, emotional empathy
   and prosociality. These effects likely enhance sociability when MDMA is
   used recreationally and may be useful when MDMA is administered in
   conjunction with psychotherapy in patients with social dysfunction or
   post-traumatic stress disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-clinical autistic-like traits (ALTs) are continuously distributed in
   the general population and genetically linked to autism. Although
   identifying the neurogenetic backgrounds of ALTs might enhance our
   ability to identify those of autism, they are largely unstudied. Here,
   we have examined the neuroanatomical basis of ALTs and their association
   with the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) rs2254298A, a known risk allele
   for autism in Asian populations which has also been implicated in
   limbic-paralimbic brain structures. First, we extracted a four-factor
   structure of ALTs, as measured using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient,
   including `prosociality', `communication', `details/patterns' and
   `imagination' in 135 neurotypical adults (79 men, 56 women) to reduce
   the genetic heterogeneity of ALTs. Then, in the same population,
   voxel-based morphometry revealed that lower `prosociality', which
   indicates strong ALTs, was significantly correlated to smaller regional
   grey matter volume in the right insula in males. Males with lower
   `prosociality' also had less interregional structural coupling between
   the right insula and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore,
   males with OXTR rs2254298A had significantly smaller grey matter volume
   in the right insula. These results show that decreased volume of the
   insula is a neuroanatomical correlate of ALTs and a potential
   intermediate phenotype linking ALTs with OXTR in male subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is widely assumed that emotions prime the body for action,
   the effects of visual perception of natural emotional scenes on the
   temporal dynamics of the human motor system have scarcely been
   investigated. Here, we used single-pulse transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) to assess motor excitability during observation and
   categorization of positive, neutral and negative pictures from the
   International Affective Picture System database. Motor-evoked potentials
   (MEPs) from TMS of the left motor cortex were recorded from hand
   muscles, at 150 and 300 ms after picture onset. In the early temporal
   condition we found an increase in hand motor excitability that was
   specific for the perception of negative pictures. This early negative
   bias was predicted by interindividual differences in the disposition to
   experience aversive feelings (personal distress) in interpersonal
   emotional contexts. In the later temporal condition, we found that MEPs
   were similarly increased for both positive and negative pictures,
   suggesting an increased reactivity to emotionally arousing scenes. By
   highlighting the temporal course of motor excitability during perception
   of emotional pictures, our study provides direct neurophysiological
   support for the evolutionary notions that emotion perception is closely
   linked to action systems and that emotionally negative events require
   motor reactions to be more urgently mobilized.}},

Abstract = {{Anosognosia is a complex symptom corresponding to a lack of awareness of
   one's current clinical status. Anosognosia for cognitive deficits has
   frequently been described in Alzheimer's disease (AD), while unawareness
   of current characteristics of personality traits has rarely been
   considered. We used a well-established questionnaire-based method in a
   group of 37 AD patients and in healthy controls to probe self-and
   hetero-evaluation of patients' personality and we calculated
   differential scores between each participant's and his/her relative's
   judgments. A brain-behavior correlation was performed using
   18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images. The
   behavioral data showed that AD patients presented with anosognosia for
   current characteristics of their personality and their anosognosia was
   primarily explained by impaired third perspective taking. The
   brain-behavior correlation analysis revealed a negative relationship
   between anosognosia for current characteristics of personality and
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) activity. Behavioral and
   neuroimaging data are consistent with the view that impairment of
   different functions subserved by the dMPFC (self-evaluation, inferences
   regarding complex enduring dispositions of self and others,
   confrontation of perspectives in interpersonal scripts) plays a role in
   anosognosia for current characteristics of personality in AD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the neural
   basis of framing effects. We tested the reflexive and reflective systems
   model of social cognition as it relates to framing. We also examined the
   relationships among frame susceptibility, intelligence and personality
   measures. Participants evaluated whether personal attributes applied to
   themselves from multiple perspectives and in positive and negative
   frames. Participants rated whether each statement was descriptive or not
   and endorsed positive frames more than negative frames. Individual
   differences on frame decisions enabled us to form high and low frame
   susceptibility groups. Endorsement of frame-consistent attributes was
   associated with personality factors, cognitive reflection and
   intelligence. Reflexive brain regions were associated with positive
   frames while reflective areas were associated with negative frames.
   Region of Interest analyses showed that frame-inconsistent responses
   were associated with increased activation within reflective cognitive
   control regions including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC),
   dorsomedial PFC and left ventrolateral PFC. Frame-consistent responses
   were associated with increased activation in the right orbitofrontal
   cortex. These results demonstrate that individual differences in frame
   susceptibility influence personal attribute evaluations. Overall, this
   study clarifies the neural correlates of the reflective and reflexive
   systems of social cognition as applied to decisions about social

Abstract = {{The ability of a deceiver to track a victim's ongoing judgments about
   the truthfulness of the deceit can be critical for successful deception.
   However, no study has yet investigated the neural circuits underlying
   receiving a judgment about one's lie. To explore this issue, we used a
   modified Guilty Knowledge Test in a mock murder situation to
   simultaneously record the neural responses involved in producing
   deception and later when judgments of that deception were made.
   Producing deception recruited the bilateral inferior parietal lobules
   (IPLs), right ventral lateral prefrontal (VLPF) areas and right
   striatum, among which the activation of the right VLPF contributed
   mostly to diagnosing the identities of the participants, correctly
   diagnosing 81.25\% of `murderers' and 81.25\% of `innocents'. Moreover,
   the participant's response when their deception was successful uniquely
   recruited the right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral IPLs, bilateral
   orbitofrontal cortices, bilateral middle temporal gyrus and left
   cerebellum, among which the right IPL contributed mostly to diagnosing
   participants' identities, correctly diagnosing 93.75\% of murderers and
   87.5\% of innocents. This study shows that neural activity associated
   with being a successful liar (or not) is a feasible indicator for
   detecting lies and may be more valid than neural activity associated
   with producing deception.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expression perception can be influenced by the natural visual
   context in which the face is perceived. We performed an fMRI experiment
   presenting participants with fearful or neutral faces against
   threatening or neutral background scenes. Triangles and scrambled scenes
   served as control stimuli. The results showed that the valence of the
   background influences face selective activity in the right anterior
   parahippocampal place area (PPA) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex
   (sgACC) with higher activation for neutral backgrounds compared to
   threatening backgrounds (controlled for isolated background effects) and
   that this effect correlated with trait empathy in the sgACC. In
   addition, the left fusiform gyrus (FG) responds to the affective
   congruence between face and background scene. The results show that
   valence of the background modulates face processing and support the
   hypothesis that empathic processing in sgACC is inhibited when affective
   information is present in the background. In addition, the findings

Abstract = {{So far, it was unclear if social hierarchy could influence sensory or
   perceptual cognitive processes. We evaluated the effects of social
   hierarchy on these processes using a basic visual perceptual decision
   task. We constructed a social hierarchy where participants performed the
   perceptual task separately with two covertly simulated players
   (superior, inferior). Participants were faster (better) when performing
   the discrimination task with the superior player. We studied the time
   course when social hierarchy was processed using event-related
   potentials and observed hierarchical effects even in early stages of
   sensory-perceptual processing, suggesting early top-down modulation by
   social hierarchy. Moreover, in a parallel analysis, we fitted a
   drift-diffusion model (DDM) to the results to evaluate the decision
   making process of this perceptual task in the context of a social
   hierarchy. Consistently, the DDM pointed to nondecision time (probably
   perceptual encoding) as the principal period influenced by social
   hierarchy.}},

Abstract = {{Self-contribution to the income (individual achievement) was an
   important factor which needs to be taken into individual's fairness
   considerations. This study aimed at elucidating the modulation of
   self-contribution to the income, on recipient's responses to unfairness
   in the Ultimatum Game. Eighteen participants were scanned while they
   were playing an adapted version of the Ultimatum Game as responders.
   Before splitting money, the proposer and the participant (responder)
   played the ball-guessing game. The responder's contribution to the
   income was manipulated by both the participant's and the proposer's
   accuracy in the ball-guessing game. It turned out that the participants
   more often rejected unfair offers and gave lower fairness ratings when
   they played a more important part in the earnings. At the neural level,
   anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex and temporoparietal junction showed greater activities to
   unfairness when self-contribution increased, whereas ventral striatum
   and medial orbitofrontal gyrus showed higher activations to fair (vs
   unfair) offers in the other-contributed condition relative to the other
   two. Besides, the activations of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   during unfair offers showed positive correlation with rejection rates in
   the self-contributed condition. These findings shed light on the
   significance of self-contribution in fairness-related social

Abstract = {{A previous functional MRI adaptation study on trait inference indicated
   that a trait code is located in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC), but could not rule out that this adaptation effect is due to
   the trait's underlying valence. To address this issue, we presented
   sentences describing positive and negative valences of either a human
   trait or object characteristic, and manipulated whether the human trait
   or object characteristic was repeated or not, either with the same or
   opposite valance. In two trait conditions, a behavioral trait-implying
   sentence was preceded by a prime sentence that implied the same or the
   opposite trait. The results confirmed the earlier finding of robust
   trait adaptation from prime to target in the vmPFC, and also found
   adaptation in the precuneus and right mid-occipital cortex. In contrast,
   no valence adaptation was found in two novel object conditions, in which
   the target sentence again implied a positive or negative trait, but was
   preceded by a prime sentence that described an object with the same or
   the opposite valence. Together with the previous study, this indicates
   that a specific trait code, but not a generalized valence code, is

   musical tension in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (pars orbitalis
   of the inferior frontal gyrus). In addition, a region of interest
   analysis in bilateral amygdala showed activation in the right
   superficial amygdala during periods of increasing tension (compared with
   decreasing tension). This is the first neuroimaging study investigating
   the time-varying changes of the emotional experience of musical tension,

Abstract = {{Empathic communication between couples plays an important role in
   relationship quality and individual well-being and research has pointed
   to the role of oxytocin in providing the neurobiological substrate for
   pair-bonding and empathy. Here, we examined links between genetic
   variability on the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and empathic behaviour
   at the initiation of romantic love. Allelic variations on five OXTR
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with
   susceptibility to disorders of social functioning were genotyped in 120
   new lovers: OXTRrs13316193, rs2254298, rs1042778, rs2268494 and
   rs2268490. Cumulative genetic risk was computed by summing risk alleles
   on each SNP. Couples were observed in support-giving interaction and
   behaviour was coded for empathic communication, including affective
   congruence, maintaining focus on partner, acknowledging partner's
   distress, reciprocal exchange and non-verbal empathy. Hierarchical
   linear modelling indicated that individuals with high OXTR risk
   exhibited difficulties in empathic communication. OXTR risk predicted
   empathic difficulties above and beyond the couple level, relationship
   duration, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Findings underscore the
   involvement of oxytocin in empathic behaviour during the early stages of
   social affiliation, and suggest the utility of cumulative risk and
   plasticity indices on the OXTR as potential biomarkers for research on
   disorders of social dysfunction and the neurobiology of empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Social avoidance is a major factor contributing to the development and
   maintenance of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Converging evidence
   suggests that social avoidance is associated with abnormal aversive
   processing and hyperactive amygdala signaling. However, what are the
   consequences of such abnormal aversive processing for action and for the
   neural mechanisms implementing action is unclear. Existing literature is
   conflicting, pointing at either enhanced or reduced action inhibition.
   We investigated the interaction between aversion and action in social
   avoidance by comparing the effects of aversive vs appetitive faces on a
   go/no-go task and associated striatal signals in 42 high and low
   socially avoidant individuals. We combined fMRI with a novel
   probabilistic learning task, in which emotional valence (angry and happy
   faces) and optimal response (go-and no-go-responses) were manipulated
   independently. High compared with low socially avoidant individuals
   showed reduced behavioral inhibition (proportion no-go-responses) for
   angry relative to happy faces. This behavioral disinhibition correlated
   with greater striatal signal during no-go-responses for angry relative
   to happy faces. The results suggest that social avoidant coping style is
   accompanied by disinhibition of action and striatal signal in the
   context of social threat. The findings concur with recent theorizing
   about aversive disinhibition and affective disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variants within the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) impact
   the neurobiology and risk for anxiety-related behaviours. There are also
   gender differences in the prevalence of anxiety-related behaviours.
   Although numerous studies have investigated the influence of 5-HTTLPR
   genotype on the neural systems involved in emotional regulation, none
   have investigated how these effects are modulated by gender and anxiety.
   We investigated this issue using two complementary region of
   interest-based structural neuroimaging approaches (voxel-based
   morphometry and Freesurfer) in 138 healthy individuals categorized into
   `no anxiety' and `subclinical anxiety' groups based on the Hamilton
   Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). Preliminarily, using anxiety as a
   continuous variable, we found a significant interaction effect of
   genotype by gender on anxiety. Females homozygous for the Short allele
   showed the highest HAM-A scores and males the lowest. In addition, a
   three-way significant interaction among genotype, gender and anxiety
   category was found for the right amygdala volume. Post hoc tests
   revealed that homozygous females carrying the Short variant with a
   subclinical anxiety condition had larger volume. The reported
   interaction effects demonstrate that gender strongly modulates the
   relationship between 5-HTTLPR genotype and subclinical expression of
   anxiety acting on amygdala, one region of the emotional neural network
   specifically involved in the anxiety-like behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{Aggression is a common response to provocation, albeit with considerable
   interindividual differences. In this fMRI study, we investigated
   emotional reactivity to threat as possible link between provocation and
   aggression, as well as the neural correlates of this relationship. We
   hypothesized that emotional reactivity, measured as fear potentiation
   (FP) of the startle response, would be negatively associated with
   aggressive behavior and would modulate neural activity during an
   aggressive interaction. In 30 healthy female participants, FP was
   measured as the difference between blink amplitudes while watching
   threatening vs neutral pictures. Participants subsequently engaged in a
   variant of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP), while being scanned.
   During the TAP, participants selected a punishment level for either a
   highly provoking or a nonprovoking opponent. There was no difference in
   aggressive behavior between participants high and low in FP. However, we
   found a negative correlation between FP and the neural provocation
   effect in several regions of a network previously associated with
   mentalizing including the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and the
   temporo-parietal junction. Independently of the FP variability,
   aggressive behavior correlated with the provocation effect on activity
   in the caudate nucleus. Our results indicate that during a provocative
   confrontation, high emotional reactivity to threat suppresses
   recruitment of the mentalizing network.}},

Abstract = {{Observation of others in pain induces positive elevation (pain effect)
   in late event-related potentials (ERP). This effect is associated with
   top-down attention regulating processes. It has previously been shown
   that stimulus exposure duration can affect top-down attentional
   modulation of response to threat-related stimuli. We investigated the
   effect of exposure duration on ERP response to others in pain. Two late
   ERP components, P3 and late positive potentials (LPP), from 18 healthy
   people were measured while they viewed pictures of hands in painful or
   neutral situations for either 200 or 500 ms, during two task conditions
   (pain judgment and counting hands). P3 and LPP pain effects during the
   pain judgment condition were significantly greater with 500 ms than 200
   ms stimulus presentation. Ours is the first study to suggest that
   engagement of empathy-related self-regulatory processes reflected in
   late potentials requires longer exposure to the pain-related stimulus.
   Although this is important information about the relationship between
   early sensory and subsequent brain processing, and about engagement of
   self-regulatory processes, the neural basis of this time-dependence
   remains unclear. It might be important to investigate the relationship
   between stimulus duration and empathic response in clinical populations
   where issues of self-regulation, empathic response and speed of
   information processing exist.}},

Abstract = {{How children respond to social and nonsocial rewards has important
   implications for understanding social cognitive development. Adults find
   faces intrinsically rewarding. However, little is known about how
   children respond to face vs nonface rewards. We utilized event-related
   potentials (the stimulus-preceding negativity, SPN) to measure
   differences in reward anticipation during a guessing game in 6 -to
   8-year-olds. Children were presented with reward indicators accompanied
   by incidental face or nonface stimuli. Nonface stimuli were comprised of
   scrambled faces in the shape of arrows, controlling for low-level
   properties of the two conditions. Children showed an increased SPN when
   the reward stimuli were accompanied by faces, relative to nonface
   stimuli. This suggests that children find a face stimulus more rewarding
   than a nonface stimulus. The results have important implications for
   processing social vs nonsocial rewards in typically developing children,
   and allow testing of populations with deficits in social reward
   processing, such as autism spectrum disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Reward responses in the medial temporal lobes and dopaminergic midbrain
   boost episodic memory formation in healthy adults, and weak memory for
   emotionally positive material in depression suggests this mechanism may
   be dysfunctional in major depressive disorder (MDD). To test this
   hypothesis, we performed a study in which unmedicated adults with MDD
   and healthy controls encoded drawings paired with reward or zero tokens
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging. In a recognition test,
   participants judged whether drawings were previously associated with the
   reward token ('reward source') or the zero token ('zero source'). Unlike
   controls, depressed participants failed to show better memory for
   drawings from the reward source vs the zero source. Consistent with
   predictions, controls also showed a stronger encoding response to reward
   tokens vs zero tokens in the right para-hippocampus and dopaminergic
   midbrain, whereas the MDD group showed the opposite pattern-stronger
   responses to zero vs reward tokens-in these regions. Differential
   activation of the dopaminergic midbrain by reward vs zero tokens was
   positively correlated with the reward source memory advantage in
   controls, but not depressed participants. These data suggest that weaker
   memory for positive material in depression reflects blunted encoding
   responses in the dopaminergic midbrain and medial temporal lobes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent symptom provocation studies that compared patients suffering from
   dental phobia with healthy controls identified hyperactivation of basal
   ganglia structures, but none have assessed striatal functional
   connectivity. We reanalyzed data from a previous functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study on dental phobia. Patients (20 men, 25 women)
   and healthy controls (18 men, 23 women) had been exposed to pictures
   showing dental treatment, and neutral contents. We conducted
   connectivity analyses via psychophysiological interactions (PPIs).
   Relative to non-phobic controls, the patients showed decreased
   connectivity between prefrontal and basal ganglia regions. Moreover, the
   clinical group was characterized by increased internal basal ganglia
   connectivity, which was more pronounced in female compared with male
   patients. This study provides first evidence for an altered information
   flow within a fronto-striatal network in dentophobic individuals during
   visual symptom provocation, which can be considered a neuromarker of
   this disorder.}},

   displays (PLDs). Intrinsic FC of the right pSTS was further examined
   using 584 (278 ASD/306 controls) resting-state data of the Autism Brain
   Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Participants with ASD were less accurate
   than controls in recognizing emotional states from PLDs. Analyses
   revealed pronounced ASD-related reductions both in task-based activity
   and resting-state iFC of the right pSTS with fronto-parietal areas
   typically encompassing the action observation network (AON). Notably,
   pSTS-hypo-activity was related to pSTS-hypo-connectivity, and both
   measures were predictive of emotion recognition performance with each
   measure explaining a unique part of the variance. Analyses with the
   large independent ABIDE dataset replicated reductions in pSTS-iFC to
   fronto-parietal regions. These findings provide novel evidence that pSTS
   hypo-activity and hypo-connectivity with the fronto-parietal AON are
   linked to the social deficits characteristic of ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Being reminded of the inherently finite nature of human existence has
   been demonstrated to elicit strivings for sexual reproduction and the
   formation and maintenance of intimate relationships. Recently, it has
   been proposed that the perception of potential mating partners is
   influenced by mortality salience. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we investigated the neurocognitive processing of attractive
   opposite-sex faces after priming with death-related words for
   heterosexual men and women. Significant modulations of behavioral and
   neural responses were found when participants were requested to decide
   whether they would like to meet the presented person. Men were more in
   favor of meeting attractive women after being primed with death-related
   words compared to a no-prime condition. Increased neural activation
   could be found under mortality salience in the left anterior insula and
   the adjacent lateral prefrontal cortex (IPFC) for both men and women. As
   previously suggested, we believe that the IPFC activation reflects an
   approach-motivated defense mechanism to overcome concerns that are
   induced by being reminded of death and dying. Our results provide
   insight on a neurocognitive level that approach motivation in general,
   and mating motivation in particular is modulated by mortality salience.}},

Abstract = {{The emotion `warmth-liking' (WL) associated with feelings of affection
   and acceptance is regularly activated in social contexts. WL has been
   suggested to be more closely related to the consummatory phase of
   post-goal attainment positive affect than to pre-goal attainment
   positive affect/approach motivation and to be partly mediated by brain
   opioids. To validate these assumptions we employed film/imagery to
   induce either a neutral emotional state or WL in female participants
   after intake of either placebo or the opioid antagonist naltrexone.
   Dependent variables were emotion self-report, interpersonal trust
   (TRUST, i.e. a behavioral indicator of WL) and frontal asymmetry (i.e.
   an electroencephalogram (EEG) indicator of approach
   motivation/behavioral activation). We found that participants reported
   more WL in the placebo/WL group than in the placebo/neutral group and
   both naltrexone groups. In addition, TRUST increased in the WL group
   after placebo, but not after naltrexone, and this pattern was reversed
   in the neutral control groups. Consequently, opioid blockade suppressed
   or even reversed the effects of the WL induction on the levels of
   self-report and behavior, respectively. In addition, we observed reduced
   relative left-frontal asymmetry in the WL (vs neutral) group, consistent
   with reduced approach motivation. Overall, these results suggest
   opioidergic influences on WL and TRUST and reduced approach
   motivation/behavioral activation for the positive emotion WL.}},

Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) has been largely studied by imaging, but
   not yet by neurodynamics, using electroencephalography (EEG) functional
   connectivity (FC). mindfulness meditation (MM), a receptive,
   non-elaborative training is theorized to lower DMN activity. We
   explored: (i) the usefulness of EEG-FC for investigating the DMN and
   (ii) the MM-induced EEG-FC effects. To this end, three MM groups were
   compared with controls, employing EEG-FC (-MPC, mean phase coherence).
   Our results show that: (i) DMN activity was identified as reduced
   overall inter-hemispheric gamma MPC during the transition from resting
   state to a time production task and (ii) MM-induced a state increase in
   alpha MPC as well as a trait decrease in EEG-FC. The MM-induced EEG-FC
   decrease was irrespective of expertise or band. Specifically, there was
   a relative reduction in right theta MPC, and left alpha and gamma MPC.
   The left gamma MPC was negatively correlated with MM expertise, possibly
   related to lower internal verbalization. The trait lower gamma MPC
   supports the notion of MM-induced reduction in DMN activity, related
   with self-reference and mind-wandering. This report emphasizes the
   possibility of studying the DMN using EEG-FC as well as the importance
   of studying meditation in relation to it.}},

Abstract = {{Prior research links greater activation of posterior medial frontal
   cortex (pMFC) and anterior insula (AI) with decreasing outcome
   predictability during decision making, as measured by decreasing
   probability for the more likely outcome out of two or increasing outcome
   variance. In addition to predictability, much work indicates that the
   magnitude or `stakes' of the outcome is also important. Despite the
   interest in the neural correlates of these decision variables, it is
   unknown whether pMFC and AI are differentially sensitive to
   predictability when magnitude is varied. This study examined brain
   activity during decision making in relation to decreasing outcome
   predictability for low as compared with high magnitude decisions. For
   low magnitude decisions, reduced predictability of the outcome was
   associated with greater activity in pMFC and bilateral AI, replicating
   prior studies. In contrast, there was no relationship between
   predictability and brain activity for high magnitude decisions, which
   tended to elicit greater pMFC and AI activity than low magnitude
   decisions for more predictable outcomes. These data indicate that the
   relationship between outcome predictability and pMFC and AI activity
   during decision making depends on magnitude, and suggest that these
   regions may be responding to the motivational salience of the decision
   rather than predictability information per se.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to identify vulnerability patterns in psychological,
   physiological and neural responses to mild psychosocial challenge in a
   population that is at a direct risk of developing depression, but who
   has not as yet succumbed to the full clinical syndrome. A group of
   healthy and a group of subclinically depressed participants underwent a
   modified Montreal Imaging Stress task (MIST), a mild neuroimaging
   psychosocial task and completed state self-esteem and mood measures.
   Cortisol levels were assessed throughout the session. All participants
   showed a decrease in performance self-esteem levels following the MIST.
   Yet, the decline in performance self-esteem levels was associated with
   increased levels of anxiety and confusion in the healthy group, but
   increased levels of depression in the subclinical group, following the
   MIST. The subclinical group showed overall lower cortisol levels
   compared with the healthy group. The degree of change in activity in the
   subgenual anterior cingulate cortex in response to negative evaluation
   was associated with increased levels of depression in the whole sample.
   Findings suggest that even in response to a mild psychosocial challenge,
   those individuals vulnerable to depression already show important
   maladaptive response patterns at psychological and neural levels. The
   findings point to important targets for future interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Episodic memory loss is one of the hallmarks of age-related cognitive
   decline and a major symptom of Alzheimer's disease. The persistence and
   strength of memories is determined by modulatory factors such as
   emotional arousal. Whether emotional memories are preserved with age or
   if these memories are just as susceptible to loss and forgetting is not
   well understood. We have recently shown that emotion alters how similar
   memories are stored using nonoverlapping representations (i.e., pattern
   separation) in an emotional mnemonic discrimination task. Here, we
   extend this work to testing young and older adults at 2 time points
   (immediately after encoding and 24 hr later). Overall, older adults
   performed worse than young adults, a memory deficit that was not
   secondary to perceptual or attentional deficits. When tested
   immediately, older adults were impaired on neutral target recognition
   but intact on emotional target recognition. We also found that a pattern
   we previously reported in young adults (reduced emotional compared to
   neutral discrimination of similar items) was reversed in older adults.
   When tested after 24 hr, young adults exhibited less forgetting of
   emotional targets compared to neutral, while older adults exhibited more
   forgetting of emotional targets. Finally, discrimination of highly
   similar positive items was preserved in older adults. These results
   suggest that emotional modulation of memory interacts with age in a
   complex manner such that the emotion-induced memory trade-off reported
   in young adults is reversed in older adults. These findings shed light
   on how emotion and memory interact in the aging brain.}},

Abstract = {{A loud auditory stimulus (LAS) presented during movement preparation can
   result in an earlier than normal movement onset. This effect had
   initially been assumed to be independent of the sensorial modality
   people attended to trigger their responses. In 2 experiments, we tested
   whether this assumption was warranted. In Experiment 1, we employed a
   timed response paradigm in which participants were cued in relation to
   the precise moment of movement onset of their motor responses. In the
   visual task, participants were cued about movement onset via visual cues
   on a monitor screen. In the auditory task, participants were cued about
   movement onset through tones delivered via headphones. During both
   tasks, we delivered an unexpected LAS 200 ms prior to movement onset. We
   found that the responses were initiated earlier by the LAS in the
   auditory task in relation to the visual task. In Experiment 2, we
   presented participants with a sequence of tones and flashes interleaved.
   The participants' task was to ignore either the tones or the flashes and
   make a movement in sync with the last tone or flash. The results showed
   that when participants had to ignore the task-irrelevant tones in the
   background, the early responses were much reduced. In contrast, when
   participants had to pay attention to the tones and ignore the flashes,
   the early release of anticipatory actions was robust. Our results
   indicate that attention to a specific sensorial modality can affect the
   early release of motor responses by LAS.}},

Abstract = {{Novelty seeking refers to the tendency of humans and animals to explore
   novel and unfamiliar stimuli and environments. The idea that dopamine
   modulates novelty seeking is supported by evidence that novel stimuli
   excite dopamine neurons and activate brain regions receiving
   dopaminergic input. In addition, dopamine is shown to drive exploratory
   behavior in novel environments. It is not clear whether dopamine
   promotes novelty seeking when it is framed as the decision to explore
   novel options versus the exploitation of familiar options. To test this
   hypothesis, we administered systemic injections of saline or GBR-12909,
   a selective dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitor, to monkeys and
   assessed their novelty seeking behavior during a probabilistic decision
   making task. The task involved pseudorandom introductions of novel
   choice options. This allowed monkeys the opportunity to explore novel
   options or to exploit familiar options that they had already sampled. We
   found that DAT blockade increased the monkeys' preference for novel
   options. A reinforcement learning (RL) model fit to the monkeys' choice
   data showed that increased novelty seeking after DAT blockade was driven
   by an increase in the initial value the monkeys assigned to novel
   options. However, blocking DAT did not modulate the rate at which the
   monkeys learned which cues were most predictive of reward or their
   tendency to exploit that knowledge. These data demonstrate that dopamine
   enhances novelty-driven value and imply that excessive novelty
   seeking-characteristic of impulsivity and behavioral addictions-might be
   caused by increases in dopamine, stemming from less reuptake.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforcement-based learning models predict that the strength of
   association between cues and outcomes is driven by aspects of outcome
   value. However, animals routinely make associations between contingent
   stimuli in the world, even if those associations hold no value to the
   organism. At the neural level, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is known to
   encode associative information, but it is not known whether this
   encoding is specific for value-based information (consistent with
   reinforcement-based models) or if the NAc additionally plays a more
   general role in forming predictive associations, independent of outcome
   value. To test this, we employed a sensory preconditioning (SPC) task
   where rats initially (Preconditioning) received either contingent
   pairings of 2 neutral stimuli (e. g., tone {[}A] and light {[}X];
   ``Paired{''}), or random noncontingent presentations ({''}Unpaired{''}).
   After cue X was subsequently conditioned with food (First-Order
   Conditioning), the effect of preconditioning was assessed in Phase 3
   (Test) by presentations of cue A alone. Electrophysiological recordings
   from the NAc core showed significant increases in phasic encoding for
   the stimuli in the Paired (but not Unpaired) condition as well as during
   test. Further, these effects were only seen in Paired rats that showed
   successful behavior during test (Good Learners), but not those who did
   not (Poor Learners) or Unpaired controls. These findings reveal a role
   for the NAc in the encoding of associative contingencies independent of
   value, and suggest that this structure also plays a more general role in
   forming associations necessary for predictive behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The prediction-error model of dopamine (DA) signaling has largely been
   confirmed with various appetitive Pavlovian conditioning procedures and
   has been supported in tests of Pavlovian extinction. Studies have
   repeatedly shown, however, that extinction does not erase the original
   memory of conditioning as the prediction-error model presumes, putting
   the model at odds with contemporary views that treat extinction as an
   episode of learning rather than unlearning of conditioning. Here, we
   combined fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) with appetitive Pavlovian
   conditioning to assess DA release directly during extinction and
   reinstatement. DA was monitored in the nucleus accumbens core, which
   plays a key role in reward processing. Following at least 4 daily
   sessions of 16 tone-food pairings, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was
   performed while rats received additional tone-food pairings followed by
   tone alone presentations (i.e., extinction). Acquisition memory was
   reinstated with noncontingent presentations of reward and then tested
   with cue presentation. Tone-food pairings produced transient (1- to 3-s)
   DA release in response to tone. During extinction, the amplitude of the
   DA response decreased significantly. Following presentation of 2
   noncontingent food pellets, subsequent tone presentation reinstated the
   DA signal. Our results support the prediction-error model for appetitive
   Pavlovian extinction but not for reinstatement.}},

Abstract = {{Withdrawal from chronic nicotine is associated with cognitive deficits.
   Therapies that ameliorate cognitive deficits during withdrawal aid in
   preventing relapse during quit attempts. Withdrawal-induced deficits in
   contextual learning are associated with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
   upregulation. The aim of the present study was to determine if the
   acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil has the ability to reverse
   nicotine withdrawal-induced deficits in contextual learning. Results
   demonstrated that low doses of donepezil, which do not enhance
   contextual learning or alter locomotor activity/anxiety-related
   behavior, can reverse nicotine withdrawal-induced deficits in contextual
   learning. Thus, donepezil may have therapeutic value for ameliorating
   cognitive deficits associated with nicotine withdrawal and for

Abstract = {{Early adversity increases the risk of nearly all mental health
   disorders. Although tractable animal models exist to probe the
   psychobiology of early adversity, the empirical research has focused
   largely on adult outcomes. In the current studies we examined how early
   exposure to the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) affects the
   maturation of fear extinction in infant rats. Whereas juvenile and adult
   rodents exhibit extinction learning that is relapse-prone (i.e., they
   show renewal and reinstatement of extinguished fear), under typical
   rearing conditions the extinction system in infant rats appears to be
   relapse-resistant (i.e., extinction leads to a permanent reduction in
   conditioned fear). In the current studies we tested the hypothesis that
   chronically exposing infant rats to CORT, either indirectly (through
   maternal drinking water) or directly (via insertion of an osmotic pump),
   leads to an early transition into the adult-like extinction system
   (i.e., evidence of the renewal effect). Although some differences were
   observed between the 2 methods of CORT exposure, the data showed that
   infants exposed to CORT via either method exhibited premature emergence
   of adult-like extinction learning (i.e., they exhibited the renewal
   effect). The theoretical implications of these findings for typical and
   abnormal development of emotion learning systems, as well as their
   practical applications in the context of prevention and treatment of
   mental health disorders, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Rats with juvenile play experience display a greater ability in
   coordinating their movements with social partners than those deprived of
   such experience, and this may be due to the play-induced neural
   restructuring of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The present study
   investigates the role of the mPFC in interanimal coordination. Rats with
   and without bilateral mPFC lesions were tested on a robbing-and-dodging
   task. This food protection task measures the ability of rats to protect
   pieces of food by gaining and maintaining an interanimal distance
   between themselves and the rat attempting to rob the food. Given that
   mPFC lesions have been associated with sensory and motor deficits, the
   same rats were also subjected to a task to measure skilled motor
   movements. Rats with bilateral mPFC lesions had more food stolen and
   displayed an inability to maintain interanimal distance with partner,
   but did not exhibit any motor or sensory deficits. These findings
   suggest that the mPFC is involved in interanimal coordination and that
   the play-induced neural restructuring of this area may account for the
   enhanced coordination seen in rats with prior play experience.}},

Abstract = {{When long-term memories are reactivated, they can reenter a transient
   plastic state in which they are vulnerable to interference or
   physiological manipulations. The present study attempted to directly
   affect reactivated memories through a stress manipulation, and compared
   the effects of stress on reactivated and nonreactivated components of a
   declarative memory in a within-subject design. We presented image pairs
   that consisted of an image of an animal and an image of an unrelated
   object. Participants were instructed to memorize the object images.
   Forty-eight hours later, we presented half of the animal images again in
   an unrelated task to indirectly reactivate the associated object images.
   Immediately after reactivation, participants were exposed to cold
   pressor stress or a warm water control condition. Forty-eight hours
   later, we assessed memory for the object images with a free recall test.
   Reactivation boosted memory performance in the control condition, such
   that reactivated items were better recalled than nonreactivated items.
   This memory-enhancing effect of reactivation was completely abolished by
   cold pressor stress. Importantly, stress selectively impacted only the
   reactivated items while leaving memory for the nonreactivated items
   unaffected. The present study shows that it is possible to selectively
   reactivate and modulate specific parts of a declarative memory.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have started to examine the neurochemical and hormonal

   postmortem. However, it is unknown whether stress involved with
   experimental handling prior to euthanizing animals will have an impact

   zebrafish to a short net handling stressor (30 s) and examine the levels
   of monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, and their
   metabolites) and whole-body cortisol at different intervals poststressor
   (0, 1, 5, 10, and 15 min). We report a time-dependent increase in the
   levels of cortisol, but no alterations in the levels of dopamine, DOPAC
   (dopamine's metabolite), serotonin, or 5HIAA (serotonin's metabolite)
   poststressor. The results demonstrate cortisol levels are more
   responsive to this type of stimulus compared with neurochemical
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is used to manage treatment of neuropathic
   pain to reduce pain and hyperalgesia and to improve activity. Prior
   studies using animal models of neuropathic pain have shown that SCS
   reduces hyperalgesia; however, it is unclear whether SCS affects
   physical activity. Therefore, we tested whether nerve injury (spared
   nerve injury {[}SNI] model) reduced physical activity levels, and
   whether SCS could restore these decreased activity levels. We tested
   whether SCS given over a long duration (6 hr daily for 3 months)
   remained effective. We compared SNI with uninjured controls over 4
   weeks, and SNI with sham SCS with SNI with active SCS (4 or 60 Hz at
   90\% motor threshold). We confirmed the presence of mechanical
   hyperalgesia by examining mechanical thresholds of the paw with von Frey
   filaments. Physical activity levels were monitored over 30 min in an
   automated activity chamber as follows: overall activity, distance
   traveled, grooming behaviors, and rearing. Measures were taken during
   SCS every 1-2 weeks for 3 months. Animals with SNI (and no or sham SCS)
   showed decreased withdrawal thresholds ipsilaterally and reduced
   physical activity (rearing, distance, lines crossed) for 3 months. Both
   4- and 60-Hz SCS increased paw withdrawal threshold during and
   immediately after SCS through 3 months. Both 4- and 60-Hz SCS increased
   the overall activity (lines crossed), distance traveled, and rearing,
   but not grooming behaviors for 3 months. This effect remained similar
   across the 3 months. Thus, measurement of spontaneous physical activity
   could be useful to examine nocifensive behaviors after nerve injury and
   is sensitive to SCS.}},

Abstract = {{We are today surrounded almost constantly by high-frequency
   electromagnetic fields (EMFs) from mobile communications base stations.
   To date, however, there has been little concern regarding nonthermal
   effects of EMFs on cognition. In the present study, male and female rats
   were subjected to continuous far-field exposure to a frequency of
   900-MHz (Global System for Mobile Communications {[}GSM]) or 1.966-GHz
   (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System {[}UMTS]) at 0.4 W/kg.
   Memory performance of adult EMF-exposed and sham-exposed female rats (at
   6 months of age) and male rats (at 3 and 6 months of age) was tested
   using a social discrimination procedure. For this procedure, a target
   juvenile male was introduced to the subject's home cage for 4 min (Trial
   1). After 30 min, the same target animal and a novel juvenile male were
   simultaneously presented to the subject for 4 min (Trial 2). Differences
   in sniffing duration to the familiar and novel target rats during Trial
   2 were used to assess memory performance. EMF-exposed females exhibited
   no differences in sniffing duration compared with controls. In contrast,
   the sniffing durations of EMF-exposed males at 3 months of age were
   significantly affected. At 6 months of age, GSM-, but not UMTS-, exposed
   male adults showed a memory performance deficit. These findings provide
   new insight into the nonthermal effects of long-term high-frequency EMF
   exposure on memory.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in neuroscience have provided new insights into the
   understanding of heart-brain interaction and communication. Cardiac
   information to the brain relies on two pathways, terminating in the
   insular cortex (IC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), along with the
   somatosensory cortex (S1-S2). Interoception relying on these
   neuroanatomical pathways has been shown to modulate social cognition. We
   report the case study of C. S., a patient with an `external heart' (an
   extracorporeal left-univentricular cardiac assist device, LVAD). The
   patient was assessed with neural/behavioral measures of cardiac
   interoception complemented by neuropsychological and social cognition
   measures. The patient's performance on the interoception task (heartbeat
   detection) seemed to be guided by signals from the artificial LVAD,
   which provides a somatosensory beat rather than by his endogenous heart.
   Cortical activity (HEP, heartbeat-evoked potential) was found decreased
   in comparison with normal volunteers, particularly during interoceptive
   states. The patient accurately performed several cognitive tasks, except
   for interoception-related social cognition domains (empathy, theory of
   mind and decision making). This evidence suggests an imbalance in the
   patient's cardiac interoceptive pathways that enhances sensation driven
   by the artificial pump over that from the cardiac vagal-IC/ACC pathway.
   A patient with two hearts, one endogenous and one artificial, presents a
   unique opportunity to explore models of interoception and heart-brain
   interaction.}},

Abstract = {{22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic mutation associated
   with disorders of cortical connectivity and social dysfunction. However,
   little is known about the functional connectivity (FC) of the resting
   brain in 22q11DS and its relationship with social behavior. A seed-based
   analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was
   used to investigate FC associated with the posterior cingulate cortex
   (PCC), in (26) youth with 22qDS and (51) demographically matched
   controls. Subsequently, the relationship between PCC connectivity and
   Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores was examined in 22q11DS
   participants. Relative to 22q11DS participants, controls showed
   significantly stronger FC between the PCC and other default mode network
   (DMN) nodes, including the precuneus, precentral gyrus and left frontal
   pole. 22q11DS patients did not show age-associated FC changes observed
   in typically developing controls. Increased connectivity between PCC,
   medial prefrontal regions and the anterior cingulate cortex, was
   associated with lower SRS scores (i.e. improved social competence) in
   22q11DS. DMN integrity may play a key role in social information
   processing. We observed disrupted DMN connectivity in 22q11DS,
   paralleling reports from idiopathic autism and schizophrenia. Increased
   strength of long-range DMN connectivity was associated with improved
   social functioning in 22q11DS. These findings support a
   `developmental-disconnection' hypothesis of symptom development in this
   disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human characteristics or
   behaviour to animals, non-living things or natural phenomena. It is
   pervasive among humans, yet nonetheless exhibits a high degree of
   inter-individual variability. We hypothesized that brain areas
   associated with anthropomorphic thinking might be similar to those
   engaged in the attribution of mental states to other humans, the
   so-called `theory of mind' or mentalizing network. To test this
   hypothesis, we related brain structure measured using magnetic resonance
   imaging in a sample of 83 healthy young adults to a simple, self-report
   questionnaire that measured the extent to which our participants made
   anthropomorphic attributions about non-human animals and non-animal
   stimuli. We found that individual differences in anthropomorphism for
   non-human animals correlated with the grey matter volume of the left
   temporoparietal junction, a brain area involved in mentalizing. Our data
   support previous work indicating a link between areas of the brain
   involved in attributing mental states to other humans and those involved
   in anthropomorphism.}},

Abstract = {{Hypnosis can affect perception, motor function and memory. However, so
   far no study using neuroimaging has investigated whether hypnosis can
   influence reward processing and decision-making. Here, we assessed
   whether posthypnotic suggestions can diminish the attractiveness of
   unhealthy food and whether this is more effective than diminishing
   attractiveness by one's own effort via autosuggestion. In total, 16
   participants were hypnotized and 16 others were instructed to associate
   a color cue (blue or green) with disgust regarding specific snacks
   (sweet or salty). Afterwards, participants bid for snack items shown on
   an either blue or green background during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging measurement. Both hypnosis and autosuggestion successfully
   devalued snacks. This was indicated by participants' decision-making,
   their self-report and by decreased blood oxygen level-dependent signal
   in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region known to
   represent value. Different vmPFC subregions coded for cue and snack
   type. The cue had significantly stronger effects on vmPFC after hypnosis
   than after autosuggestion, indicating that hypnosis was more effective
   in genuinely reducing value. Supporting previous findings, the precuneus
   was involved in the hypnotic effects by encoding whether a snack was
   sweet or salty during hypnotic cue presentation. Our results demonstrate
   that posthypnotic suggestions can influence valuation and
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how the brain computes value is a basic question in
   neuroscience. Although individual studies have driven this progress,
   meta-analyses provide an opportunity to test hypotheses that require
   large collections of data. We carry out a meta-analysis of a large set
   of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of value computation to
   address several key questions. First, what is the full set of brain
   areas that reliably correlate with stimulus values when they need to be
   computed? Second, is this set of areas organized into dissociable
   functional networks? Third, is a distinct network of regions involved in
   the computation of stimulus values at decision and outcome? Finally, are
   different brain areas involved in the computation of stimulus values for
   different reward modalities? Our results demonstrate the centrality of
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), ventral striatum and posterior
   cingulate cortex (PCC) in the computation of value across tasks, reward
   modalities and stages of the decision-making process. We also find
   evidence of distinct subnetworks of co-activation within VMPFC, one
   involving central VMPFC and dorsal PCC and another involving more
   anterior VMPFC, left angular gyrus and ventral PCC. Finally, we identify
   a posterior-to-anterior gradient of value representations corresponding
   to concrete-to-abstract rewards.}},

Abstract = {{Implicit or automatic detection of social signals, which discriminate
   animate, intentional objects in the environment, is essential for higher
   social cognition and its development. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we identified the neural substrate of detecting
   simple visual social signals and examined its functional link with the
   mechanism of inferring another's mental state. Healthy participants were
   presented with the eye-gaze shift (EG) and self-propelling motion (SP)
   under both implicit and explicit task conditions. They also performed a
   social role-playing game in which mental inference (MI) was implicitly
   prompted during the presentation of faces (implicit MI). Implicit
   detection of EG and SP activated the posterior middle temporal gyrus
   (pMTG) bilaterally, whereas the right posterior superior temporal sulcus
   was activated during the explicit conditions. We revealed that the
   individual variation in neural response in the right pMTG during
   implicit eye-gaze detection explains the individual tendency to recruit
   the regions implicated in mental-state inference (medial prefrontal
   cortex, temporal pole and striatum) during the implicit MI task. Our
   results suggest that the implicit detection of visual social signals
   involves the pMTG and underlies the development of higher social
   cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical accounts of emotion regulation (ER) discriminate various
   cognitive strategies to voluntarily modify emotional states. Amongst
   these, attentional deployment (i.e. distraction) and cognitive change
   (i.e. reappraisal), have been shown to successfully down-regulate
   emotions. Neuroimaging studies found that both strategies differentially
   engage neural structures associated with selective attention, working
   memory and cognitive control. The aim of this study was to further
   delineate similarities and differences between the ER strategies
   reappraisal and distraction by investigating their temporal brain
   dynamics using event-related potentials (ERPs) and their patterns of
   facial expressive behavior. Twenty-one participants completed an ER
   experiment in which they had to either passively view positive, neutral
   and negative pictures, reinterpret them to down-regulate affective
   responses (reappraisal), or solve a concurrently presented mathematical
   equation (distraction). Results demonstrate the efficacy of both
   strategies in the subjective control of emotion, accompanied by
   reductions of facial expressive activity (Corrugator supercilii and
   Zygomaticus major). ERP results indicated that distraction, compared
   with reappraisal, yielded a stronger and earlier attenuation of the late
   positive potential (LPP) magnitude for negative pictures. For positive
   pictures, only distraction but not reappraisal had significant effect on
   LPP attenuation. The results support the process model of ER, separating
   subtypes of cognitive strategies based on their specific time course.}},

Abstract = {{Human beings are constantly engaged in thought. Sometimes thoughts occur
   repetitively and can become distressing. Up to now the neural bases of
   these intrusive or unwanted thoughts is largely unexplored. To study the
   neural correlates of unwanted thoughts, we acquired resting-state fMRI
   data of 41 female healthy subjects and assessed the self-reported amount
   of unwanted thoughts during measurement. We analyzed local connectivity
   by means of regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity of a
   seed region. More unwanted thoughts (state) were associated with lower
   ReHo in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and higher ReHo in
   left striatum (putamen). Additional seed-based analysis revealed higher
   functional connectivity of the left striatum with left inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG) in participants reporting more unwanted thoughts. The
   state-dependent higher connectivty in left striatum was positively
   correlated with rumination assessed with a dedicated questionnaire
   focussing on trait aspects. Unwanted thoughts are associated with
   activity in the fronto-striatal brain circuitry. The reduction of local
   connectivity in DLPFC could reflect deficiencies in thought suppression
   processes, whereas the hightened activity in left striatum could imply
   an imbalance of gating mechanisms housed in basal ganglia. Its
   functional connectivity to left IFG is discussed as the result of
   thought-related speech processes.}},

Abstract = {{When people state their willingness to pay for something, the amount
   usually differs from the behavior in a real purchase situation. The
   discrepancy between a hypothetical answer and the real act is called
   hypothetical bias. We investigated neural processes of hypothetical bias
   regarding monetary donations to public goods using fMRI with the
   hypothesis that amygdala codes for real costs. Real decisions activated
   amygdala more than hypothetical decisions. This was observed for both
   accepted and rejected proposals. The more the subjects accepted real
   donation proposals the greater was the activity in rostral anterior
   cingulate cortex-a region known to control amygdala but also neural
   processing of the cost-benefit difference. The presentation of a
   charitable donation goal evoked an insula activity that predicted the
   later decision to donate. In conclusion, we have identified the neural
   mechanisms underlying real donation behavior, compatible with theories
   on hypothetical bias. Our findings imply that the emotional system has
   an important role in real decision making as it signals what kind of
   immediate cost and reward an outcome is associated with.}},

Abstract = {{Many people routinely criticise themselves. While self-criticism is
   largely unproblematic for most individuals, depressed patients exhibit
   excessive self-critical thinking, which leads to strong negative
   affects. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy
   subjects (N = 20) to investigate neural correlates and possible
   psychological moderators of self-critical processing. Stimuli consisted
   of individually selected adjectives of personally negative content and
   were contrasted with neutral and negative non-self-referential
   adjectives. We found that confrontation with self-critical material
   yielded neural activity in regions involved in emotions (anterior
   insula/hippocampus-amygdala formation) and in anterior and posterior
   cortical midline structures, which are associated with self-referential
   and autobiographical memory processing. Furthermore, contrasts revealed
   an extended network of bilateral frontal brain areas. We suggest that
   the co-activation of superior and inferior lateral frontal brain regions
   reflects the recruitment of a frontal top-down pathway, representing
   cognitive reappraisal strategies for dealing with evoked negative
   affects. In addition, activation of right superior frontal areas was
   positively associated with neuroticism and negatively associated with
   cognitive reappraisal. Although these findings may not be specific to
   negative stimuli, they support a role for clinically relevant
   personality traits in successful regulation of emotion during
   confrontation with self-critical material.}},

Abstract = {{Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), an enzyme that converts dopamine to
   norepinephrine, has broad influences on social functions. In this study,
   we examined to what extent two polymorphisms (-1021C/T and a 19 bp
   insertion/deletion) in DBH gene modulate individuals' empathic
   perception and response, which were measured, respectively, by reading
   the mind in the eyes test and the empathic concern subscale of
   interpersonal reactivity index. Results showed that polymorphism at
   -1021C/T, but not the 19 bp insertion/deletion, accounts for 2.3\%
   variance of empathic perception and 1.4\% variance of empathic response.
   Individuals with the CC genotype, which is associated with higher DBH
   activity, manifested greater empathic ability than those with CT/TT
   genotypes. These findings demonstrate the importance of DBH -1021C/T as
   a genetic basis of empathy and in predicting individual differences in
   social and affective processing.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of social rejection on cardiac and brain responses was
   examined in a study in which participants had to decide on the basis of
   pictures of virtual peers whether these peers would like them or not.
   Physiological and behavioral responses to expected and unexpected
   acceptance and rejection were compared. It was found that participants
   expected that about 50\% of the virtual judges gave them a positive
   judgment. Cardiac deceleration was strongest for unexpected social
   rejection. In contrast, the brain response was strongest to expected
   acceptance and was characterized by a positive deflection peaking around
   325 ms following stimulus onset and the observed difference was maximal
   at fronto-central positions. The cardiac and electrocortical responses
   were not related. It is hypothesized that these differential response
   patterns might be related to earlier described differential involvement

   emotional stimulus processing is critically dependent on attention
   toward emotional stimulus features. We set out to test this hypothesis
   using EEG measurements and a modified oddball paradigm. Unexpected
   emotional stimuli evoked amplitude variations of the P3a (an ERP marker

Abstract = {{Neural activity in the social brain network varies across individuals
   with different cultural traits and different genetic polymorphisms. It
   remains unknown whether a specific genetic polymorphism may influence
   the association between cultural traits and neural activity in the
   social brain network. We tested whether the serotonin transporter
   promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) affects the association between
   self-construals and neural activity involved in reflection of personal
   attributes of oneself and a significant other (i.e., mother). Using
   functional MRI, we scanned Chinese adults with short/short (s/s) or
   long/long (l/l) variants of the 5-HTTLPR during reflection of personal
   attributes of oneself and one's mother. We found that, while s/s and l/l
   genotype groups did not differ significantly in self-construals measured
   by the Self-Construal Scale, the relationship between self-construal
   scores and neural responses to reflection of oneself and mother was
   significantly different between the two genotype groups. Specifically,
   l/l but not s/s genotype group showed significant association between
   self-construal scores and activity in the medial prefrontal cortex,
   bilateral middle frontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, insula and
   hippocampus during reflection on mental attributes of oneself and
   mother. Our findings suggest that a specific genetic polymorphism may

Abstract = {{A substantial body of evidence indicates that utilitarian judgments
   (favoring the greater good) made in response to difficult moral dilemmas
   are preferentially supported by controlled, reflective processes,
   whereas deontological judgments (favoring rights/duties) in such cases
   are preferentially supported by automatic, intuitive processes. A recent
   neuroimaging study by Kahane et al. challenges this claim, using a new
   set of moral dilemmas that allegedly reverse the previously observed
   association. We report on a study in which we both induced and measured
   reflective responding to one of Greene et al.'s original dilemmas and
   one of Kahane et al.'s new dilemmas. For the original dilemma, induced
   reflection led to more utilitarian responding, replicating previous
   findings using the same methods. There was no overall effect of induced
   reflection for the new dilemma. However, for both dilemmas, the degree
   to which an individual engaged in prior reflection predicted the
   subsequent degree of utilitarian responding, with more reflective
   subjects providing more utilitarian judgments. These results cast doubt
   on Kahane et al.'s conclusions and buttress the original claim linking
   controlled, reflective processes to utilitarian judgment and automatic,
   intuitive processes to deontological judgment. Importantly, these
   results also speak to the generality of the underlying theory,
   indicating that what holds for cases involving utilitarian physical
   harms also holds for cases involving utilitarian lies.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala plays a central role in processing facial affect,
   responding to diverse expressions and features shared between
   expressions. Although speculation exists regarding the nature of
   relationships between expression-and feature-specific amygdala
   reactivity, this matter has not been fully explored. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and principal component analysis (PCA) in a
   sample of 300 young adults, to investigate patterns related to
   expression-and feature-specific amygdala reactivity to faces displaying
   neutral, fearful, angry or surprised expressions. The PCA revealed a
   two-dimensional correlation structure that distinguished emotional
   categories. The first principal component separated neutral and
   surprised from fearful and angry expressions, whereas the second
   principal component separated neutral and angry from fearful and
   surprised expressions. This two-dimensional correlation structure of
   amygdala reactivity may represent specific feature-based cues conserved
   across discrete expressions. To delineate which feature-based cues
   characterized this pattern, face stimuli were averaged and then
   subtracted according to their principal component loadings. The first
   principal component corresponded to displacement of the eyebrows,
   whereas the second principal component corresponded to increased
   exposure of eye whites together with movement of the brow. Our results
   suggest a convergent representation of facial affect in the amygdala
   reflecting feature-based processing of discrete expressions.}},

Abstract = {{Computerized attention modification is a relatively new and empirically
   validated treatment approach for different types of anxiety disorders.
   However, its neural basis and processes involved are poorly understood.
   This study examined the effect of a one-time application of an attention
   modification program (AMP) on neural substrates underlying emotion
   processing in individuals with high social anxiety. Fourteen individuals
   with elevated social anxiety symptoms completed an emotional face
   processing task during functional magnetic resonance imaging before and
   after AMP, and were subsequently exposed to a laboratory stressor.
   Results revealed the following: First, there was attenuated activation
   from pre- to post-AMP in the bilateral amygdala, bilateral insula and
   subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Second, post-AMP, individuals
   exhibited increased activation in several regions of the prefrontal
   cortex (PFC). Third, those individuals with greater enhancement of
   ventromedial PFC activation after AMP showed diminished attentional
   allocation for threat and attenuated anxiety reactivity to the stressor.
   We conclude that AMP exerts effects that are similar to those previously
   reported for standard anxiolytics; however, it also appears to foster
   deployment of top-down brain processes aimed to regulate anxiety.}},

   men do. During fMRI, male and female participants viewed evocative
   images that varied in novelty and valence. Women and men showed
   equivalent responses to novel negative material, but women showed a
   sustained amygdala response to familiar negative material relative to
   men, indicating that women's amygdala responses were more persistent
   over multiple repetitions of negative material. Individuals with more
   persistent amygdala responses also reported greater levels of negative

Abstract = {{Prosody refers to the melodic and rhythmic aspects of speech. Two forms
   of prosody are typically distinguished: `affective prosody' refers to
   the expression of emotion in speech, whereas `linguistic prosody'
   relates to the intonation of sentences, including the specification of
   focus within sentences and stress within polysyllabic words. While these
   two processes are united by their use of vocal pitch modulation, they
   are functionally distinct. In order to examine the localization and
   lateralization of speech prosody in the brain, we performed two
   voxel-based meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies of the perception of
   affective and linguistic prosody. There was substantial sharing of brain
   activations between analyses, particularly in right-hemisphere auditory
   areas. However, a major point of divergence was observed in the inferior
   frontal gyrus: affective prosody was more likely to activate Brodmann
   area 47, while linguistic prosody was more likely to activate the
   ventral part of area 44.}},

Abstract = {{In major depressive disorder (MDD), as a network-level disease, the
   pathophysiology would be displayed to a wide extent over the brain.
   Moreover, the network-wide changes could be dependent on the context of
   affective processing. In this study, we sought affective state-dependent
   changes of the brain functional network by applying a graph-theoretical
   approach to functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired in 13
   patients with MDD and 12 healthy controls who were exposed to video
   clips inducing the negative, neutral or positive affective state. For
   each affective condition, a group-wise brain functional network was
   constructed based on partial correlation of mean activity across
   subjects between brain areas. Network parameters, global and local
   efficiencies, were measured from the brain functional network. Compared
   with controls', patients' brain functional network shifted to the
   regular network in the topological architecture, showing decreased
   global efficiency and increased local efficiency, during negative and
   neutral affective processing. Further, the shift to the regular network
   in patients was most evident during negative affective processing. MDD
   is proposed to provoke widespread changes across the whole brain in an
   affective state-dependent manner, specifically in the negative affective
   state.}},

Abstract = {{Exaggerated anticipatory anxiety during expectation of

   psychopathology of social anxiety disorder (SAD). The neural basis of
   anticipatory anxiety in SAD has not been investigated in controlled
   studies. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates during the anticipation of
   public and evaluated speaking vs a control condition in 17 SAD patients
   and 17 healthy control subjects. FMRI results show increased activation
   of the insula and decreased activation of the ventral striatum in SAD
   patients, compared to control subjects during anticipation of a speech
   vs the control condition. In addition, an activation of the amygdala in
   SAD patients during the first half of the anticipation phase in the
   speech condition was observed. Finally, the amount of anticipatory
   anxiety of SAD patients was negatively correlated to the activation of
   the ventral striatum. This suggests an association between incentive
   function, motivation and anticipatory anxiety when SAD patients expect a
   performance situation.}},

Abstract = {{Depression frequently involves disrupted inter-personal relationships,
   while treatment with serotonergic anti-depressants can interfere with
   libido and sexual function. However, little is known about how serotonin
   activity influences appraisals of intimate partnerships. Learning more
   could help to specify how serotonergic mechanisms mediate social
   isolation in psychiatric illness. Forty-four healthy heterosexual
   adults, currently in romantic relationships, received 8 days treatment
   with the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor citalopram (N = 21; 10
   male) or placebo (N = 23; 12 male). Participants viewed photographs of
   unknown, heterosexual couples and made a series of judgements about
   their relationships. Participants also indicated the importance of
   relationship features in their own close partnerships, and close
   partnerships generally. Citalopram reduced the rated quality of couples'
   physical relationships and the importance attributed to physical and
   intimate aspects of participants' own relationships. In contrast,
   citalopram also enhanced the evaluated worth of mutual trust in
   relationships. Amongst males, citalopram was associated with judgements
   of reduced turbulence and bickering in others' relationships, and
   increased male dominance. These data constitute preliminary evidence
   that enhancing serotonin activity modulates cognitions about sexual
   activity as part of a re-appraisal of sources of value within close
   intimate relationships, enhancing the judged importance of longer-term
   benefits of trust and shared experiences.}},

   hydrocortisone or placebo 45 min before fear extinction. In fear
   acquisition, a picture of a geometrical figure was either partially
   paired (conditioned stimulus; CS+) or not paired (CS-) with an
   electrical stimulation (unconditioned stimulus; UCS). In fear
   extinction, each CS was presented again, but no UCS occurred. Cortisol
   increased conditioned skin conductance responses in early and late
   extinction. In early extinction, higher activation towards the CS- than
   to the CS+ was found in the amygdala, hippocampus and posterior
   parahippocampal gyrus. This pattern might be associated with the
   establishment of a new memory trace. In late extinction, the placebo
   compared with the cortisol group displayed enhanced CS+/CS-
   differentiation in the amygdala, medial frontal cortex and nucleus
   accumbens. A change from early deactivation to late activation of the
   extinction circuit as seen in the placebo group seems to be needed to
   enhance extinction and to reduce fear. Cortisol appears to interfere
   with this process thereby impairing extinction of recently acquired
   conditioned fear.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, two major emotion
   regulation strategies, are differentially related to emotional
   well-being. The aim of this study was to test the association of
   individual differences in these two emotion regulation strategies with
   gray matter volume of brain regions that have been shown to be involved
   in the regulation of emotions. Based on high-resolution magnetic
   resonance images of 96 young adults voxel-based morphometry was used to
   analyze the gray matter volumes of the a priori regions of interest,
   including amygdala, insula, dorsal anterior cingulate and paracingulate
   cortex, medial and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and their association
   with cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression usage as well as
   neuroticism. A positive association of cognitive reappraisal with right
   and tendentially left amygdala volume and of neuroticism with left
   amygdala volume (marginally significant) was found. Expressive
   suppression was related to dorsal anterior cingulate/paracingulate
   cortex and medial PFC gray matter volume. The results of this study
   emphasize the important role of the amygdala in individual differences
   in cognitive reappraisal usage as well as neuroticism. Additionally, the
   association of expressive suppression usage with larger volumes of the
   medial PFC and dorsal anterior/paracingulate cortex underpins the role
   of these regions in regulating emotion-expressive behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Perceived threat from outgroups is a consistent social-environmental
   antecedent of intergroup bias (i.e. prejudice, ingroup favoritism). The
   serotonin transporter gene polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) has been associated
   with individual variations in sensitivity to context, particularly
   stressful and threatening situations. Here, we examined how 5-HTTLPR and
   environmental factors signaling potential outgroup threat dynamically
   interact to shape intergroup bias. Across two studies, we provide novel
   evidence for a gene-environment interaction on the acquisition of
   intergroup bias and prejudice. Greater exposure to signals of outgroup
   threat, such as negative prior contact with outgroups and perceived
   danger from the social environment, were more predictive of intergroup
   bias among participants possessing at least one short allele (vs two
   long alleles) of 5-HTTLPR. Furthermore, this gene x environment
   interaction was observed for biases directed at diverse ethnic and
   arbitrarily-defined outgroups across measures reflecting intergroup
   biases in evaluation and discriminatory behavior. These findings reveal
   a candidate genetic mechanism for the acquisition of intergroup bias,
   and suggest that intergroup bias is dually inherited and transmitted
   through the interplay of social (i.e. contextual cues of outgroup
   threat) and biological mechanisms (i.e. genetic sensitivity toward
   threatening contexts) that regulate perceived intergroup threats.}},

Abstract = {{Semiochemicals are volatile compounds that communicate specific meaning
   between individuals and elicit specific behavioral and/or physiological
   responses mediated by highly sensitive and highly specific olfactory
   pathways. Recent work suggests that semiochemicals can activate multiple
   olfactory pathways at once, but the degree to which parallel pathways
   activated by the same semiochemical interact and what the behavioral
   consequences of such interactions are remains a topic of debate. Here,
   we approached this question behaviorally, investigating whether rats
   could be trained to avoid carbon disulfide (CS2; conditional stimulus)
   via taste-potentiated odor aversion, and asking whether any such
   learning would have an impact on rats' subsequent use of CS2 as a
   semiochemical cue (i.e., in a socially transmitted food preference
   paradigm). The results show that CS2-mediated food preference learning
   is unimpaired by aversions conditioned to CS2, a result indicating that
   canonical and semiochemical pathways for the processing of CS2 function
   in a largely independent manner.}},

Title = {{Intake-Dependent Effects of Cocaine Self-Administration on Impulsive

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{419-429}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Cocaine use is associated with high levels of impulsive choice (greater
   discounting of delayed rewards) in humans, but the cause/effect
   relationships between cocaine use and impulsive choice are not fully
   understood. In previous work, we found that both experimenter-and
   self-administration of fixed quantities of cocaine caused lasting
   increases in impulsive choice in rats. The present study extended these
   findings by taking into account baseline impulsive choice prior to
   self-administration and by allowing rats free access to cocaine. Male
   Long-Evans rats were trained in a delay discounting task in which they
   made discrete-trial choices between small immediate and large delayed
   food rewards. Half of the rats were then implanted with intravenous
   catheters and, following recovery, allowed to self-administer cocaine
   HCl (1.0 mg/kg/infusion) in 6-hr sessions over 14 days. Control rats
   orally self-administered a sucrose solution under similar conditions.
   Upon completion of self-administration, rats remained abstinent for 3
   weeks before retesting in the delay discounting task. Cocaine and
   control groups did not differ prior to self-administration, but
   afterward, the cocaine group showed greater impulsive choice (fewer
   choices of large, delayed rewards) than controls. Additional analyses
   revealed that the effects of cocaine on impulsive choice were
   intake-dependent; rats classified as ``low intake{''} did not differ
   from controls, whereas rats classified as ``high intake{''} were
   significantly more impulsive than both controls and their precocaine
   baseline. These findings are consistent with the idea that
   cocaine-induced, pharmacologically based neural adaptations promote the
   development of impulsive decision making.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic relationships between different behaviors used to index the
   rewarding or reinforcing effects of alcohol are poorly understood. To
   address this issue, ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP)
   was tested in a genetically diverse panel of inbred mouse strains, and
   strain means from this study and other inbred strain studies were used
   to examine the genetic correlation between CPP and several
   ethanol-related phenotypes, including activity measures recorded during
   CPP training and testing. Mice from each strain were exposed to a
   well-characterized unbiased place conditioning procedure using ethanol
   doses of 2 or 4 g/kg; an additional group from each strain was exposed
   to saline alone on all trials. Genotype had a significant effect on CPP,
   basal locomotor activity, ethanol-stimulated activity, and the effect of
   repeated ethanol exposure on activity. Correlational analyses showed
   significant negative genetic correlations between CPP and sweetened
   ethanol intake and between CPP and test session activity, as well as a
   significant positive genetic correlation between CPP and chronic ethanol
   withdrawal severity. Moreover, there was a trend toward a positive
   genetic correlation between CPP and ethanol-induced conditioned taste
   aversion. These genetic correlations suggest overlap in the genetic
   mechanisms underlying CPP and each of these traits. The patterns of
   genetic relationships suggest a greater impact of ethanol's aversive
   effects on drinking and a greater impact of ethanol's rewarding effects
   on CPP. Overall, these data support the idea that genotype influences
   ethanol's rewarding effect, a factor that may contribute importantly to
   addictive vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{There is evidence that the nitric oxide (NO)/soluble guanylyl cyclase
   (sGC)/cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) signaling pathway in the basal
   lateral amygdala and hippocampus plays a key role in memory processing,
   but it is not known if this NO signaling pathway in the nucleus
   accumbens (Gomes et al., 2006), a known pivotal region in reward memory,
   is essential for drug-associated reward memory. We therefore
   investigated the effect of the NO/sGC/PKG signaling pathway in the
   nucleus accumbens (NAc) on morphine-induced conditioned place preference
   (CPP). Results showed that a preconditioning microinjection of the NO
   synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)
   into the NAc shell, but not into the core, significantly blocked the
   acquisition of morphine CPP. The blockage effect of L-NAME on the
   acquisition of CPP was imitated by the neuronal NOS inhibitor
   7-nitroindazole, 3-bromo-, sodium salt (7-NI), the sGC inhibitor
   1H-{[}1,2,4] oxadiazolo-{[}4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), and the PKG
   inhibitor Rp-8Br-PET-cGMPS. The 7-NI-or ODQ-induced effect was reversed
   by premicroinjection of the sGC activator YC-1 or the PKG activator
   8-Br-cGMP in the NAc shell. However, microinfusion of 7-NI, ODQ, or
   Rp-8Br-PET-cGMPS into the NAc shell or the core had no effect on the
   expression of morphine CPP. These findings indicate that the NO/sGC/PKG
   signaling pathway in the NAc shell is critical for the acquisition of
   morphine-induced place preference, whereas the same signaling pathway in
   the NAc shell or core is not involved in the retrieval of
   morphine-induced place preference.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is a prevalent neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder
   with poor prognosis and limited understanding of its etiology. This
   limited etiological understanding renders developing animal models of
   schizophrenia difficult. Although attempts are made to recreate putative
   etiologies in models, these models may only enable the generation of
   treatments targeted at the mechanisms manipulated. Although the
   chakragati mouse was not created as a result of a specific gene target,
   reports to date suggest these mice exhibit behavioral abnormalities that
   are consistent with some observed in patients with schizophrenia. As an
   initial screen on the relevance of these mice to schizophrenia, we
   tested the exploration and sensorimotor gating of male and female
   chakragati mice in the cross-species tests behavioral pattern monitor
   (BPM) and prepulse inhibition (PPI), respectively. The chakragati mice
   exhibited hyperactive yet more meandering/circling movements of
   exploration compared with wildtype (WT) littermates. Moreover,
   chakragati mice exhibited impaired PPI compared with WT mice, primarily
   at high prepulse intensity levels. Thus, chakragati mice share some of
   the abnormal exploratory and PPI behaviors that are observed in patients
   with schizophrenia. These behaviors can be used to screen for novel
   antipsychotics which may be based on novel mechanisms of action. The
   multivariate abnormal exploration of these mice may also yield further
   information for treatment effects. Further characterization of these
   mice in tasks with putative links to negative or cognitive symptoms may
   further advance the utility of these mice as a screen for novel
   treatments for schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Clock genes have been implicated in several disorders, such as
   schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and drug
   dependence. However, few studies to date have examined the role of clock
   genes in fear-related behaviors. The authors used mice with the Clock
   Delta 19 mutation to assess the involvement of this gene in contextual
   fear conditioning. Male wild-type (WT) and Clock Delta 19 mutant mice
   underwent a single session of contextual fear conditioning (12 min, 4
   unsignaled shocks), followed by daily 12-min retention trials. There
   were no differences between mutant and WT mice in the acquisition of
   contextual fear, and WT and mutant mice demonstrated similar freezing
   during the first retention session. However, extinction of contextual
   fear was accelerated in mutant mice across the remaining retention
   sessions, as compared to WT mice, suggesting a role for Clock in
   extinction following aversive learning. Because the Clock Delta 19
   mutation has previously been demonstrated to result in an increase in
   dopamine signaling, the authors confirmed the role of dopamine in
   extinction learning using preretention session administration of a low
   dose of the dopamine transport reuptake inhibitor modafinil (0.75
   mg/kg), which resulted in decreased freezing across retention sessions.
   These findings are consistent with an emerging portrayal of the
   importance of Clock genes in noncircadian functions, as well as the
   important role of dopamine in extinction learning.}},

Title = {{Effects of Postretrieval-Extinction Learning on Return of Contextually
   Controlled Cued Fear}},

Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{Reactivation of an already consolidated memory makes it labile for a
   period of several hrs, which are required for its reconsolidation.
   Evidence suggests that the return of conditioned fear through
   spontaneous recovery, reinstatement, or renewal can be prevented by
   blockading this reconsolidation process using pharmacological or
   behavioral interventions. Postretrieval-extinction learning has been
   shown to prevent the return of cued fear in humans using fear-irrelevant
   stimuli, as well as cued and contextual fear in rodents. The effects of
   postretrieval extinction on human contextually controlled cued fear to
   fear-relevant stimuli remain unknown, and are the focus of the present
   study. The experimental design was based on 3 consecutive days:
   acquisition, reactivation and extinction, and re-extinction. For the
   fear conditioning, 2 zoo frames served as different contexts, 5
   fear-relevant stimuli (aversive animal pictures) served as conditioned
   stimuli (CS), electric shocks served as unconditioned stimuli (UCS).
   Expectancy ratings and skin-conductance response (SCR) were used as
   measures of fear responses; spontaneous recovery and renewal were used
   as indicators of the return of fear. The expectancy ratings and SCR
   results indicated spontaneous recovery on the third day, regardless of
   retrieval prior to extinction. No robust renewal effect was seen. It is
   suggested that the use of fear-relevant stimuli, the context salience,
   or reactivation context may explain the lack of reconsolidation effect.
   Our study indicates that the beneficial effects of
   postretrieval-extinction learning are sensitive to subtle methodological
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{Sex differences in emotional memory have received increasing interest
   over the past decade. However, to date, no work has explored how a
   postlearning stressor might modulate the influence of sex hormone status
   on memory for gist and peripheral detail in an emotional versus neutral
   context. Here, we tested 3 predictions. First, compared with naturally
   cycling (NC) women in the luteal phase, women on hormonal contraception
   (HC) would have significantly blunted hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   reactivity to physical stress. Second, postlearning stress would enhance
   detail and gist memory from an emotional story in NC women, and finally,
   postlearning stress would not affect emotional memory for details or
   gist in HC women. Healthy NC and HC women viewed a brief, narrated story
   containing neutral or emotionally arousing elements. Immediately after,
   cold pressor stress (CPS) or a control procedure was administered. One
   week later, participants received a surprise free recall test for story
   elements. NC women exhibited significantly greater cortisol increases to
   CPS compared with HC women. NC women who viewed the emotional story and
   were administered CPS recalled the most peripheral details overall and
   more gist from the emotional compared with the neutral story. In HC
   women, however, the postlearning cortisol release did not affect memory
   for gist or peripheral details from the emotional or neutral story in
   any way. Additionally, NC and HC women performed similarly on measures
   of attention and arousal. These findings suggest that in women,
   postlearning stress differentially affects memory for emotional
   information depending on their hormonal contraceptive status.}},

Abstract = {{The mammillary bodies and their projections via the mammilliothalamic
   tract to the anterior thalamic nuclei are known to be important for
   spatial memory in rodents, but their precise role remains unclear. To
   determine whether transection of the mammilliothalamic tract can produce
   deficits on tests of spatial memory even when the navigational demands
   placed on the animal are limited, rats with discrete mammilliothalamic
   tract lesions were tested on the ability to use distal visual cues to
   discriminate between 2 locations within a room, irrespective of the
   direction traveled (Experiment 1). Animals with mammilliothalamic tract
   lesions acquired this task more slowly and less accurately than control
   animals. Consistent with this impairment in discriminating different
   spatial locations, the same lesions also severely disrupted
   object-in-place memory but spared performance on standard tests of
   object recognition memory (Experiment 2). Finally, to compare
   performance on a task that is known to be sensitive to mammilliothalamic
   transection and requires animals to actively navigate within their
   environment, the effect of the lesions on spatial working memory in the
   radial-arm maze was examined. Taken together, the results suggest that
   even when there are little or no navigational demands, mammilliothalamic
   tract damage still results in impoverished encoding of spatial location.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The expression of the immediate-early gene c-fos was used to compare
   networks of activity associated with recency memory (temporal order
   memory) and recognition memory. In Experiment 1, rats were first
   familiarized with sets of objects and then given pairs of different,
   familiar objects to explore. For the recency test group, each object in
   a pair was separated by 110 min in the time between their previous
   presentations. For the recency control test, each object in a pair was
   separated by less than a 1 min between their prior presentations.
   Temporal discrimination of the objects correlated with c-fos activity in
   the recency test group in several sites, including area Te2, the
   perirhinal cortex, lateral entorhinal cortex, as well as the dentate
   gyrus, hippocampal fields CA3 and CA1. For both the test and control
   conditions, network models were derived using structural equation
   modeling. The recency test model emphasized serial connections from the
   perirhinal cortex to lateral entorhinal cortex and then to the CA1
   subfield. The recency control condition involved more parallel pathways,
   but again highlighted CA1 within the hippocampus. Both models contrasted
   with those derived from tests of object recognition (Experiment 2),
   because stimulus novelty was associated with pathways from the
   perirhinal cortex to lateral entorhinal cortex that then involved both
   the dentate gyrus (and CA3) and CA1 in parallel. The present findings
   implicate CA1 for the processing of familiar stimuli, including recency
   discriminations, while the dentate gyrus and CA3 pathways are recruited
   when the perirhinal cortex signals novel stimuli.}},

   biochemical results showed that amyloid-beta peptides (A beta 40 and A
   beta 42) increased with age. The endothelial expression of the A beta
   influx transporter (RAGE) also increased, and the expression of A beta
   efflux transporter (LPR-1) decreased, with age. The greatest change in
   the biochemical measures also were between 12 and 20 months. Twenty
   additional rats were analyzed for stem cell proliferation, and
   neurogenesis decreased with age, particularly between about 12 and 20
   months. These early changes in brain, biochemistry, and behavior provide

Abstract = {{Social anxiety is the intense fear of negative evaluation by others, and
   it emerges uniquely from a social situation. Given its social origin, we
   asked whether an anxiety-inducing social situation could enhance the
   processing of faces linked to the situational threat. While past
   research has focused on how individual differences in social anxiety
   relate to face processing, we tested the effect of manipulated social
   anxiety in the context of anxiety about appearing racially prejudiced in
   front of a peer. Visual processing of faces was indexed by the N170
   component of the event-related potential. Participants viewed faces of
   Black and White males, along with nonfaces, either in private or while
   being monitored by the experimenter for signs of prejudice in a `public'
   condition. Results revealed a difference in the N170 response to Black
   and Whites faces that emerged only in the public condition and only
   among participants high in dispositional social anxiety. These results
   provide new evidence that anxiety arising from the social situation
   modulates the earliest stages of face processing in a way that is
   specific to a social threat, and they shed new light on how anxiety
   effects on perception may contribute to the regulation of intergroup
   responses.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Joint actions require the integration of simultaneous self- and
   other-related behaviour. Here, we investigated whether this function is
   underpinned by motor simulation, that is the capacity to represent a
   perceived action in terms of the neural resources required to execute
   it. This was tested in a music performance experiment wherein on-line
   brain stimulation (double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, dTMS)
   was employed to interfere with motor simulation. Pianists played the
   right-hand part of piano pieces in synchrony with a recording of the
   left-hand part, which had (Trained) or had not (Untrained) been
   practiced beforehand. Training was assumed to enhance motor simulation.
   The task required adaptation to tempo changes in the left-hand part
   that, in critical conditions, were preceded by dTMS delivered over the
   right primary motor cortex. Accuracy of tempo adaptation following dTMS
   or sham stimulations was compared across Trained and Untrained
   conditions. Results indicate that dTMS impaired tempo adaptation
   accuracy only during the perception of trained actions. The magnitude of
   this interference was greater in empathic individuals possessing a
   strong tendency to adopt others' perspectives. These findings suggest
   that motor simulation provides a functional resource for the temporal
   coordination of one's own behaviour with others in dynamic social
   contexts.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Disengagement of emotion regulation circuits was previously shown in
   depressed mothers and was hypothesized to underlie the impaired
   maternal-infant sensitivity described in postpartum depression (PPD). We
   hypothesized similarly reduced resting-state functional connectivity in
   default mode network (DMN) regions involved in social cognition in PPD.
   Resting-state functional MRI, clinical and mother-infant attachment data
   were obtained from 14 unmedicated postpartum women with major depression
   and 23 healthy postpartum women. Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) time
   series were extracted, filtered between 0.007 and 0.08 Hz and used as
   regressors in a whole brain general linear model analysis. PCC-right
   amygdala connectivity was significantly disrupted in depressed compared
   to healthy mothers for low-frequency neural activity, showing a negative
   (inverse) coupling in the depressed group but not in the controls.
   PCC-right amygdala connectivity was positively correlated with
   PCC-parahippocampus connectivity. Resting connectivity patterns of
   positive co-activations in postpartum women mirrored the canonical DMN.
   These findings of reduced PCC-amygdala coupling raise the possibility
   that PPD might involve the disruption of outward, preventative aspects
   of self-relevant thought and theory of mind/empathy processes. Further
   integrated studies of neural connectivity and these cognitive/behavioral
   dimensions are warranted.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, `ecstasy') is used
   recreationally to improve mood and sociability, and has generated
   clinical interest as a possible adjunct to psychotherapy. One way that
   MDMA may produce positive `prosocial' effects is by changing responses
   to emotional stimuli, especially stimuli with social content. Here, we
   examined for the first time how MDMA affects subjective responses to
   positive, negative and neutral emotional pictures with and without
   social content. We hypothesized that MDMA would dose-dependently
   increase reactivity to positive emotional stimuli and dampen reactivity
   to negative stimuli, and that these effects would be most pronounced for
   pictures with people in them. The data were obtained from two studies
   using similar designs with healthy occasional MDMA users (total N =
   101). During each session, participants received MDMA (0, 0.75 and 1.5
   mg/kg oral), and then rated their positive and negative responses to
   standardized positive, negative and neutral pictures with and without
   social content. MDMA increased positive ratings of positive social
   pictures, but reduced positive ratings of non-social positive pictures.
   We speculate this `socially selective' effect contributes to the
   prosocial effects of MDMA by increasing the comparative value of social
   contact and closeness with others. This effect may also contribute to
   its attractiveness to recreational users.}},

Abstract = {{The human mirror system has been the subject of much research over the
   past two decades, but little is known about the timecourse of mirror
   responses. In addition, it is unclear whether mirror and counter-mirror
   effects follow the same timecourse. We used single-pulse transcranial
   magnetic stimulation to investigate the timecourse of mirror and
   counter-mirror responses in the human brain. Experiment 1 demonstrated
   that mirror responses can be measured from around 200 ms after observed
   action onset. Experiment 2 demonstrated significant effects of
   counter-mirror sensorimotor training at all timepoints at which a mirror
   response was found in Experiment 1 (i.e. from 200 ms onward), indicating
   that mirror and counter-mirror responses follow the same timecourse. By
   suggesting similarly direct routes for mirror and counter-mirror
   responses, these results support the associative account of mirror
   neuron origins whereby mirror responses arise as a result of correlated
   sensorimotor experience during development. More generally, they
   contribute to theorizing regarding mirror neuron function by providing
   some constraints on how quickly mirror responses can influence social
   cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Processing information from faces is crucial to understanding others and
   to adapting to social life. Many studies have investigated responses to
   facial emotions to provide a better understanding of the processes and
   the neural networks involved. Moreover, several studies have revealed
   abnormalities of emotional face processing and their neural correlates
   in affective disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate whether
   early visual event-related potentials (ERPs) are affected by the
   emotional skills of healthy adults. Unfamiliar faces expressing the six
   basic emotions were presented to 28 young adults while recording visual
   ERPs. No specific task was required during the recording. Participants
   also completed the Social Skills Inventory (SSI) which measures social
   and emotional skills. The results confirmed that early visual ERPs (P1,
   N170) are affected by the emotions expressed by a face and also
   demonstrated that N170 and P2 are correlated to the emotional skills of
   healthy subjects. While N170 is sensitive to the subject's emotional
   sensitivity and expressivity, P2 is modulated by the ability of the
   subjects to control their emotions. We therefore suggest that N170 and
   P2 could be used as individual markers to assess strengths and
   weaknesses in emotional areas and could provide information for further
   investigations of affective disorders.}},

   association was found. Imaging results revealed that responses in each
   group were associated with distinct patterns of brain activation,
   indicating divergent decision mechanisms. Acceptance of unfair offers
   was associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity in low
   scorers and ventromedial prefrontal cortex activity in high scorers.
   Overall, our findings point to distinct motivations for rejecting unfair
   offers in individuals who vary in psychopathic traits, with rejections
   in high psychopathy scorers being probably induced by frustration.
   Implications of these results for models of ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex dysfunction in psychopathy are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{How we perceive emotional signals from our environment depends on our
   personality. Alexithymia, a personality trait characterized by
   difficulties in emotion regulation has been linked to aberrant brain
   activity for visual emotional processing. Whether alexithymia also
   affects the brain's perception of emotional speech prosody is currently
   unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate
   the impact of alexithymia on hemo-dynamic activity of three a priori
   regions of the prosody network: the superior temporal gyrus (STG), the
   inferior frontal gyrus and the amygdala. Twenty-two subjects performed
   an explicit task (emotional prosody categorization) and an implicit task
   (metrical stress evaluation) on the same prosodic stimuli. Irrespective
   of task, alexithymia was associated with a blunted response of the right
   STG and the bilateral amygdalae to angry, surprised and neutral prosody.
   Individuals with difficulty describing feelings deactivated the left STG
   and the bilateral amygdalae to a lesser extent in response to angry
   compared with neutral prosody, suggesting that they perceived angry
   prosody as relatively more salient than neutral prosody. In conclusion,
   alexithymia may be associated with a generally blunted neural response
   to speech prosody. Such restricted prosodic processing may contribute to
   problems in social communication associated with this personality trait.}},

Abstract = {{In typical development, empathic abilities continue to refine during
   adolescence and early adulthood. Children and adolescents with autism
   spectrum disorders (ASD) show deficits in empathy, whereas adults with
   ASD may have developed compensatory strategies. We aimed at comparing
   developmental trajectories in the neural mechanisms underlying empathy
   in individuals with ASD and typically developing control (TDC) subjects.
   Using an explicit empathizing paradigm and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, 27 participants with ASD and 27 TDC aged 12-31 years were
   investigated. Participants were asked to empathize with emotional faces
   and to either infer the face's emotional state (other-task) or to judge
   their own emotional response (self-task). Differential age-dependent
   changes were evident during the self-task in the right dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, right medial prefrontal cortex, right inferior
   parietal cortex, right anterior insula and occipital cortex.
   Age-dependent decreases in neural activation in TDC were paralleled by
   either increasing or unchanged age-dependent activation in ASD. These
   data suggest ASD-associated deviations in the developmental trajectories
   of self-related processing during empathizing. In TDC, age-dependent
   modulations of brain areas may reflect the `fine-tuning' of cortical
   networks by reduction of task-unspecific brain activity. Increased
   age-related activation in individuals with ASD may indicate the
   development of compensatory mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{While abnormal processing of performance feedback has been associated
   with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), neural responses to different
   kinds of feedback information, especially to ambiguous feedback are
   widely unknown. Using fMRI and a performance adaptive time-estimation
   task, we acquired blood oxygenation level-dependant responses and
   emotional ratings to positive, negative and ambiguous performance
   feedback in patients and healthy controls. Negative and ambiguous
   feedback led to increased levels of anxiety, guilt and shame in
   patients. Both negative and ambiguous feedback, as compared to positive
   feedback, induced increased activation of the insular cortex in
   patients. Furthermore, patients showed no differential activation to
   negative feedback in the putamen and to ambiguous feedback in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Finally, negative feedback
   induced increased activation in the midcingulate cortex in patients
   compared to controls. Findings indicate that both negative and ambiguous
   performance feedbacks are associated with abnormal negative emotions and
   altered brain activation, in particular increased insula activation,
   while activation in the putamen and VMPFC does not differentiate between
   feedback types in OCD patients. This suggests a parallel pattern of
   increased and decreased neural sensitivity to different kinds of
   feedback information and a general emotional hyperresponsivity to
   negative and ambiguous performance feedback in OCD.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research on classical fear-conditioning in the anxiety disorders
   has identified overgeneralization of conditioned fear as an important
   conditioning correlate of anxiety pathology. Unfortunately, only one
   human neuroimaging study of classically conditioned fear generalization
   has been conducted, and the neural substrates of this clinically germane
   process remain largely unknown. The current generalization study employs
   a clinically validated generalization gradient paradigm, modified for
   the fMRI environment, to identify neural substrates of classically
   conditioned generalization that may function aberrantly in clinical
   anxiety. Stimuli include five rings of gradually increasing size with
   extreme sizes serving as cues of conditioned danger (CS+) and safety
   (CS-). The three intermediately sized rings serve as generalization
   stimuli (GSs) and create a continuum-of-size from CS+ to CS-. Results
   demonstrate `positive' generalization gradients, reflected by declines
   in responding as the presented stimulus differentiates from CS+, in
   bilateral anterior insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral
   inferior parietal lobule. Conversely, `negative' gradients, reflected by
   inclines in responding as the presented stimulus differentiates from CS+
   were instantiated in bilateral ventral hippocampus, ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and precuneus cortex. These results as well as those
   from connectivity analyses are discussed in relation to a working
   neurobiology of conditioned generalization centered on the hippocampus.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between belief in free will (BFW) and third-party
   punishment (TPP) of criminal norm violations has been the subject of
   great debate among philosophers, criminologists and neuroscientists. We
   combined a TPP task with functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   investigate how lay people's BFW might affect their punishment of
   hypothetical criminal offenses varying in affective content. Our results
   revealed that people with strong BFW punished more harshly than people
   with weak BFW, but only in low affective cases, likely driven by a more
   robust commitment to moral responsibility. This effect was mirrored by a
   stronger activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, a region
   presumably involved in attentional selection to salient stimuli and
   attribution of temporary intentions and beliefs of others. But, for high
   affective cases, the BFW-based behavioral and neural differences
   disappeared. Both groups similarly punished high affective cases and
   showed higher activation in the right insula. The right insula is
   typically activated during aversive interoceptive-emotional processing
   for extreme norm violations. Our results demonstrated that the impact of
   BFW on TPP is context-dependent; perhaps explaining in part why the
   philosophical debate between free will and determinism is so stubbornly
   persistent.}},

Abstract = {{People feel bad for inflicting harms upon others; this emotional state
   is termed interpersonal guilt. In this study, the participant played
   multiple rounds of a dot-estimation task with anonymous partners while
   undergoing fMRI. The partner would receive pain stimulation if the
   partner or the participant or both responded incorrectly; the
   participant was then given the option to intervene and bear a proportion
   of pain for the partner. The level of pain voluntarily taken and the
   activations in anterior middle cingulate cortex (aMCC) and bilateral
   anterior insula (AI) were higher when the participant was solely
   responsible for the stimulation (Self\_Incorrect) than when both
   committed an error (Both\_Incorrect). Moreover, the gray matter volume
   in the aMCC predicted the individual's compensation behavior, measured
   as the difference between the level of pain taken in the Self\_Incorrect
   and Both\_Incorrect conditions. Furthermore, a mediation pathway
   analysis revealed that activation in a midbrain region mediated the
   relationship between aMCC activation and the individual's tendency to
   compensate. These results demonstrate that the aMCC and the midbrain
   nucleus not only play an important role in experiencing interpersonal
   guilt, but also contribute to compensation behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Creativity enables humans to adapt flexibly to changing circumstances,
   to manage complex social relations and to survive and prosper through
   social, technological and medical innovations. In humans, chronic,
   trait-based as well as temporary, state-based approach orientation has
   been linked to increased capacity for divergent rather than convergent
   thinking, to more global and holistic processing styles and to more
   original ideation and creative problem solving. Here, we link creative
   cognition to oxytocin, a hypothalamic neuropeptide known to up-regulate
   approach orientation in both animals and humans. Study 1 (N = 492)
   showed that plasma oxytocin predicts novelty-seeking temperament. Study
   2 (N = 110) revealed that genotype differences in a polymorphism in the
   oxytocin receptor gene rs1042778 predicted creative ideation, with
   GG/GT-carriers being more original than TT-carriers. Using double-blind
   placebo-controlled between-subjects designs, Studies 3-6 (N = 191)
   finally showed that intranasal oxytocin (vs matching placebo) reduced
   analytical reasoning, and increased holistic processing, divergent
   thinking and creative performance. We conclude that the oxytonergic
   circuitry sustains and enables the day-to-day creativity humans need for
   survival and prosperity and discuss implications.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that brain regions for mentalizing,
   including temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC), are activated in understanding the nonliteral meaning of
   sentences. A different set of brain regions, including left inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG), is activated for dealing with pragmatic
   incongruence. Here we demonstrate that individuals' cognitive empathic
   ability modulates the brain activity underlying the processing of
   pragmatic constraints during sentence comprehension. The lian... dou...
   construction in Chinese (similar to English even) normally describes an
   event of low expectedness; it also introduces a pragmatic scale against
   which the likelihood of an underspecified event can be inferred. By
   embedding neutral or highly likely events in the construction, we
   created underspecified and incongruent sentences and compared both with
   control sentences in which events of low expectedness were described.
   Imaging results showed that (i) left TPJ was activated for the
   underspecified sentences, and the activity in mPFC correlated with
   individuals' fantasizing ability and (ii) anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) was activated for the incongruent sentences, and the activity in
   bilateral IFG correlated with individuals' perspective taking ability.
   These findings suggest that brain activations in making pragmatic
   inference and in dealing with pragmatic failure are modulated by
   different components of cognitive empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding emotions in others engages specific brain regions in
   temporal and medial prefrontal cortices. These activations are often
   attributed to more general cognitive `mentalizing' functions, associated
   with theory of mind and also necessary to represent people's
   non-emotional mental states, such as beliefs or intentions. Here, we
   directly investigated whether understanding emotional feelings recruit
   similar or specific brain systems, relative to other non-emotional
   mental states. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging with
   multivoxel pattern analysis in 46 volunteers to compare activation
   patterns in theory-of-mind tasks for emotions, relative to beliefs or
   somatic states accompanied with pain. We found a striking dissociation
   between the temporoparietal cortex, that exhibited a remarkable
   voxel-by-voxel pattern overlap between emotions and beliefs (but not
   pain), and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, that exhibited distinct
   (and yet nearby) patterns of activity during the judgment of beliefs and
   emotions in others. Pain judgment was instead associated with activity
   in the supramarginal gyrus, middle cingulate cortex and middle insular
   cortex. Our data reveal for the first time a functional dissociation
   within brain networks sub-serving theory of mind for different mental
   contents, with a common recruitment for cognitive and affective states
   in temporal regions, and distinct recruitment in prefrontal areas.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies on trait inference about the self and others have
   found a network of brain areas, the critical part of which appears to be
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We investigated whether the mPFC plays
   an essential role in the neural representation of a trait code. To
   localize the trait code, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) adaptation, which is a rapid suppression of neuronal responses
   upon repeated presentation of the same underlying stimulus, in this
   case, the implied trait. Participants had to infer an agent's (social)
   trait from brief trait-implying behavioral descriptions. In each trial,
   the critical (target) sentence was preceded by a sentence (prime) that
   implied the same trait, the opposite trait, or no trait at all. The
   results revealed robust adaptation from prime to target in the ventral
   mPFC only during trait conditions, as expected. Adaptation was strongest
   after being primed with a similar trait, moderately strong after an
   opposite trait and much weaker after a trait-irrelevant prime. This
   adaptation pattern was found nowhere else in the brain. In line with
   previous research on fMRI adaptation, we interpret these findings as
   indicating that a trait code is represented in the ventral mPFC.}},

Abstract = {{As a social species, humans evolved to detect information from the
   social behavior of others. Yet, the mechanisms used to evaluate social
   interactions, the brain networks implicated in such recognition, and
   whether individual differences in own social behavior determine response
   to similar behavior in others remain unknown. Here we examined social
   synchrony as a potentially important mechanism in the evaluation of
   social behavior and utilized the parenting context, an evolutionarily
   salient setting of significant consequences for infant survival, to test
   this issue. The brain response of healthy postpartum mothers to three
   mother-infant interaction vignettes was assessed. Videos included a
   typical synchronous interaction and two pathological interactions of
   mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression and anxiety that showed
   marked deviations from social synchrony. Mothers' own interactions with
   their 4- to 6-month-old infants were videotaped and micro-coded for
   synchrony. Results indicated that the recognition of social synchrony
   involved activations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC),
   fusiform, cuneus, inferior parietal lobule, supplementary motor area and
   NAcc. Mother's own synchrony with her infant correlated with her dACC
   response to synchrony in others. Findings are consistent with models
   suggesting that social action underpins social recognition and highlight
   social synchrony and the mother-infant bond as one prototypical context
   for studying the brain basis of social understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of empathy is a hallmark of social impairments in individuals with
   autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the concept empathy encompasses
   several socio-emotional and behavioral components underpinned by
   interacting brain circuits. This study examined empathic arousal and
   social understanding in individuals with ASD and matched controls by
   combining pressure pain thresholds (PPT) with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (study 1) and electroencephalography/event-related
   potentials and eye-tracking responses (study 2) to empathy-eliciting
   stimuli depicting physical bodily injuries. Results indicate that
   participants with ASD had lower PPT than controls. When viewing body
   parts being accidentally injured, increased hemodynamic responses in the
   somatosensory cortex (SI/SII) but decreased responses in the anterior
   mid-cingulate and anterior insula as well as heightened N2 but preserved
   late-positive potentials (LPP) were detected in ASD participants. When
   viewing a person intentionally hurting another, decreased hemodynamic
   responses in the medial prefrontal cortex and reduced LPP were observed
   in the ASD group. PPT was a mediator for the SI/SII response in
   predicting subjective unpleasantness ratings to others' pain. Both ASD
   and control groups had comparable mu suppression, indicative of typical
   sensorimotor resonance. The findings demonstrate that, in addition to
   reduced pain thresholds, individuals with ASD exhibit heightened
   empathic arousal but impaired social understanding when perceiving
   others' distress.}},

Abstract = {{Atypical visual processing of biological motion contributes to social
   impairments in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the exact
   temporal sequence of deficits of cortical biological motion processing
   in ASD has not been studied to date. We used 64-channel
   electroencephalography to study event-related potentials associated with
   human motion perception in 17 children and adolescents with ASD and 21
   typical controls. A spatio-temporal source analysis was performed to
   assess the brain structures involved in these processes. We expected
   altered activity already during early stimulus processing and reduced
   activity during subsequent biological motion specific processes in ASD.
   In response to both, random and biological motion, the P100 amplitude
   was decreased suggesting unspecific deficits in visual processing, and
   the occipito-temporal N200 showed atypical lateralization in ASD
   suggesting altered hemispheric specialization. A slow positive
   deflection after 400 ms, reflecting top-down processes, and human
   motion-specific dipole activation differed slightly between groups, with
   reduced and more diffuse activation in the ASD-group. The latter could
   be an indicator of a disrupted neuronal network for biological motion
   processing in ADS. Furthermore, early visual processing (P100) seems to
   be correlated to biological motion-specific activation. This emphasizes
   the relevance of early sensory processing for higher order processing
   deficits in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with antisocial behavior place a great physical and economic
   burden on society. Deficits in emotional processing have been recognized
   as a fundamental cause of antisocial behavior. Emerging evidence also
   highlights a significant contribution of attention allocation deficits
   to such behavior. A comprehensive literature search identified 12
   studies that were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, which
   compared 291 individuals with antisocial problems and 247 controls.
   Signed Differential Mapping revealed that compared with controls, gray
   matter volume (GMV) in subjects with antisocial behavior was reduced in
   the right lentiform nucleus (P < 0.0001), left insula (P = 0.0002) and
   left frontopolar cortex (FPC) (P = 0.0006), and was increased in the
   right fusiform gyrus (P < 0.0001), right inferior parietal lobule (P =
   0.0003), right superior parietal lobule (P = 0.0004), right cingulate
   gyrus (P = 0.0004) and the right postcentral gyrus (P = 0.0004). Given
   the well-known contributions of limbic and paralimbic areas to emotional
   processing, the observed reductions in GMV in these regions might
   represent neural correlates of disturbance in emotional processing
   underlying antisocial behavior. Previous studies have suggested an FPC
   role in attention allocation during emotional processing. Therefore, GMV
   deviations in this area may constitute a neural basis of deficits in
   attention allocation linked with antisocial behavior.}},

Abstract = {{There have been several reports on the association between the
   Val(158)Met genetic polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase
   (COMT) gene, as well as the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic
   region (5-HTTLPR) of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), and
   frontolimbic region volumes, which have been suggested to underlie
   individual differences in emotion processing or susceptibility to
   emotional disorders. However, findings have been somewhat inconsistent.
   This study used diffeomorphic anatomic registration through
   exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) whole-brain voxel-based morphometry
   to study the genetic effects of COMT Val(158)Met and SLC6A4 5-HTTLPR, as
   well as their interaction, on the regional gray matter volumes of a
   sample of 91 healthy volunteers. An interaction of COMT Val(158)Met x
   SLC6A4 5-HTTLPR genotypes with gray matter volume was found in bilateral
   parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, hippocampus, vermis of cerebellum and
   right putamen/insula. In particular, the gray matter volume in these
   regions was smaller in individuals who were both COMT-Met and 5-HTTLPR-S
   carriers, or both COMT-Val and 5-HTTLPR-L homozygotes, as compared with
   individuals with intermediate combinations of alleles. The interaction
   of COMT Val(158)Met and SLC6A4 5-HTTLPR adds to the understanding of
   individual differences in emotion processing.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence for a role of the amygdala in processing
   gaze direction and emotional relevance of faces. In this event-related
   functional magnetic resonance study we investigated amygdala responses
   while we orthogonally manipulated head direction, gaze direction and
   facial expression (angry, happy and neutral). This allowed us to
   investigate effects of stimulus ambiguity, low-level factors and
   non-emotional factors on amygdala activation. Averted vs direct gaze
   induced increased activation in the right dorsal amygdala regardless of
   facial expression and head orientation. Furthermore, valence effects
   were found in the ventral amygdala and strongly dependent on head
   orientation. We observed enhanced activation to angry and neutral vs
   happy faces for observer-directed faces in the left ventral amygdala
   while the averted head condition reversed this pattern resulting in
   increased activation to happy as compared to angry and neutral faces.
   These results suggest that gaze direction drives specifically dorsal
   amygdala activation regardless of facial expression, low-level
   perceptual factors or stimulus ambiguity. The role of the amygdala is
   thus not restricted to the detection of potential threat, but has a more
   general role in attention processes. Furthermore, valence effects are
   associated with activation of the ventral amygdala and strongly
   influenced by non-emotional factors.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to enhance sensitivity to relevant (post)hypnotic
   suggestions has implications for creating clinically informed analogues
   of psychological and neuropsychological conditions and for the use of
   hypnotic interventions in psychological and medical conditions. The aim
   of this study was to test the effect of oxytocin inhalation on a
   post-hypnotic suggestion that previously has been shown to improve the
   selectivity of attention in the Stroop task. In a double-blind
   placebo-controlled between-subjects study, medium hypnotizable
   individuals performed the Stroop task under normal conditions and when
   they had been given a post-hypnotic suggestion that they would perceive
   words as meaningless symbols. In line with previous research, Stroop
   interference was substantially reduced by the suggestion in the placebo
   condition. However, contrary to expectations, oxytocin impeded the
   effect of the word blindness suggestion on performance. The results are
   explained in terms of the requirement for the re-implementation of the
   word blindness suggestion on a trial-by-trial basis and the need to
   sustain activation of the suggestion between trials. The findings
   contrast with a recent study showing a beneficial effect of oxytocin on
   sensitivity to (post)hypnotic suggestions but are consistent with
   findings showing a detrimental effect of oxytocin on memory processes.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies show a correlation between activity of the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and skin conductance
   measurements. However, little is known whether this brain region plays a
   causal role in regulating physiological arousal. To address this
   question, we employed Granger causality analysis (GCA) to establish
   causality between cerebral blood oxygenation level-dependent and skin
   conductance signals in 24 healthy adults performing a cognitive task
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results showed that
   activity of the vmPFC not only negatively correlated with skin
   conductance level (SCL) but also Granger caused SCL, thus establishing
   the direction of influence. Importantly, across participants, the
   strength of Granger causality was negatively correlated to phasic skin
   conductance responses elicited by external events during the behavioral
   task. In contrast, activity of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   positively correlated with SCL but did not show a causal relationship in
   GCA. These new findings indicate that the vmPFC plays a causal role in
   regulating physiological arousal. Increased vmPFC activity leads to a
   decrease in skin conductance. The findings may also advance our
   understanding of dysfunctions of the vmPFC in mood and anxiety disorders
   that involve altered control of physiological arousal.}},

Abstract = {{Being able to comprehend communicative intentions and to recognize
   whether such intentions are directed toward us or not is extremely
   important in social interaction. Two brain systems, the mentalizing and
   the mirror neuron system, have been proposed to underlie intention
   recognition. However, little is still known about how the systems
   cooperate within the process of communicative intention understanding
   and to what degree they respond to self-directed and other-directed
   stimuli. To investigate the role of the mentalizing and the mirror
   neuron system, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging with four
   types of action sequence: communicative and private intentions as well
   as other-directed and self-directed intentions. Categorical and
   functional connectivity analyses showed that both systems contribute to
   the encoding of communicative intentions and that both systems are
   significantly stronger activated and more strongly coupled in
   self-directed communicative actions.}},

Abstract = {{Besides food restriction, hyperactivity is considered a key behavioral
   trait of anorexia nervosa (AN), playing a major role in the pathogenesis
   and progression of the disorder. However, the underlying neurophysiology
   remains poorly understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   during two affective go/no-go tasks to probe inhibitory control in
   response to stimuli depicting physical activity vs inactivity and food
   vs non-food in AN patients compared with 26 healthy athlete and
   non-athlete controls. We hypothesized that neural correlates of
   behavioral inhibition are biased by the emotional information of the
   stimuli in AN patients, leading to a differential neural inhibitory
   pattern during the two tasks. Indeed, we found reduced response
   inhibition for food and non-food images in the putamen, while stimuli
   depicting physical activity resulted in an exaggerated response of the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cerebellum in AN patients. However, both AN
   patients and athletes revealed an increased response in the
   somatosensory cortex to physical activity stimuli. These results suggest
   that physical activity stimuli might place an increased demand on the
   inhibitory control system in AN patients. The resulting hyperactivity of
   the PFC and cerebellum may lead to altered executive function and motor
   control, sustaining increased physical activity in AN patients.}},

Abstract = {{Ambivalence is a state of inconsistency that is often experienced as
   affectively aversive. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging
   study, we investigated the role of cognitive and social-affective
   processes in the experience of ambivalence and coping with its negative
   consequences. We examined participants' brain activity during the
   dichotomous evaluation (pro vs contra) of pretested ambivalent (e.g.
   alcohol), positive (e.g. happiness) and negative (e.g. genocide) word
   stimuli. We manipulated evaluation relevance by varying the probability
   of evaluation consequences, under the hypothesis that ambivalence is
   experienced as more negative when outcomes are relevant. When making
   ambivalent evaluations, more activity was found in the anterior
   cingulate cortex, the insula, the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) and
   the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, for both high and low
   evaluation relevance. After statistically conservative corrections,
   activity in the TPJ and PCC/precuneus was negatively correlated with
   experienced ambivalence after scanning, as measured by Priester and
   Petty's felt ambivalence scale (1996). The findings show that cognitive
   and social-affective brain areas are involved in the experience of
   ambivalence. However, these networks are differently associated with
   subsequent reduction of ambivalence, thus highlighting the importance of
   understanding both cognitive and affective processes involved in
   ambivalent decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescents view thousands of food commercials annually, but the neural
   response to food advertising and its association with obesity is largely
   unknown. This study is the first to examine how neural response to food
   commercials differs from other stimuli (e.g. non-food commercials and
   television show) and to explore how this response may differ by weight
   status. The blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging activation was measured in 30 adolescents ranging from lean to
   obese in response to food and non-food commercials imbedded in a
   television show. Adolescents exhibited greater activation in regions
   implicated in visual processing (e.g. occipital gyrus), attention (e.g.
   parietal lobes), cognition (e.g. temporal gyrus and posterior cerebellar
   lobe), movement (e.g. anterior cerebellar cortex), somatosensory
   response (e.g. postcentral gyrus) and reward {[}e.g. orbitofrontal
   cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] during food commercials.
   Obese participants exhibited less activation during food relative to
   non-food commercials in neural regions implicated in visual processing
   (e.g. cuneus), attention (e.g. posterior cerebellar lobe), reward (e.g.
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ACC) and salience detection (e.g.
   precuneus). Obese participants did exhibit greater activation in a
   region implicated in semantic control (e.g. medial temporal gyrus).
   These findings may inform current policy debates regarding the impact of
   food advertising to minors.}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly assumed that early emotional signals provide relevant
   information for social cognition tasks. The goal of this study was to
   test the association between (a) cortical markers of face emotional
   processing and (b) social-cognitive measures, and also to build a model
   which can predict this association (a and b) in healthy volunteers as
   well as in different groups of psychiatric patients. Thus, we
   investigated the early cortical processing of emotional stimuli (N170,
   using a face and word valence task) and their relationship with the
   social-cognitive profiles (SCPs, indexed by measures of theory of mind,
   fluid intelligence, speed processing and executive functions). Group
   comparisons and individual differences were assessed among schizophrenia
   (SCZ) patients and their relatives, individuals with attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), individuals with euthymic bipolar
   disorder (BD) and healthy participants (educational level, handedness,
   age and gender matched). Our results provide evidence of emotional N170
   impairments in the affected groups (SCZ and relatives, ADHD and BD) as
   well as subtle group differences. Importantly, cortical processing of
   emotional stimuli predicted the SCP, as evidenced by a structural
   equation model analysis. This is the first study to report an
   association model of brain markers of emotional processing and SCP.}},

Abstract = {{The observation of goal-directed actions performed by another individual
   allows one to understand what that individual is doing and why he/she is
   doing it. Important information about others' behaviour is also carried
   out by the dynamics of the observed action. Action dynamics characterize
   the `vitality form' of an action describing the cognitive and affective
   relation between the performing agent and the action recipient. Here,
   using the fMRI technique, we assessed the neural correlates of vitality
   form recognition presenting participants with videos showing two actors
   executing actions with different vitality forms: energetic and gentle.
   The participants viewed the actions in two tasks. In one task (what),
   they had to focus on the goal of the presented action; in the other task
   (how), they had to focus on the vitality form. For both tasks,

Abstract = {{Two mechanisms have been proposed to account for the difficulty in
   recognizing faces of other racial groups (the other-race effect; ORE):
   perceptual expertise and social cognitive factors. Focusing on the
   social cognitive factors alone, we manipulated in-group and out-group
   memberships based on two social categories (nationality and university
   affiliation), and controlled for perceptual expertise by testing
   Caucasian participants with Caucasian faces only. Using event-related
   potentials (ERPs) and focusing on the N170, a brain electrical component
   sensitive to faces, we provide for the first time strong support for the
   social cognitive influence on face processing within 200 ms. After
   participants learned the social categories, the N170 latency
   differentiated between double in-group and double out-group faces,
   taking longer to process the latter. In comparison, without group
   memberships, there was no difference in N170 latency among the faces.
   These results are consistent with recent findings of behavioral and
   imaging research, providing further support for the social cognitive
   model and its potential for understanding ORE.}},

Abstract = {{With advancing age, processing resources are shifted away from negative
   emotional stimuli and toward positive ones. Here, we explored this
   `positivity effect' using event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants
   identified the presence or absence of a visual probe that appeared over
   photographs of emotional faces. The ERPs elicited by the onsets of
   angry, sad, happy and neutral faces were recorded. We examined the
   frontocentral emotional positivity (FcEP), which is defined as a
   positive deflection in the waveforms elicited by emotional expressions
   relative to neutral faces early on in the time course of the ERP. The
   FcEP is thought to reflect enhanced early processing of emotional
   expressions. The results show that within the first 130 ms young adults
   show an FcEP to negative emotional expressions, whereas older adults
   show an FcEP to positive emotional expressions. These findings provide
   additional evidence that the age-related positivity effect in emotion
   processing can be traced to automatic processes that are evident very
   early in the processing of emotional facial expressions.}},

Abstract = {{Infant vocalizations are among the most biologically salient sounds in
   the environment and can draw the listener to the infant rapidly in both
   times of distress and joy. A region of the midbrain, the periaqueductal
   gray (PAG), has long been implicated in the control of urgent,
   survival-related behaviours. To test for PAG involvement in the
   processing of infant vocalizations, we recorded local field potentials
   from macroelectrodes implanted in this region in four adults who had
   undergone deep brain stimulation. We found a significant difference
   occurring as early as 49 ms after hearing a sound in activity recorded
   from the PAG in response to infant vocalizations compared with
   constructed control sounds and adult and animal affective vocalizations.
   This difference was not present in recordings from thalamic electrodes
   implanted in three of the patients. Time frequency analyses revealed
   distinct patterns of activity in the PAG for infant vocalisations,
   constructed control sounds and adult and animal vocalisations. These
   results suggest that human infant vocalizations can be discriminated
   from other emotional or acoustically similar sounds early in the
   auditory pathway. We propose that this specific, rapid activity in
   response to infant vocalizations may reflect the initiation of a state
   of heightened alertness necessary to instigate protective caregiving.}},

Abstract = {{This event-related potential (ERP) study explored the behaviour of N400
   and post-N400 frontal positivities (pN400FP) during the processing of
   emotionally biased and unbiased sentences that randomly led to highly
   expected or unexpected word outcomes. Unexpected outcomes (as determined
   by sentence completion written tests) elicited significantly larger N400
   and pN400FP responses than did highly expected outcomes. Emotionally
   neutral outcomes triggered a significant N400 expectancy effect across
   all scalp locations, including frontal sites, whereas emotionally biased
   outcomes elicited a significant N400 effect localized to posterior scalp
   regions. The subsequent pN400FP effect was significant only when
   emotional expectations were violated and not when emotionally neutral
   sentences led to unexpected outcomes. This frontal effect, linked to the
   processing of lexically unexpected but plausible words, showed larger
   amplitudes for unexpected pleasant surprises than for unexpected
   setbacks. Our results support the view that the pN400FP response to
   unexpected verbal outcomes entails more than a generic reaction to a
   lexical `misprediction'. Rather, they favour the hypothesis that the
   affective content of the sentence being processed influences the effort
   needed to override a lexical prediction, such that more effort is needed
   to override a pessimistic prediction than an optimistic one.}},

Abstract = {{Women typically remember more female than male faces, whereas men do not
   show a reliable own-gender bias. However, little is known about the
   neural correlates of this own-gender bias in face recognition memory.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated
   whether face gender modulated brain activity in fusiform and inferior
   occipital gyri during incidental encoding of faces. Fifteen women and 14
   men underwent fMRI while passively viewing female and male faces,
   followed by a surprise face recognition task. Women recognized more
   female than male faces and showed higher activity to female than male
   faces in individually defined regions of fusiform and inferior occipital
   gyri. In contrast, men's recognition memory and
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent response were not modulated by face gender.
   Importantly, higher activity in the left fusiform gyrus (FFG) to one
   gender was related to better memory performance for that gender. These
   findings suggest that the FFG is involved in the gender bias in memory
   for faces, which may be linked to differential experience with female
   and male faces.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of extended self refers to the idea that people incorporate
   self-relevant others or objects into one's sense of self. Initial neural
   support for the notion of extended self was provided by fMRI evidence
   that medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) showed greater activation while
   people imagined objects belonging to them compared with someone else
   (Kim \& Johnson, 2012). This study investigated whether self-associated
   objects (i.e. `mine') subsequently engage MPFC spontaneously when a task
   does not require explicit self-referential judgments. During fMRI
   scanning, participants detected `oddballs' (objects with a specific
   frame color) intermixed with objects participants had previously
   imagined belonging to them or to someone else and previously unseen
   non-oddball objects. There was greater activity in MPFC and posterior
   cingulate cortex for those `self-owned' objects that participants were
   more successful at imagining owning compared with `other-owned' objects.
   In addition, change in object preference following the ownership
   manipulation (a mere ownership effect) was predicted by activity in
   MPFC. Overall, these results provide neural evidence for the idea that

Abstract = {{Contemporary learning theories suggest that conditioning is heavily
   dependent on the processing of prediction errors, which signal a
   discrepancy between expected and observed outcomes. This line of
   research provides a framework through which classical theories of
   placebo effects, expectations and conditioning, can be reconciled. Brain
   regions related to prediction error processing {[}anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex or the nucleus accumbens] overlap
   with those involved in placebo effects. Here we examined the possibility
   that the magnitude of objective neurochemical responses to placebo
   administration would depend on individual expectation-effectiveness
   comparisons. We show that such comparisons and not expectations per se
   predict behavioral placebo responses and placebo-induced activation of A
   mu-opioid receptor-mediated neurotransmission in regions relevant to
   error detection (e.g. ACC). Expectations on the other hand were
   associated with greater A mu-opioid system activation in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but not with greater behavioral placebo
   responses. The results presented aid the elucidation of molecular and
   neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between
   expectation-effectiveness associations and the formation of placebo
   responses, shedding light on the individual differences in learning and
   decision making. Expectation and outcome comparisons emerge as a
   cognitive mechanism that beyond reward associations appears to
   facilitate the formation and sustainability of placebo responses.}},

Abstract = {{Affective Theory of Mind (ToM), an important aspect of ToM, involves the

   the developmental phase of adolescence, which is often related with

   present study investigated the neural development of affective ToM
   throughout adolescence. Eighteen adolescent (ages 12-14 years) and 18
   young adult women (aged 19-25 years) were scanned while evaluating
   complex affective mental states depicted by actors in video clips. The
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed significantly stronger
   activation in adolescents in comparison to adults in the affective ToM
   condition. Current results indicate that the vmPFC might be involved in

Abstract = {{Prior studies have suggested that positive social interactions are
   experienced as rewarding. Yet, it is not well understood how social
   relationships influence neural responses to other persons' gains. In
   this study, we investigated neural responses during a gambling task in
   which healthy participants (N = 31; 18 females) could win or lose money
   for themselves, their best friend or a disliked other (antagonist). At
   the moment of receiving outcome, person-related activity was observed in
   the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), precuneus and temporal
   parietal junction (TPJ), showing higher activity for friends and
   antagonists than for self, and this activity was independent of outcome.
   The only region showing an interaction between the person-participants
   played for and outcome was the ventral striatum. Specifically, the
   striatum was more active following gains than losses for self and
   friends, whereas for the antagonist this pattern was reversed. Together,
   these results show that, in a context with social and reward
   information, social aspects are processed in brain regions associated
   with social cognition (mPFC, TPJ), and reward aspects are processed in
   primary reward areas (striatum). Furthermore, there is an interaction of
   social and reward information in the striatum, such that reward-related
   activity was dependent on social relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Early life stress (ELS) is known to have considerable influence on brain
   development, mental health and affective functioning. Previous
   investigations have shown that alexithymia, a prevalent personality
   trait associated with difficulties experiencing and verbalizing
   emotions, is particularly related to ELS. The aim of the present study
   was to investigate how neural correlates of emotional experiences in
   alexithymia are altered in the presence and absence of ELS. Therefore,
   50 healthy individuals with different levels of alexithymia were matched
   regarding ELS and investigated with respect to neural correlates of
   audio-visually induced emotional experiences via functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. The main finding was that ELS modulated hippocampal
   responses to pleasant (> neutral) stimuli in high-alexithymic
   individuals, whereas there was no such modulation in low-alexithymic
   individuals matched for ELS. Behavioral and psychophysiological results
   followed a similar pattern. When considered independent of ELS,
   alexithymia was associated with decreased responses in insula (pleasant
   > neutral) and temporal pole (unpleasant > neutral). Our results show
   that the influence of ELS on emotional brain responses seems to be
   modulated by an individual's degree of alexithymia. Potentially,
   protective and adverse effects of emotional abilities on brain responses
   to emotional experiences are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Several sources of evidence point toward a link between asymmetry of
   prefrontal brain activity and approach-withdrawal tendencies. Here, we
   tested the causal nature of this link and examined if the categorization
   of an ambiguous approach- or withdrawal-related vocal signal can be
   biased by manipulating left and right frontal neural activity. We used
   voice morphing of affective non-verbal vocalizations to create
   individually tailored affectively ambiguous stimuli on an Anger-Fear
   continuum-two emotions that represent extremes on the
   approach-withdrawal dimension. We tested perception of these stimuli
   after 10 min of low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation over left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or over
   the vertex (control), a technique that has transient inhibitory effects
   on the targeted brain region. As expected, ambiguous stimuli were more
   likely perceived as expressing Anger (approach) than Fear (withdrawal)
   after right prefrontal compared with left prefrontal or control
   stimulation. These results provide the first evidence that the
   manipulation of asymmetrical activity in prefrontal cortex can change
   the explicit categorization of ambiguous emotional signals.}},

Abstract = {{Circadian rhythms influence virtually every aspect of behavior. This
   special issue provides updates on the current state and future
   directions for the field of circadian rhythms in behavioral

   of behavioral and biomedical science. Specifically, a growing interest
   in the cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and metabolic consequences of
   circadian rhythm disorders and dysfunction is emerging. This special
   issue is not intended to provide an exhaustive overview of the entire
   field of chronobiology or behavioral rhythms. Instead, we invited
   researchers from a variety of fields to critically review and integrate
   studies that address the roles of circadian rhythms in behavioral
   neuroscience. The papers included in this issue range from the molecular
   biology of clock genes to the behavior of free-living animals, and cover
   a wide variety of species ranging from insects, to rodents, to humans.
   As such, the reviews provide an overview of the burgeoning field of

Abstract = {{Laboratory and field data relevant to the survival value of the
   suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) pacemaker are presented for 4 related North
   American squirrel species that evolved in habitats with markedly
   different environmental conditions. Laboratory studies used free-running
   activity rhythms under constant conditions as the signature of an
   endogenous pacemaker. Field studies documented the circadian ecology of
   the 4 species; survival of intact controls was compared, when possible,
   with an SCN-lesioned group of free-living animals or with wild-caught
   animals in a laboratory facility that simulated natural conditions. All
   4 species were rhythmic in the laboratory as indicated by precise
   free-running wheel-turning rhythms under constant conditions, as well as
   by photo-entrainment of free-runs to a 24-hr light-dark schedule.
   Southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) presumably minimized
   predation by sleeping in sheltering tree dens during daylight, with
   awakening by their SCN timer for nocturnal gliding. Eastern chipmunks
   (Tamias striatus) were strictly diurnal but avoided predation in
   elaborate dens as well as by facultative hibernation and winter food
   caches. Antelope squirrels (Ammospermophilus leucurus) were also diurnal
   with dens for minimizing predation at night. Golden-mantled ground
   squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) were diurnal, fossorial species with
   protective dens; during the extended hibernation in winter, the SCN
   played a role in limiting the time spent in arousal episodes. Thus, in
   the evolution of the physiology and behavior of these species, the SCN
   has become involved in diverse functions ranging from regulation of
   activity to reduction of energy expenditure during arousal episodes of
   hibernating ground squirrels.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the predominance of sleep in early infancy, developmental
   science has yet to play a major role in shaping concepts and theories
   about sleep and its associated ultradian and circadian rhythms. Here we
   argue that developmental analyses help us to elucidate the relative
   contributions of the brainstem and forebrain to sleep-wake control and
   to dissect the neural components of sleep-wake rhythms. Developmental
   analysis also makes it clear that sleep-wake processes in infants are
   the foundation for those of adults. For example, the infant brainstem
   alone contains a fundamental sleep-wake circuit that is sufficient to
   produce transitions among wakefulness, quiet sleep, and active sleep. In
   addition, consistent with the requirements of a ``flip-flop{''} model of
   sleep-wake processes, this brainstem circuit supports rapid transitions
   between states. Later in development, strengthening bidirectional
   interactions between the brainstem and forebrain contribute to the
   consolidation of sleep and wake bouts, the elaboration of sleep
   homeostatic processes, and the emergence of diurnal or nocturnal
   circadian rhythms. The developmental perspective promoted here
   critically constrains theories of sleep-wake control and provides a
   needed framework for the creation of fully realized computational
   models. Finally, with a better understanding of how this system is
   constructed developmentally, we will gain insight into the processes
   that govern its disintegration due to aging and disease.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep is an important physiological state, but its function and
   regulation remain elusive. Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model
   organism for studying sleep because it has a well-established diurnal
   activity pattern, including consolidated periods of quiescence that
   share many characteristics with human sleep. Sleep behavior is regulated
   by circadian and homeostatic processes and is modulated by environmental
   and physiological context cues. These cues are communicated to sleep
   circuits by neurohormones and neuromodulators. A major class of
   neuromodulators, monoamines, has been found to be essential in various
   aspects of sleep regulation. Dopamine promotes arousal and
   sleep-dependent memory formation as well as daily activity. Octopamine,
   the insect homolog of norepinephrine, promotes wake and may play a role
   in circadian clock-dependent sleep and arousal. Serotonin promotes sleep
   and modulates circadian entrainment to light. The different monoamines
   each signal through multiple receptors in various brain regions in
   response to different conditions. How these separate circuits integrate
   their inputs into a single program of behavior is an open field of study
   for which Drosophila will continue to be a useful model. Monoamine
   biosynthetic pathways and receptors are conserved between flies and
   humans, and, thus far, their roles in modulating sleep also appear to be
   conserved.}},

Abstract = {{The circadian system organizes sleep and wake through imposing a daily
   cycle of sleep propensity on the organism. Sleep has been shown to play
   an important role in learning and memory. Apart from the daily cycle of
   sleep propensity, however, direct effects of the circadian system on
   learning and memory also have been well documented. Many mechanistic
   components of the memory consolidation process ranging from the
   molecular to the systems level have been identified and studied. The
   question that remains is how do these various processes and components
   work together to produce cycles of increased and decreased learning
   abilities, and why should there be times of day when neural plasticity
   appears to be restricted? Insights into this complex problem can be
   gained through investigations of the learning disabilities caused by
   circadian disruption in Siberian hamsters and by aneuploidy in Down's
   syndrome mice. A simple working hypothesis that has been explored in
   this work is that the observed learning disabilities are due to an
   altered excitation/inhibition balance in the CNS. Excessive inhibition
   is the suspected cause of deficits in memory consolidation. In this
   article we present the evidence that excessive inhibition in these cases
   of learning disability involves GABAergic neurotransmission, that
   treatment with GABA receptor inhibitors can reverse the learning
   disability, and that the efficacy of the treatment is time sensitive
   coincident with the major daily sleep phase, and that it depends on
   sleep. The evidence we present leads us to hypothesize that a function
   of the circadian system is to reduce neuroplasticity during the daily
   sleep phase when processes of memory consolidation are taking place.}},

Abstract = {{The circadian system has pronounced influence on learning and memory,
   manifesting as marked changes in memory acquisition and recall across
   the day. From a mechanistic perspective, the majority of studies have
   investigated mammalian hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as
   this system is highly tractable. The hippocampus plays a major role in
   learning and memory, and has the potential to integrate circadian
   information in many ways, including information from local, independent
   oscillators, and through circadian modulation of neurogenesis, synaptic
   remodeling, intracellular cascades, and epigenetic regulation of gene
   expression. These local processes are combined with input from other
   oscillatory systems to synergistically augment hippocampal rhythmic
   function. This overview presents an account of the current state of
   knowledge on circadian interactions with learning and memory circuitry
   and provides a framework for those interested in further exploring these

Abstract = {{Circadian rhythms in most mammals are synchronized to local time by
   phase and period resetting actions of daily light-dark cycles on a
   retino-recipient, light-entrainable circadian pacemaker, the
   suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN receives input from other brain
   regions, some of which mediate the phase and period resetting actions of
   behavioral arousal on circadian rhythms. We review historical milestones
   in the discovery of so-called ``nonphotic{''} circadian clock resetting
   induced by environmentally stimulated arousal, or by feedback from
   clock-controlled rest-activity cycles. Topics include species
   generality, interactions between concurrent or successive photic and
   nonphotic inputs to the circadian clock, neural pathways,
   neurotransmitters, and clock cell responses that mediate resetting by
   behavioral arousal. The role of behavioral inputs to the circadian clock
   in determining the phase of entrainment to local time in natural
   environments is not well understood. Nonetheless, nonphotic effects are
   of sufficient magnitude to raise issues for the design of experiments in
   behavioral neuroscience (any procedure that is sufficiently arousing may
   alter the timing of circadian clocks that regulate dependent variables
   of primary interest). Nonphotic inputs to the clock may be exploited in
   strategies to reset or strengthen circadian rhythms in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Mood disorders are multifactorial and heterogeneous diseases caused by
   the interplay of several genetic and environmental factors. In humans,
   mood disorders are often accompanied by abnormalities in the
   organization of the circadian system, which normally synchronizes
   activities and functions of cells and tissues. Studies on animal models
   suggest that the basic circadian clock mechanism, which runs in
   essentially all cells, is implicated in the modulation of biological
   phenomena regulating affective behaviors. In particular, recent findings
   highlight the importance of the circadian clock mechanisms in
   neurological pathways involved in mood, such as monoaminergic
   neurotransmission, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis regulation,
   suprachiasmatic nucleus and olfactory bulb activities, and neurogenesis.
   Defects at the level of both, the circadian clock mechanism and system,
   may contribute to the etiology of mood disorders. Modification of the
   circadian system using chronotherapy appears to be an effective
   treatment for mood disorders. Additionally, understanding the role of
   circadian clock mechanisms, which affect the regulation of different
   mood pathways, will open up the possibility for targeted pharmacological
   treatments.}},

   Environmentally disrupted circadian rhythms increase the risk of mood
   disorders in the general population. However, proof that a disturbance

   psychiatric disorders remains elusive. Using clock gene mutants,
   manipulations of sleep-wake and light-dark cycles, and brain lesions

Abstract = {{Sleep and circadian functioning has been of particular interest to
   researchers focused on improving treatments for psychiatric illness. The
   goal of the present paper is to highlight the exciting research that
   utilizes basic sleep and circadian science as building blocks for
   intervention in the mood disorders. The reviewed evidence suggests that
   the sleep and circadian systems are a) disrupted in the mood disorders
   and linked to symptoms, b) open systems that can be modified, c) the
   focus of interventions which have been developed to effectively treat
   sleep disturbance within mood disorders, and d) intimately linked with
   mood, such that improvements in sleep are associated with improvements
   in mood. Although significant positive treatment effects are evident,
   more research is needed to fill the gap in our basic understanding of
   the relationship between sleep and mood.}},

Abstract = {{The use of alcohol is an important part of the daily lives of many
   individuals that may be experienced as a single nightly drink with a
   meal or a debilitating pattern of intoxication. The circadian timing
   system imposes a daily temporal order throughout the brain and body.
   Ethanol, with its complex and broad pharmacology, can thereby alter
   circadian physiology at multiple levels of organization. Here, we review
   data from animal models demonstrating that (a) perturbations of the
   circadian timing system are often, but not necessarily, reflected in
   altered drinking behaviors or ethanol response; (b) alcohol can act to
   alter the circadian entrainment and pacemaking functions of the
   suprachiasmatic nuclei; and (c) the temporal patterning of alcohol
   exposure and withdrawal in a circadian context can influence processes
   related to addiction development, particularly increased voluntary
   alcohol consumption and development of physical dependence as reflected
   in the physiological withdrawal reaction. New data are presented to show
   that the withdrawal reaction elicited after long-duration alcohol vapor
   sessions is significantly modulated according to the time of day that it
   is initiated. Further application of chronobiological principles to
   alcohol research should enhance mechanistic understanding and suggest
   potential therapeutic approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Circadian rhythms are prominent in many physiological and behavioral
   functions. Circadian disruptions either by environmental or molecular
   perturbation can have profound health consequences, including the
   development and progression of addiction. Both animal and humans studies
   indicate extensive bidirectional relationships between the circadian
   system and drugs of abuse. Addicted individuals display disrupted
   rhythms, and chronic disruption or particular chronotypes may increase
   the risk for substance abuse and relapse. Moreover, polymorphisms in
   circadian genes and an evening chronotype have been linked to mood and
   addiction disorders, and recent efforts suggest an association with the
   function of reward neurocircuitry. Animal studies are beginning to
   determine how altered circadian gene function results in drug-induced
   neuroplasticity and behaviors. Many studies suggest a critical role for
   circadian rhythms in reward-related pathways in the brain and indicate
   that drugs of abuse directly affect the central circadian pacemaker. In
   this review, we highlight key findings demonstrating the importance of
   circadian rhythms in addiction and how future studies will reveal
   important mechanistic insights into the involvement of circadian rhythms
   in drug addiction.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that receiving an unfair monetary offer in
   economic bargaining elicits also-called feedback negativity (FN). This
   scalp-recorded brain potential probably reflects a bad-vs-good
   evaluation in the medial frontal cortex and has been linked to
   fundamental processes of reinforcement learning. In the present study,
   we investigated whether the evaluative mechanism indexed by the FN is
   also involved in learning who is an unfair vs fair bargaining partner.
   An electroencephalogram was recorded while participants completed a
   computerized version of the Ultimatum Game, repeatedly receiving fair or
   unfair monetary offers from alleged other participants. Some of these
   proposers were either always fair or always unfair in their offers. In
   each trial, participants first saw a portrait picture of the respective
   proposer before the monetary offer was presented. Therefore, the faces
   could be used as predictive cues for the fairness of the pending offers.
   We found that not only unfair offers themselves induced a FN, but also
   (over the task) faces of unfair proposers. Thus, when interaction
   partners repeatedly behave in an unfair way, their faces acquire a
   negative valence, which manifests in a basal neural mechanism of
   bad-vs-good evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{In the current functional MRI study, we investigated interactions
   between reward and threat processing. Visual cues at the start of each
   trial informed participants about the chance of winning monetary reward
   and/or receiving a mild aversive shock. We tested two competing
   hypothesis: according to the `salience hypothesis', in the condition
   involving both reward and threat, enhanced activation would be observed
   because of increased salience; according to the `competition
   hypothesis', the processing of reward and threat would trade-off against
   each other, leading to reduced activation. Analysis of skin conductance
   data during a delay phase revealed an interaction between reward and
   threat processing, such that the effect of reward was reduced during
   threat and the effect of threat was reduced during reward. Analysis of
   imaging data during the same task phase revealed interactions between
   reward and threat processing in several regions, including the
   midbrain/ventral tegmental area, caudate, putamen, bed nucleus of the
   stria terminalis, anterior insula, middle frontal gyrus and dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex. Taken together, our findings reveal
   conditions during which reward and threat trade-off against each other
   across multiple sites. Such interactions are suggestive of competitive
   processes and may reflect the organization of opponent systems in the
   brain.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety is the cognitive state related to the inability to control
   emotional responses to perceived threats. Anxiety is inversely related
   to brain activity associated with the cognitive regulation of emotions.
   Mindfulness meditation has been found to regulate anxiety. However, the
   brain mechanisms involved in meditation-related anxiety relief are
   largely unknown. We employed pulsed arterial spin labeling MRI to
   compare the effects of distraction in the form of attending to the
   breath (ATB; before meditation training) to mindfulness meditation
   (after meditation training) on state anxiety across the same subjects.
   Fifteen healthy subjects, with no prior meditation experience,
   participated in 4 d of mindfulness meditation training. ATB did not
   reduce state anxiety, but state anxiety was significantly reduced in
   every session that subjects meditated. Meditation-related anxiety relief
   was associated with activation of the anterior cingulate cortex,
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula. Meditation-related
   activation in these regions exhibited a strong relationship to anxiety
   relief when compared to ATB. During meditation, those who exhibited
   greater default-related activity (i.e. posterior cingulate cortex)
   reported greater anxiety, possibly reflecting an inability to control
   self-referential thoughts. These findings provide evidence that
   mindfulness meditation attenuates anxiety through mechanisms involved in
   the regulation of self-referential thought processes.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{760-766}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although much is known about the neural dynamics of maladaptive
   affective styles, the mechanisms of happiness and well-being are less
   clear. One possibility is that the neural processes of trait happiness
   are the opposite of those involved in depression/anxiety: `rose-colored
   glasses' cause happy people to focus on positive cues while remaining
   oblivious to threats. Specifically, because negative affective styles
   have been associated with increased amygdala activation to negative
   stimuli, it may be happy people will not show this enhanced response,
   and may even show reduced amygdala activation to negative stimuli.
   Alternatively, if well-being entails appropriate sensitivity to
   information, happy people may process any relevant cues-positive or
   negative-to facilitate appropriate responding. This would mean that
   happiness is associated with increased amygdala activation to both
   positive and negative stimuli. Forty-two participants viewed affective
   stimuli during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Happier
   participants showed greater amygdala responses to positive stimuli.
   Moreover, no significant relationships were found between happiness and
   responses to negative stimuli. In other words, for happy people, a
   tuning toward positive did not come at the cost of losing sensitivity to
   negativity. This work suggests that trait happiness is associated with a
   balanced amygdala response to positivity and negativity.}},

Abstract = {{Social judgments often require resolution of incongruity in
   communication contents. Although previous studies revealed that such
   conflict resolution recruits brain regions including the medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG),
   functional relationships and networks among these regions remain
   unclear. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we
   investigated the functional dissociation and networks by measuring human
   brain activity during resolving incongruity between verbal and
   non-verbal emotional contents. First, we found that the conflict
   resolutions biased by the non-verbal contents activated the posterior
   dorsal mPFC (post-dmPFC), bilateral anterior insula (AI) and right
   dorsal pIFG, whereas the resolutions biased by the verbal contents
   activated the bilateral ventral pIFG. In contrast, the anterior dmPFC
   (ant-dmPFC), bilateral superior temporal sulcus and fusiform gyrus were
   commonly involved in both of the resolutions. Second, we found that the
   post-dmPFC and right ventral pIFG were hub regions in networks
   underlying the non-verbal- and verbal-content-biased resolutions,
   respectively. Finally, we revealed that these resolution-type-specific
   networks were bridged by the ant-dmPFC, which was recruited for the
   conflict resolutions earlier than the two hub regions. These findings
   suggest that, in social conflict resolutions, the ant-dmPFC selectively
   recruits one of the resolution-type-specific networks through its
   interaction with resolution-type-specific hub regions.}},

Abstract = {{Mindfulness-an attentive non-judgmental focus on present experiences-is
   increasingly incorporated in psychotherapeutic treatments as a skill
   fostering emotion regulation. Neurobiological mechanisms of actively
   induced emotion regulation are associated with prefrontally mediated
   down-regulation of, for instance, the amygdala. We were interested in
   neurobiological correlates of a short mindfulness instruction during
   emotional arousal. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   investigated effects of a short mindfulness intervention during the cued
   expectation and perception of negative and potentially negative pictures
   (50\% probability) in 24 healthy individuals compared to 22 controls.
   The mindfulness intervention was associated with increased activations
   in prefrontal regions during the expectation of negative and potentially
   negative pictures compared to controls. During the perception of
   negative stimuli, reduced activation was identified in regions involved
   in emotion processing (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus). Prefrontal and
   right insular activations when expecting negative pictures correlated
   negatively with trait mindfulness, suggesting that more mindful
   individuals required less regulatory resources to attenuate emotional
   arousal. Our findings suggest emotion regulatory effects of a short
   mindfulness intervention on a neurobiological level.}},

Abstract = {{Acute peripheral inflammation with corresponding increases in peripheral
   cytokines affects neuropsychological functions and induces
   depression-like symptoms. However, possible effects of increased immune
   responses on social cognition remain unknown. Therefore, this study
   investigated the effects of experimentally induced acute inflammation on
   performance and neural responses during a social cognition task
   assessing Theory of Mind (ToM) ability. In this double-blind randomized
   crossover functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 18 healthy
   right-handed male volunteers received an injection of bacterial
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.4 ng/kg) or saline, respectively. Plasma
   levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as mood ratings
   were analyzed together with brain activation during a validated ToM task
   (i.e. Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test). LPS administration induced
   pronounced transient increases in pro- (IL-6, TNF-alpha) and
   anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL-1ra) cytokines as well as decreases in
   mood. Social cognition performance was not affected by acute
   inflammation. However, altered neural activity was observed during the
   ToM task after LPS administration, reflected by increased responses in
   the fusiform gyrus, temporo-parietal junction, superior temporal gyrus
   and precuneus. The increased task-related neural responses in the LPS
   condition may reflect a compensatory strategy or a greater social
   cognitive processing as a function of sickness.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathy is a personality disorder associated with callous and
   impulsive behavior and criminal recidivism. It has long been theorized
   that psychopaths have deficits in processing reward and punishment.
   Here, we use structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   examine the neural correlates of reward and loss sensitivity in a group
   of criminal psychopaths. Forty-one adult male prison inmates (n = 18
   psychopaths and n = 23 non-psychopaths) completed a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging task involving the gain or loss of money. Across the
   entire sample of participants, monetary gains elicited robust activation
   within the ventral striatum (VS). Although psychopaths and
   non-psychopaths did not significantly differ with respect to overall
   levels of VS response to reward vs loss, we observed significantly
   different correlations between VS responses and psychopathy severity
   within each group. Volumetric analyses of striatal subregions revealed a
   similar pattern of correlations, specifically for the right accumbens
   area within VS. In a separate sample of inmates (n = 93 psychopaths and
   n = 117 non-psychopaths) who completed a self-report measure of
   appetitive motivation, we again found that the correlation with
   psychopathy severity differed between groups. These convergent results
   offer novel insight into the neural substrates of reward and loss
   processing in psychopathy.}},

Abstract = {{The interactionist approach to the study of exogenous oxytocin (OT)
   effects on prosocial behavior has emphasized the need to consider both
   contextual cues and individual differences. Therefore, an experiment was
   set up to examine the joint effect of intranasal OT, a salient social
   cue and the personality trait social value orientation on cooperative
   behavior in one-shot prisoner's dilemma games. The outcome of these
   mixed-motive games is known to be highly dependent on values and on
   social information that might reveal the partner's intent. Consistent
   with an a priori hypothesis, OT and social information interact
   significantly to affect the behavior of individuals with a proself value
   orientation: after prior contact with the game partner, OT enhances
   cooperative behavior, whereas in anonymous conditions, it exacerbates
   their intrinsic self-interested behavior. These effects of OT do not
   hold for individuals with a prosocial value orientation, whose
   cooperation levels appear to be more influenced by prior contact with
   the game partner. Follow-up hypotheses for why prosocial and proself
   individuals respond differently to exogenous OT were developed.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in the gene that encodes the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) have
   been associated with many aspects of social cognition as well as several
   prosocial behaviors. However, potential associations of OXTR variants
   with reactions to betrayals of trust while cooperating for mutual
   benefit have not yet been explored. We examined how variations in 10
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms on OXTR were associated with behavior
   and emotional reactions after a betrayal of trust in an iterated
   Prisoner's Dilemma Game. After correction for multiple testing, one
   haplotype (C-rs9840864, T-rs2268494) was significantly associated with
   faster retaliation post-betrayal-an association that appeared to be due
   to this haplotype's intermediate effect of exacerbating people's anger
   after they had been betrayed. Furthermore, a second haplotype
   (A-rs237887, C-rs2268490) was associated with higher levels of
   post-betrayal satisfaction, and a third haplotype (G-rs237887,
   C-rs2268490) was associated with lower levels of post-betrayal
   satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is consistently involved in
   tasks requiring the processing of mental states, and much rarer so by
   tasks that do not involve mental state inferences. We hypothesized that
   the dmPFC might be more generally involved in high construal of stimuli,
   defined as the formation of concepts or ideas by omitting non-essential
   features of stimuli, irrespective of their social or non-social nature.
   In an fMRI study, we presented pictures of a person engaged in everyday
   activities (social stimuli) or of objects (non-social stimuli) and
   induced a higher level of construal by instructing participants to
   generate personality traits of the person or categories to which the
   objects belonged. This was contrasted against a lower level task where
   participants had to describe these same pictures visually. As predicted,
   we found strong involvement of the dmPFC in high construal, with
   substantial overlap across social and non-social stimuli, including
   shared activation in the vmPFC/OFC, parahippocampal, fusiform and

   reward sensitivity in the aging brain. Although such an age effect might
   be due to a decline of physiological processes, it may also be a
   consequence of age-related changes in motivational preference for
   different rewards. Here, we examined whether the age effects on neural
   correlates of reward anticipation are modulated by the type of expected
   reward. Functional magnetic resonance images were acquired in 24 older
   (60-78 years) and 24 young participants (20-28 years) while they
   performed an incentive delay task offering monetary or social rewards.
   Anticipation of either reward type recruited brain structures associated
   with reward, including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Region of interest
   analysis revealed an interaction effect of reward type and age group in
   the right NAcc: enhanced activation to cues of social reward was
   detected in the older subsample while enhanced activation to cues of
   monetary reward was detected in the younger subsample. Our results
   suggest that neural sensitivity to reward-predicting cues does not
   generally decrease with age. Rather, neural responses in the NAcc appear
   to be modulated by the type of reward, presumably reflecting age-related
   changes in motivational value attributed to different types of reward.}},

Abstract = {{Failure of the amygdala to habituate, or decrease response intensity, to
   repeatedly presented faces may be one mechanism by which individuals
   with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) develop and maintain social
   symptoms. However, genetic influences on habituation in ASD have not
   been examined. We hypothesized that serotonin transporter-linked
   promoter region (5-HTTLPR) genotype affects change in amygdala response
   to repeated sad faces differently in individuals with ASD vs healthy
   controls. Forty-four youth with ASD and 65 controls aged 8-19 years were
   genotyped and underwent an event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging scan where they identified the gender of emotional faces
   presented for 250 ms. The first half of the run was compared with the
   second half to assess habituation. 5-HTTLPR genotype influences amygdala
   habituation to sad faces differently for individuals with ASD vs
   controls. The genotype-by-diagnosis-by-run half interaction was driven
   by individuals with ASD and low expressing genotypes (S/S, S/L-G and
   L-G/L-G), who trended toward sensitization (increase in amygdala
   activation) and whose habituation scores significantly differed from
   individuals with ASD and higher expressing genotypes (L-A/L-A, S/L-A and
   L-A/L-G) as well as controls with low expressing genotypes. Our results
   show that amygdala response to social stimuli in ASD, which may
   contribute to social symptoms, is genetically influenced.}},

Abstract = {{Major depression goes along with affective and social-cognitive
   deficits. Most research on affective deficits in depression has,
   however, only focused on unimodal emotion processing, whereas in daily
   life, emotional perception is often highly dependent on the evaluation
   of multimodal inputs. We thus investigated emotional audiovisual
   integration in patients with depression and healthy subjects. Subjects
   rated the expression of happy, neutral and fearful faces while
   concurrently being exposed to emotional or neutral sounds. Results
   demonstrated group differences in left inferior frontal gyrus and
   inferior parietal cortex when comparing incongruent to congruent happy
   facial conditions, mainly due to a failure of patients to deactivate
   these regions in response to congruent stimulus pairs. Moreover, healthy
   subjects decreased activation in right posterior superior temporal
   gyrus/sulcus and midcingulate cortex when an emotional stimulus was
   paired with a neutral rather than another emotional one. In contrast,
   patients did not show such deactivation when neutral stimuli were
   integrated. These results demonstrate aberrant neural response in
   audiovisual processing in depression, indicated by failure to deactivate
   regions involved in inhibition and salience processing when congruent
   and neutral audiovisual stimuli pairs are integrated, providing a
   possible mechanism of constant arousal and readiness to act in this
   patient group.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although several paradigms have shown that threatening faces are
   processed preferentially, no study to date has investigated whether this
   preferential processing can be manipulated by value associations. Using
   schematic faces, this study was divided into three phases in order to
   investigate the effects of associating high values with happy faces and
   low values with angry faces. The baseline phase, in which elicited a
   shorter RT and a larger N2pc for angry faces than for happy faces,
   demonstrated that the preferential processing of angry faces could be
   obtained in the discrimination task. After the training phase, which
   established associations between different face targets and their
   respective values, the anger superiority effect remained absent in a
   subsequent test phase despite the fact that participants clearly
   understood that no reward (gain) or punishment (loss) would be provided.
   Our investigation shows that the `anger superiority effect' can be
   modified by value associations and that the value effect, rather than
   the impact of endogenous attention, played a more crucial role in
   manipulating the preferential processing of angry faces.}},

Abstract = {{Alexithymia and increased interoceptive awareness have been associated
   with affective disorders as well as with altered insula and anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) function. Brain imaging studies have demonstrated
   an association between neurotransmitter function and affective disorders
   as well as personality traits. Here, we first examined the relationship
   between alexithymic facets as assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia
   Scale (TAS-20) and interoceptive awareness (assessed with the Body
   Perception Questionnaire) in 18 healthy subjects. Second, we
   investigated their association with glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric
   acid (GABA) concentrations in the left insula and the ACC using 3-Tesla
   proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Behaviorally, we found a close
   association between alexithymia and interoceptive awareness.
   Furthermore, glutamate levels in the left insula were positively
   associated with both alexithymia and awareness of autonomic nervous
   system reactivity, while GABA concentrations in ACC were selectively
   associated with alexithymia. Although preliminary, our results suggest
   that increased glutamate-mediated excitatory transmission-related to
   enhanced insula activity-reflects increased interoceptive awareness in
   alexithymia. Suppression of the unspecific emotional arousal evoked by
   increased awareness of bodily responses in alexithymics might thus be
   reflected in decreased neuronal activity mediated by increased GABA
   concentration in ACC.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional reactivity and the ability to modulate an emotional state,
   which are important factors for psychological well-being, are often
   dysregulated in psychiatric disorders. Neural correlates of emotional
   states have mostly been studied at the group level, thereby neglecting
   individual differences in the intensity of emotional experience. This
   study investigates the relationship between brain activity and
   interindividual variation in subjective affect ratings. A standardized
   mood induction (MI) procedure, using positive facial expression and
   autobiographical memories, was applied to 54 healthy participants (28
   female), who rated their subjective affective state before and after the
   MI. We performed a regression analysis with brain activation during MI
   and changes in subjective affect ratings. An increase in positive
   affective ratings correlated with activity in the amygdala, hippocampus
   and the fusiform gyrus (FFG), whereas reduced positive affect correlated
   with activity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Activations in
   the amygdala, hippocampus and FFG are possibly linked to strategies
   adopted by the participants to achieve mood changes. Subgenual cingulate
   cortex activation has been previously shown to relate to rumination.
   This finding is in line with previous observations of the subgenual
   cingulate's role in emotion regulation and its clinical relevance to
   therapy and prognosis of mood disorders.}},

   regions previously associated with empathy for pain. In contrast,
   subsequent compassion training could reverse the increase in negative
   effect and, in contrast, augment self-reports of positive affect. In
   addition, compassion training increased activations in a non-overlapping
   brain network spanning ventral striatum, pregenual anterior cingulate
   cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex. We conclude that training
   compassion may reflect a new coping strategy to overcome empathic
   distress and strengthen resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD), which is characterized by the fear of
   being rejected and negatively evaluated, involves altered brain
   activation during the processing of negative emotions in a social
   context. Although associated temperament traits, such as shyness or
   behavioral inhibition, have been studied, there is still insufficient
   knowledge to support the dimensional approach, which assumes a continuum
   from subclinical to clinical levels of social anxiety symptoms. This
   study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the
   neural bases of individual differences in social anxiety. Our sample
   included participants with both healthy/subclinical as well as clinical
   levels of social anxiety. Forty-six participants with a wide range of
   social anxiety levels performed a gender decision task with emotional
   facial expressions during fMRI scanning. Activation in the left anterior
   insula and right lateral prefrontal cortex in response to angry faces
   was positively correlated with the level of social anxiety in a
   regression analysis. The results substantiate, with a dimensional
   approach, those obtained in previous studies that involved SAD patients
   or healthy and subclinical participants. It may help to refine further
   therapeutic strategies based on markers of social anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{The vast majority of attempts to quit smoking cigarettes are
   unsuccessful. Negative affect (NA) is one of the primary factors
   contributing to smoking relapse, in part because it interferes with
   psychological processes that are essential for self-regulation and
   coping. Converging evidence suggests that NA may be less of a problem
   for smokers with high relative to low dispositional self-control, but
   very little is known about the mechanisms that underlie this effect. We
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging to address this issue by
   examining the associations between trait self-control, state levels of
   NA and patterns of brain activation in nicotine-deprived smokers (n =
   117) during the performance of a verbal n-back paradigm (a task
   requiring cognitive processes that support self-regulation). While the
   activation of several brain regions linked to executive control
   correlated positively and negatively with state NA and trait
   self-control, respectively, an interaction between these factors was
   identified in only one region: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC). We conclude that the functions supported by the vmPFC are an
   important source of variability in smokers' self-regulatory functioning
   and propose that the region may contribute to the use of implicit forms
   of self-control under demanding circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of a team depends on its ability to deliver information
   through a hierarchy of team members and negotiate processes spanning
   different time scales. That structure and the behavior that results from
   it pose problems for researchers because multiply-nested interactions
   are not easily separated. We explored the behavior of a six-person team
   engaged in a Submarine Piloting and Navigation (SPAN) task using the
   tools of dynamical systems. The data were a single entropy time series
   that showed the distribution of activity across six team members, as
   recorded by nine-channel electroencephalography (EEG). A single team's
   data were analyzed for the purposes of illustrating the utility of
   multifractal analysis and allowing for in-depth exploratory analysis of
   temporal characteristics. Could the meaningful events experienced by one
   of these teams be captured using multifractal analysis, a dynamical
   systems tool that is specifically designed to extract patterns across
   levels of analysis? Results indicate that nested patterns of team
   activity can be identified from neural data streams, including both
   routine and novel events. The novelty of this tool is the ability to
   identify social patterns from the brain activity of individuals in the
   social interaction. Implications for application and future directions
   of this research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The current research examined the influence of ingroup/outgroup

   perceptual processing of own- and other-race faces. White participants
   performed a sequential matching task with upright and inverted faces
   belonging either to their own race (White) or to another race (Black)
   and affiliated with either their own university or another university by
   a preceding visual prime. Results demonstrated that the
   right-lateralized N170 component evoked by test faces was modulated by
   race and by social category: the N170 to own-race faces showed a larger
   inversion effect (i.e., latency delay for inverted faces) when the faces
   were categorized as other-university rather than own-university members;
   the N170 to other-race faces showed no modulation of its inversion
   effect by university affiliation. These results suggest that neural
   correlates of structural face encoding (as evidenced by the N170
   inversion effects) can be modulated by both visual (racial) and

Abstract = {{Body postures provide clear signals about emotional expressions, but so
   far it is not clear what muscle patterns are associated with specific
   emotions. This study lays the groundwork for a Body Action Coding System
   by investigating what combinations of muscles are used for emotional
   bodily expressions and assessing whether these muscles also
   automatically respond to the perception of emotional behavior. Surface
   electromyography of muscles in the arms (biceps and triceps) and
   shoulders (upper trapezius and deltoids) were measured during both
   active expression and passive viewing of fearful and angry bodily
   expressions. The biceps, deltoids, and triceps are recruited strongly
   for the expression of anger and fear expression predominantly depends on
   the biceps and the deltoids. During passive viewing, all muscles
   automatically activate during the passive viewing of anger. During fear
   perception, a clear activation can be seen in the trapezius, deltoid,
   and triceps muscles, whereas the biceps shows inhibition. In conclusion,
   this study provides more insight into the perception and expression of
   emotions in the body.}},

   across different menstrual phases (e.g., late luteal/premenstrual phase
   and follicular phase) when the arousal level of negative and neutral
   stimuli was equal. Following previous studies, an oddball paradigm was
   utilized in present study. Participants viewed neutral and negative
   (highly (HN) and moderately negative (MN)) stimuli with matched arousal
   and were asked to make deviant vs. standard judgments. The behavioral
   results showed a higher accuracy for HN stimuli than neutral stimuli,
   and the other comparisons were not significant. The major event-related
   potential (ERP) finding was that N2 amplitude was larger for MN than
   neutral in the late luteal phase, whereas such difference was absent
   during the follicular phase. Moreover, The N2 for HN stimuli was larger
   in late luteal phase than in follicular phase. Therefore, female may be
   with higher sensitivity to MN stimuli during late luteal phase than
   during follicular phase when the arousal of stimuli was well controlled.
   These results provide additional insight to premenstrual affective
   syndrome and affective disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Self-related stimuli such as the own name have been used to investigate
   self-awareness. The present study investigates a novel paradigm
   employing personal and possessive self-referential and
   non-self-referential pronouns (SRPs and NSRPs). Going beyond previous
   research, the robustness of the previously demonstrated self-reference
   effect was investigated for personal as well as possessive SRPs under
   passive and active processing conditions using event-related brain
   potentials (ERPs) as outcome measures. ERPs were recorded from 33
   healthy participants during the presentation of SRPs ich and mein
   (German for I/my) and NSRPs er and sein (he/his). Additionally, the role
   of the second person perspective (2PP) pronouns du and dein (you/your)
   was explored. Stimuli were presented in a rapid serial visual
   presentation (RSVP) design at frequencies of 2.5 and 1Hz including a
   passive reading and two active counting instructions. The results
   demonstrate that SRPs were spontaneously processed preferentially
   compared to NSRPs during an initial processing stage. SRPs moreover
   specifically benefitted from allocation of attention during later
   processing stages. These results suggest that processes during which a
   stimulus is related to oneself or others take place very early.
   Differences in temporal processing of personal and possessive pronouns
   were not found.}},

Abstract = {{When movements indicate meaningful actions, even nonbiological objects
   induce the impression of having a mind or animacy. This basic social
   ability was investigated in adults with high-functioning autism (HFA,
   n=13, and matched controls, n=13) by systematically varying motion
   properties of simple geometric shapes. Critically, trial-by-trial
   variations of (1) motion complexity of stimuli, and of (2) participants'
   individual animacy ratings were separately correlated with neural
   activity to dissociate cognitive strategies relying more closely on
   stimulus analysis vs. subjective experience. Increasing motion
   complexity did not yield any significant group differences, and in both
   groups, it correlated with neural activity in regions involved in
   perceptual and evaluative processing, including the ventral medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and posterior
   cingulate cortex (PCC). In contrast, although there were no significant
   behavioral differences between the groups, increasing animacy ratings
   correlated with neural activity in the insula, STG, amygdala, dorsal
   mPFC and PCC more strongly in controls than in HFA. These results
   indicate that in HFA the evaluation of stimulus properties cuing for
   animacy is intact, while increasing subjective ratings do not seem to be
   robustly related to social processing, including spontaneous mental
   state inferences and experience of salience.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about brain mechanisms recruited during the monitoring
   and appraisal of social conflicts-for instance, when individuals compete
   with each other for the same resources. We designed a novel experimental
   task inducing resource conflicts between two individuals. In an
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design,
   participants played with another human participant or against a
   computer, who across trials chose either different (no-conflict) or the
   same tokens (conflict trials) in order to obtain monetary gains. In
   conflict trials, the participants could decide whether they would share
   the token, and the resulting gain, with the other person or instead keep
   all points for themselves. Behaviorally, participants shared much more
   often when playing with a human partner than with a computer. fMRI
   results demonstrated that the dorsal mediofrontal cortex was selectively
   activated during human conflicts. This region might play a key role in
   detecting situations in which self- and social interest are incompatible
   and require behavioral adjustment. In addition, we found a
   conflict-related response in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   that correlated with measures of social relationship and individual
   sharing behavior. Taken together, these findings reveal a key role of
   these prefrontal areas for the appraisal and resolution of interpersonal
   resource conflicts.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals can experience embarrassment when exposed to self-feedback
   images, depending on the extent of the divergence from the internal
   representation of the standard self. Our previous work implicated the
   anterior insular cortex (AI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in
   the processing of embarrassment; however, their exact functional
   contributions have remained uncertain. Here, we explored the effects of
   being observed by others while viewing self-face images on the extent of
   embarrassment, and the activation and connectivity patterns in the AI
   and ACC. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging
   hyperscanning in pairs of healthy participants using an interaction
   system that allowed an individual to be observed by a partner in real
   time. Being observed increased the extent of embarrassment reported when
   viewing self-face images; a corresponding increase in self-related
   activity in the right AI suggested that this region played a direct role
   in the subjective experience. Being observed also increased the
   functional connectivity between the caudal ACC and prefrontal regions,
   which are involved in processing the reflective self. The ACC might
   therefore serve as a hub, integrating information about the reflective
   self that is used in evaluating perceptual self-face images.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that memory is more accurate for own-relative to
   other-race faces (own-race bias), which has been suggested to result
   from larger perceptual expertise for own-race faces. Previous studies
   also demonstrated better memory for own-relative to other-gender faces,
   which is less likely to result from differences in perceptual expertise,
   and rather may be related to social in-group vs out-group
   categorization. We examined neural correlates of the own-gender bias
   using event-related potentials (ERP). In a recognition memory
   experiment, both female and male participants remembered faces of their
   respective own gender more accurately compared with other-gender faces.
   ERPs during learning yielded significant differences between the
   subsequent memory effects (subsequently remembered - subsequently
   forgotten) for own-gender compared with other-gender faces in the
   occipito-temporal P2 and the central N200, whereas neither later
   subsequent memory effects nor ERP old/new effects at test reflected a
   neural correlate of the own-gender bias. We conclude that the own-gender
   bias is mainly related to study phase processes, which is in line with

Abstract = {{People believe that women are more emotionally intense than men, but the
   scientific evidence is equivocal. In this study, we tested the novel
   hypothesis that men and women differ in the neural correlates of
   affective experience, rather than in the intensity of neural activity,
   with women being more internally (interoceptively) focused and men being
   more externally (visually) focused. Adult men (n = 17) and women (n =
   17) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study while
   viewing affectively potent images and rating their moment-to-moment
   feelings of subjective arousal. We found that men and women do not
   differ overall in their intensity of moment-to-moment affective
   experiences when viewing evocative images, but instead, as predicted,
   women showed a greater association between the momentary arousal ratings
   and neural responses in the anterior insula cortex, which represents
   bodily sensations, whereas men showed stronger correlations between
   their momentary arousal ratings and neural responses in the visual
   cortex. Men also showed enhanced functional connectivity between the
   dorsal anterior insula cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex,
   which constitutes the circuitry involved with regulating shifts of
   attention to the world. These results demonstrate that the same
   affective experience is realized differently in different people, such
   that women's feelings are relatively more self-focused, whereas men's
   feelings are relatively more world-focused.}},

Abstract = {{Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been associated with stress reactivity in
   affective disorders and is most densely expressed in the amygdala. An
   important stressor associated with affective disorders is the experience
   of childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM). We investigated whether the
   interaction of NPY risk genotype and CEM would affect brain activation.
   From the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, 33 healthy
   controls and 85 patients with affective disorders were scanned with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while making gender decisions of
   emotional facial expressions. Results showed interactions between
   genotype and CEM, within carriers of the risk genotype, CEM was
   associated with higher amygdala activation, whereas CEM did not
   influence activation in non-risk carriers. In the posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC), less activation was seen in those with CEM and the risk
   genotype, whereas genotype did not influence PCC activation in those
   without CEM. In addition, those carrying the risk genotype and with
   experience of CEM made a faster gender decision than those without CEM.
   Thus, the combined effect of carrying NPY risk genotype and a history of
   CEM affected amygdala and PCC reactivity, areas related to emotion,
   self-relevance processing and autobiographical memory. These results are
   consistent with the notion that the combination of risk genotype and CEM
   may cause hypervigilance.}},

Abstract = {{In human social interactions, facial emotional expressions are a crucial
   source of information. Repeatedly presented information typically leads
   to an adaptation of neural responses. However, processing seems
   sustained with emotional facial expressions. Therefore, we tested
   whether sustained processing of emotional expressions, especially
   threat-related expressions, would attenuate neural adaptation. Neutral
   and emotional expressions (happy, mixed and fearful) of same and
   different identity were presented at 3 Hz. We used
   electroencephalography to record the evoked steady-state visual
   potentials (ssVEP) and tested to what extent the ssVEP amplitude adapts
   to the same when compared with different face identities. We found
   adaptation to the identity of a neutral face. However, for emotional
   faces, adaptation was reduced, decreasing linearly with negative
   valence, with the least adaptation to fearful expressions. This short
   and straightforward method may prove to be a valuable new tool in the
   study of emotional processing.}},

Abstract = {{Eudaimonic well-being reflects traits concerned with personal growth,
   self-acceptance, purpose in life and autonomy (among others) and is a
   substantial predictor of life events, including health. Although
   interest in the aetiology of eudaimonic well-being has blossomed in
   recent years, little is known of the underlying neural substrates of
   this construct. To address this gap in our knowledge, here we examined
   whether regional gray matter (GM) volume was associated with eudaimonic
   well-being. Structural magnetic resonance images from 70 young, healthy
   adults who also completed Ryff's 42-item measure of the six core facets
   of eudaimonia, were analysed with voxel-based morphometry techniques. We
   found that eudaimonic well-being was positively associated with right
   insular cortex GM volume. This association was also reflected in three
   of the sub-scales of eudaimonia: personal growth, positive relations and
   purpose in life. Positive relations also showed a significant
   association with left insula volume. No other significant associations
   were observed, although personal growth was marginally associated with
   left insula, and purpose in life exhibited a marginally significant
   negative association with middle temporal gyrus GM volume. These
   findings are the first to our knowledge linking eudaimonic well-being
   with regional brain structure.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the spatiotemporal brain dynamics of emotional
   information processing during reading using a combination of surface and
   intracranial electroencephalography (EEG). Two different theoretical
   views were opposed. According to the standard psycholinguistic
   perspective, emotional responses to words are generated within the
   reading network itself subsequent to semantic activation. According to
   the neural re-use perspective, brain regions that are involved in
   processing emotional information contained in other stimuli (faces,
   pictures, smells) might be in charge of the processing of emotional
   information in words as well. We focused on a specific
   emotion-disgust-which has a clear locus in the brain, the anterior
   insula. Surface EEG showed differences between disgust and neutral words
   as early as 200 ms. Source localization suggested a cortical generator
   of the emotion effect in the left anterior insula. These findings were
   corroborated through the intracranial recordings of two epileptic
   patients with depth electrodes in insular and orbitofrontal areas. Both
   electrodes showed effects of disgust in reading as early as 200 ms. The
   early emotion effect in a brain region (insula) that responds to
   specific emotions in a variety of situations and stimuli clearly
   challenges classic sequential theories of reading in favor of the neural
   re-use perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Depressive cognitive schemas play an important role in the emergence and
   persistence of major depressive disorder (MDD). The current study
   adapted emotion regulation techniques to reflect elements of cognitive
   behavioural therapy (CBT) and related psychotherapies to delineate
   neurocognitive abnormalities associated with modulating the negative
   cognitive style in MDD. Nineteen non-medicated patients with MDD and 19
   matched controls reduced negative or enhanced positive feelings elicited
   by emotional scenes while undergoing functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Although both groups showed significant emotion regulation
   success as measured by subjective ratings of affect, the controls were
   significantly better at modulating both negative and positive emotion.
   Both groups recruited regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) when regulating negative
   emotions. Only in controls was this accompanied by reduced activity in
   sensory cortices and amygdala. Similarly, both groups showed enhanced
   activity in VLPFC and ventral striatum when enhancing positive affect;
   however, only in controls was ventral striatum activity correlated with
   regulation efficacy. The results suggest that depression is associated
   with both a reduced capacity to achieve relief from negative affect
   despite recruitment of ventral and dorsal prefrontal cortical regions
   implicated in emotion regulation, coupled with a disconnect between
   activity in reward-related regions and subjective positive affect.}},

Abstract = {{Much work in the field of social cognition shows that adopting an
   abstract (vs concrete) mindset alters the way people construe the world,
   thereby exerting substantial effects across innumerable aspects of human
   behavior. In order to investigate the cognitive and neural basis of
   these effects, we scanned participants as they performed two widely used
   tasks that induce an abstracting vs concretizing mindsets. Specifically,
   participants: (i) indicated `why' perform certain activities (a task
   that involves abstraction) or `how' the same activities are performed (a
   task that involves concretization) and (ii) generated superordinate
   categories for certain objects (a task that involves abstraction) or
   subordinate exemplars for the same objects (a task that involves
   concretization). We conducted a conjunction analysis of the two tasks,
   in order to uncover the neural activity associated with abstraction and
   concretization. The results showed that concretization was associated
   with activation in fronto-parietal regions implicated in goal-directed
   action; abstraction was associated with activity within posterior
   regions implicated in visual perception. We discuss these findings in
   light of construal-level theory's notion of abstraction.}},

Abstract = {{Personal identity critically depends on the creation of stories about
   the self and one's life. The present study investigates the neural
   substrates of autobiographical reasoning, a process central to the
   construction of such narratives. During functional magnetic resonance
   imaging scanning, participants approached a set of personally
   significant memories in two different ways: in some trials, they
   remembered the concrete content of the events (autobiographical
   remembering), whereas in other trials they reflected on the broader
   meaning and implications of their memories (autobiographical reasoning).
   Relative to remembering, autobiographical reasoning recruited a
   left-lateralized network involved in conceptual processing {[}including
   the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior frontal gyrus,
   middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus]. The ventral MPFC-an area that
   may function to generate personal/affective meaning-was not consistently
   engaged during autobiographical reasoning across participants but,
   interestingly, the activity of this region was modulated by individual
   differences in interest and willingness to engage in self-reflection.
   These findings support the notion that autobiographical reasoning and
   the construction of personal narratives go beyond mere remembering in
   that they require deriving meaning and value from past experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals react to violation of social norms by outgroup members
   differently than to transgressions of those same norms by ingroup
   members: namely outgroup perpetrators are punished much more harshly
   than ingroup perpetrators. This parochial punishment pattern has been
   observed and extensively studied in social psychology and behavioral
   economics. Despite progress in recent years, however, little is known
   about the neural underpinnings of this intergroup bias. Here, we
   demonstrate by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) that the
   transient disruption of the right, but not the left temporo-parietal
   junction (TPJ), reduces parochial punishment in a third-party punishment
   paradigm with real social groups. Moreover, we show that this observed
   TMS effect on parochial punishment is mediated by a classical punishment
   motive, i.e. retaliation. Finally, our data suggests that a change in
   perspective-taking might be the underlying mechanism that explains the
   impact of right TPJ disruption on retaliation motivation and parochial
   punishment. These findings provide the first causal evidence that the
   right TPJ plays a pivotal role in the implementation of parochial
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Data from developmental psychology suggests a link between the growth of

   percentile of the empathy quotient questionnaire (EQ, Baron-Cohen and
   Wheelwright, 2004). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
   used to compare neural responses to cues of social and non-social
   (monetary) reward. When compared to the high-EQ group, the low-EQ group
   showed reduced activity of the brain s reward system, specifically the
   right nucleus accumbens, in response to cues predictive of social reward
   (videos showing gestures of approval)-but increased activation in this
   area for monetary incentives. Our data provide evidence for a link

Abstract = {{The complex phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD) encompasses motor,
   psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctions, including early impairments in
   emotion recognition. In this first functional magnetic resonance imaging
   study, we investigated emotion-processing deficits in 14 manifest HD
   patients and matched controls. An emotion recognition task comprised
   short video clips displaying one of six basic facial expressions
   (sadness, happiness, disgust, fear, anger and neutral). Structural
   changes between patients and controls were assessed by means of
   voxel-based morphometry. Along with deficient recognition of negative
   emotions, patients exhibited predominantly lower neural response to
   stimuli of negative valences in the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum,
   insula, cingulate and prefrontal cortices, as well as in sensorimotor,
   temporal and visual areas. Most of the observed reduced activity
   patterns could not be explained merely by regional volume loss. Reduced
   activity in the thalamus during fear correlated with lower thalamic
   volumes. During the processing of sadness, patients exhibited enhanced
   amygdala and hippocampal activity along with reduced recruitment of the
   medial prefrontal cortex. Higher amygdala activity was related to more
   pronounced amygdala atrophy and disease burden. Overall, the observed
   emotion-related dysfunctions in the context of structural
   neurodegeneration suggest both disruptions of striatal-thalamo-cortical
   loops and potential compensation mechanism with greater disease severity
   in manifest HD.}},

Abstract = {{Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. How attractive someone is
   perceived to be depends on the individual or cultural standards to which
   this person is compared. But although comparisons play a central role in
   the way people judge the appearance of others, the brain processes
   underlying attractiveness comparisons remain unknown. In the present
   experiment, we tested the hypothesis that attractiveness comparisons
   rely on the same cognitive and neural mechanisms as comparisons of
   simple nonsocial magnitudes such as size. We recorded brain activity
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants
   compared the beauty or height of two women or two dogs. Our data support
   the hypothesis of a common process underlying these different types of
   comparisons. First, we demonstrate that the distance effect
   characteristic of nonsocial comparisons also holds for attractiveness
   comparisons. Behavioral results indicated, for all our comparisons,
   longer response times for near than far distances. Second, the neural
   correlates of these distance effects overlapped in a frontoparietal
   network known for its involvement in processing simple nonsocial
   quantities. These results provide evidence for overlapping processes in
   the comparison of physical attractiveness and nonsocial magnitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the well-known role of the amygdala in mediating emotional
   interference during tasks requiring cognitive resources, no definite
   conclusion has yet been reached regarding the differential roles of
   functionally and anatomically distinctive subcomponents of the amygdala
   in such processes. In this study, we examined female participants and
   attempted to separate the neural processes for the detection of
   emotional information from those for the regulation of cognitive
   interference from emotional distractors by adding a temporal gap between
   emotional stimuli and a subsequent cognitive Stroop task. Reaction time
   data showed a significantly increased Stroop interference effect
   following emotionally negative stimuli compared with neutral stimuli,
   and functional magnetic resonance imaging data revealed that the
   anterior ventral amygdala (avAMYG) showed greater responses to negative
   stimuli compared with neutral stimuli. In addition, individuals who
   scored high in neuroticism showed greater posterior dorsal amygdala
   (pdAMYG) responses to incongruent compared with congruent Stroop trials
   following negative stimuli, but not following neutral stimuli. Taken
   together, the findings of this study demonstrated functionally
   distinctive contributions of the avAMYG and pdAMYG to the
   emotion-modulated Stroop interference effect and suggested that the
   avAMYG encodes associative values of emotional stimuli whereas the
   pdAMYG resolves cognitive interference from emotional distractors.}},

Abstract = {{Social rejection often increases aggression, but the neural mechanisms
   underlying this effect remain unclear. This experiment tested whether
   neural activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and
   anterior insula in response to social rejection predicted greater
   subsequent aggression. Additionally, it tested whether executive
   functioning moderated this relationship. Participants completed a
   behavioral measure of executive functioning, experienced social
   rejection while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and
   then completed a task in which they could aggress against a person who
   rejected them using noise blasts . We found that dACC activation and
   executive functioning interacted to predict aggression. Specifically,
   participants with low executive functioning showed a positive
   association between dACC activation and aggression, whereas individuals
   with high executive functioning showed a negative association. Similar
   results were found for the left anterior insula. These findings suggest
   that social pain can increase or decrease aggression, depending on an
   individual's regulatory capability.}},

Abstract = {{When viewing object-related hand actions people make proactive eye
   movements of the same kind as those made when performing such actions.
   Why is this so? It has been suggested that proactive gaze when viewing a
   given hand action depends on the recruitment of motor areas such as the
   ventral premotor (PMv) cortex that would be involved in the execution of
   that action. However, direct evidence for a distinctive role of the PMv
   cortex in driving gaze behavior is still lacking. We recorded eye
   moments while viewing hand actions before and immediately after
   delivering repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the
   left PMv and the posterior part of the left superior temporal sulcus,
   which is known to be involved in high-order visual action processing.
   Our results showed that rTMS-induced effects were selective with respect
   to the viewed actions following the virtual lesion of the left PMv only.
   This, for the first time, provides direct evidence that the PMv cortex
   might selectively contribute to driving the viewer's gaze to the
   action's target. When people view another's action, their eyes may be
   driven by motor processes similar to those they would need to perform
   the action themselves.}},

Abstract = {{In everyday life, people adaptively prepare for the future by simulating
   dynamic events about impending interactions with people, objects and
   locations. Previous research has consistently demonstrated that a
   distributed network of frontal-parietal-temporal brain regions supports
   this ubiquitous mental activity. Nonetheless, little is known about the
   manner in which specific regions of this network contribute to component
   features of future simulation. In two experiments, we used a functional
   magnetic resonance (fMR)-repetition suppression paradigm to demonstrate
   that distinct frontal-parietal-temporal regions are sensitive to
   processing the scenarios or what participants imagined was happening in
   an event (e.g. medial prefrontal, posterior cingulate, temporal-parietal
   and middle temporal cortices are sensitive to the scenarios associated
   with future social events), people (medial prefrontal cortex), objects
   (inferior frontal and premotor cortices) and locations (posterior
   cingulate/retrosplenial, parahippocampal and posterior parietal
   cortices) that typically constitute simulations of personal future
   events. This pattern of results demonstrates that the neural substrates
   of these component features of event simulations can be reliably
   identified in the context of a task that requires participants to
   simulate complex, everyday future experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies suggest that anxious individuals are more hypervigilant
   to threat in their environment than nonanxious individuals. In the
   present event-related potential (ERP) study, we sought to investigate
   the extent to which afferent cortical processes, as indexed by the
   earliest visual component C1, are biased in observers high in fear of
   specific objects. In a visual search paradigm, ERPs were measured while
   spider-fearful participants and controls searched for discrepant objects
   (e.g. spiders, butterflies, flowers) in visual arrays. Results showed
   enhanced C1 amplitudes in response to spatially directed target stimuli
   in spider-fearful participants only. Furthermore, enhanced C1 amplitudes
   were observed in response to all discrepant targets and distractors in
   spider-fearful compared with non-anxious participants, irrespective of
   fearful and non-fearful target contents. This pattern of results is in
   line with theoretical notions of heightened sensory sensitivity
   (hypervigilance) to external stimuli in high-fearful individuals.
   Specifically, the findings suggest that fear facilitates afferent
   cortical processing in the human visual cortex in a non-specific and
   temporally sustained fashion, when observers search for potential threat
   cues.}},

Abstract = {{The tendency to trust and to cooperate increases from adolescence to
   adulthood. This social development has been associated with improved
   mentalizing and age-related changes in brain function. Thus far, there
   is limited imaging data investigating these associations. We used two
   trust games with a trustworthy and an unfair partner to explore the
   brain mechanisms underlying trust and cooperation in subjects ranging
   from adolescence to mid-adulthood. Increasing age was associated with
   higher trust at the onset of social interactions, increased levels of
   trust during interactions with a trustworthy partner and a stronger
   decline in trust during interactions with an unfair partner. Our
   findings demonstrate a behavioural shift towards higher trust and an
   age-related increase in the sensitivity to others' negative social
   signals. Increased brain activation in mentalizing regions, i.e.
   temporo-parietal junction, posterior cingulate and precuneus, supported
   the behavioural change. Additionally, age was associated with reduced
   activation in the reward-related orbitofrontal cortex and caudate
   nucleus during interactions with a trustworthy partner, possibly
   reflecting stronger expectations of trustworthiness. During unfair
   interactions, age-related increases in anterior cingulate activation, an
   area implicated in conflict monitoring, may mirror the necessity to
   inhibit pro-social tendencies in the face of the partner's actual levels
   of cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Expectations about an upcoming emotional event have the power to shape

   mediation analyses to examine the relationship between brain activity
   when anticipating the need to cognitively reappraise aversive images,
   amygdala responses to those images and subsequent success in diminishing
   negative affect. We found that anticipatory activity in right
   rostrolateral prefrontal cortex was associated with greater subsequent
   left amygdala responses to aversive images and decreased regulation
   success. In contrast, anticipatory ventral anterior insula activity was
   associated with reduced amygdala responses and greater reappraisal
   success. In both cases, left amygdala responses mediated the
   relationship between anticipatory activity and reappraisal success.
   These results suggest that anticipation facilitates successful

Abstract = {{Social interactions occur within a variety of different
   contexts-cooperative/competitive-and often involve members of our social
   network. Here, we investigated whether social network modulated the
   value placed on positive outcomes during a competitive context. Eighteen
   human participants played a simple card-guessing game with three
   different competitors: a close friend (in-network), a confederate
   (out-of-network) and a random number generator (non-social condition)
   while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Neuroimaging
   results at the time of outcome receipt demonstrated a significant main
   effect of competitor across multiple regions of medial prefrontal
   cortex, with Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) responses strongest
   when competing against one's friend compared with all other conditions.
   Striatal BOLD responses demonstrated a more general sensitivity to
   positive compared with negative monetary outcomes, which an exploratory
   analysis revealed to be stronger when interacting with social, compared
   with non-social, competitors. Interestingly, a Granger causality
   analysis indicated directed influences sent from an medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) region, which shows social network differentiation of
   outcomes, and the ventral striatum bilaterally. Our results suggest that
   when competing against others of varying degrees of social network, mPFC
   differentially values these outcomes, perhaps treating in-network
   outcomes as more informative, leaving the striatum to more general value
   computations.}},

Abstract = {{Social comparisons are an important means by which we gain information
   about the self, but little is known about the neural mechanisms
   underlying comparative social judgment, as most prior functional
   magnetic resonance imaging research on this topic has investigated
   judgments of self or others in isolation. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC) has routinely been implicated in social cognitive tasks that
   rely on such absolute judgments about the self or others, but it is
   unclear whether activity in this region is modulated by personal
   relevance of social stimuli or self-similarity of judgment targets.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that these
   forces interact to determine vmPFC response during social comparisons,
   as well as neural activity in the bilateral anterior insulae.
   Comparisons between the self and similar others exhibit a unique
   response in this region when compared with other judgment contexts,
   suggesting that the special psychological status afforded to these
   social comparisons is indexed by activity in the vmPFC and insula.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, it has been shown that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is
   involved in error execution as well as error observation. Based on this
   finding, it has been argued that recognizing each other's mistakes might
   rely on motor simulation. In the current functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study, we directly tested this hypothesis by
   investigating whether medial prefrontal activity in error observation is
   restricted to situations that enable simulation. To this aim, we
   compared brain activity related to the observation of errors that can be
   simulated (human errors) with brain activity related to errors that
   cannot be simulated (machine errors). We show that medial prefrontal
   activity is not only restricted to the observation of human errors but
   also occurs when observing errors of a machine. In addition, our data
   indicate that the MPFC reflects a domain general mechanism of monitoring
   violations of expectancies.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder resulting in prominent
   impairments in social functioning. Thus, clinical research has focused
   on underlying deficits of emotion processing and their linkage to
   specific symptoms and neurobiological dysfunctions. Although there is
   substantial research investigating impairments in unimodal affect
   recognition, studies in schizophrenia exploring crossmodal emotion
   processing are rare. Therefore, event-related potentials were measured
   in 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy controls while rating
   the expression of happy, fearful and neutral faces and concurrently
   being distracted by emotional or neutral sounds. Compared with controls,
   patients with schizophrenia revealed significantly decreased P1 and
   increased P2 amplitudes in response to all faces, independent of emotion
   or concurrent sound. Analyzing these effects with regard to audiovisual
   (in) congruence revealed that P1 amplitudes in patients were only
   reduced in response to emotionally incongruent stimulus pairs, whereas
   similar amplitudes between groups could be observed for congruent
   conditions. Correlation analyses revealed a significant negative
   correlation between general symptom severity (Brief Psychiatric Rating
   Scale-V4) and P1 amplitudes in response to congruent audiovisual
   stimulus pairs. These results indicate that early visual processing
   deficits in schizophrenia are apparent during emotion processing but,
   depending on symptom severity, these deficits can be restored by
   presenting concurrent emotionally congruent sounds.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized by vigilance to
   novelty, sensitivity to approach-withdrawal cues and social reticence in
   childhood, is associated with risk for anxiety in adolescence.
   Independent studies link reward hyper-responsivity to BI, adolescent
   anxiety and dopamine gene variants. This exploratory study extends these
   observations by examining the impact of DRD4 genotype and reward
   hyper-responsivity on the BI-anxiety link. Adolescents (N = 78)
   completed a monetary incentive delay task in the fMRI environment.
   Participants were characterized based on a continuous score of BI and
   the 7-repeat allele (7R+) of the DRD4 functional polymorphism.
   Parent-report and self-report measures of anxiety were also collected.
   Across the entire sample, striatal activation increased systematically
   with increases in the magnitude of anticipated monetary gains and
   losses. DRD4 status moderated the relation between BI and activation in
   the caudate nucleus. Childhood BI was associated with parent report of
   adolescent anxiety among 7R+ participants with elevated levels of
   striatal response to incentive cues. DRD4 genotype influenced the
   relations among neural response to incentives, early childhood BI and
   anxiety. The findings help refine our understanding of the role
   reward-related brain systems play in the emergence of anxiety in
   temperamentally at-risk individuals, building a foundation for future
   larger scale studies.}},

Abstract = {{Although altruistic and selfish behaviors seem fundamentally
   incommensurable humans regularly choose between them. One model of such
   choices suggests that individuals ascribe a common form of subjective
   value to their own outcomes and those of others. To test this `person
   invariance' hypothesis, we asked individuals to choose between
   allocating varying amounts of money to themselves or to a partner.
   Participants' choice patterns provided an estimate of the relative value
   they placed on their own and others' gains. These estimates were used to
   isolate neural activity correlating with the subjective value of gains
   irrespective of the recipient (self or other) during a separate set of
   trials in which rewards were offered only to the self or partner.
   Activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex scaled with this
   person-invariant value parameter, consistent with earlier demonstrations
   that this region supports common value computation. These data suggest
   that individuals reduce the value associated with their own and others'

Abstract = {{Touch plays a crucial role in social-emotional development. Slow, gentle
   touch applied to hairy skin is processed by C-tactile (CT) nerve fibers.
   Furthermore, `social brain' regions, such as the posterior superior
   temporal sulcus (pSTS) have been shown to process CT-targeted touch.
   Research on the development of these neural mechanisms is scant, yet
   such knowledge may inform our understanding of the critical role of
   touch in development and its dysfunction in disorders involving sensory
   issues, such as autism. The aim of this study was to validate the
   ability of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), an imaging
   technique well-suited for use with infants, to measure temporal lobe
   responses to CT-targeted touch. Healthy adults received brushing to the
   right forearm (CT) and palm (non-CT) separately, in a block design
   procedure. We found significant activation in right pSTS and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to arm > palm touch. In addition,
   individual differences in autistic traits were related to the magnitude
   of peak activation within pSTS. These findings demonstrate that fNIRS
   can detect brain responses to CT-targeted touch and lay the foundation
   for future work with infant populations that will characterize the
   development of brain mechanisms for processing CT-targeted touch in
   typical and atypical populations.}},

Abstract = {{Reminders of mortality influence human social cognition, but whether and
   how reminders of mortality affect brain activity underlying social
   cognition remains unclear. To test whether increasing mortality salience
   modulates neural responses to others' suffering, we scanned healthy
   adults who viewed video clips showing others in pain using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. One group of participants were primed to
   increase mortality salience and another group were primed with negative
   affect in terms of fear/anxiety. We found that perceiving painful vs
   non-painful stimuli in the pre-priming session activated the
   midcingulate/dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MCC/dMPFC), bilateral
   anterior insula/inferior frontal cortex, bilateral secondary
   somatosensory cortex and left middle temporal gyrus. However, MCC/dMPFC
   activity in response to perceived pain in others was significantly
   decreased in the post-priming session by the mortality salience priming,
   but was not influenced by the negative affect priming. Moreover,
   subjective fear of death induced by the priming procedures mediated the
   change in MCC/dMPFC activity across the priming procedures. Subjective
   fear of death also moderated the co-variation of MCC/dMPFC and left
   insular activity during perception of others in pain. Our findings
   indicate that reminders of mortality decrease neural responses to
   others' suffering and this effect is mediated by the subjective fear of
   death.}},

Abstract = {{This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate
   brain activation during preparatory and regulatory control while
   participants (N = 24) were instructed either to simply view or decrease
   their emotional response to, pleasant, neutral or unpleasant pictures. A
   main effect of emotional valence on brain activity was found in the
   right precentral gyrus, with greater activation during positive than
   negative emotion regulation. A main effect of regulation phase was
   evident in the bilateral anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC), precuneus,
   posterior cingulate cortex, right putamen and temporal and occipital
   lobes, with greater activity in these regions during preparatory than
   regulatory control. A valence X regulation interaction was evident in
   regions of ventromedial PFC and anterior cingulate cortex, reflecting
   greater activation while regulating negative than positive emotion, but
   only during active emotion regulation (not preparation). Conjunction
   analyses revealed common brain regions involved in differing types of
   emotion regulation including selected areas of left lateral PFC,
   inferior parietal lobe, temporal lobe, right cerebellum and bilateral

Abstract = {{Psychopaths show a reduced ability to recognize emotion facial
   expressions, which may disturb the interpersonal relationship
   development and successful social adaptation. Behavioral hypotheses
   point toward an association between emotion recognition deficits in
   psychopathy and amygdala dysfunction. Our prediction was that amygdala
   dysfunction would combine deficient activation with disturbances in
   functional connectivity with cortical regions of the face-processing
   network. Twenty-two psychopaths and 22 control subjects were assessed
   and functional magnetic resonance maps were generated to identify both
   brain activation and task-induced functional connectivity using
   psychophysiological interaction analysis during an emotional
   face-matching task. Results showed significant amygdala activation in
   control subjects only, but differences between study groups did not
   reach statistical significance. In contrast, psychopaths showed
   significantly increased activation in visual and prefrontal areas, with
   this latest activation being associated with psychopaths'
   affective-interpersonal disturbances. Psychophysiological interaction
   analyses revealed a reciprocal reduction in functional connectivity
   between the left amygdala and visual and prefrontal cortices. Our
   results suggest that emotional stimulation may evoke a relevant cortical
   response in psychopaths, but a disruption in the processing of emotional
   faces exists involving the reciprocal functional interaction between the
   amygdala and neocortex, consistent with the notion of a failure to
   integrate emotion into cognition in psychopathic individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Functions of the orbitofrontal cortex include diverse social, cognitive
   and affective processes, many of which are abnormal in autism spectrum
   disorders (ASDs). Recently, altered orbitofrontal sulcogyral patterns
   have been revealed in several psychiatric conditions, such as
   schizophrenia, indicating a possibility that altered orbitofrontal
   sulcogyral morphology reflects abnormal neurodevelopment. However, the
   presence of sulcal alterations in ASD remains unexplored. Using
   structural magnetic resonance imaging, subtypes of the `H-shaped' sulcus
   (Type I, II and III, in order of frequency), posterior orbital sulcus
   (POS) and intermediate orbital sulcus were identified in each hemisphere
   of adult males with ASD (n = 51) and matched normal controls (n = 55)
   based on the study by Chiavaras and Petrides. ASD showed a significantly
   altered distribution of H-shaped sulcal subtypes in both hemispheres,
   with a significant increase of Type III. A significant alteration in the
   distribution of sulcal subtypes was also identified in the right
   hemisphere POS of ASD. Categorical regression analysis revealed that
   Type I and II expressions predicted a reduced total Autism-Spectrum
   Quotient score. Furthermore, Type I expression was associated with a
   reduced `attention' to detail' subscale score. The results demonstrate
   that altered sulcogyral morphology can be a marker for abnormal
   neurodevelopment leading to the increased risk of developing autism.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional connection is the main reason people engage with music, and
   the emotional features of music can influence processing in other
   domains. Williams syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental genetic disorder
   where musicality and sociability are prominent aspects of the phenotype.
   This study examined oscillatory brain activity during a musical
   affective priming paradigm. Participants with WS and age-matched
   typically developing controls heard brief emotional musical excerpts or
   emotionally neutral sounds and then reported the emotional valence
   (happy/sad) of subsequently presented faces. Participants with WS
   demonstrated greater evoked fronto-central alpha activity to the happy
   vs sad musical excerpts. The size of these alpha effects correlated with
   parent-reported emotional reactivity to music. Although participant
   groups did not differ in accuracy of identifying facial emotions,
   reaction time data revealed a music priming effect only in persons with
   WS, who responded faster when the face matched the emotional valence of
   the preceding musical excerpt vs when the valence differed. Matching
   emotional valence was also associated with greater evoked gamma activity
   thought to reflect cross-modal integration. This effect was not present
   in controls. The results suggest a specific connection between music and
   socioemotional processing and have implications for clinical and
   educational approaches for WS.}},

Abstract = {{Infants' visual scanning of social scenes is influenced by both
   exogenously and endogenously driven shifts of attention. We manipulate
   these factors by contrasting individual infants' distribution of visual
   attention to the eyes relative to the mouth when viewing complex dynamic
   scenes with multiple communicative signals (e.g. peek-a-boo), relative
   to the same infant viewing simpler scenes where only single features
   move (moving eyes, mouth and hands). We explore the relationship between
   context-dependent scanning patterns and later social and communication
   outcomes in two groups of infants, with and without familial risk for
   autism. Our findings suggest that in complex scenes requiring more
   endogenous control of attention, increased scanning of the mouth region
   relative to the eyes at 7 months is associated with superior expressive
   language (EL) at 36 months. This relationship holds even after
   controlling for outcome group. In contrast, in simple scenes where only
   the mouth is moving, those infants, irrespective of their group
   membership, who direct their attention to the repetitive moving feature,
   i.e. the mouth, have poorer EL at 36 months. Taken together, our
   findings suggest that scanning of complex social scenes does not begin
   as strikingly different in those infants later diagnosed with autism.}},

Abstract = {{The current research examined the viability of the N400, an
   event-related potential (ERP) related to the detection of semantic
   incongruity, as an index of both stereotype accessibility and
   interracial prejudice. Participants' EEG was recorded while they
   completed a sequential priming task, in which negative or positive,
   stereotypically black (African American) or white (Caucasian American)
   traits followed the presentation of either a black or white face acting
   as a prime. ERP examination focused on the N400, but additionally
   examined N100 and P200 reactivity. Replicating and extending previous
   N400 stereotype research, results indicated that the N400 can indeed
   function as an index of stereotype accessibility in an interracial
   domain, as greater N400 reactivity was elicited by trials in which the
   face prime was incongruent with the target trait than when primes and
   traits matched. Furthermore, N400 activity was moderated by
   participants' self-reported explicit bias. More explicitly biased
   participants demonstrated greater N400 reactivity to stereotypically
   white traits following black faces than black traits following black
   faces. P200 activity was additionally associated with participants
   implicit biases, as more implicitly biased participants similarly
   demonstrated greater P200 reactivity to stereotypically white traits
   following black faces than black traits following black faces.}},

Abstract = {{The devastating social, emotional and economic consequences of human
   aggression are laid bare nightly on newscasts around the world.
   Aggression is principally mediated by neural circuitry comprising
   multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex and limbic system, including the
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala
   and hippocampus. A striking characteristic of these regions is their
   structural asymmetry about the midline (i.e. left vs right hemisphere).
   Variations in these asymmetries have been linked to clinical disorders
   characterized by aggression and the rate of aggressive behavior in
   psychiatric patients. Here, we show for the first time that structural
   asymmetries in prefrontal cortical areas are also linked to aggression
   in a normal population of early adolescents. Our findings indicate a
   relationship between parent reports of aggressive behavior in
   adolescents and structural asymmetries in the limbic and paralimbic ACC
   and OFC, and moreover, that this relationship varies by sex.
   Furthermore, while there was no relationship between aggression and
   structural asymmetries in the amygdala or hippocampus, hippocampal
   volumes did predict aggression in females. Taken together, the results
   suggest that structural asymmetries in the prefrontal cortex may
   influence human aggression, and that the anatomical basis of aggression
   varies substantially by sex.}},

Abstract = {{Animal models are critical for gaining insights into autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD). Despite their apparent advantages to mice for neural
   studies, rats have not been widely used for disorders of the human CNS,
   such as ASD, for the lack of convenient genome manipulation tools. Here
   we describe two of the first transgenic rat models for ASD, developed
   using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) methodologies, and their initial
   behavioral assessment using a rapid juvenile test battery. A syndromic
   and nonsyndromic rat model for ASD were created as two separate knockout
   rat lines with heritable disruptions in the genes encoding Fragile X
   mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Neuroligin3 (NLGN3). FMRP, a
   protein with numerous proposed functions including regulation of mRNA
   and synaptic protein synthesis, and NLGN3, a member of the neuroligin
   synaptic cell-adhesion protein family, have been implicated in human
   ASD. Juvenile subjects from both knockout rat lines exhibited
   abnormalities in ASD-relevant phenotypes including juvenile play,
   perseverative behaviors, and sensorimotor gating. These data provide
   important first evidence regarding the utility of rats as genetic models
   for investigating ASD-relevant genes.}},

Abstract = {{Communication and swallowing deficits are common in Parkinson's disease
   (PD). Evidence indicates that voice and speech dysfunction manifest
   early, prior to motor deficits typically associated with striatal
   dopamine loss. Unlike deficits in the extremities, cranial sensorimotor
   deficits are refractory to standard dopamine-related pharmacological and
   surgical interventions, thus the mechanisms underlying vocal deficits
   are unclear. Although neurotoxin models have provided some insight, they
   typically model nigrostriatal dopamine depletion and are therefore
   limited. Widespread alpha-synuclein (aSyn) pathology is common to
   familial and sporadic PD, and transgenic mouse models based on aSyn
   overexpression present a unique opportunity to explore vocalization
   deficits in relation to extrastriatal, nondopaminergic pathologies.
   Specifically, mice overexpressing human wild-type aSyn under a broad
   neuronal promoter (Thy1-aSyn) present early, progressive motor and
   nonmotor deficits starting at 2-3 months, followed by parkinsonism with
   dopamine loss at 14 months. We recorded ultrasonic vocalizations from
   Thy1-aSyn mice and wild-type (WT) controls at 2-3, 6-7, and 9 months.
   Thy1-aSyn mice demonstrated early, progressive vocalization deficits
   compared with WT. Duration and intensity of calls were significantly
   reduced and call profile was altered in the Thy1-aSyn mice, particularly
   at 2-3 months. Call rate trended toward a more drastic decrease with age
   in the Thy1-aSyn mice compared with WT. Alpha-synuclein pathology is
   present in the periaqueductal gray and may underlie the manifestation of
   vocalization deficits. These results indicate that aSyn overexpression
   can induce vocalization deficits at an early age in mice and provides a
   new model for studying the mechanisms underlying cranial sensorimotor
   deficits and treatment interventions for PD.}},

Abstract = {{Normal aging in rats affects behavioral performance on a variety of
   associative learning tasks under Pavlovian conditions. There is little
   information, however, on whether aging also impacts performance of
   instrumental tasks. Young (9-12 months) and aged (24-27 months) Fisher
   344 rats were trained to press distinct levers associated with either
   maltodextrin or sucrose. The rats in both age groups increased their
   lever press frequency at a similar rate, suggesting that the initial
   acquisition of this instrumental task is not affected by aging. Using a
   contingency degradation procedure, we then addressed whether aged rats
   could adapt their behavior to changes in action-outcome contingencies.
   We found that young and aged rats do adapt, but that a different
   schedule of reinforcement is necessary to optimize performance in each
   age group. Finally, we also addressed whether aged rats can extinguish a
   lever press action as well as young rats, using 2 40-min extinction
   sessions on consecutive days. While extinction profiles were similar in
   young and aged rats on the first day of training, aged rats were faster
   to extinguish their lever presses on the second day, in spite of their
   performance levels being similar at the beginning of the session.
   Together these data support the finding that acquisition of instrumental
   lever press behaviors is preserved in aged rats and suggest that they
   have a different threshold for switching strategies in response to
   changes in action-outcome associations. This pattern of result implies
   that age-related changes in the brain are heterogeneous and widespread
   across structures.}},

Abstract = {{Delay of gratification (DoG) refers to the ability to postpone immediate
   rewards in favor of later and better rewards. A successful DoG in
   children/adolescents is subject to the maturation of the lateral and
   medial prefrontal cortex, which is more prone to normal age-related
   atrophy compared with other brain regions. Therefore, we investigated
   morphological brain correlates of DoG using structural MRI surface-based
   morphometry as well as determined whether dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC) atrophy is related to DoG in the elderly. We used the behavioral
   Delay of Gratification Test for Adults to measure DoG in 40 healthy
   older adults aged between 63 and 93 years. When simultaneously
   controlling for age and intracranial volume, high DoG significantly
   positively correlated with cortical surface area of the left DLPFC. At a
   more liberal statistical threshold, we found positive correlations
   between DoG and cortical thickness of the left and right DLPFC, left and
   right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and left midanterior cingulate
   cortex. Additionally, cortical surface area in the left DLPFC correlated
   positively with DoG as well as with the volume of the left caudate
   nucleus. The results suggest that the DLPFC, medial prefrontal cortex,
   and the caudate nucleus play a crucial role in DoG in the elderly
   supporting studies in related constructs such as delay discounting and
   impulsivity. Further, the study shows that age-related prefrontal
   atrophy is associated with DoG performance. The findings are in line
   with concepts of ``willpower{''} that postulate a central role of
   frontostriatal connectivity in self-regulation and self-control.}},

Abstract = {{Novelty is often prioritized and detected automatically. It attracts
   attention-eliciting the orienting response. However, novelty is not a
   unitary concept, and the extent to which the orienting response is
   elicited depends on several factors. In the present study we
   investigated how stimulus novelty, deviance from the context, and
   complexity of the stimulus context contribute to the anterior N2 and
   novelty P3 event-related potential components, using the visual novelty
   oddball paradigm. In the first experiment the novelty P3 was drastically
   reduced when the stimulus context was complex compared with simple, and
   in a second experiment when novels were frequent rather than deviant. No
   such effect was found for the anterior N2, suggesting it is a function
   of stimulus characteristics, not deviance. In contrast, the novelty P3
   depended on deviance and contextual complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The anterior thalamic nuclei are vital for many spatial tasks. To
   determine more precisely their role, the present study modified the
   conventional Morris watermaze task. In each of 3 experiments, rats were
   repeatedly placed on a submerged platform in 1 corner (the `correct'
   corner) of either a rectangular pool (Experiment 1) or a square pool
   with walls of different appearances (Experiments 2 and 3). The rats were
   then released into the pool for a first test trial in the absence of the
   platform. In Experiment 1, normal rats distinguished the 2 sets of
   corners in the rectangular pool by their geometric properties,
   preferring the correct corner and its diagonally opposite partner.
   Anterior thalamic lesions severely impaired this discrimination. In
   Experiments 2 and 3, normal rats typically swam directly to the correct
   corner of the square pool on the first test trial. Rats with anterior
   thalamic lesions, however, often failed to initially select the correct
   corner, taking more time to reach that location. Nevertheless, the
   lesioned rats still showed a subsequent preference for the correct
   corner. The same lesioned rats also showed no deficits in Experiments 2
   and 3 when subsequently trained to swim to the correct corner over
   repeated trials. The findings show how the anterior thalamic nuclei
   contribute to multiple aspects of spatial processing. These thalamic
   nuclei may be required to distinguish relative dimensions (Experiment 1)
   as well as translate the appearance of spatial cues when viewed for the
   first time from different perspectives (Experiments 2, 3).}},

Abstract = {{Juveniles of many species engage in rough-and-tumble play behaviors, and
   these social encounters are important for the expression of typical
   social behaviors. Play is a highly motivated and rewarding behavior,
   which suggests that the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is likely
   important for reinforcing the behavior. Indeed, systemic dopamine
   receptor antagonists decrease the expression of play behaviors, but the
   specific dopaminergic networks important for play are not known. In this
   study, we examined immediate-early gene expression in specific
   dopaminergic cell groups after juvenile male and female rats played or
   did not play. Subjects were housed with a same-sex sibling, and
   spontaneous play behavior (or lack thereof) was observed for 1 hr.
   Brains were harvested and immunohistochemistry was used to localize Fos
   and tyrosine hydroxylase. Cells expressing both proteins were counted in
   midbrain and forebrain dopaminergic cell groups. Females that played had
   more double-labeled cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) than
   females that did not play, but there was no effect of play on
   double-labeled cell counts in any brain region in males. Furthermore,
   many measures of play in females were positively correlated with the
   number of double-labeled cells in the VTA, including play duration and
   pin duration. Our results suggest that play in females likely induces
   dopamine release from mesocorticolimbic neurons to reinforce play
   behaviors. Our results also highlight a sex difference in the neural
   networks mediating play, thus emphasizing the importance of studying the
   neurobiology of play in both males and females.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing a rat model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), ethanol
   was administered over postnatal days (PD) 4 to 9. As adults, control and
   ethanol rats underwent trace fear conditioning (TFC), in which a tone
   conditioned stimulus (CS) and footshock unconditioned stimulus (US) were
   repeatedly paired, though the two stimuli never overlapped in time.
   Following training in Experiment 1, conditioned fear (freezing) to the
   tone CS was dose-dependently reduced in ethanol rats relative to
   controls. Experiment 2 was designed to test whether the TFC deficit
   varied based on the duration of the trace interval (TI; time from CS
   offset to US onset). Holding the time separating CS onset from US onset
   constant at 20 sec, control and ethanol rats were trained with a 5 or 15
   sec tone CS, followed 15 or 5 sec later, respectively, by the US.
   Conditioned fear to the tone CS was significantly reduced in high dose
   ethanol rats trained with the 15 sec TI only. Acquisition and
   consolidation of trace fear memories relies on forebrain
   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) signaling, including the
   downstream phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2
   (pERK1/2). Separate rats were trained with the 5 or 15 sec TI and then
   sacrificed 1 hr later. Significant reductions in pERK1/2-positive
   neurons were seen in areas CA1 and CA3 of the dorsal hippocampus (DH)
   following training at both TIs in ethanol rats. The disruption of DH
   learning-dependent plasticity appears tied to freezing behavior in
   ethanol rats, but only when the training stimuli are separated by more
   than 5 sec.}},

Abstract = {{Endogenous opioids play an important role in prediction error during
   fear learning. However, the evidence for this role has been obtained
   almost exclusively using the species-specific defense response of
   freezing as the measure of learned fear. It is unknown whether opioid
   receptors regulate predictive fear learning when other measures of
   learned fear are used. Here, we used conditioned suppression as the
   measure of learned fear to assess the role of opioid receptors in fear
   learning. Experiment 1a studied associative blocking of fear learning.
   Rats in an experimental group received conditioned stimulus A (CSA) +
   training in Stage I and conditioned stimulus A and B (CSAB) + training
   in Stage II, whereas rats in a control group received only CSAB +
   training in Stage II. The prior fear conditioning of CSA blocked fear
   learning to conditioned stimulus B (CSB) in the experimental group. In
   Experiment 1b, naloxone (4 mg/kg) administered before Stage II prevented
   this blocking, thereby enabling normal fear learning to CSB. Experiment
   2a studied overexpectation of fear. Rats received CSA + training and CSB
   + training in Stage I, and then rats in the experimental group received
   CSAB + training in Stage II whereas control rats did not. The Stage II
   compound training of CSAB reduced fear to CSA and CSB on test. In
   Experiment 2b, naloxone (4 mg/kg) administered before Stage II prevented
   this overexpectation. These results show that opioid receptors regulate
   Pavlovian fear learning, augmenting learning in response to positive
   prediction error and impairing learning in response to negative
   prediction error, when fear is assessed via conditioned suppression.
   These effects are identical to those observed when freezing is used as
   the measure of learned fear. These findings show that the role for
   opioid receptors in regulating fear learning extends across multiple
   measures of learned fear.}},

Abstract = {{A pervasive finding in animal models of substance abuse is that
   associations form quickly between contexts and drugs of abuse, such as
   cocaine. Studies of conditioned place preference (CPP) demonstrate that
   animals approach cues previously paired with cocaine. This is a commonly
   used preparation, but the configuration of the CPP apparatus differs
   across laboratories. Two common apparatus configurations for CPP are one
   compartment (in which the animal has access to the entire apparatus and
   spatial cues are irrelevant) or two compartments (in which access is
   restricted to one half of the apparatus and spatial cues are relevant).
   We compared the effects of acquisition and extinction of cocaine-induced
   CPP as a function of configuration. During CPP acquisition, C57BL/6J
   mice received cocaine paired with one tactile floor (conditioned
   stimulus; CS+) and saline paired with the other (CS-). CS+ and CS-trials
   occurred on alternate days in one of three configurations:
   one-compartment (exposure to the entire apparatus during CS+ or CS-),
   two-compartment consistent position (exposure to CS+ or CS-in adjacent,
   spatially distinct compartments), or two-compartment alternating
   position (exposure to CS+ or CS-in adjacent compartments that alternated
   spatial locations across days). A stronger preference for the CS+ floor
   occurred in two-versus one-compartment groups, with the strongest
   preference observed when cocaine was paired with alternating chamber
   positions. In contrast, greater loss of preference occurred after
   extinction in a one-compartment procedure, regardless of one-or
   two-compartment acquisition history. These findings suggest that a
   two-compartment configuration facilitated acquisition but attenuated
   extinction of a cocaine-induced CPP. The use of different CPP
   configurations may distinguish the underlying substrates and relevant
   cues for acquisition and extinction processes in cocaine abuse.}},

Abstract = {{Here we present a novel approach to quickly and reliably find long (200
   ms 2 s) stereotyped sequences of sounds ({''}motifs{''}) in acoustic
   recordings of birdsong. Robust and time-efficient identification of such
   sequences is a crucial first step in many studies ranging from
   development to neuronal basis of motor behavior. Accurately identifying
   motifs is usually hindered by the presence of animal-intrinsic
   variability in execution and tempo, and by extrinsic acoustic noise (e.
   g., movement artifacts, ambient noise). The algorithm we describe in
   this report has been optimized to work in bird species that sing
   stereotyped syllable sequences (such as the zebra finch), and requires
   minimal user involvement (similar to 5 min for over 1,000 motifs).
   Importantly, it is transparent and robust to the choice of parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an effective treatment for
   depression, targets self-referential processing of emotional stimuli. We
   examined the effects of CBT on brain functioning during self-referential
   processing in depressive patients using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). Depressive patients (n = 23) and healthy participants (n
   = 15) underwent fMRI scans during a self-referential task using
   emotional trait words. The depressive patients had fMRI scans before and
   after completing a total of 12 weekly sessions of group CBT for
   depression, whereas the healthy participants underwent fMRI scans 12
   weeks apart with no intervention. Before undergoing CBT, the depressive
   patients showed hyperactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
   during self-referential processing of negative words. Following CBT,
   MPFC and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) activity during
   self-referential processing among depressive patients was increased for
   positive stimuli, whereas it was decreased for negative stimuli.
   Improvements in depressive symptoms were negatively correlated with vACC
   activity during self-referential processing of negative stimuli. These
   results suggest that CBT-related improvements in depressive symptoms are
   associated with changes in MPFC and vACC activation during
   self-referential processing of emotional stimuli.}},
