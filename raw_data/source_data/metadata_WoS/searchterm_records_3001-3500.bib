Abstract = {{One factor that influences the success of emotion regulation is the
   manner in which the regulated emotion was generated. Recent research has
   suggested that reappraisal, a top-down emotion regulation strategy, is
   more effective in decreasing self-reported negative affect when emotions
   were generated from the top-down, versus the bottom-up. On the basis of
   a process overlap framework, we hypothesized that the neural regions
   active during reappraisal would overlap more with emotions that were
   generated from the top-down, rather than from the bottom-up. In
   addition, we hypothesized that increased neural overlap between
   reappraisal and the history effects of top-down emotion generation would
   be associated with increased reappraisal success. The results of several
   analyses suggested that reappraisal and emotions that were generated
   from the top-down share a core network of prefrontal, temporal, and
   cingulate regions. This overlap is specific; no such overlap was
   observed between reappraisal and emotions that were generated in a
   bottom-up fashion. This network consists of regions previously
   implicated in linguistic processing, cognitive control, and
   self-relevant appraisals, which are processes thought to be crucial to
   both reappraisal and top-down emotion generation. Furthermore,
   individuals with high reappraisal success demonstrated greater neural
   overlap between reappraisal and the history of top-down emotion
   generation than did those with low reappraisal success. The overlap of
   these key regions, reflecting overlapping processes, provides an initial
   insight into the mechanism by which generation history may facilitate
   emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the neural systems that underpin reading acquisition is
   key if neuroscientific findings are to inform educational practice. We
   provide a unique window into these systems by teaching 19 adults to read
   24 novel words written in unfamiliar letters and to name 24 novel
   objects while in an MRI scanner. Behavioral performance on trained items
   was equivalent for the two stimulus types. However, componential
   letter-sound associations were extracted when learning to read, as shown
   by correct reading of untrained words, whereas object-name associations
   were holistic and arbitrary. Activity in bilateral anterior fusiform
   gyri was greater during object name learning than learning to read, and
   ROI analyses indicated that left mid-fusiform activity was predictive of
   success in object name learning but not in learning to read. In
   contrast, activity in bilateral parietal cortices was predictive of
   success for both stimulus types but was greater during learning and
   recall of written word pronunciations relative to object names. We argue
   that mid-to-anterior fusiform gyri preferentially process whole items
   and contribute to learning their spoken form associations, processes
   that are required for skilled reading. In contrast, parietal cortices
   preferentially process componential visual-verbal mappings, a process
   that is crucial for early reading development.}},

Abstract = {{Anticipating the sensorimotor consequences of an action for both self
   and other is fundamental for action coordination when individuals
   socially interact. Somatosensation constitutes an elementary component
   of social cognition and sensorimotor prediction, but its functions in
   active social behavior remain unclear. We hypothesized that the
   somatosensory system contributes to social haptic behavior as evidenced
   by specific anticipatory activation patterns when touching an animate
   target (human hand) compared with an inanimate target (fake hand). fMRI
   scanning was performed during a paradigm that allowed us to isolate the
   anticipatory representations of active interpersonal touch while
   controlling for nonsocial sensorimotor processes and possible confounds
   because of interpersonal relationships or socioemotional valence. Active
   interpersonal touch was studied both as skin-to-skin contact and as
   object-mediated touch. The results showed weaker deactivation in primary
   somatosensory cortex and medial pFC and stronger activation in
   cerebellum for the animate target, compared with the inanimate target,
   when intending to touch it with one's own hand. Differently, in
   anticipation of touching the human hand with an object, anterior
   inferior parietal lobule and lateral occipital-temporal cortex showed
   stronger activity. When actually touching a human hand with one's own
   hand, activation was stronger in medial pFC but weaker in primary
   somatosensory cortex. The findings provide new insight on the
   contribution of simulation and sensory prediction mechanisms to active
   social behavior. They also suggest that literally getting in touch with
   someone and touching someone by using an object might be approached by
   an agent as functionally distinct conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Measures of social competence are closely related to actual community
   functioning in patients with schizophrenia. However, the neurobiological
   mechanisms underlying competence in schizophrenia are not fully
   understood. We hypothesized that social deficits in schizophrenia are
   explained, at least in part, by abnormally lateralized patterns of brain
   activation in response to tasks engaging social cognition, as compared
   to healthy individuals. We predicted such patterns would be partly
   heritable, and therefore affected in patients nonpsychotic siblings as
   well. We used a functional magnetic resonance image paradigm to
   characterize brain activation induced by theory of mind tasks, and two
   tests of social competence, the Test of Adaptive Behavior in
   Schizophrenia (TABS), and the Social Skills Performance Assessment
   (SSPA) in siblings discordant for schizophrenia and comparable healthy
   controls (n = 14 per group). Healthy individuals showed the strongest
   correlation between social competence and activation of right hemisphere
   structures involved in social cognitive processing, whereas in patients,
   the correlation pattern was lateralized to left hemisphere areas.
   Unaffected siblings of patients exhibited a pattern intermediate between
   the other groups. These results support the hypothesis that
   schizophrenia may be characterized by an abnormal functioning of
   nondominant hemisphere structures involved in the processing of socially
   salient information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Amphetamine sensitisation (AS) is an established animal model of the
   hypersensitivity to psychostimulants seen in patients with
   schizophrenia. AS also models the dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine
   signalling which has been implicated in the development of psychotic
   symptoms. Recent data suggest that the enhanced excitability of
   mesolimbic dopamine neurons in AS is driven by a hyperactivity of
   hippocampal (subiculum) neurons, consistent with a strong association
   between hippocampal dysfunction and schizophrenia. While AS can be
   modelled in human volunteers, its functional consequences on
   dopaminoceptive brain regions (i.e. striatum and hippocampus) remains
   unclear. Here we describe the effects of a sensitising dosage pattern of
   dextroamphetamine on the neural correlates of motor sequence learning in
   healthy volunteers, within a randomised, double-blind, parallel-groups
   design. Behaviourally, sensitisation was characterised by enhanced
   subjective responses to amphetamine but did not change performance (i.e.
   learning rate) during an explicit sequence learning task. In contrast,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements showed that
   repeated intermittent amphetamine exposure was associated with increased
   blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal within the medial temporal
   lobe (MTL) (subiculum/entorhinal cortex) and midbrain, in the vicinity
   of the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) during sequence
   encoding. Importantly, MTL hyperactivity correlated with the
   sensitisation of amphetamine-induced attentiveness. The MTL-midbrain
   hyperactivity reported here mirrors observations in sensitised rodents
   and is consistent with contemporary models of schizophrenia and
   behavioural sensitisation. These findings of meso-hippocampal
   hyperactivity during AS thus link pathophysiological concepts of
   dopamine dysregulation to cognitive models of psychosis.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation is important for learning and cognition. Although
   dopaminergic (D2) transmission in the ventral striatum (VS) is
   associated with motivation, learning, and cognition are more strongly
   associated with function of the dorsal striatum, including activation in
   the caudate nucleus. A recent study found an interaction between
   intrinsic motivation and the DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphism (rs1800497),
   suggesting that A-carriers of rs1800497 are significantly more sensitive
   to motivation in order to improve during working memory (WM) training.
   Using data from the two large-scale imaging genetic data sets, IMAGEN (n
   = 1080, age 13-15 years) and BrainChild (n 300, age 6-27), we
   investigated whether rs 1800497 is associated with WM. In the IMAGEN
   data set, we tested whether VS/caudate activation during reward
   anticipation was associated with WM performance and whether rs1800497
   and VS/caudate activation interact to affect WM performance. We found
   that rs1800497 was associated with WM performance in IMAGEN and
   BrainChild. Higher VS and caudate activation during reward processing
   were significantly associated with higher WM performance (p < 0.0001).
   An interaction was found between the DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphism rs 1800497
   and VS activation during reward anticipation on WM (p < 0.01), such that
   carriers of the minor allele (A) showed a significant correlation
   between VS activation and WM, whereas the GG-homozygotes did not,
   suggesting that the effect of VS BOLD on WM is modified by
   inter-individual genetic differences related to D2 dopaminergic
   transmission.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline personality (BPD) disorder share
   clinical features such as emotional lability and poor interpersonal
   functioning but the course of illness and treatment differs in these
   groups, which suggests that the underlying neurobiology of BD and BPD is
   likely to be different. Understanding the neural mechanisms behind the
   pathophysiology of BD and BPD will facilitate accurate diagnosis and
   inform the administration of targeted treatment.
   Since deficits in social cognition or emotion regulation or in the
   self-referential processing system can give rise to these clinical
   features, and impairment in these domains have been observed in both
   patient groups, functional connectivity within and between networks
   subserving these processes during resting was investigated using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Data were acquired from 16
   patients with BD, 14 patients with BPD, and 13 healthy controls (HC) and
   functional connectivity strength was correlated with scores using the
   Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale.
   Functional network connectivity (FNC) patterns differentiated BD and BPD
   patients from HC. In BD, FNC was increased while in BPD it was
   decreased. In BD impaired FNC was evident primarily among networks
   involved in self-referential processing while in BPD it also involved
   the emotion regulatory network. Impaired FNC displayed an association
   with impulsivity in BPD and emotional clarity and emotional awareness in
   BD.
   This study shows that BD and BPD can perhaps be differentiated using
   resting state FNC approach and that the neural mechanisms underpinning
   overlapping symptoms discernibly differ between the groups. These
   findings provide a potential platform for elucidating the targeted
   effects of psychological interventions in both disorders. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Coordinated triadic interactions, involving oneself, another person, and
   an external object, are considered uniquely human skilL However, the
   exact mechanisms underlying the ability to engage in such social
   interactiom remain hitherto unknown. We used functional neuroimaging to
   investigate the neural signature of triadic interactions. For this
   purpose, participants viewed pictures of objects in a 3 T functional
   magnetic resonanceLmagint, scanner and were asked whether they could
   imagine this object in a social interaction with another person. We also
   aimed to dissociate this process from, as well as to find commonalities
   with, purely self-referential or otherreferential processing In all
   trial-types, we found activations in core mentalizing brain areas
   (medial prefronti cortex, posterior Ungulate cortex, precuneus and
   temporoparietal junction). Furthermore, triadic engagements but not
   self-referential or other-referential processing were associated with
   activations in classical mirror neuron areas (inferior frontal gyrus and
   inferior parietal lobe). Finally, mentalizing networks showed a strong
   functional connectivity with mirror neuron areas exclusively during
   triadic engagements. These results suggest that the imagined interaction
   of two agents is processed in a more complex neural social cognitive
   network than purely self- or other-referential considerations. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Effective adaptive behavior rests on an appropriate understanding of how
   much responsibility we have over outcomes in the environment. This
   attribution of agency to ourselves or to an external event influences
   our behavioral and affective response to the outcomes. Despite its
   special importance to understanding human motivation and affect, the
   neural mechanisms involved in self-attributed rewards and punishments
   remain unclear. Previous evidence implicates the anterior insula (AI) in
   evaluating the consequences of our own actions. However, it is unclear
   if the AI has a general role in feedback evaluation (positive and
   negative) or plays a specific role during error processing. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and a motion prediction task, we
   investigate neural responses to self-and externally attributed monetary
   gains and losses. We found that attribution effects vary according to
   the valence of feedback: significant valence 3 attribution interactions
   in the right AI, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the midbrain, and
   the right ventral putamen. Self-attributed losses were associated with
   increased activity in the midbrain, the ACC and the right AI, and
   negative BOLD response in the ventral putamen. However, higher BOLD
   activity to self-attributed feedback (losses and gains) was observed in
   the left AI, the thalamus, and the cerebellar vermis. These results
   suggest a functional lateralization of the AI. The right AI, together
   with the midbrain and the ACC, is mainly involved in processing the
   salience of the outcome, whereas the left is part of a
   cerebello-thalamic-cortical pathway involved in cognitive control
   processes important for subsequent behavioral adaptations. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is the prototypical sex-specific
   disorder in which symptom onset and offset require a particular hormonal
   milieu and for which there is moderate heritability. The present study
   investigated brain emotion processing in PMDD and healthy controls, as
   well as functional polymorphisms in two candidate genes for PMDD, the
   serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and brain derived neurotrophic factor
   (BDNF). The 5-HTT linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and BDNF Val66Met
   polymorphisms were genotyped in 31 patients with PMDD and 31 healthy
   controls. A subset of 16 patients and 15 controls participated in two
   functional magnetic resonance imaging-sessions performing an emotion
   processing task; once in the mid-follicular, and once in the late luteal
   phase which corresponds with maximum severity of mood symptoms.
   Genotypes were not directly associated with PMDD. A main effect of group
   was found in the whole brain analysis, with patients having lower
   activation of the pre-genual anterior cingulate and ventro-medial
   prefrontal cortex, independent of menstrual cycle phase. Post-hoc
   functional ROI analyses in the fronto-cingulate cluster showed no effect
   of 5-HTTLPR genotype but a genotype-by-group-by-phase interaction effect
   of BDNF Val66Met. Women with PMDD who were carriers of the Met-allele
   had lower fronto-cingulate cortex activation in the luteal phase
   compared to Met-allele carrying controls. The results provide suggestive
   evidence of impaired emotion-induced fronto-cingulate cortex activation
   in PMDD patients. Although limited by a small sample, the potential
   influence of BDNF Val66Met in PMDD is in line with preclinical findings.

   the treatment of stress-related disorders. However, recently it has been
   shown that OXT can have anxiogenic effects as well. In the present
   study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan the brains
   of 60 healthy men while they were exposed to social stress after they
   received either intranasal OXT (24 IU) or placebo treatment. Although
   OXT administration did not alter salivary cortisol levels as a surrogate
   marker of stress axis activity, our participants initially reported an
   increment in perceived social stress. This behavioral effect was
   paralleled on the neural level by increased activity in the precuneus
   and cingulate cortex. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis
   that OXT can induce a self-referential processing bias which facilitates
   the sensation of social stress in the absence of altered endocrine
   responses. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The posterior midline region (PMR)-considered a core of the default mode
   network-is deactivated during successful performance in different
   cognitive tasks. The extent of PMR-deactivations is correlated with
   task-demands and associated with successful performance in various
   cognitive domains. In the domain of episodic memory, functional MRI
   (fMRI) studies found that PMR-deactivations reliably predict learning
   (successful encoding). Yet it is unclear what explains this relation.
   One intriguing possibility is that PMR-deactivations are partially
   mediated by respiratory artifacts. There is evidence that the fMRI
   signal in PMR is particularly prone to respiratory artifacts, because of
   its large surrounding blood vessels. As respiratory fluctuations have
   been shown to track changes in attention, it is critical for the general
   interpretation of fMRI results to clarify the relation between
   respiratory fluctuations, cognitive performance, and fMRI signal. Here,
   we investigated this issue by measuring respiration during word
   encoding, together with a breath-holding condition during fMRI-scanning.
   Stimulus-locked respiratory analyses showed that respiratory
   fluctuations predicted successful encoding via a respiratory
   phase-locking mechanism. At the same time, the fMRI analyses showed that
   PMR-deactivations associated with learning were reduced during
   breath-holding and correlated with individual differences in the
   respiratory phase-locking effect during normal breathing. A left frontal
   region-used as a control region-did not show these effects. These
   findings indicate that respiration is a critical factor in explaining
   the link between PMR-deactivation and successful cognitive performance.
   Further research is necessary to demonstrate whether our findings are
   restricted to episodic memory encoding, or also extend to other
   cognitive domains. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Facial color is important information for social communication as it
   provides important clues to recognize a person's emotion and health
   condition. Our previous EEG study suggested that N170 at the left
   occipito-temporal site is related to facial color processing (Nakajima
   et al., {[}2012]: Neuropsychologia 50:2499-2505). However, because of
   the low spatial resolution of EEG experiment, the brain region is
   involved in facial color processing remains controversial. In the
   present study, we examined the neural substrates of facial color
   processing using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We
   measured brain activity from 25 subjects during the presentation of
   natural-and bluish-colored face and their scrambled images. The
   bilateral fusiform face (FFA) area and occipital face area (OFA) were
   localized by the contrast of natural-colored faces versus
   natural-colored scrambled images. Moreover, region of interest (ROI)
   analysis showed that the left FFA was sensitive to facial color, whereas
   the right FFA and the right and left OFA were insensitive to facial
   color. In combination with our previous EEG results, these data suggest
   that the left FFA may play an important role in facial color processing.

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is a disabling psychiatric disorder that usually begins to
   affect individuals during their adolescence or early adulthood and most
   patients continue to suffer social, economic, and psychological
   difficulties from the very onset of the disorder. The neurobiology of
   the disorder comprises of changes in the brain that can be detected
   using MR imaging. Focus on the morphological changes in patients with
   first episode schizophrenia limits the confounding effect of factors
   such as long-term medication or progression. Therefore, the detected
   abnormalities are more likely to indicate the primary pathology and the
   existence of such changes provides the opportunity of applying them for
   subject recognition based on brain imaging.
   This paper presents a combination of methods pertaining to automated
   whole-brain morphometry of MR images and the methods of supervised
   learning. The designed recognition procedure is successfully used here
   for classification of 104 subjects into groups of patients and healthy
   volunteers with the use of k-NM and SVM classifiers. The same algorithm
   is further used for distinguishing between patients who responded well
   to treatment and those who did not show adequate symptomatic relief. (C)

Abstract = {{Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum
   Disorder (ASD) are often comorbid and share cognitive abnormalities in
   temporal foresight. A key question is whether shared cognitive
   phenotypes are based on common or different underlying pathophysiologies
   and whether comorbid patients have, additive neurofunctional deficits,
   resemble one of the disorders or have a different pathophysiology. We
   compared age- and IQ-matched boys with non-comorbid ADHD (18),
   non-comorbid ASD (15), comorbid ADHD and ASD (13) and healthy controls
   (18) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a
   temporal discounting task. Only the ASD and the comorbid groups
   discounted delayed rewards more steeply. The fMRI data showed both
   shared and disorder-specific abnormalities in the three groups relative
   to controls in their brain-behaviour associations. The comorbid group
   showed both unique and more severe brain-discounting associations than
   controls and the non-comorbid patient groups in temporal discounting
   areas of ventromedial and lateral prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum
   and anterior cingulate, suggesting that comorbidity is neither an
   endophenocopy of the two pure disorders nor an additive pathology. (C)

Abstract = {{Our personal values are subject to forces of social influence.
   Deontological resolve captures how strongly one relies on absolute rules
   of right and wrong in the representation of one's personal values and
   may predict willingness to modify one's values in the presence of social
   influence. Using fMRI, we found that a neurobiological metric for
   deontological resolve based on relative activity in the ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) during the passive processing of sacred values
   predicted individual differences in conformity. Individuals with
   stronger deontological resolve, as measured by greater VLPFC activity,
   displayed lower levels of conformity. We also tested whether
   responsiveness to social reward, as measured by ventral striatal
   activity during social feedback, predicted variability in conformist
   behavior across individuals but found no significant relationship. From
   these results we conclude that unwillingness to conform to others'
   values is associated with a strong neurobiological representation of
   social rules.}},

   results. For example, in functional neuroanatomical studies, the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) has often been implicated as a critical neural
   substrate. However, results in electrophysiological (EEG) studies have
   been inconsistent as to the role of the PFC. EEG results have more often
   implicated widespread alpha synchronization, particularly in posterior
   regions, in creative cognition. Recent fMRI evidence has indicated that
   the PFC may be activated as a part of and together with other components
   of a deliberate control brain network. Controlled processing is
   neurologically dissociated from, but may co-occur with, spontaneous
   cognition mediated by a subset of the default-mode network (e.g., the
   angular gyms {[}BA 39] in the posterior parietal cortex, which has been
   increasingly implicated in creative cognition). When the demand for
   controlled processing is substantially increased, default-mode
   processing may be suppressed. There is now preliminary evidence to
   suggest an association between alpha synchronization and default-mode
   processing. Creative cognition likely emerges from an optimal balance
   between spontaneous processing and controlled processing.}},

Abstract = {{If someone causes you harm, your affective reaction to that person might
   be profoundly influenced by your inferences about the intentionality of
   their actions. In the present study, we aimed to understand how
   affective responses to a biologically salient aversive outcome
   administered by others are modulated by the extent to which a given
   individual is judged to have deliberately or inadvertently delivered the
   outcome. Using fMRI, we examined how neural responses to anticipation
   and receipt of an aversive stimulus are modulated by this fundamental
   social judgment. We found that affective evaluations about an individual
   whose actions led to either noxious or neutral consequences for the
   subject did indeed depend on the perceived intentions of that
   individual. At the neural level, activity in the anterior insula
   correlated with the interaction between perceived intentionality and
   anticipated outcome valence, suggesting that this region reflects the
   influence of mental state attribution on aversive expectations}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that the difference between
   resting-state brain activations depends on whether the subject was eyes
   open (EO) or eyes closed (EC). However, whether the spontaneous
   fluctuations are directly related to these two different resting states
   are still largely unclear. In the present study, we acquired
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 24 healthy
   subjects (11 males, 20.17 +/- 2.74 years) under the EO and EC states.
   The amplitude of the spontaneous brain activity in low-frequency band
   was subsequently investigated by using the metric of fractional
   amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF) for each subject under
   each state. A support vector machine (SVM) analysis was then applied to
   evaluate whether the category of resting states could be determined from
   the brain spontaneous fluctuations. We demonstrated that these two
   resting states could be decoded from the identified pattern of brain
   spontaneous fluctuations, predominantly based on fALFF in the
   sensorimotor module. Specifically, we observed prominent relationships
   between increased fALFF for EC and decreased fALFF for EO in
   sensorimotor regions. Overall, the present results indicate that a SVM
   performs well in the discrimination between the brain spontaneous
   fluctuations of distinct resting states and provide new insight into the
   neural substrate of the resting states during EC and EO.}},

Title = {{Moderate threat causes longer lasting disruption to processing in
   anxious individuals}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{Anxiety is associated with increased attentional capture by threat.
   Previous studies have used simultaneous or briefly separated (<1 s)
   presentation of threat distractors and target stimuli. Here, we tested
   the hypothesis that high trait anxious participants would show a longer
   time window within which distractors cause disruption to subsequent task
   processing, and that this would particularly be observed for stimuli of
   moderate or ambiguous threat value. A novel temporally separated
   emotional distractor task was used. Face or house distractors were
   presented for 250 ms at short (similar to 1.6 s) or long (similar to 3
   s) intervals prior to a letter string comprising Xs or Ns. Trait anxiety
   was associated with slowed identification of letter strings presented at
   long intervals after face distractors with part surprise/part fear
   expressions. In other words, these distractors had an impact on high
   anxious individuals' speed of target identification seconds after their
   offset. This was associated with increased activity in the fusiform
   gyrus and amygdala and reduced dorsal anterior cingulate recruitment.
   This pattern of activity may reflect impoverished recruitment of
   reactive control mechanisms to damp down stimulus-specific processing in
   subcortical and higher visual regions. These findings have implications
   for understanding how threat-related attentional biases in anxiety may
   lead to dysfunction in everyday settings where stimuli of moderate,
   potentially ambiguous, threat value such as those used here are fairly
   common, and where attentional disruption lasting several seconds may
   have a profound impact.}},

Volume = {{76}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous research suggests that testosterone (T) plays a key
   role in shaping competitive and aggressive behavior in humans, possibly
   by modulating threat-related neural circuitry. However, this research
   has been limited by the use of T augmentation that fails to account for
   baseline differences and has been conducted exclusively in women. Thus,
   the extent to which normal physiologic concentrations of T affect
   threat-related brain function in men remains unknown.
   Methods: In the current study, we use a novel two-step pharmacologic
   challenge protocol to overcome these limitations and to evaluate causal
   modulation of threat-and aggression-related neural circuits by T in
   healthy young men (n = 16). First, we controlled for baseline
   differences in T through administration of a gonadotropin releasing
   hormone antagonist. Once a common baseline was established across
   participants, we then administered T to within the normal physiologic
   range. During this second step of the protocol we acquired functional
   neuroimaging data to examine the impact of T augmentation on neural
   circuitry supporting threat and aggression.
   Results: Gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonism successfully reduced
   circulating concentrations of T and brought subjects to a common
   baseline. Administration of T rapidly increased circulating T
   concentrations and was associated with heightened reactivity of the
   amygdala, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal grey to angry facial
   expressions.
   Conclusions: These findings provide novel causal evidence that T rapidly
   potentiates the response of neural circuits mediating threat processing
   and aggressive behavior in men.}},

Abstract = {{Many powerful human emotional thoughts are generated in the absence of a
   precipitating event in the environment. Here, we tested whether we can
   decode the valence of internally driven, self-generated thoughts during
   task-free rest based on neural similarities with task-related affective
   mental states. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   data while participants generated positive and negative thoughts as part
   of an attribution task (Session A) and while they reported the
   occurrence of comparable mental states during task-free rest periods
   (Session B). With the use of multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA), we
   identified response patterns in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC)
   that encode the affective content of thoughts that are generated in
   response to an external experimental cue. Importantly, these task driven
   response patterns reliably predicted the occurrence of affective
   thoughts generated during unconstrained rest periods recorded one week
   apart. This demonstrates that at least certain elements of task-cued and
   task-free affective experiences rely on a common neural code.
   Furthermore, our findings reveal the role that the mOFC plays in
   determining the affective tone of unconstrained thoughts. More
   generally, our results suggest that MVPA is an important methodological
   tool for attempts to understand unguided subject driven mental states
   such as mind-wandering and daydreaming based on neural similarities with
   task-based experiences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There remains much unknown about how large-scale neural networks
   accommodate neurological disruption, such as moderate and severe
   traumatic brain injury (TBI). A primary goal in this study was to
   examine the alterations in network topology occurring during the first
   year of recovery following TBI. To do so we examined 21 individuals with
   moderate and severe TBI at 3 and 6 months after resolution of
   posttraumatic amnesia and 15 age- and education-matched healthy adults
   using functional MRI and graph theoretical analyses. There were two
   central hypotheses in this study: 1) physical disruption results in
   increased functional connectivity, or hyperconnectivity, and 2)
   hyperconnectivity occurs in regions typically observed to be the most
   highly connected cortical hubs, or the ``rich club{''}. The current
   findings generally support the hyperconnectivity hypothesis showing that
   during the first year of recovery after TBI, neural networks show
   increased connectivity, and this change is disproportionately
   represented in brain regions belonging to the brain's core subnetworks.
   The selective increases in connectivity observed here are consistent
   with the preferential attachment model underlying scale-free network
   development. This study is the largest of its kind and provides the
   unique opportunity to examine how neural systems adapt to significant
   neurological disruption during the first year after injury.}},

Title = {{Fairness Norms and Theory of Mind in an Ultimatum Game: Judgments,

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity to fairness undergoes relevant changes across
   development. Whether such changes depend on primary inequity aversion or
   on sensitivity to a social norm of fairness is still debated. Using a
   modified version of the Ultimatum Game that creates informational
   asymmetries between Proposer and Responder, a previous study showed that
   both perceptions of fairness and fair behavior depend upon normative
   expectations, i.e., beliefs about what others expect one should do in a
   specific situation. Individuals tend to comply with the norm when
   risking sanctions, but disregard the norm when violations are
   undetectable. Using the same methodology with children aged 8-10 years,
   the present study shows that children's beliefs and behaviors differ
   from what is observed in adults. Playing as Proposers, children show a
   self-serving bias only when there is a clear informational asymmetry.
   Playing as Responders, they show a remarkable discrepancy between their
   normative judgment about fair procedures (a coin toss to determine the
   offer) and their behavior (rejection of an unfair offer derived from the
   coin toss), supporting the existence of an outcome bias effect. Finally,
   our results reveal no influence of theory of mind on children's
   decision-making behavior.}},

Title = {{An evaluation of traffic-awareness campaign videos: empathy induction is
   associated with brain function within superior temporal sulcus}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Acting appropriately within social contexts requires an ability to
   appreciate others' mental and emotional states. Indeed, some campaign
   programs designed to reduce anti-social behaviour seek to elicit empathy
   for the victims. The effectiveness of these campaigns can be evaluated
   according to the degree to which they induce such responses, but by
   applying neuroscientific techniques this can be done at the behavioural
   and neurophysiological level. Neuroimaging studies aimed at identifying
   the neural mechanisms behind such socio-cognitive and -emotional
   processes frequently reveal the role of the superior temporal sulcus
   (STS). We applied this knowledge to assess the effectiveness of
   traffic-awareness campaign adverts to induce empathic expression.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 20
   healthy male volunteers as they watched these campaign videos consisting
   of a dramatic sequence of events and catastrophic endings, and control
   videos without such dramatic endings. Among other structures, a
   significantly greater neural response was observed within bilateral STS,
   particularly within the right hemisphere, during the observation of
   campaign relative to control videos. Furthermore, activation in these
   brain regions correlated with the subjects' empathic expression. Our
   results develop our understanding of the role of STS in social
   cognition. Moreover, our data demonstrate the utility of neuroscientific
   methods when evaluating the effectiveness of campaign videos in terms of
   their ability to elicit empathic responses. Our study also demonstrates
   the utility of these specific stimuli for future neuroscientific
   research.}},

Title = {{Alterations of regional homogeneity in pediatric bipolar depression: a
   resting-state fMRI study}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) has attracted increasing
   attentions due to its high prevalence and great influence on social
   functions of children and adolescents. However, the pathophysiology
   underlying PBD remains unclear. In the present study, the resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to detect
   abnormalities of baseline brain functions in depressed PBD youth.
   Methods: Seventeen youth with PBD-depression aged 10 - 18 years old and
   18 age- and sex-matched normal controls were recruited in this study.
   The fMRI data under resting state were obtained on a Siemens 3.0 Tesla
   scanner and were analyzed using the regional homogeneity (ReHo) method.
   Correlations between the ReHo values of each survived area and the
   severity of depression symptoms in patients were further analyzed.
   Results: As compared with the control group, PBD-depression patients
   showed decreased ReHo in the medial frontal gyrus, bilateral middle
   frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, and the right putamen.
   Significant negative correlations of the mood and feelings questionnaire
   scores with mean ReHo values in the medial frontal gyrus and the right
   middle frontal gyrus in PBD-depression patients were observed.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that extensive regions with altered
   baseline brain activities are existed in PBD-depression and these brain
   regions mainly locate in the fronto-limbic circuit and associated
   striatal structures. Moreover, the present findings also add to our
   understanding that there could be unique neuropathophysiological
   mechanisms underlying PBD-depression.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research shows that the amygdala automatically responds to a
   face's trustworthiness when a face is clearly visible. However, it is
   unclear whether the amygdala could evaluate such high-level facial
   information without a face being consciously perceived. Using a backward
   masking paradigm, we demonstrate in two functional neuroimaging
   experiments that the human amygdala is sensitive to subliminal variation
   in facial trustworthiness. Regions in the amygdala tracked how
   untrustworthy a face appeared (i.e., negative-linear responses) as well
   as the overall strength of a face's trustworthiness signal (i.e.,
   nonlinear responses), despite faces not being subjectively seen. This
   tracking was robust across blocked and event-related designs and both
   real and computer-generated faces. The findings demonstrate that the
   amygdala can be influenced by even high-level facial information before
   that information is consciously perceived, suggesting that the
   amygdala's processing of social cues in the absence of awareness may be
   more extensive than previously described.}},

Abstract = {{Two sets of brain areas are repeatedly reported in neuroimaging studies
   on social cognition: the Mirror Neuron System and the Mentalizing
   System. The Mirror System is involved in goal understanding and has been
   associated with several emotional and cognitive functions central to
   social interaction, ranging from empathy to gestural communication and
   imitation. The Mentalizing System is recruited in tasks requiring
   cognitive processes such as self-reference and understanding of other's
   intentions. Although theoretical accounts for an interaction between the
   two systems have been proposed, little is known about their synergy
   during social exchanges. In order to explore this question, we have
   recorded brain activity by means of functional MRI during live social
   exchanges based on reciprocal imitation of hand gestures. Here, we
   investigate, using the method of psychophysiological interaction, the
   changes in functional connectivity of the Mirror System due to the
   conditions of interest (being imitated, imitating) compared with passive
   observation of hand gestures. We report a strong coupling between the
   Mirror System and the Mentalizing System during the imitative exchanges.
   Our findings suggest a complementary role of the two networks during
   social encounters. The Mirror System would engage in the preparation of
   own actions and the simulation of other's actions, while the Mentalizing
   System would engage in the anticipation of the other's intention and
   thus would participate to the co-regulation of reciprocal actions.
   Beyond a specific effect of imitation, the design used offers the
   opportunity to tackle the role of role-switching in an interpersonal
   account of social cognition.}},

Title = {{Dysfunctional dopaminergic neurotransmission in asocial BTBR mice}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental conditions
   characterized by pronounced social and communication deficits and
   stereotyped behaviours. Recent psychosocial and neuroimaging studies
   have highlighted reward-processing deficits and reduced dopamine (DA)
   mesolimbic circuit reactivity in ASD patients. However, the
   neurobiological and molecular determinants of these deficits remain
   undetermined. Mouse models recapitulating ASD-like phenotypes could help
   generate hypotheses about the origin and neurophysiological
   underpinnings of clinically relevant traits. Here we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), behavioural and molecular readouts to
   probe dopamine neurotransmission responsivity in BTBR T+ Itpr3(tf)/J
   mice (BTBR), an inbred mouse line widely used to model ASD-like symptoms
   owing to its robust social and communication deficits, and high level of
   repetitive stereotyped behaviours. C57BL/6J (B6) mice were used as
   normosocial reference comparators. DA reuptake inhibition with GBR 12909
   produced significant striatal DA release in both strains, but failed to
   elicit fMRI activation in widespread forebrain areas of BTBR mice,
   including mesolimbic reward and striatal terminals. In addition, BTBR
   mice exhibited no appreciable motor responses to GBR 12909. DA D1
   receptor-dependent behavioural and signalling responses were found to be
   unaltered in BTBR mice, whereas dramatic reductions in pre-and
   postsynaptic DA D2 and adenosine A2A receptor function was observed in
   these animals. Overall these results document profoundly compromised DA
   D2-mediated neurotransmission in BTBR mice, a finding that is likely to
   have a role in the distinctive social and behavioural deficits exhibited
   by these mice. Our results call for a deeper investigation of the role
   of dopaminergic dysfunction in mouse lines exhibiting ASD-like
   phenotypes, and possibly in ASD patient populations.}},

Abstract = {{Disengagement of emotion regulation circuits was previously shown in
   depressed mothers and was hypothesized to underlie the impaired
   maternal-infant sensitivity described in postpartum depression (PPD). We
   hypothesized similarly reduced resting-state functional connectivity in
   default mode network (DMN) regions involved in social cognition in PPD.
   Resting-state functional MRI, clinical and mother-infant attachment data
   were obtained from 14 unmedicated postpartum women with major depression
   and 23 healthy postpartum women. Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) time
   series were extracted, filtered between 0.007 and 0.08 Hz and used as
   regressors in a whole brain general linear model analysis. PCC-right
   amygdala connectivity was significantly disrupted in depressed compared
   to healthy mothers for low-frequency neural activity, showing a negative
   (inverse) coupling in the depressed group but not in the controls.
   PCC-right amygdala connectivity was positively correlated with
   PCC-parahippocampus connectivity. Resting connectivity patterns of
   positive co-activations in postpartum women mirrored the canonical DMN.
   These findings of reduced PCC-amygdala coupling raise the possibility
   that PPD might involve the disruption of outward, preventative aspects
   of self-relevant thought and theory of mind/empathy processes. Further
   integrated studies of neural connectivity and these cognitive/behavioral
   dimensions are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The human mirror system has been the subject of much research over the
   past two decades, but little is known about the timecourse of mirror
   responses. In addition, it is unclear whether mirror and counter-mirror
   effects follow the same timecourse. We used single-pulse transcranial
   magnetic stimulation to investigate the timecourse of mirror and
   counter-mirror responses in the human brain. Experiment 1 demonstrated
   that mirror responses can be measured from around 200 ms after observed
   action onset. Experiment 2 demonstrated significant effects of
   counter-mirror sensorimotor training at all timepoints at which a mirror
   response was found in Experiment 1 (i.e. from 200 ms onward), indicating
   that mirror and counter-mirror responses follow the same timecourse. By
   suggesting similarly direct routes for mirror and counter-mirror
   responses, these results support the associative account of mirror
   neuron origins whereby mirror responses arise as a result of correlated
   sensorimotor experience during development. More generally, they
   contribute to theorizing regarding mirror neuron function by providing
   some constraints on how quickly mirror responses can influence social
   cognition.}},

Abstract = {{While abnormal processing of performance feedback has been associated
   with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), neural responses to different
   kinds of feedback information, especially to ambiguous feedback are
   widely unknown. Using fMRI and a performance adaptive time-estimation
   task, we acquired blood oxygenation level-dependant responses and
   emotional ratings to positive, negative and ambiguous performance
   feedback in patients and healthy controls. Negative and ambiguous
   feedback led to increased levels of anxiety, guilt and shame in
   patients. Both negative and ambiguous feedback, as compared to positive
   feedback, induced increased activation of the insular cortex in
   patients. Furthermore, patients showed no differential activation to
   negative feedback in the putamen and to ambiguous feedback in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). Finally, negative feedback
   induced increased activation in the midcingulate cortex in patients
   compared to controls. Findings indicate that both negative and ambiguous
   performance feedbacks are associated with abnormal negative emotions and
   altered brain activation, in particular increased insula activation,
   while activation in the putamen and VMPFC does not differentiate between
   feedback types in OCD patients. This suggests a parallel pattern of
   increased and decreased neural sensitivity to different kinds of
   feedback information and a general emotional hyperresponsivity to
   negative and ambiguous performance feedback in OCD.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research on classical fear-conditioning in the anxiety disorders
   has identified overgeneralization of conditioned fear as an important
   conditioning correlate of anxiety pathology. Unfortunately, only one
   human neuroimaging study of classically conditioned fear generalization
   has been conducted, and the neural substrates of this clinically germane
   process remain largely unknown. The current generalization study employs
   a clinically validated generalization gradient paradigm, modified for
   the fMRI environment, to identify neural substrates of classically
   conditioned generalization that may function aberrantly in clinical
   anxiety. Stimuli include five rings of gradually increasing size with
   extreme sizes serving as cues of conditioned danger (CS+) and safety
   (CS-). The three intermediately sized rings serve as generalization
   stimuli (GSs) and create a continuum-of-size from CS+ to CS-. Results
   demonstrate `positive' generalization gradients, reflected by declines
   in responding as the presented stimulus differentiates from CS+, in
   bilateral anterior insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and bilateral
   inferior parietal lobule. Conversely, `negative' gradients, reflected by
   inclines in responding as the presented stimulus differentiates from CS+
   were instantiated in bilateral ventral hippocampus, ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and precuneus cortex. These results as well as those
   from connectivity analyses are discussed in relation to a working
   neurobiology of conditioned generalization centered on the hippocampus.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between belief in free will (BFW) and third-party
   punishment (TPP) of criminal norm violations has been the subject of
   great debate among philosophers, criminologists and neuroscientists. We
   combined a TPP task with functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   investigate how lay people's BFW might affect their punishment of
   hypothetical criminal offenses varying in affective content. Our results
   revealed that people with strong BFW punished more harshly than people
   with weak BFW, but only in low affective cases, likely driven by a more
   robust commitment to moral responsibility. This effect was mirrored by a
   stronger activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, a region
   presumably involved in attentional selection to salient stimuli and
   attribution of temporary intentions and beliefs of others. But, for high
   affective cases, the BFW-based behavioral and neural differences
   disappeared. Both groups similarly punished high affective cases and
   showed higher activation in the right insula. The right insula is
   typically activated during aversive interoceptive-emotional processing
   for extreme norm violations. Our results demonstrated that the impact of
   BFW on TPP is context-dependent; perhaps explaining in part why the
   philosophical debate between free will and determinism is so stubbornly
   persistent.}},

Abstract = {{People feel bad for inflicting harms upon others; this emotional state
   is termed interpersonal guilt. In this study, the participant played
   multiple rounds of a dot-estimation task with anonymous partners while
   undergoing fMRI. The partner would receive pain stimulation if the
   partner or the participant or both responded incorrectly; the
   participant was then given the option to intervene and bear a proportion
   of pain for the partner. The level of pain voluntarily taken and the
   activations in anterior middle cingulate cortex (aMCC) and bilateral
   anterior insula (AI) were higher when the participant was solely
   responsible for the stimulation (Self\_Incorrect) than when both
   committed an error (Both\_Incorrect). Moreover, the gray matter volume
   in the aMCC predicted the individual's compensation behavior, measured
   as the difference between the level of pain taken in the Self\_Incorrect
   and Both\_Incorrect conditions. Furthermore, a mediation pathway
   analysis revealed that activation in a midbrain region mediated the
   relationship between aMCC activation and the individual's tendency to
   compensate. These results demonstrate that the aMCC and the midbrain
   nucleus not only play an important role in experiencing interpersonal
   guilt, but also contribute to compensation behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that brain regions for mentalizing,
   including temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC), are activated in understanding the nonliteral meaning of
   sentences. A different set of brain regions, including left inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG), is activated for dealing with pragmatic
   incongruence. Here we demonstrate that individuals' cognitive empathic
   ability modulates the brain activity underlying the processing of
   pragmatic constraints during sentence comprehension. The lian... dou...
   construction in Chinese (similar to English even) normally describes an
   event of low expectedness; it also introduces a pragmatic scale against
   which the likelihood of an underspecified event can be inferred. By
   embedding neutral or highly likely events in the construction, we
   created underspecified and incongruent sentences and compared both with
   control sentences in which events of low expectedness were described.
   Imaging results showed that (i) left TPJ was activated for the
   underspecified sentences, and the activity in mPFC correlated with
   individuals' fantasizing ability and (ii) anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) was activated for the incongruent sentences, and the activity in
   bilateral IFG correlated with individuals' perspective taking ability.
   These findings suggest that brain activations in making pragmatic
   inference and in dealing with pragmatic failure are modulated by
   different components of cognitive empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding emotions in others engages specific brain regions in
   temporal and medial prefrontal cortices. These activations are often
   attributed to more general cognitive `mentalizing' functions, associated
   with theory of mind and also necessary to represent people's
   non-emotional mental states, such as beliefs or intentions. Here, we
   directly investigated whether understanding emotional feelings recruit
   similar or specific brain systems, relative to other non-emotional
   mental states. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging with
   multivoxel pattern analysis in 46 volunteers to compare activation
   patterns in theory-of-mind tasks for emotions, relative to beliefs or
   somatic states accompanied with pain. We found a striking dissociation
   between the temporoparietal cortex, that exhibited a remarkable
   voxel-by-voxel pattern overlap between emotions and beliefs (but not
   pain), and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, that exhibited distinct
   (and yet nearby) patterns of activity during the judgment of beliefs and
   emotions in others. Pain judgment was instead associated with activity
   in the supramarginal gyrus, middle cingulate cortex and middle insular
   cortex. Our data reveal for the first time a functional dissociation
   within brain networks sub-serving theory of mind for different mental
   contents, with a common recruitment for cognitive and affective states
   in temporal regions, and distinct recruitment in prefrontal areas.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies on trait inference about the self and others have
   found a network of brain areas, the critical part of which appears to be
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We investigated whether the mPFC plays
   an essential role in the neural representation of a trait code. To
   localize the trait code, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) adaptation, which is a rapid suppression of neuronal responses
   upon repeated presentation of the same underlying stimulus, in this
   case, the implied trait. Participants had to infer an agent's (social)
   trait from brief trait-implying behavioral descriptions. In each trial,
   the critical (target) sentence was preceded by a sentence (prime) that
   implied the same trait, the opposite trait, or no trait at all. The
   results revealed robust adaptation from prime to target in the ventral
   mPFC only during trait conditions, as expected. Adaptation was strongest
   after being primed with a similar trait, moderately strong after an
   opposite trait and much weaker after a trait-irrelevant prime. This
   adaptation pattern was found nowhere else in the brain. In line with
   previous research on fMRI adaptation, we interpret these findings as
   indicating that a trait code is represented in the ventral mPFC.}},

Abstract = {{As a social species, humans evolved to detect information from the
   social behavior of others. Yet, the mechanisms used to evaluate social
   interactions, the brain networks implicated in such recognition, and
   whether individual differences in own social behavior determine response
   to similar behavior in others remain unknown. Here we examined social
   synchrony as a potentially important mechanism in the evaluation of
   social behavior and utilized the parenting context, an evolutionarily
   salient setting of significant consequences for infant survival, to test
   this issue. The brain response of healthy postpartum mothers to three
   mother-infant interaction vignettes was assessed. Videos included a
   typical synchronous interaction and two pathological interactions of
   mothers diagnosed with postpartum depression and anxiety that showed
   marked deviations from social synchrony. Mothers' own interactions with
   their 4- to 6-month-old infants were videotaped and micro-coded for
   synchrony. Results indicated that the recognition of social synchrony
   involved activations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC),
   fusiform, cuneus, inferior parietal lobule, supplementary motor area and
   NAcc. Mother's own synchrony with her infant correlated with her dACC
   response to synchrony in others. Findings are consistent with models
   suggesting that social action underpins social recognition and highlight
   social synchrony and the mother-infant bond as one prototypical context
   for studying the brain basis of social understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of empathy is a hallmark of social impairments in individuals with
   autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the concept empathy encompasses
   several socio-emotional and behavioral components underpinned by
   interacting brain circuits. This study examined empathic arousal and
   social understanding in individuals with ASD and matched controls by
   combining pressure pain thresholds (PPT) with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (study 1) and electroencephalography/event-related
   potentials and eye-tracking responses (study 2) to empathy-eliciting
   stimuli depicting physical bodily injuries. Results indicate that
   participants with ASD had lower PPT than controls. When viewing body
   parts being accidentally injured, increased hemodynamic responses in the
   somatosensory cortex (SI/SII) but decreased responses in the anterior
   mid-cingulate and anterior insula as well as heightened N2 but preserved
   late-positive potentials (LPP) were detected in ASD participants. When
   viewing a person intentionally hurting another, decreased hemodynamic
   responses in the medial prefrontal cortex and reduced LPP were observed
   in the ASD group. PPT was a mediator for the SI/SII response in
   predicting subjective unpleasantness ratings to others' pain. Both ASD
   and control groups had comparable mu suppression, indicative of typical
   sensorimotor resonance. The findings demonstrate that, in addition to
   reduced pain thresholds, individuals with ASD exhibit heightened
   empathic arousal but impaired social understanding when perceiving
   others' distress.}},

   Aim. To study the empathic response in two groups of older people and
   their relationship to emotional intelligence and moral judgment.
   Subjects and methods. We enrolled 60 subjects divided into two groups of
   30 subjects each completed a battery of tests: TMMS-24, DEX, IRI and
   moral dilemmas.
   Results. In the dimension of the IRI perspective taking older group
   scored significantly less than the middle age group (U = 279; p < 0.05).
   In all other variables, no statistically significant differences were
   found.
   Conclusions. The results show the absence of a generalized deficit in
   social cognition in the elderly sample evaluated. However, differences
   were observed based on age on empathy and executive performance: over
   time a progressive impairment in theory of mind and a decline in the
   general empathic capacity occur. With regard to emotional intelligence,
   the elderly evaluated show a correct perception and understanding of
   their emotions even report a poorer ability to manage and regulate their
   emotions.}},

   Brain response to facial expressions was measured in 25 regions
   constituting a face network, as defined previously. In 9 out of these 25
   regions, common genetic variance explained a significant proportion of
   phenotypic variance (40-50\%) in their response to ambiguous facial
   expressions; this was not the case for angry facial expressions. Across
   the network, the strength of the genotype-phenotype relationship varied
   as a function of the inter-individual variability in the number of
   functional connections possessed by a given region (R-2 = 0.38, p <
   0.001). Furthermore, this variability showed an inverted U relationship
   with both the number of observed connections (R-2 = 0.48, p < 0.001) and
   the magnitude of brain response (R-2 = 0.32, p < 0.001). Thus, a
   significant proportion of the brain response to facial expressions is
   predicted by common genetic variance in a subset of regions constituting
   the face network. These regions show the highest inter-individual
   variability in the number of connections with other network nodes,
   suggesting that the genetic model captures variations across the
   adolescent brains in co-opting these regions into the face network.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances in semantic and phonological aspects of language processing
   are indicated in patients with schizophrenia, and in high-risk
   individuals for schizophrenia. To uncover neural correlates of the
   disturbances, a previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study using a visual lexical decision task in block design reported less
   leftward lateralization in the inferior frontal cortices, in
   patientswith schizophrenia and individuals with high genetic risk for
   psychosis compared with normal control subjects. However, to our
   knowledge, no previous study has investigated contrasts between word and
   non-word processing that allow dissociation between semantic and
   phonological processing using event-related design visual lexical
   decision fMRI tasks in subjects with ultra-high-risk for psychosis (UHR)
   and patients with schizophrenia. In the current study, 20 patients with
   schizophrenia, 11 UHR, and 20 demographically matched controls underwent
   lexical decision fMRI tasks. Compared with controls, both schizophrenia
   and UHR groups showed significantly decreased activity in response to
   non-words compared with words in the inferior frontal regions.
   Additionally, decreased leftward lateralization in the non-word compared
   with word activity contrast was found in subjects with UHR compared with
   controls, which was not evident in patients with schizophrenia. The
   present findings suggest neural correlates of difficulty in phonological
   aspects of language processing during non-word processing in contrast to
   word, which at least partially commonly underlies the pathophysiology of
   schizophrenia and UHR. Together with a previous study in genetic
   high-risk subjects, the current results also suggest that reduced
   functional lateralization in the language-related frontal cortex may be
   a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia. Furthermore, the current
   result may suggest that the genetic basis of psychosis is presumed to be
   related to the evolution of the language capacity characteristic of
   humans. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Altered medial prefrontal activity during dynamic face processing in

Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{225-230}},

Abstract = {{Background: Processing the emotional content of faces is recognised as a
   key deficit of schizophrenia, associated with poorer functional outcomes
   and possibly contributing to the severity of clinical symptoms such as
   paranoia. At the neural level, fMRI studies have reported altered limbic
   activity in response to facial stimuli. However, previous studies may be
   limited by the use of cognitively demanding tasks and static facial
   stimuli. To address these issues, the current study used a face
   processing task involving both passive face viewing and dynamic social
   stimuli. Such a task may (1) lack the potentially confounding effects of
   high cognitive demands and (2) show higher ecological validity.
   Methods: Functional MRI was used to examine neural activity in 25
   patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective
   disorder and 21 age-and gender-matched healthy controls while they
   participated in a face processing task, which involved viewing videos of
   angry and neutral facial expressions, and a non-biological baseline
   condition.
   Results: While viewing faces, patients showed significantly weaker
   deactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex, including the anterior
   cingulate, and decreased activation in the left cerebellum, compared to
   controls. Patients also showed weaker medial prefrontal deactivation
   while viewing the angry faces relative to baseline.
   Discussion: Given that the anterior cingulate plays a role in processing
   negative emotion, weaker deactivation of this region in patients while
   viewing faces may contribute to an increased perception of social
   threat. Future studies examining the neurobiology of social cognition in
   schizophrenia using fMRI may help establish targets for treatment
   interventions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{1-3}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Deficits in the capacity to reflect about the self and
   others ({''}social reflection{''} {[}SR]) have been identified in
   schizophrenia, as well as in people with a genetic or clinical risk for
   the disorder. However, the neural underpinnings of these abnormalities
   are incompletely understood.
   Methods: Responses of a network of brain regions known to be involved in
   self and other processing (e. g., medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC),
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and superior temporal gyrus (STG))
   were measured during SR in 16 first-degree, non-psychotic relatives
   (RELS) of schizophrenia patients and 16 healthy controls (CONS). Because
   of prior evidence linking dysfunction in this network and delusions,
   associations between SR-related responses of this network and
   subclinical delusions (measured using the Peters et al. Delusions
   Inventory) were also examined.
   Results: Compared with CONS, RELS showed significantly less SR-related
   activity of the right and left PCC and STG. Moreover, response
   magnitudes were negatively correlated with levels of delusional thinking
   across both groups.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that aberrant function of the neural
   circuitry underpinning SR is associated with the genetic liability to
   schizophrenia and confers vulnerability to delusional beliefs. (C) 2014

Title = {{Investigating socio-cognitive processes in deception: A quantitative
   meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{113-122}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging studies have found a broad network of brain regions
   involved in deception, including the prefrontal cortex, insula, anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Although
   deception can be conceptualized as the attempt to deliberately cause
   another person to accept a false belief, research to date has mainly
   focused on executive control processes when participants are instructed
   to lie under certain conditions. Recently, more ecologically valid and
   interactive experimental paradigms have been used in which subjects were
   also requested to take the perspective of another person, read his or
   her intentions, and make a self-determined decision to deceive that
   person and break a moral rule. To investigate the influence of these
   socio-cognitive processes on the neural network of deception, we
   performed a quantitative meta-analysis combining the data from 416
   participants across 22 fMRI and two PET studies. Based on the
   description of the experimental paradigm, studies were divided in social
   interactive and non-interactive deception studies. Increased activation
   in the dorsal ACC, the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ)/angular
   gyrus, and the bilateral temporal pole (TP) was found to be greater in
   social interactive than in non-interactive deception. These results
   demonstrate the important role of perspective taking, theory of mind,
   and moral reasoning processes in deception as well as conflict
   processing. In addition to the role of executive control processes
   determined by previous meta-analyses, our findings show the importance
   of these socio-cognitive processes in deception and give new insight
   into the function and interpretation of the brain regions involved. (C)

Abstract = {{The nature of neural processing within category-preferring visual
   networks remains an open topic in human neuroscience. Although the
   topography of face, scene, and object-preferring modules in the human
   brain is well established, the functional characterization, in terms of
   dynamic selectivity across their nodes is still elusive.
   Here, we use long trials of perceptually impoverished images of faces
   and objects to assess the dynamics of BOLD activity and selectivity
   induced by perceptual closure within these regions of interest.
   Departing from paradigms involving immediate percepts, we used ambiguous
   images favoring holistic search and independence from low level stimulus
   properties.
   By assessing the neural responses to images that go beyond the preferred
   category of the studied ROIs we could dissect the specificity of these
   processes as a function of the timing of perceptual closure and
   contribute to the debate regarding specialization of these modules.
   We found that pSTS is a notable exception to the observation that
   category selective high-level visual areas also participate on the
   perceptual closure of their non-preferred category. A similar
   observation was found for PPA responses to faces. Most importantly,
   these observations directly link the pSTS region with the social
   processing network, which cannot be engaged by object stimuli. (C) 2014

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{The double-deficit hypothesis of dyslexia posits that both rapid naming
   and phonological impairments can cause reading difficulties, and that
   individuals who have both of these deficits show greater reading
   impairments compared to those with a single deficit. Despite extensive
   behavioral research, the brain basis of poor reading with a
   double-deficit has never been investigated. The goal of the study was to
   evaluate the double-deficit hypothesis using functional MRI. Activation
   patterns during a printed word rhyme judgment task in 90 children with a
   wide range of reading abilities showed dissociation between brain
   regions that were sensitive to phonological awareness (left inferior
   frontal and inferior parietal regions) and rapid naming (right
   cerebellar lobule VI). More specifically, the double-deficit group
   showed less activation in the frontoparietal reading network compared to
   children with only a deficit in phonological awareness, who in turn
   showed less activation than the typically-reading group. On the other
   hand, the double-deficit group showed less cerebellar activation
   compared to children with only a rapid naming deficit, who in turn
   showed less activation than the typically-reading children. Functional
   connectivity analyses revealed that bilateral prefrontal regions were
   key for linking brain regions associated with phonological awareness and
   rapid naming, with the double-deficit group being the most aberrant in
   their connectivity. Our study provides the first functional
   neuroanatomical evidence for the double-deficit hypothesis of
   developmental dyslexia. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   preference for a semantically-mediated pathway from orthographic inputs
   to the retrieval of phonological representations, whereas the elderly
   preferred a direct connection from orthographic inputs to phonological
   lexicons prior to the activation of semantic representations. These
   sequential pathways are in line with the lexical semantic and
   non-semantic routes in the dual-route cascaded model. The shift in

Abstract = {{The behaviors of other people are often central to envisioning the
   future. The ability to accurately predict the thoughts and actions of
   others is essential for successful social interactions, with
   far-reaching consequences. Despite its importance, little is known about
   how the brain represents people in order to predict behavior. In this
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study, participants learned the
   unique personality of 4 protagonists and imagined how each would behave
   in different scenarios. The protagonists' personalities were composed of
   2 traits: Agreeableness and Extraversion. Which protagonist was being
   imagined was accurately inferred based solely on activity patterns in
   the medial prefrontal cortex using multivariate pattern classification,
   providing novel evidence that brain activity can reveal whom someone is
   thinking about. Lateral temporal and posterior cingulate cortex
   discriminated between different degrees of agreeableness and
   extraversion, respectively. Functional connectivity analysis confirmed
   that regions associated with trait-processing and individual identities
   were functionally coupled. Activity during the imagination task, and
   revealed by functional connectivity, was consistent with the default
   network. Our results suggest that distinct regions code for personality
   traits, and that the brain combines these traits to represent
   individuals. The brain then uses this ``personality model{''} to predict
   the behavior of others in novel situations.}},

   An fMRI study with experienced CCTV operators}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{74-91}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Does visual experience in judging intent to harm change our brain
   responses? And if it does, what are the mechanisms affected? We
   addressed these questions by studying the abilities of Closed Circuit
   Television (CCTV) operators, who must identify the presence of hostile
   intentions using only visual cues in complex scenes. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to assess which brain processes are modulated
   by CCTV experience. To this end we scanned 15 CCTV operators and 15 age
   and gender matched novices while they watched CCTV videos of 16 sec, and
   asked them to report whether each clip would end in violence or not. We
   carried out four separate whole-brain analyses including 3 model-based
   analyses and one analysis of intersubject correlation to examine
   differences between the two groups. The three model analyses were based
   on 1) experimentally pre-defined clip activity labels of fight,
   confrontation, playful, and neutral behaviour, 2) participants' reports
   of violent outcomes during the scan, and 3) visual saliency within each
   clip, as pre-assessed using eye-tracking. The analyses identified
   greater activation in the right superior frontal gyrus for operators
   than novices when viewing playful behaviour, and reduced activity for
   operators in comparison with novices in the occipital and temporal
   regions, irrespective of the type of clips viewed. However, in the
   parahippocampal gyrus, all three model-based analyses consistently
   showed reduced activity for experienced CCTV operators. Activity in the
   anterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus (uncus) was found to increase
   with years of CCTV experience. The intersubject correlation analysis
   revealed a further effect of experience, with CCTV operators showing
   correlated activity in fewer brain regions (superior and middle temporal
   gyrus, inferior parietal lobule and the ventral striatum) than novices.
   Our results indicate that long visual experience in action observation,
   aimed to predict harmful behaviour, modulates brain mechanisms of intent
   recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1632-1648}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Recent human neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural
   correlates of either noxious stimulus intensity or reported pain.
   Although useful, analyzing brain relationships with stimulus intensity
   and behavior separately does not address how sensation and pain are
   linked in the central nervous system. In this study, we used multi-level
   mediation analysis to identify brain mediators of pain regions in which
   trial-by-trial responses to heat explained variability in the
   relationship between noxious stimulus intensity (across 4 levels) and
   pain. This approach has the potential to identify multiple circuits with
   complementary roles in pain genesis. Brain mediators of noxious heat
   effects on pain included targets of ascending nociceptive pathways
   (anterior cingulate, insula, SII, and medial thalamus) and also
   prefrontal and subcortical regions not associated with nociceptive
   pathways per se. Cluster analysis revealed that mediators were grouped
   into several distinct functional networks, including the following:
   somatosensory, paralimbic, and striatal-cerebellar networks that
   increased with stimulus intensity; and 2 networks co-localized with
   ``default mode{''} regions in which stimulus intensity-related decreases
   mediated increased pain. We also identified ``thermosensory{''} regions
   that responded to increasing noxious heat but did not predict pain
   reports. Finally, several regions did not respond to noxious input, but
   their activity predicted pain; these included ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cerebellar regions, and
   supplementary motor cortices. These regions likely underlie both
   nociceptive and non-nociceptive processes that contribute to pain, such
   as attention and decision-making processes. Overall, these results
   elucidate how multiple distinct brain systems jointly contribute to the

Abstract = {{The development of language, social interaction, and communicative
   skills are remarkably different in the child with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD). Atypical brain connectivity has frequently been reported
   in this patient population. However, the interplay between their brain
   connectivity and language performance remains largely understudied.
   Using diffusion tensor imaging tractography and resting-state fMRI, the
   authors explored the structural and functional connectivity of the
   language network and its relation to the language profile in a group of
   healthy control subjects (N = 25) and a group of children with ASD (N =
   17). The authors hypothesized that in children with ASD, a neural
   connectivity deficit of the language network can be related to the
   observed abnormal language function. They found an absence of the
   right-hemispheric arcuate fascicle (AF) in 28\% (7/25) of the healthy
   control children and in 59\% (10/17) of the children with ASD. In
   contrast to healthy control children, the absence of the
   right-hemispheric AF in children with autism was related to a lower
   language performance as indicated by a lower verbal IQ, lower scores on
   the Pea-body Picture Vocabulary Test, and lower language scores on the
   Dutch version of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals
   (CELF-4NL). In addition, through iterative fMRI data analyses, the
   language impairment of children with ASD could be linked to a marked
   loss of intrahemispheric functional connectivity between inferior
   frontal and superior temporal regions, known as the cortical language
   network. Both structural and functional underconnectivity patterns
   coincide and are related to an abnormal language function in children
   with ASD. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Stress is a constant characteristic of everyday life in our society,
   playing a role in triggering several chronic disorders. Therefore, there
   is an ongoing need to develop new methods in order to manage stress
   reactions. The regulatory function of right medial-prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) is frequently reported by imaging studies during psychosocial
   stress situations. Here, we examined the effects of inhibitory and
   excitatory preconditioning stimulation via cathodal and anodal
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on psychosocial stress
   related behavioral indicators and physiological factors, including the
   cortisol level in the saliva and changes in brain perfusion. Twenty
   minutes real or sham tDCS was applied over the right mPFC of healthy
   subjects before the performance of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST).
   Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured during stimulation and
   after TSST, using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL).
   Comparing the effect of the different stimulation conditions, during
   anodal stimulation we found higher rCBF in the right mPFC, compared to
   the sham and in the right amygdala, superior PFC compared to the
   cathodal condition. Salivary cortisol levels showed a decrease in the
   anodal and increase in cathodal groups after completion of the TSST. The
   behavioral stress indicators indicated the increase of stress level,
   however, did not show any significant differences among groups. In this
   study we provide the first insights into the neuronal mechanisms
   mediating psychosocial stress responses by prefrontal tDCS. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that aging has a large impact on connectivity
   within and between functional networks. An open question is whether
   elderly still have the flexibility to adapt functional network
   connectivity (FNC) to the demands of the task at hand. To study this, we
   collected fMRI data in younger and older participants during resting
   state, a selective attention (SA) task and an n-back working memory task
   with varying levels of difficulty. Spatial independent component (IC)
   analysis was used to identify functional networks over all participants
   and all conditions. Dual regression was used to obtain participant and
   task specific time-courses per IC. Subsequently, functional connectivity
   was computed between all ICs in each of the tasks. Based on these
   functional connectivity matrices, a scaled version of the eigenvector
   centrality (SEC) was used to measure the total influence of each IC in
   the complete graph of ICs. The results demonstrated that elderly remain
   able to adapt FNC to task demands. However, there was an age-related
   shift in the impetus for FNC change. Older participants showed the
   maximal change in SEC patterns between resting state and the SA task.
   Young participants, showed the largest shift in SEC patterns between the
   less demanding SA task and the more demanding 2-back task. Our results
   suggest that increased FNC changes from resting state to low demanding
   tasks in elderly reflect recruitment of additional resources, compared
   with young adults. The lack of change between the low and high demanding
   tasks suggests that elderly reach a resource ceiling. (C) 2013 Wiley

Abstract = {{To study the effect of acute alcohol intoxication on the functional
   connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) and temporal fractal
   properties of the healthy adult brain.
   Eleven healthy male volunteers were asked to drink 0.59 g/kg of ethanol.
   Resting state blood oxygen level dependent (rsBOLD) MRI scans were
   obtained before consumption, 60 min post-consumption and 90 min
   post-consumption. Before each rsBOLD scan, pointed-resolved spectroscopy
   (PRESS) H-1-MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) scans were acquired to
   measure ethanol levels in the right basal ganglia.
   Significant changes in DMN connectivity were found following alcohol
   consumption (p < 0.01). Both increased and decreased regional
   connectivity were found after 60 min, whereas mostly decreased
   connectivity was found after 90 min. The fractal behaviour of the rsBOLD
   signal, which is believed to help reveal complexity of small-scale
   neuronal circuitry, became more ordered after both 60 and 90 min of
   alcohol consumption (p < 0.01).
   The DMN has been linked to personal identity and social behavior. As
   such, our preliminary findings may provide insight into the
   neuro-functional underpinnings of the cognitive and behavioral changes
   observed during acute alcohol intoxication. The reduced fractal
   dimension implies a change in function of small-scale neural networks
   towards less complex signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Electroencephalographic (EEG) neurofeedback training has been
   shown to produce plastic modulations in salience network and default
   mode network functional connectivity in healthy individuals. In this
   study, we investigated whether a single session of neurofeedback
   training aimed at the voluntary reduction of alpha rhythm (8-12 Hz)
   amplitude would be related to differences in EEG network oscillations,
   functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity, and subjective measures of state
   anxiety and arousal in a group of individuals with post-traumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD).
   Method: Twenty-one individuals with PTSD related to childhood abuse
   underwent 30 min of EEG neurofeedback training preceded and followed by
   a resting-state fMRI scan.
   Results: Alpha desynchronizing neurofeedback was associated with
   decreased alpha amplitude during training, followed by a significant
   increase ('rebound') in resting-state alpha synchronization. This
   rebound was linked to increased calmness, greater salience network
   connectivity with the right insula, and enhanced default mode network
   connectivity with bilateral posterior cingulate, right middle frontal
   gyrus, and left medial prefrontal cortex.
   Conclusion: Our study represents a first step in elucidating the
   potential neurobehavioural mechanisms mediating the effects of
   neurofeedback treatment on regulatory systems in PTSD. Moreover, it
   documents for the first time a spontaneous EEG `rebound' after
   neurofeedback, pointing to homeostatic/compensatory mechanisms operating
   in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{The anticipation of favourable or unfavourable events is a key component
   in our daily life. However, the temporal dynamics of anticipation
   processes in relation to brain activation are still not fully
   understood.
   A modified version of the monetary incentive delay task was administered
   during separate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   electroencephalogram (EEG) sessions in the same 25 participants to
   assess anticipatory processes with a multi-modal neuroimaging set-up.
   During fMRI, gain and loss anticipation were both associated with
   heightened activation in ventral striatum and reward-related areas. EEG
   revealed most pronounced P300 amplitudes for gain anticipation, whereas
   CNV amplitudes distinguished neutral from gain and loss anticipation.
   Importantly, P300, but not CNV amplitudes, were correlated to neural
   activation in the ventral striatum for both gain and loss anticipation.
   Larger P300 amplitudes indicated higher ventral striatum blood oxygen
   level dependent (BOLD) response.
   Early stimulus evaluation processes indexed by EEG seem to be positively
   related to higher activation levels in the ventral striatum, indexed by
   fMRI, which are usually associated with reward processing. The current
   results, however, point towards a more general motivational mechanism
   processing salient stimuli during anticipation. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Social communication through touch and mutual grooming can convey highly
   salient socio-emotional signals and has been shown to involve the
   neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) in several species. Less is known about the
   modulatory influence of OXT on the neural and emotional responses to
   human interpersonal touch. The present randomized placebo
   (PLC)-controlled within-subject pharmaco-functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study was designed to test the hypothesis that a single
   intranasal dose of synthetic OXT (24 IU) would facilitate both neural
   and emotional responses to interpersonal touch in a context-(female vs
   male touch) and trait( autistic trait load) specific manner.
   Specifically, the experimental rationale was to manipulate the reward
   value of interpersonal touch independent of the intensity and type of
   actual cutaneous stimulation administered. Thus, 40 heterosexual males
   believed that they were touched by either a man or a woman, although in
   fact an identical pattern of touch was always given by the same female
   experimenter blind to condition type. Our results show that OXT
   increased the perceived pleasantness of female, but not male touch, and
   associated neural responses in insula, precuneus, orbitofrontal, and
   pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, the behavioral and neural
   effects of OXT were negatively correlated with autistic-like traits.
   Taken together, this is the first study to show that the perceived
   hedonic value of human heterosexual interpersonal touch is facilitated
   by OXT in men, but that its behavioral and neural effects in this
   context are blunted in individuals with autistic traits.}},

Title = {{Reduced self-referential neural response during intergroup competition
   predicts competitor harm}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{36-43}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Why do interactions become more hostile when social relations shift from
   ``me versus you{''} to ``us versus them{''}? One possibility is that
   acting with a group can reduce spontaneous self-referential processing
   in the moral domain and, in turn, facilitate competitor harm. We tested
   this hypothesis in an fMRI experiment in which (i) participants
   performed a competitive task once alone and once with a group; (ii)
   spontaneous self-referential processing during competition was indexed
   unobtrusively by activation in an independently localized region of the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) associated with self-reference; and
   (iii) we assessed participants' willingness to harm competitors versus
   teammates. As predicted, participants who showed reduced mPFC activation
   in response to descriptions of their own moral behaviors while competing
   in a group were more willing to harm competitors. These results suggest
   that intergroup competition (above and beyond inter-personal
   competition) can reduce self-referential processing of moral
   information, enabling harmful behaviors towards members of a competitive
   group. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Much decision-making requires balancing benefits to the self with
   benefits to the group. There are marked individual differences in this
   balance such that individualists tend to favor themselves whereas
   prosocials tend to favor the group. Understanding the mechanisms
   underlying this difference has important implications for society and
   its institutions. Using behavioral and fMRI data collected during the
   performance of the ultimatum game, we show that individual differences
   in social preferences for resource allocation, so-called ``social value
   orientation,{''} is linked with activity in the nucleus accumbens and
   amygdala elicited by inequity, rather than activity in insula, ACC, and
   dorsolateral pFC. Importantly, the presence of cognitive load made
   prosocials behave more prosocially and individualists more
   individualistically, suggesting that social value orientation is driven
   more by intuition than reflection. In parallel, activity in the nucleus
   accumbens and amygdala, in response to inequity, tracked this behavioral
   pattern of prosocials and individualists. In addition, we conducted an
   impunity game experiment with different participants where they could
   not punish unfair behavior and found that the inequity-correlated
   activity seen in prosocials during the ultimatum game disappeared. This
   result suggests that the accumbens and amygdala activity of prosocials
   encodes ``outcome-oriented emotion{''} designed to change situations
   (i.e., achieve equity or punish). Together, our results suggest a
   pivotal contribution of the nucleus accumbens and amygdala to individual
   differences in sociality.}},

Title = {{Anticipating agoraphobic situations: the neural correlates of panic

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2385-2396}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background. Panic disorder with agoraphobia is characterized by panic
   attacks and anxiety in situations where escape might be difficult.
   However, neuroimaging studies specifically focusing on agoraphobia are
   rare. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with
   disorder-specific stimuli to investigate the neural substrates of
   agoraphobia.
   Method. We compared the neural activations of 72 patients suffering from
   panic disorder with agoraphobia with 72 matched healthy control subjects
   in a 3-T fMRI study. To isolate agoraphobia-specific alterations we
   tested the effects of the anticipation and perception of an
   agoraphobia-specific stimulus set. During fMRI, 48 agoraphobia-specific
   and 48 neutral pictures were randomly presented with and without
   anticipatory stimulus indicating the content of the subsequent pictures
   (Westphal paradigm).
   Results. During the anticipation of agoraphobia-specific pictures,
   stronger activations were found in the bilateral ventral striatum and
   left insula in patients compared with controls. There were no group
   differences during the perception phase of agoraphobia-specific
   pictures.
   Conclusions. This study revealed stronger region-specific activations in
   patients suffering from panic disorder with agoraphobia in anticipation
   of agoraphobia-specific stimuli. Patients seem to process these stimuli
   more intensively based on individual salience. Hyperactivation of the
   ventral striatum and insula when anticipating agoraphobia-specific
   situations might be a central neurofunctional correlate of agoraphobia.
   Knowledge about the neural correlates of anticipatory and perceptual
   processes regarding agoraphobic situations will help to optimize and
   evaluate treatments, such as exposure therapy, in patients with panic
   disorder and agoraphobia.}},

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2437-2447}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background. Observing another person performing a complex action
   accelerates the observer's acquisition of the same action and limits the
   time-consuming process of learning by trial and error. Learning by
   observation requires specific skills such as attending, imitating and
   understanding contingencies. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) exhibit deficits in these skills.
   Method. The performance of 20 ASD children was compared with that of a
   group of typically developing (TD) children matched for chronological
   age (CA), IQ and gender on tasks of learning of a visuomotor sequence by
   observation or by trial and error. Acquiring the correct sequence
   involved three phases: a detection phase (DP), in which participants
   discovered the correct sequence and learned how to perform the task; an
   exercise phase (EP), in which they reproduced the sequence until
   performance was error free; and an automatization phase (AP), in which
   by repeating the error-free sequence they became accurate and speedy.
   Results. In the DP, ASD children were impaired in detecting a sequence
   by trial and error only when the task was proposed as first, whereas
   they were as efficient as TD children in detecting a sequence by
   observation. In the EP, ASD children were as efficient as TD children.
   In the AP, ASD children were impaired in automatizing the sequence.
   Although the positive effect of learning by observation was evident, ASD
   children made a high number of imitative errors, indicating marked
   tendencies to hyperimitate.
   Conclusions. These findings demonstrate the imitative abilities of ASD
   children although the presence of imitative errors indicates an
   impairment in the control of imitative behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the well-documented importance of paternal caregiving for
   positive child development, little is known about the neural changes
   that accompany the transition to fatherhood in humans, or about how
   changes in hormone levels affect paternal brain function. We compared
   fathers of children aged 1-2 with non-fathers in terms of hormone levels
   (oxytocin and testosterone), neural responses to child picture stimuli,
   and neural responses to visual sexual stimuli. Compared to non-fathers,
   fathers had significantly higher levels of plasma oxytocin and lower
   levels of plasma testosterone. In response to child picture stimuli,
   fathers showed stronger activation than non-fathers within regions
   important for face emotion processing (caudal middle frontal gyrus
   {[}MFG]), mentalizing (temporo-parietal junction {[}TPJ]) and reward
   processing (medial orbitofrontal cortex {[}mOFC]). On the other hand,
   non-fathers had significantly stronger neural responses to sexually
   provocative images in regions important for reward and approach-related
   motivation (dorsal caudate and nucleus accumbens). Testosterone levels
   were negatively correlated with responses to child stimuli in the MFG.
   Surprisingly, neither testosterone nor oxytocin levels predicted neural
   responses to sexual stimuli. Our results suggest that the decline in
   testosterone that accompanies the transition to fatherhood may be
   important for augmenting empathy toward children. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Face perception is crucial to survival among social primates. It has
   been suggested that a group of extrastriate cortical regions responding
   more strongly to faces than to nonface objects is critical for face
   processing in primates. It is generally assumed that these regions are
   not retinotopically organized, as with human face-processing areas,
   showing foveal bias but lacking any organization with respect to polar
   angle. Despite many electrophysiological studies targeting monkey face
   patches, the retinotopic organization of these patches remains largely
   unclear. We have examined the relationship between cortical face patches
   and the topographic organization of extrastriate cortex using
   biologically relevant, phase-encoded retinotopic mapping stimuli in
   macaques. Single-subject fMRI results indicated a gradual shift from
   highly retinotopic to no topographic organization from posterior to
   anterior face patches in inferotemporal cortex. We also constructed a
   probabilistic retinotopic atlas of occipital and ventral extrastriate
   visual cortex. By comparing this probabilistic map to the locations of
   face patches at the group level, we showed that a previously identified
   posterior lateral temporal face patch (PL) is located within the
   posterior inferotemporal dorsal (PITd) retinotopic area. Furthermore, we
   identified a novel face patch posterior PL, which is located in
   retinotopically organized transitional area V4 (V4t). Previously
   published coordinates of human PITd coincide with the group-level
   occipital face area (OFA), according to a probabilistic map derived from
   a large population, implying a potential correspondence between monkey
   PL/PITd and human OFA/PITd. Furthermore, the monkey middle lateral
   temporal face patch (ML) shows consistent foveal biases but no obvious
   polar-angle structure. In contrast, middle fundus temporal (MF),
   anterior temporal and prefrontal monkey face patches lacked topographic
   organization.}},

Abstract = {{Over 90\% of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) demonstrate
   atypical sensory behaviors. In fact, hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory
   input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment is now
   included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. However, there are children
   with sensory processing differences who do not meet an ASD diagnosis but
   do show atypical sensory behaviors to the same or greater degree as ASD
   children. We previously demonstrated that children with Sensory
   Processing Disorders (SPD) have impaired white matter microstructure,
   and that this white matter microstructural pathology correlates with
   atypical sensory behavior. In this study, we use diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) fiber tractography to evaluate the structural connectivity
   of specific white matter tracts in boys with ASD (n = 15) and boys with
   SPD (n = 16), relative to typically developing children (n = 23). We
   define white matter tracts using probabilistic streamline tractography
   and assess the strength of tract connectivity using mean fractional
   anisotropy. Both the SPD and ASD cohorts demonstrate decreased
   connectivity relative to controls in parieto-occipital tracts involved
   in sensory perception and multisensory integration. However, the ASD
   group alone shows impaired connectivity, relative to controls, in
   temporal tracts thought to subserve social-emotional processing. In
   addition to these group difference analyses, we take a dimensional
   approach to assessing the relationship between white matter connectivity
   and participant function. These correlational analyses reveal
   significant associations of white matter connectivity with auditory
   processing, working memory, social skills, and inattention across our
   three study groups. These findings help elucidate the roles of specific
   neural circuits in neurodevelopmental disorders, and begin to explore
   the dimensional relationship between critical cognitive functions and
   structural connectivity across affected and unaffected children.}},

Abstract = {{Physical and sexual assault during adolescence is a potent risk factor
   for mental health and psychosocial problems, as well as revictimization,
   especially among female victims. To better understand this conferred
   risk, we conducted an exploratory study comparing assaulted and
   non-assaulted girls' behavioral and brain responses during a trust
   learning task. Adolescent girls (14 assaulted, 16 non-assaulted)
   performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging task that manipulated
   the percentages of which three different faces delivered positive and
   negative outcomes. Analyses focused on comparing unexpected to expected
   outcomes. We found that assaulted adolescent girls demonstrated less
   behavioral slowing in response to unexpected negative social outcomes,
   or trust violations (i.e., when a presumably trustworthy face delivered
   a negative outcome), relative to control girls. Trust violations were
   also associated with less activation in anterior insular and anterior
   cingulate regions among the assaulted group compared to the control
   group. Furthermore, we found that the severity of participants' exposure
   to assaultive events scaled negatively with recruitment of these
   regions. These preliminary results suggest that assault victims may
   engage differential learning processes upon unexpected negative social
   outcomes. These findings have implications for understanding impaired
   trust learning and social functioning among assault victims. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The visual perception of others' body parts is critical for
   understanding and imitating their behavior. The visual cortex in humans
   includes the extrastriate body area (EBA), which is a large portion of
   the occipitotemporal cortex that is selectively responsive to visually
   perceived body parts. Previous neuroimaging studies showed that the EBA
   not only receives sensory inputs regarding others' body information but
   also receives kinesthetic feedback regarding one's own actions. This
   finding raised the possibility that the EBA could be formed via
   nonvisual sensory modalities. However, the effect of visual deprivation
   on the formation of the EBA has remained largely unknown. Here, we used
   fMRI to investigate the effect of vision loss on the development of the
   EBA. Blind and sighted human subjects performed equally well in a
   haptic-identification task involving three categories of objects (hand
   shapes, toy cars, and teapots). The superior part (i.e., the middle
   temporal gyrus and angular gyrus) of the EBA and the supramarginal gyrus
   showed greater sensitivity to recognized hand shapes than to inanimate
   objects, regardless of the sensory modality and visual experience.
   Unlike the superior part of the EBA, the sensitivity of the inferior
   part (i.e., the inferior temporal sulcus and middle occipital gyrus)
   depended on visual experience. However, this vision-dependent
   sensitivity explained minor individual differences in hand-recognition
   performance. These results indicate that nonvisual modalities drive the
   development of the cortical network underlying the recognition of hand
   gestures with a node in the visual cortex.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings suggest that a
   part of the planurn temporale (PT) is involved in representing spatial
   properties of acoustic information. Here, we tested whether this
   representation of space is frequency-dependent or generalizes across
   spectral content, as required from high order sensory representations.
   Using sounds with two different spectral content and two spatial
   locations in individually tailored virtual acoustic environment, we
   compared three conditions in a sparse-fMRI experiment: Single Location,
   in which two sounds were both presented from one location; Fixed
   Mapping, in which there was one-to-one mapping between two sounds and
   two locations; and Mixed Mapping, in which the two sounds were equally
   likely to appear at either one of the two locations. We surmised that
   only neurons tuned to both location and frequency should be
   differentially adapted by the Mixed and Fixed mappings. Replicating our
   previous findings, we found adaptation to spatial location in the PT
   Importantly, activation was higher for Mixed Mapping than for Fixed
   Mapping blocks, even though the two sounds and the two locations
   appeared equally in both conditions. These results show that spatially
   tuned neurons in the human PT are not invariant to the spectral content
   of sounds.}},

Abstract = {{Music is a potent source for eliciting emotions, but not everybody
   experience emotions in the same way. Individuals with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) show difficulties with social and emotional cognition.
   Impairments in emotion recognition are widely studied in ASD, and have
   been associated with atypical brain activation in response to emotional
   expressions in faces and speech. Whether these impairments and atypical
   brain responses generalize to other domains, such as emotional
   processing of music, is less clear. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we investigated neural correlates of emotion recognition in
   music in high-functioning adults with ASD and neurotypical adults. Both
   groups engaged similar neural networks during processing of emotional
   music, and individuals with ASD rated emotional music comparable to the
   group of neurotypical individuals. However, in the ASD group, increased
   activity in response to happy compared to sad music was observed in
   dorsolateral prefrontal regions and in the rolandic operculum/insula,
   and we propose that this reflects increased cognitive processing and
   physiological arousal in response to emotional musical stimuli in this
   group.}},

Title = {{Modular structure of functional networks in olfactory memory}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{264-275}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Graph theory enables the study of systems by describing those systems as
   a set of nodes and edges. Graph theory has been widely applied to
   characterize the overall structure of data sets in the social,
   technological, and biological sciences, including neuroscience. Modular
   structure decomposition enables the definition of sub-networks whose
   components are gathered in the same module and work together closely,
   while working weakly with components from other modules. This processing
   is of interest for studying memory, a cognitive process that is widely
   distributed. We propose a new method to identify modular structure in
   task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) networks. The
   modular structure was obtained directly from correlation coefficients
   and thus retained information about both signs and weights. The method
   was applied to functional data acquired during a yes-no odor recognition
   memory task performed by young and elderly adults. Four response
   categories were explored: correct (Hit) and incorrect (False alarm, FA)
   recognition and correct and incorrect rejection. We extracted time
   series data for 36 areas as a function of response categories and age
   groups and calculated condition-based weighted correlation matrices.
   Overall, condition-based modular partitions were more homogeneous in
   young than elderly subjects. Using partition similarity-based statistics
   and a posteriori statistical analyses, we demonstrated that several
   areas, including the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and anterior
   cingulate gyrus, belonged to the same module more frequently during Hit
   than during all other conditions. Modularity values were negatively
   correlated with memory scores in the Hit condition and positively
   correlated with bias scores (liberal/conservative attitude) in the Hit
   and FA conditions. We further demonstrated that the proportion of
   positive and negative links between areas of different modules (i.e.,
   the proportion of correlated and anti-correlated areas) accounted for
   most of the observed differences in signed modularity. Taken together,
   our results provided some evidence that the neural networks involved in
   odor recognition memory are organized into modules and that these
   modular partitions are linked to behavioral performance and individual
   strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   indicate that social context matters and that participants' cortical

   We found enhanced alpha, beta and theta band activity in the T rather
   than the A resting-state condition, which was more pronounced in
   posterior brain regions. We further found a positive correlation between
   anxious attachment style and enhanced alpha power in the T vs. A

   neuropsychological testing, fMRI was utilized to examine activation
   patterns during expressive fluency and receptive language tasks. In
   comparison to internationally adopted children without language
   difficulties and nonadopted controls, participants with language
   difficulty had worse performance on tasks of verbal memory and
   reasoning, academic skills, and working memory. Behaviorally, all
   internationally adopted participants, regardless of language ability,
   had more parent-reported hyperactivity and impulsivity compared with

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has facilitated major
   advances in understanding human brain function. Neuroscientists are
   interested in using fMRI to study the effects of external stimuli on
   brain activity and causal relationships among brain regions, but have
   not stated what is meant by causation or defined the effects they
   purport to estimate. Building on Rubin's causal model, we construct a
   framework for causal inference using blood oxygenation level dependent
   (BOLD) fMRI time series data. In the usual statistical literature on
   causal inference, potential outcomes, assumed to be measured without
   systematic error, are used to define unit and average causal effects.
   However, in general the potential BOLD responses are measured with
   stimulus dependent systematic error. Thus we define unit and average
   causal effects that are free of systematic error. In contrast to the
   usual case of a randomized experiment where adjustment for intermediate
   outcomes leads to biased estimates of treatment effects, here the
   failure to adjust for task dependent systematic error leads to biased
   estimates. We therefore adjust for systematic error using measured
   ``noise covariates,{''} using a linear mixed model to estimate the
   effects and the systematic error. Our results are important for
   neuroscientists, who typically do not adjust for systematic error. They
   should also prove useful to researchers in other areas where responses
   are measured with error and in fields where large amounts of data are
   collected on relatively few subjects. To illustrate our approach, we
   reanalyze data from a social evaluative threat task, comparing the
   findings with results that ignore systematic error.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Theory and research suggest that sensory processing
   sensitivity (SPS), found in roughly 20\% of humans and over 100 other
   species, is a trait associated with greater sensitivity and
   responsiveness to the environment and to social stimuli. Self-report
   studies have shown that high-SPS individuals are strongly affected by
   others' moods, but no previous study has examined neural systems engaged
   in response to others' emotions. Methods: This study examined the neural
   correlates of SPS (measured by the standard short-form Highly Sensitive
   Person {[}HSP] scale) among 18 participants (10 females) while viewing
   photos of their romantic partners and of strangers displaying positive,
   negative, or neutral facial expressions. One year apart, 13 of the 18
   participants were scanned twice. Results: Across all conditions, HSP
   scores were associated with increased brain activation of regions
   involved in attention and action planning (in the cingulate and premotor
   area {[}PMA]). For happy and sad photo conditions, SPS was associated
   with activation of brain regions involved in awareness, integration of
   sensory information, empathy, and action planning (e.g., cingulate,
   insula, inferior frontal gyrus {[}IFG], middle temporal gyrus {[}MTG],
   and PMA). Conclusions: As predicted, for partner images and for happy
   facial photos, HSP scores were associated with stronger activation of
   brain regions involved in awareness, empathy, and self-other processing.
   These results provide evidence that awareness and responsiveness are
   fundamental features of SPS, and show how the brain may mediate these
   traits.}},

Abstract = {{Various functional magnetic resonance imaging studies addressed the
   effects of antidepressant drugs on brain functioning in healthy
   subjects; however, none specifically investigated positive mood changes
   to antidepressant drug. Sixteen subjects with no personal or family
   history of psychiatric disorders were selected from an ongoing 4-week
   open trial of small doses of clomipramine. Follow-up interviews
   documented clear positive treatment effects in six subjects, with
   reduced irritability and tension in social interactions, improved
   decision making, higher self-confidence and brighter mood. These
   subjects were then included in a placebo-controlled confirmatory trial
   and were scanned immediately after 4 weeks of clomipramine use and again
   4 weeks after the last dose of clomipramine. The functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were run during emotion-eliciting
   stimuli. Repeated-measures analysis of variance of brain activity
   patterns showed significant interactions between group and treatment
   status during induced irritability (P < 0.005 cluster-based) but not
   during happiness. Individuals displaying a positive subjective response
   do clomipramine had higher frontoparietal cortex activity during
   irritability than during happiness and neutral emotion, and higher
   temporo-parieto-occipital cortex activity during irritability than
   during happiness. We conclude that antidepressants not only induce
   positive mood responses but also act upon autobiographical recall of
   negative emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Reactivity to smoking cues is an important factor in the
   motivation to smoke and has been associated with the dopamine receptor 4
   variable number tandem repeat (DRD4 exon III VNTR) polymorphism, but
   little is known about the associated neural mechanisms.
   Methods: Non-treatment-seeking Caucasian smokers completed overnight
   abstinence and viewed smoking and neutral cues, during 2 separate
   functional magnetic resonance imaging scans, while wearing either a
   nicotine or placebo patch (order randomized) and were genotyped for the
   DRD4 VNTR. We conducted mixed-effects repeated-measures analyses of
   variance (within-subject factor: nicotine or placebo patch;
   between-subject factor: DRD4 long {[}L: >= 1 copy of >= 7 repeats] or
   short {[}S: 2 copies <= 6 repeats] genotype) of 6 a priori regions of
   interest.
   Results: Relative to neutral cues, smoking cues elicited greater
   activity in bilateral ventral striatum and left amygdala during nicotine
   replacement and deactivation in these regions during nicotine
   deprivation. A patch x DRD4 interaction was observed in the left
   amygdala, an area associated with appetitive reinforcement and relapse
   risk, such that S allele carriers demonstrated greater activation on
   active patch than on placebo patch.
   Conclusions: Brain systems associated with reward salience may become
   primed and overreactive at nicotine replacement doses intended for the
   first step of smoking cessation and may become inhibited during nicotine
   withdrawal in DRD4 S but not in DRD4 L carriers. These findings are
   consistent with the role of these regions in drug reinforcement and
   suggest a differential influence of nicotine replacement on amygdala
   activation in the association of incentive salience with smoking stimuli
   across DRD4 genotypes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   understand how homeowners process non-financial information when
   considering strategic mortgage default. We find that borrowers initially
   attempt to inhibit their knee-jerk reaction to retaliate against a
   lender who has engaged in egregious lending practices when compared to a
   financially conservative lender. Moreover, when defaults are rare,
   borrowers are less likely to default because violating the social norm
   results in feelings of disgust. Finally, when a lender refuses a loan
   modification, the borrower is found to seek retribution. Interestingly,
   granting even a modest loan modification removes the desire of
   homeowners to seek retribution towards their lender no matter what their
   impression of the lender may be. The results carry a number of policy
   implications.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with schizophrenia suffer from deficits in monitoring and
   controlling their own thoughts. Within these so-called metacognitive
   impairments, alterations in probabilistic reasoning might be one
   cognitive phenomenon disposing to delusions. However, so far little is
   known about alterations in associated brain functionality.
   A previously established task for functional magnetic resonance imaging
   ( fMRI), which requires a probabilistic decision after a variable amount
   of stimuli, was applied to 23 schizophrenia patients and 28 healthy
   controls matched for age, gender and educational levels. We compared
   activation patterns during decision-making under conditions of certainty
   versus uncertainty and evaluated the process of final decision-making in
   ventral striatum ( VS) and ventral tegmental area ( VTA).
   We replicated a pre-described extended cortical activation pattern
   during probabilistic reasoning. During final decision-making,
   activations in several fronto- and parietocortical areas, as well as in
   VS and VTA became apparent. In both of these regions schizophrenia
   patients showed a significantly reduced activation.
   These results further define the network underlying probabilistic
   decision-making. The observed hypo-activation in regions commonly
   associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission fits into current
   concepts of disrupted prediction error signaling in schizophrenia and
   suggests functional links to reward anticipation. Forthcoming studies
   with patients at risk for psychosis and drug-naive first episode
   patients are necessary to elucidate the development of these findings
   over time and the interplay with associated clinical symptoms. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to assess functional changes in the
   cerebral cortex in people with different sign language experience and
   hearing status whilst observing and imitating Chinese Sign Language
   (CSL) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 50
   participants took part in the study, and were divided into four groups
   according to their hearing status and experience of using sign language:
   prelingual deafness signer group (PDS), normal hearing non-signer group
   (HnS), native signer group with normal hearing (HNS), and acquired
   signer group with normal hearing (HLS). fMRI images were scanned from
   all subjects when they performed block-designed tasks that involved
   observing and imitating sign language stimuli. Nine activation areas
   were found in response to undertaking either observation or imitation
   CSL tasks and three activated areas were found only when undertaking the
   imitation task. Of those, the PDS group had significantly greater
   activation areas in terms of the cluster size of the activated voxels in
   the bilateral superior parietal lobule, cuneate lobe and lingual gyrus
   in response to undertaking either the observation or the imitation CSL
   task than the HnS, HNS and HLS groups. The PDS group also showed
   significantly greater activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus
   which was also found in the HNS or the HLS groups but not in the HnS
   group. This indicates that deaf signers have better sign language
   proficiency, because they engage more actively with the phonetic and
   semantic elements. In addition, the activations of the bilateral
   superior temporal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule were only found in
   the PDS group and HNS group, and not in the other two groups, which
   indicates that the area for sign language processing appears to be
   sensitive to the age of language acquisition.
   Learning Outcomes: After reading this article, readers will be able to:
   discuss the relationship between sign language and its neural
   mechanisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Naturalistic stimuli evoke highly reliable brain activity across
   viewers. Here we record neural activity from a group of naive
   individuals while viewing popular, previously-broadcast television
   content for which the broad audience response is characterized by social
   media activity and audience ratings. We find that the level of
   inter-subject correlation in the evoked encephalographic responses
   predicts the expressions of interest and preference among thousands.
   Surprisingly, ratings of the larger audience are predicted with greater
   accuracy than those of the individuals from whom the neural data is
   obtained. An additional functional magnetic resonance imaging study
   employing a separate sample of subjects shows that the level of neural
   reliability evoked by these stimuli covaries with the amount of
   blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activation in higher-order

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{115-120}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{While decades of research have demonstrated that a region of the right
   fusiform gyrus (FG) responds selectively to faces, a second line of
   research suggests that the FG responds to a range of animacy cues,
   including biological motion and goal-directed actions, even in the
   absence of faces or other human-like surface features. These findings
   raise the question of whether the FG is indeed sensitive to faces or to
   the more abstract category of animate agents. The current study uses
   fMRI to examine whether the FG responds to all faces in a
   category-specific way or whether the FG is especially sensitive to the
   faces of animate agents. Animate agents are defined here as intentional
   agents with the capacity for rational goal-directed actions.
   Specifically, we examine how the FG responds to an entity that looks
   like an animate agent but that lacks the capacity for goal-directed
   rational action. Region-of-interest analyses reveal that the FG
   activates more strongly to the animate compared with the inanimate
   entity, even though the surface features of both animate and inanimate
   entities were identical. These results suggest that the FG does not
   respond to all faces in a category-specific way, and is instead
   especially sensitive to whether an entity is animate. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Altered Activity and Functional Connectivity of Superior Temporal Gyri

Abstract = {{Objective: The prior functional MRI studies have demonstrated
   significantly abnormal activity in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus
   (STG) of anxiety patients. The purpose of the current investigation was
   to determine whether the abnormal activity in these regions was related
   to a loss of functional connectivity between these regions.
   Materials and Methods: Ten healthy controls and 10 anxiety patients
   underwent noninvasive fMRI while actively listening to emotionally
   neutral words alternated by silence (Task 1) or threat-related words
   (Task 2). The participants were instructed to silently make a judgment
   of each word's valence (i.e., unpleasant, pleasant, or neutral). A
   coherence analysis was applied to the functional MRI data to examine the
   functional connectivity between the left and the right STG, which was
   selected as the primary region of interest on the basis of our prior
   results.
   Results: The data demonstrated that the anxiety patients exhibited
   significantly increased activation in the bilateral STG than the normal
   controls. The functional connectivity analysis indicated that the
   patient group showed significantly decreased degree of connectivity
   between the bilateral STG during processing Task 2 compared to Task 1 (t
   = 2.588, p = 0.029). In addition, a significantly decreased connectivity
   was also observed in the patient group compared to the control group
   during processing Task 2 (t = 2.810, p = 0.012).
   Conclusion: Anxiety patients may exhibit increased activity of the STG
   but decreased functional connectivity between the left and right STG,
   which may reflect the underlying neural abnormality of anxiety disorder,
   and this will provide new insights into this disease.}},

Title = {{Spatial Attention Effects of Disgusted and Fearful Faces}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Effective processing of threat-related stimuli is of significant
   evolutionary advantage. Given the intricate relationship between
   attention and the neural processing of threat-related emotions, this
   study manipulated attention allocation and emotional categories of
   threat-related stimuli as independent factors and investigated the time
   course of spatial-attention-modulated processing of disgusting and
   fearful stimuli. The participants were instructed to direct their
   attention either to the two vertical or to the two horizontal locations,
   where two faces and two houses would be presented. The task was to
   respond regarding the physical identity of the two stimuli at cued
   locations. Event-related potentials (ERP) evidences were found to
   support a two-stage model of attention-modulated processing of
   threat-related emotions. In the early processing stage, disgusted faces
   evoked larger P1 component at right occipital region despite the
   attention allocation while larger N170 component was elicited by fearful
   faces at right occipito-temporal region only when participants attended
   to houses. In the late processing stage, the amplitudes of the parietal
   P3 component enhanced for both disgusted and fearful facial expressions
   only when the attention was focused on faces. According to the results,
   we propose that the temporal dynamics of the emotion-by-attention
   interaction consist of two stages. The early stage is characterized by
   quick and specialized neural encoding of disgusting and fearful stimuli
   irrespective of voluntary attention allocation, indicating an automatic
   detection and perception of threat-related emotions. The late stage is
   represented by attention-gated separation between threat-related stimuli
   and neutral stimuli; the similar ERP pattern evoked by disgusted and
   fearful faces suggests a more generalized processing of threat-related
   emotions via top-down attentional modulation, based on which the
   defensive behavior in response to threat events is largely facilitated.}},

Abstract = {{Besides food restriction, hyperactivity is considered a key behavioral
   trait of anorexia nervosa (AN), playing a major role in the pathogenesis
   and progression of the disorder. However, the underlying neurophysiology
   remains poorly understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   during two affective go/no-go tasks to probe inhibitory control in
   response to stimuli depicting physical activity vs inactivity and food
   vs non-food in AN patients compared with 26 healthy athlete and
   non-athlete controls. We hypothesized that neural correlates of
   behavioral inhibition are biased by the emotional information of the
   stimuli in AN patients, leading to a differential neural inhibitory
   pattern during the two tasks. Indeed, we found reduced response
   inhibition for food and non-food images in the putamen, while stimuli
   depicting physical activity resulted in an exaggerated response of the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cerebellum in AN patients. However, both AN
   patients and athletes revealed an increased response in the
   somatosensory cortex to physical activity stimuli. These results suggest
   that physical activity stimuli might place an increased demand on the
   inhibitory control system in AN patients. The resulting hyperactivity of
   the PFC and cerebellum may lead to altered executive function and motor
   control, sustaining increased physical activity in AN patients.}},

Abstract = {{Ambivalence is a state of inconsistency that is often experienced as
   affectively aversive. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging
   study, we investigated the role of cognitive and social-affective
   processes in the experience of ambivalence and coping with its negative
   consequences. We examined participants' brain activity during the
   dichotomous evaluation (pro vs contra) of pretested ambivalent (e.g.
   alcohol), positive (e.g. happiness) and negative (e.g. genocide) word
   stimuli. We manipulated evaluation relevance by varying the probability
   of evaluation consequences, under the hypothesis that ambivalence is
   experienced as more negative when outcomes are relevant. When making
   ambivalent evaluations, more activity was found in the anterior
   cingulate cortex, the insula, the temporal parietal junction (TPJ) and
   the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, for both high and low
   evaluation relevance. After statistically conservative corrections,
   activity in the TPJ and PCC/precuneus was negatively correlated with
   experienced ambivalence after scanning, as measured by Priester and
   Petty's felt ambivalence scale (1996). The findings show that cognitive
   and social-affective brain areas are involved in the experience of
   ambivalence. However, these networks are differently associated with
   subsequent reduction of ambivalence, thus highlighting the importance of
   understanding both cognitive and affective processes involved in
   ambivalent decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescents view thousands of food commercials annually, but the neural
   response to food advertising and its association with obesity is largely
   unknown. This study is the first to examine how neural response to food
   commercials differs from other stimuli (e.g. non-food commercials and
   television show) and to explore how this response may differ by weight
   status. The blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging activation was measured in 30 adolescents ranging from lean to
   obese in response to food and non-food commercials imbedded in a
   television show. Adolescents exhibited greater activation in regions
   implicated in visual processing (e.g. occipital gyrus), attention (e.g.
   parietal lobes), cognition (e.g. temporal gyrus and posterior cerebellar
   lobe), movement (e.g. anterior cerebellar cortex), somatosensory
   response (e.g. postcentral gyrus) and reward {[}e.g. orbitofrontal
   cortex and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] during food commercials.
   Obese participants exhibited less activation during food relative to
   non-food commercials in neural regions implicated in visual processing
   (e.g. cuneus), attention (e.g. posterior cerebellar lobe), reward (e.g.
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ACC) and salience detection (e.g.
   precuneus). Obese participants did exhibit greater activation in a
   region implicated in semantic control (e.g. medial temporal gyrus).
   These findings may inform current policy debates regarding the impact of
   food advertising to minors.}},

Abstract = {{The observation of goal-directed actions performed by another individual
   allows one to understand what that individual is doing and why he/she is
   doing it. Important information about others' behaviour is also carried
   out by the dynamics of the observed action. Action dynamics characterize
   the `vitality form' of an action describing the cognitive and affective
   relation between the performing agent and the action recipient. Here,
   using the fMRI technique, we assessed the neural correlates of vitality
   form recognition presenting participants with videos showing two actors
   executing actions with different vitality forms: energetic and gentle.
   The participants viewed the actions in two tasks. In one task (what),
   they had to focus on the goal of the presented action; in the other task
   (how), they had to focus on the vitality form. For both tasks,
   activations were found in the action observation/execution circuit. Most
   interestingly, the contrast how vs what revealed activation in right
   dorso-central insula, highlighting the involvement, in the recognition
   of vitality form, of an anatomical region connecting somatosensory areas
   with the medial temporal region and, in particular, with the
   hippocampus. This somatosensory-insular-limbic circuit could underlie
   the observers' capacity to understand the vitality forms conveyed by the
   observed action.}},

Abstract = {{The present fMRI study investigated whether placebo treatment can change

   they were presented with disgusting, fear-eliciting and neutral pictures

   suggestion that it can reduce disgust symptoms). The placebo provoked a
   strong decrease of experienced disgust, which was accompanied by reduced
   insula activation. Exploratory psychophysiological interaction analyses
   revealed decreased connectivity in a network consisting of the insula,
   the amygdala, the anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal
   cortex. Moreover, the placebo increased amygdala-DMPFC coactivation. Our
   findings suggest that placebo use can modulate a specific affective
   state and might be an option as a first therapy step for clinical
   samples characterized by excessive and difficult-to-control disgust
   feelings.}},

Abstract = {{Women typically remember more female than male faces, whereas men do not
   show a reliable own-gender bias. However, little is known about the
   neural correlates of this own-gender bias in face recognition memory.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated
   whether face gender modulated brain activity in fusiform and inferior
   occipital gyri during incidental encoding of faces. Fifteen women and 14
   men underwent fMRI while passively viewing female and male faces,
   followed by a surprise face recognition task. Women recognized more
   female than male faces and showed higher activity to female than male
   faces in individually defined regions of fusiform and inferior occipital
   gyri. In contrast, men's recognition memory and
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent response were not modulated by face gender.
   Importantly, higher activity in the left fusiform gyrus (FFG) to one
   gender was related to better memory performance for that gender. These
   findings suggest that the FFG is involved in the gender bias in memory
   for faces, which may be linked to differential experience with female
   and male faces.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of extended self refers to the idea that people incorporate
   self-relevant others or objects into one's sense of self. Initial neural
   support for the notion of extended self was provided by fMRI evidence
   that medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) showed greater activation while
   people imagined objects belonging to them compared with someone else
   (Kim \& Johnson, 2012). This study investigated whether self-associated
   objects (i.e. `mine') subsequently engage MPFC spontaneously when a task
   does not require explicit self-referential judgments. During fMRI
   scanning, participants detected `oddballs' (objects with a specific
   frame color) intermixed with objects participants had previously
   imagined belonging to them or to someone else and previously unseen
   non-oddball objects. There was greater activity in MPFC and posterior
   cingulate cortex for those `self-owned' objects that participants were
   more successful at imagining owning compared with `other-owned' objects.
   In addition, change in object preference following the ownership
   manipulation (a mere ownership effect) was predicted by activity in
   MPFC. Overall, these results provide neural evidence for the idea that
   personally relevant external stimuli may be incorporated into one's
   sense of self.}},

Abstract = {{Prior studies have suggested that positive social interactions are
   experienced as rewarding. Yet, it is not well understood how social
   relationships influence neural responses to other persons' gains. In
   this study, we investigated neural responses during a gambling task in
   which healthy participants (N = 31; 18 females) could win or lose money
   for themselves, their best friend or a disliked other (antagonist). At
   the moment of receiving outcome, person-related activity was observed in
   the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), precuneus and temporal
   parietal junction (TPJ), showing higher activity for friends and
   antagonists than for self, and this activity was independent of outcome.
   The only region showing an interaction between the person-participants
   played for and outcome was the ventral striatum. Specifically, the
   striatum was more active following gains than losses for self and
   friends, whereas for the antagonist this pattern was reversed. Together,
   these results show that, in a context with social and reward
   information, social aspects are processed in brain regions associated
   with social cognition (mPFC, TPJ), and reward aspects are processed in
   primary reward areas (striatum). Furthermore, there is an interaction of
   social and reward information in the striatum, such that reward-related
   activity was dependent on social relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Early life stress (ELS) is known to have considerable influence on brain
   development, mental health and affective functioning. Previous
   investigations have shown that alexithymia, a prevalent personality
   trait associated with difficulties experiencing and verbalizing
   emotions, is particularly related to ELS. The aim of the present study
   was to investigate how neural correlates of emotional experiences in
   alexithymia are altered in the presence and absence of ELS. Therefore,
   50 healthy individuals with different levels of alexithymia were matched
   regarding ELS and investigated with respect to neural correlates of
   audio-visually induced emotional experiences via functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. The main finding was that ELS modulated hippocampal
   responses to pleasant (> neutral) stimuli in high-alexithymic
   individuals, whereas there was no such modulation in low-alexithymic
   individuals matched for ELS. Behavioral and psychophysiological results
   followed a similar pattern. When considered independent of ELS,
   alexithymia was associated with decreased responses in insula (pleasant
   > neutral) and temporal pole (unpleasant > neutral). Our results show
   that the influence of ELS on emotional brain responses seems to be
   modulated by an individual's degree of alexithymia. Potentially,
   protective and adverse effects of emotional abilities on brain responses
   to emotional experiences are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy refers to our ability to recognize and share emotions by another
   human being. Impairment may underlie many of the emotional deficits
   commonly associated with a range of neuropsychiatric and neurological
   conditions. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been implicated in
   these processes, but the specific contribution of subregions of the PFC
   remain unclear. Studies regarding the role of subregions of the
   prefrontal cortex such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)-in
   facial emotion recognition have yielded inconsistent results. The
   present study aimed to investigate the capacity to recognize nonverbal
   emotional facial expressions in a group of patients with the following:
   (a) perfusion deficits in the vmPFC (vmPFC group; N = 13), (b)
   hypoperfusions sparing the vmPFC (nonvmPFC group; N = 12), and in (c) a
   control group of healthy volunteers (control group; N = 17). Regions of
   hypoperfusion were identified by means of Single Photon Emission
   Computed Tomography (SPECT). Participants were asked to recognize facial
   expressions of the 7 basic emotions (happiness, fear, surprise, anger,
   disgust, sadness, or neutral). Detection of facial expressions of fear,
   disgust, and surprise was affected after functional disruption of the
   vmPFC. The present study confirms the role of the vmPFC in recognizing
   emotional facial expressions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pediatric anxiety disorders are chronic and impairing
   conditions that are characterized by risk aversion and avoidance;
   however, the neural correlates of decision making under risk in anxious
   youth remain poorly understood. Methods: Youth with a primary diagnosis
   of separation anxiety, social phobia, or generalized anxiety disorder (n
   = 16) and healthy controls (n = 15), performed a risky decision-making
   task under conditions of potential gain or loss while undergoing a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan. Results: Analyses
   were conducted to examine neural response to risky versus nonrisky
   choices in each condition. Anxious youth made fewer risky choices during
   potential loss compared to controls. Both groups elicited strong
   frontostriatal activation during risky choice. During risky choice in
   the gain condition, controls exhibited greater activation in ventral
   putamen during risky choice than during nonrisky choice and than anxious
   youth. In the loss condition, controls exhibited greater activation in
   medial prefrontal cortex during risk-taking while anxious youth
   exhibited greater engagement of amygdala and insula. Neural activation
   during risky choice was associated with individual differences in
   anxiety symptom severity, such that as anxiety symptomatology increased,
   there was decreased recruitment of the ventral striatum in the gain
   condition and increasing recruitment of the amygdala in the loss

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that urban upbringing and city living were
   associated with stress-induced activity in the amygdala and the
   perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC). This finding might link the
   epidemiological risk factor ``urbanicity{''} to neurobiological
   mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. However, given the heritability of
   stress-related phenotypes, it appears likely that genetic factors can
   modulate the effect of urbanicity on social stress processing. In the
   present exploratory study, we investigated if a functional sequence
   variation in the neuropeptide S receptor gene (NPSR1 rs324981) is
   associated with brain activation patterns under acute psychosocial
   stress and if it modulates the link between urbanicity and central
   stress processing. In animals, neuropeptide S has strong anxiolytic
   effects and it induces hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
   activation. In humans, rs324981 was found to be associated with anxiety
   and stress-related phenotypes. Forty-two subjects were exposed to a
   psychosocial stress task for scanner environments (ScanSTRESS). While no
   main effect of rs324981 on amygdala and pACC activity was detected, we
   found a distinct interaction between rs324981 and urban upbringing
   modulating right amygdala responses. Moreover, right amygdala responses
   were significantly higher in subjects who also showed a salivary
   cortisol response to the stress exposure. The present finding of a gene
   x environment interaction further supports the view that the brain NPS
   system is involved in central stress regulation. This study provides
   first evidence for the assumption that a NPSR1 variant modulates brain
   activation under stress, interacting with the environmental risk factor
   urban upbringing.}},

Abstract = {{Prosopometamorphopsia is a disorder of face perception in which faces
   appear distorted to the perceiver. The neural basis of
   prosopometamorphopsia is unclear, but may involve abnormal activity in
   face-selective areas in the ventral occipito-temporal pathway. Here we
   present the case of AS, a 44-year-old woman who reports persistent
   perceptual distortions of faces with no known cause. AS was presented
   with facial images and rated the magnitude of her distortions while
   activity in her core face areas and other areas in the ventral visual
   pathway was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The
   magnitude of her distortions was positively correlated with signal
   changes in the right occipital face area (OFA) and right fusiform face
   area (FFA), as well as right V1 V3, and right lateral occipital cortex
   (LOC). There was also a trend for a significant correlation with signal
   in the left OFA and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), but not in the
   right or left superior temporal sulcus (STS). These results suggest that
   AS' prosopometamorphopsia reflects anomalous activity in face-processing
   network, particularly in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{It is generally assumed that abstract concepts are linguistically coded,
   in line with imaging evidence of greater engagement of the left
   perisylvian language network for abstract than concrete words (Binder
   JR, Desai RH, Graves WW, Conant LL. 2009. Where is the semantic system?
   A critical review and meta-analysis of 120 functional neuroimaging
   studies. Cerebral Cortex. 19:2767-2796; Wang J, Conder JA, Blitzer DN,
   Shinkareva SV. 2010. Neural representation of abstract and concrete
   concepts: A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. Hum Brain Map.
   31:1459-1468). Recent behavioral work, which used tighter matching of
   items than previous studies, however, suggests that abstract concepts
   also entail affective processing to a greater extent than concrete
   concepts (Kousta S-T, Vigliocco G, Vinson DP, Andrews M, Del Campo E.
   The representation of abstract words: Why emotion matters. J Exp Psychol
   Gen. 140:14-34). Here we report a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   experiment that shows greater engagement of the rostral anterior
   cingulate cortex, an area associated with emotion processing (e.g.,
   Etkin A, Egner T, Peraza DM, Kandel ER, Hirsch J. 2006. Resolving
   emotional conflict: A role for the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in
   modulating activity in the amygdala. Neuron. 52:871), in abstract
   processing. For abstract words, activation in this area was modulated by
   the hedonic valence (degree of positive or negative affective
   association) of our items. A correlation analysis of more than 1,400
   English words further showed that abstract words, in general, receive
   higher ratings for affective associations (both valence and arousal)
   than concrete words, supporting the view that engagement of emotional
   processing is generally required for processing abstract words. We argue
   that these results support embodiment views of semantic representation,
   according to which, whereas concrete concepts are grounded in our
   sensory-motor experience, affective experience is crucial in the
   grounding of abstract concepts.}},

Abstract = {{A leading hypothesis for the neural basis of autism postulates globally
   abnormal brain connectivity, yet the majority of studies report effects
   that are either very weak, inconsistent across studies, or explain
   results incompletely. Here we apply multiple analytical approaches to
   resting-state BOLD-fMRI data at the whole-brain level. Neurotypical and
   high-functioning adults with autism displayed very similar patterns and
   strengths of resting-state connectivity. We found only limited evidence
   in autism for abnormal resting-state connectivity at the regional level
   and no evidence for altered connectivity at the whole-brain level.
   Regional abnormalities in functional connectivity in autism spectrum
   disorder were primarily in the frontal and temporal cortices. Within
   these regions, functional connectivity with other brain regions was
   almost exclusively lower in the autism group. Further examination showed
   that even small amounts of head motion during scanning have large
   effects on functional connectivity measures and must be controlled
   carefully. Consequently, we suggest caution in the interpretation of
   apparent positive findings until all possible confounding effects can be
   ruled out. Additionally, we do not rule out the possibility that
   abnormal connectivity in autism is evident at the microstructural
   synaptic level, which may not be reflected sensitively in hemodynamic
   changes measured with BOLD-fMRI.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{55-64}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Accurate person perception is crucial in social decision-making. One of
   the central elements in successful social perception is the ability to
   understand another's response bias; this is because the same behavior
   can represent different inner states depending on whether other people
   are yea-sayers or naysayers. In the present study, we have tried to
   investigate how the internal biases of others are perceived. Using a
   multi-trial learning paradigm, perceivers made predictions about a
   target's responses to various suggested activities and then received
   feedback for each prediction trial-by-trial. Our hypotheses were that
   (1) the internal decision criterion of the targets would be realized
   through repeated experiences, and (2) due to positive-negative
   asymmetry, yea-sayers would be recognized more gradually than naysayers
   through the probabilistic integration of repeated experiences. To find
   neural evidence that tracks probabilistic integration when forming
   person knowledge on response biases, we employed a model-based fMRI with
   a State-Space Model. We discovered that person knowledge about
   yea-sayers modulated several brain regions, including caudate nucleus,
   DLPFC, hippocampus, etc. Moreover, when person knowledge was updated
   with incorrect performance feedback, brain regions including the caudate
   nucleus, DLPFC, dmPFC, and TPJ were also involved. There were
   overlapping regions for both processes, caudate nucleus and DLPFC,
   suggesting that these regions take crucial roles in forming person
   knowledge with repeated feedback, while reflecting acquired information
   up to the current prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by
   alterations in brain function that are identifiable also during the
   brain's `resting state'. One functional network that is disrupted in
   this disorder is the default mode network (DMN), a set of large-scale
   connected brain regions that oscillate with low-frequency fluctuations
   and are more active during rest relative to a goal-directed task. Recent
   studies support the idea that the DMN is not a unitary system, but
   rather is composed of smaller and distinct functional subsystems that
   interact with each other. The functional relevance of these subsystems
   in depression, however, is unclear.
   Method. Here, we investigated the functional connectivity of distinct
   DMN subsystems and their interplay in depression using resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results. We show that patients with MDD exhibit increased within-network
   connectivity in posterior, ventral and core DMN subsystems along with
   reduced interplay from the anterior to the ventral DMN subsystems.
   Conclusions. These data suggest that MDD is characterized by alterations
   of subsystems within the DMN as well as of their interactions. Our
   findings highlight a critical role of DMN circuitry in the
   pathophysiology of MDD, thus suggesting these subsystems as potential
   therapeutic targets.}},

Abstract = {{Very preterm (PT) birth (32 weeks of gestation) carries a high risk for
   an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. In recent years, the importance
   of neurocognitive deficits in the language domain has been increasingly
   recognized, which can be well-characterized using neuropsychological
   testing and noninvasive imaging approaches. We compared former early PT
   born children and adolescents (PT, n = 29, 20M) and typically developing
   children (TD, n = 19, 7M), using conventional fMRI group analyses as
   well as functional connectivity analyses. We found only small regions
   with significantly different group activation (PT > TD) but
   significantly stronger connectivity between superior temporal lobe (STL)
   language regions in TD participants. There were also significant
   differences in local and global network efficiency (TD > PT).
   Surprisingly, there was a stronger connectivity of STL regions with
   non-STL regions both intrahemispherically and interhemispherically in PT
   participants, suggesting the coexistence of reduced and increased
   connectivity in the language network of former PTs. Very similar results
   were obtained when using task-based versus resting state functional
   connectivity approaches. Finally, lateralization of functional
   connectivity correlated with verbal comprehension abilities, suggesting
   that a more bilateral language comprehension representation is
   associated with better performance. Our results underline the importance
   of interhemispheric crosstalk for language comprehension. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Current knowledge about small-world networks underlying emotions is
   sparse, and confined to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   studies using resting-state paradigms. This fMRI study applied
   Eigenvector Centrality Mapping (ECM) and functional connectivity
   analysis to reveal neural small-world networks underlying joy and fear.
   Joy and fear were evoked using music, presented in 4-min blocks. Results
   show that the superficial amygdala (SF), laterobasal amygdala (LB),
   striatum, and hypothalamus function as computational hubs during joy.
   Out of these computational hubs, the amygdala nuclei showed the highest
   centrality values. The SF showed functional connectivity during joy with
   the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and nucleus accumbens (Nac), suggesting
   that SF, MD, and Nac modulate approach behavior in response to positive
   social signals such as joyful music. The striatum was functionally
   connected during joy with the LB, as well as with premotor cortex, areas
   1 and 7a, hippocampus, insula and cingulate cortex, showing that
   sensorimotor, attentional, and emotional processes converge in the
   striatum during music perception. The hypothalamus showed functional
   connectivity during joy with hippocampus and MD, suggesting that
   hypothalamic endocrine activity is modulated by hippocampal and thalamic
   activity during sustained periods of music-evoked emotion. Our study
   indicates high centrality of the amygdala nuclei groups within a
   functional network underlying joy, suggesting that these nuclei play a
   central role for the modulation of emotion-specific activity within this

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) studies showed that resting state
   activity in the healthy brain is organized into multiple large-scale
   networks encompassing distant regions. A key finding of resting state
   fMRI studies is the anti-correlation typically observed between the
   dorsal attention network (DAN) and the default mode network (DMN),
   whichduring task performanceare activated and deactivated, respectively.
   Previous studies have suggested that alcohol administration modulates
   the balance of activation/deactivation in brain networks, as well as it
   induces significant changes in oscillatory activity measured by
   electroencephalography (EEG). However, our knowledge of alcohol-induced
   changes in band-limited EEG power and their potential link with the
   functional interactions between DAN and DMN is still very limited. Here
   we address this issue, examining the neuronal effects of alcohol
   administration during resting state by using simultaneous EEG-fMRI. Our
   findings show increased EEG power in the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz)
   after administration of alcohol compared to placebo, which was prominent
   over the frontal cortex. More interestingly, increased frontal tonic EEG
   activity in this band was associated with greater anti-correlation
   between the DAN and the frontal component of the DMN. Furthermore, EEG
   theta power and DAN-DMN anti-correlation were relatively greater in
   subjects who reported a feeling of euphoria after alcohol
   administration, which may result from a diminished inhibition exerted by
   the prefrontal cortex. Overall, our findings suggest that slow brain
   rhythms are responsible for dynamic functional interactions between
   brain networks. They also confirm the applicability and potential
   usefulness of EEG-fMRI for central nervous system drug research. Hum

Abstract = {{There is converging evidence that people rapidly and automatically
   encode affective dimensions of objects, events, and environments that
   they encounter in the normal course of their daily routines. An
   important research question is whether affective representations differ
   with sensory modality. This research examined the nature of the
   dependency of affect and sensory modality at a whole-brain level of
   analysis in an incidental affective processing paradigm. Participants
   were presented with picture and sound stimuli that differed in positive
   or negative valence in an event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging experiment. Global statistical tests, applied at a level of the
   individual, demonstrated significant sensitivity to valence within
   modality, but not valence across modalities. Modality-general and
   modality-specific valence hypotheses predict distinctly different
   multidimensional patterns of the stimulus conditions. Examination of
   lower dimensional representation of the data demonstrated separable
   dimensions for valence processing within each modality. These results
   provide support for modality-specific valence processing in an
   incidental affective processing paradigm at a whole-brain level of
   analysis. Future research should further investigate how
   stimulus-specific emotional decoding may be mediated by the physical
   properties of the stimuli. Hum Brain Mapp 35:3558-3568, 2014. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Neuroeconomics integrates concepts and methods from psychology,
   economics, and cognitive neuroscience to understand how the brain makes
   decisions. In economics, demand refers to the relationship between a
   commodity's consumption and its cost, and, in behavioral studies, high
   alcohol demand has been consistently associated with greater alcohol
   misuse. Relatively little is known about how the brain processes demand
   decision making, and the current study is an initial investigation of
   the neural correlates of alcohol demand among heavy drinkers. Using an
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm,
   participants (N = 24) selected how much they would drink under varying
   levels of price. These choices determined access to alcohol during a
   subsequent bar laboratory self-administration period. During decisions
   to drink in general, greater activity was present in multiple distinct
   subunits of the prefrontal and parietal cortices. In contrast, during
   decisions to drink that were demonstrably affected by the cost of
   alcohol, significantly greater activation was evident in frontostriatal
   regions, suggesting an active interplay between cognitive deliberation
   and subjective reward value. These choices were also characterized by
   significant deactivation in default mode network regions, suggesting
   suppression resulting from greater cognitive load. Across choice types,
   the anterior insula was notably recruited in diverse roles, further
   implicating the importance of interoceptive processing in
   decision-making behavior. These findings reveal the neural signatures
   subserving alcohol cost benefit decision making, providing a foundation
   for future clinical applications of this paradigm and extending this
   approach to understanding the neural correlates of demand for other
   addictive commodities.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the gradient induced electroencephalography (EEG) artifact
   is analyzed and compared for two functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) pulse sequences with different k-space trajectories: echo planar
   imaging (EPI) and spiral. Furthermore, the performance of the average
   artifact subtraction algorithm (AAS) to remove the gradient artifact for
   both sequences is evaluated. The results show that the EEG gradient
   artifact for spiral sequences is one order of magnitude higher than for
   EPI sequences due to the chirping spectrum of the spiral sequence and
   the dB/dt of its crusher gradients. However, in the presence of accurate
   synchronization, the use of AAS yields the same artifact suppression
   efficiency for both pulse sequences below 80 Hz. The quality of EEG
   signal after AAS is demonstrated for phantom and human data. EEG
   spectrogram and visual evoked potential (VEP) are compared outside the
   scanner and use both EPI and spiral pulse sequences. MR related artifact
   residues affect the spectra over 40 Hz (less than 0.2 mu V up to 120 Hz)
   and modify the amplitude of P1, N2 and P300 in the VEP. These
   modifications in the EEG signal have to be taken into account when
   interpreting EEG data acquired in simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments. (C)

Abstract = {{Impairments in self-awareness contribute to disability in schizophrenia.
   Studies have revealed activation abnormalities in schizophrenia in
   cortical midline structures associated with self-reference. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare activation throughout
   the brain in people with schizophrenia and healthy controls (Kelly et
   al., 2002) while they indicated whether trait adjectives described
   attributes of themselves, their mother or a former president of the
   United States. Blood oxygenation level dependent signal in each
   condition was compared to resting fixation. Patients were less likely
   and slower to endorse positive self-attributes, and more likely and
   quicker to endorse negative self-attributes than controls. Activation
   abnormalities reported previously in cortical midline structures were
   again noted. In addition, patients showed greater signal increases in
   frontal, temporal gyri and insula, and smaller signal decreases in
   posterior regions than healthy controls when thinking about themselves.
   Group differences were less evident when subjects were thinking about
   their mothers and tended to go in the opposite direction when thinking
   about a president. Many of the areas showing abnormality have been shown
   in other studies to differ between patients and controls in structure
   and with other activation paradigms. We suggest that general
   neuropathology in schizophrenia alters the neural system configurations
   associated with self representation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{One of the most widely investigated functions of the brain is vision.
   Whereas special attention is often paid to motion detection and its
   modulation by attention, comparatively still little is known about the
   structural background of this function. We therefore, examined the white
   matter microstructural background of coherent motion detection. A
   random-dot kinematogram paradigm was used to measure the sensitivity of
   healthy individuals' to movement coherence. The potential correlation
   was investigated between the motion detection threshold and the white
   matter microstructure as measured by high angular resolution diffusion
   M. The Track Based Spatial Statistics method was used to address this
   correlation and probabilistic tractography to reveal the connection
   between identified regions. A significant positive correlation was found
   between the behavioural data and the local fractional anisotropy in the
   posterior part of the right superior frontal gyrus, the right
   juxta-cortical superior parietal lobule, the left parietal white matter,
   the left superior temporal gyrus and the left optic radiation.
   Probabilistic tractography identified pathways that are highly similar
   to the segregated attention networks, which have a crucial role in the
   paradigm. This study draws attention to the structural determinant of a
   behavioural function. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder (DD) typically manifests as a
   disruption of body self-awareness. Interoception defined as the
   cognitive processing of body signals-has been extensively considered as
   a key processing for body self-awareness. In consequence, the purpose of
   this study was to investigate whether there are systematic differences
   in interoception between a patient with DD and controls that might
   explain the disembodiment symptoms suffered in this disease. To assess
   interoception, we utilized a heartbeat detection task and measures of
   functional connectivity derived from fMRI networks in
   interoceptive/exteroceptivo/mind-wandering states. Additionally, we
   evaluated empathic abilities to test the association between
   interoception and emotional experience. The results showed patient's
   impaired performance in the heartbeat detection task when compared to
   controls. Furthermore, regarding functional connectivity, we found a
   lower global brain connectivity of the patient relative to controls only
   in the interoceptive state. He also presented a particular pattern of
   impairments in affective empathy. To our knowledge, this is the first
   experimental research that assesses the relationship between
   interoception and DD combining behavioral and neurobiological measures.
   Our results suggest that altered neural mechanisms and cognitive
   processes regarding body signaling might be engaged in DD phenomenology.
   Moreover, our study contributes experimental data to the comprehension
   of brain-body interactions and the emergence of self-awareness and
   emotional feelings.}},

   in fMRI}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Objects are reminiscent of actions often performed with them: knife and
   apple remind us on peeling the apple or cutting it. Mnemonic
   representations of object-related actions( action codes) evoked by the
   sight of an object may constrain and hence facilitate recognition of
   unrolling actions. The present fMRI study investigated if and how action
   codes influence brain activation during action observation. The average
   number of action codes (NAC) of 51 sets of objects was rated by a group
   of n= 24 participants. In an fMRI study, different volunteers were asked
   to recognize actions performed with the same objects presented in short
   videos. To disentangle areas reflecting the storage of action codes from
   those exploiting them, we showed object-compatible and
   object-incompatible ( pantomime) actions. Areas storing action codes
   were considered to positively co-vary with NAC in both object-compatible
   and object-incompatible action; due to its role in tool-related tasks,
   we here hypothesized left anterior inferior parietal cortex (aIPL).
   Incontrast, areas exploiting action codes were expected to show this
   correlation only in object-compatible but not incompatible action, as
   only object-compatible actions match one of the active action codes. For
   this interaction, we hypothesized ventrolateral premotorcortex (PMv) to
   join aIPL due to its role in biasing competition in IPL. We found left
   anterior intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and left posterior middle temporal
   gyrus (pMTG) to co-vary with NAC. In addition to these areas, action
   codes increased activity in object-compatible action in bilateral PMv,
   right IPS, and lateral occipital cortex (LO). Findings suggest that
   during action observation, the brain derives possible actions from
   perceived objects, and uses this information to shape action
   recognition. In particular, the number of expectable actions quantifies
   the activity level at PMv, IPL,}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{In the recent perceptual decision-making literature, a fronto-parietal
   network is typically reported to primarily represent the neural
   substrate of human perceptual decision-making. However, the view that
   only cortical areas are involved in perceptual decision-making has been
   challenged by several neurocomputational models which all argue that the
   basal ganglia play an essential role in perceptual decisions. To
   consolidate these different views, we conducted an Activation Likelihood
   Estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on the existing neuroimaging literature.
   The results argue in favor of the involvement of a frontal-parietal
   network in general perceptual decision-making that is possibly
   complemented by the basal ganglia, and modulated in substantial parts by
   task difficulty. In contrast, expectation of reward, an important aspect
   of many decision-making processes, shows almost no overlap with the
   general perceptual decision-making network.}},

Title = {{Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Patients with Schizophrenia
   and Non-Affected Siblings}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients with schizophrenia often experience problems
   regulating their emotions. Non-affected relatives show similar
   difficulties, although to a lesser extent, and the neural basis of such
   difficulties remains to be elucidated. In the current paper we
   investigated whether schizophrenia patients, non-affected siblings and
   healthy controls (HC) exhibit differences in brain activation during
   emotion regulation.
   Methods: All subjects (n = 20 per group) performed an emotion regulation
   task while they were in an fMRI scanner. The task contained two
   experimental conditions for the down-regulation of emotions (reappraise
   and suppress), in which IAPS pictures were used to generate a negative
   affect. We also assessed whether the groups differed in emotion
   regulation strategies used in daily life by means of the emotion
   regulation questionnaire (ERQ).
   Results: Though the overall negative affect was higher for patients as
   well as for siblings compared to HC for all conditions, all groups
   reported decreased negative affect after both regulation conditions.
   Nonetheless, neuroimaging results showed hypoactivation relative to HC
   in VLPFC, insula, middle temporal gyrus, caudate and thalamus for
   patients when reappraising negative pictures. In siblings, the same
   pattern was evident as in patients, but only in cortical areas.
   Conclusions: Given that all groups performed similarly on the emotion
   regulation task, but differed in overall negative affect ratings and
   brain activation, our findings suggest reduced levels of emotion
   regulation processing in neural circuits in patients with schizophrenia.
   Notably, this also holds for siblings, albeit to a lesser extent,
   indicating that it may be part and parcel of a vulnerability for
   psychosis.}},

Title = {{Empathy and stress related neural responses in maternal decision making}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Mothers need to make caregiving decisions to meet the needs of children,
   which may or may not result in positive child feedback. Variations in
   caregivers' emotional reactivity to unpleasant child-feedback may be
   partially explained by their dispositional empathy levels. Furthermore,
   empathic response to the child's unpleasant feedback likely helps
   mothers to regulate their own stress. We investigated the relationship
   between maternal dispositional empathy, stress reactivity, and neural
   correlates of child feedback to caregiving decisions. In Part 1 of the
   study, 33 female participants were recruited to undergo a lab-based mild
   stressor, the Social Evaluation Test (SET), and then in Part 2 of the
   study, a subset of the participants, 14 mothers, performed a Parenting
   Decision Making Task (PDMT) in an fMRI setting. Four dimensions of
   dispositional empathy based on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index were
   measured in all participants-Personal Distress, Empathic Concern,
   Perspective Taking, and Fantasy. Overall, we found that the Personal
   Distress and Perspective Taking were associated with greater and lesser
   cortisol reactivity, respectively. The four types of empathy were
   distinctly associated with the negative (vs. positive) child feedback
   activation in the brain. Personal Distress was associated with amygdala
   and hypothalamus activation, Empathic Concern with the left ventral
   striatum, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and supplemental
   motor area (SMA) activation, and Fantasy with the septal area, right SMA
   and VLPFC activation. Interestingly, hypothalamus-septal coupling during
   the negative feedback condition was associated with less PDMT-related
   cortisol reactivity. The roles of distinct forms of dispositional
   empathy in neural and stress responses are discussed.}},

   fMRI Study in Human Primary Visual Cortex}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{It is believed that human primary visual cortex (V1) increases activity
   with increasing temporal frequency of a visual stimulus. Two kinds of
   visual stimulus were used in the previous studies, one is
   patterned-flash stimulus with a fixed onset period and an increasing
   average luminance with the increase of temporal frequency, the other is
   contrast reversing flickering checkerboard or grating with a constant
   average luminance across different temporal frequencies. That
   hemodynamic responses change as a function of reversal frequency of
   contrast reversing checkerboard is at odds with neurophysiological
   studies in animals and neuroimaging studies in humans. In the present
   study, we addressed the relationship between reversal frequency of
   contrast reversing checkerboard and hemodynamic response in human V1
   using an event-related experimental paradigm and found that the
   transient characteristics of blood oxygenation level dependent response
   in human V1 depended very little on the reversal frequency of a contrast
   reversing checkerboard.}},

Abstract = {{The human voice carries speech as well as important nonlinguistic
   signals that influence our social interactions. Among these cues that
   impact our behavior and communication with other people is the perceived
   emotional state of the speaker. A theoretical framework for the neural
   processing stages of emotional prosody has suggested that auditory
   emotion is perceived in multiple steps (Schirmer and Kotz, 2006)
   involving low-level auditory analysis and integration of the acoustic
   information followed by higher-level cognition. Empirical evidence for
   this multistep processing chain, however, is still sparse. We examined
   this question using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a
   continuous carry-over design (Aguirre, 2007) to measure brain activity
   while volunteers listened to non-speech-affective vocalizations morphed
   on a continuum between anger and fear. Analyses dissociated neuronal
   adaptation effects induced by similarity in perceived emotional content
   between consecutive stimuli from those induced by their acoustic
   similarity. We found that bilateral voice-sensitive auditory regions as
   well as right amygdala coded the physical difference between consecutive
   stimuli. In contrast, activity in bilateral anterior insulae, medial
   superior frontal cortex, precuneus, and subcortical regions such as
   bilateral hippocampi depended predominantly on the perceptual difference
   between morphs. Our results suggest that the processing of vocal affect
   recognition is a multistep process involving largely distinct neural
   networks. Amygdala and auditory areas predominantly code emotion-related
   acoustic information while more anterior insular and prefrontal regions
   respond to the abstract, cognitive representation of vocal affect.}},

Abstract = {{Polysomnography (PSG) is still the standard in sleep monitoring, with
   several alternative solutions developed, including simplified
   electroencephalographic recorders such as SOMNOwatch plus EEG. In this
   study, we aimed to evaluate the validity of the recordings and of the
   analysis of the proprietary software of this solution, compared to PSG
   and semiautomatic scoring, respectively. From thirteen healthy adults,
   we recorded 27 nights simultaneously with a classical EEG amplifier
   (NeuroScan system) and the ambulatory SOMNOwatch plus EEG. Thereafter,
   we performed (semi-) automatic sleep analysis in Somnolyzer 24x7 and
   DOMINO Light (SOMNOwatch software). AASM scoring sensitivity of
   SOMNOwatch plus EEG, as revealed by Somnolyzer 24x7, was 97.79\%, and
   specificity 87.19\%. Paired T tests revealed no significant differences
   between the recordings of the two EEG systems, with intraclass
   correlation coefficients ranging from moderate to very good. When data
   were analyzed in DOMINO Light, sensitivity was 92.99\% and specificity
   was 80.90\%. Our data suggest that SOMNOwatch plus EEG might serve as a
   reliable instrument for recording sleep in healthy individuals, but its
   proprietary software, DOMINO Light, still seems to have weaknesses in
   terms of automatic sleep staging. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Studies investigating the neurophysiological basis of intrapersonal
   emotion regulation (control of one's own emotional experience) report
   that the frontal cortex exerts a modulatory effect on limbic structures
   such as the amygdala and insula. However, no imaging study to date has
   examined the neurophysiological processes involved in interpersonal
   emotion regulation, where the goal is explicitly to regulate another
   person's emotion. Twenty healthy participants (10 males) underwent fMRI
   while regulating their own or another person's emotions. Intrapersonal
   and interpersonal emotion regulation tasks recruited an overlapping
   network of brain regions including bilateral lateral frontal cortex,
   pre-supplementary motor area, and left temporo-parietal junction.
   Activations unique to the interpersonal condition suggest that both
   affective (emotional simulation) and cognitive (mentalizing) aspects of
   empathy may be involved in the process of interpersonal emotion
   regulation. These findings provide an initial insight into the neural
   correlates of regulating another person's emotions and may be relevant
   to understanding mental health issues that involve problems with social
   interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Humans have an automatic tendency to imitate others. Previous studies on
   how we control these tendencies have focused on reactive mechanisms,
   where inhibition of imitation is implemented after seeing an action.
   This work suggests that reactive control of imitation draws on at least
   partially specialized mechanisms. Here, we examine preparatory imitation
   control, where advance information allows control processes to be
   employed before an action is observed. Drawing on dual route models from
   the spatial compatibility literature, we compare control processes using
   biological and non-biological stimuli to determine whether preparatory
   imitation control recruits specialized neural systems that are similar
   to those observed in reactive imitation control. Results indicate that
   preparatory control involves anterior prefrontal, dorsolateral
   prefrontal, posterior parietal and early visual cortices regardless of
   whether automatic responses are evoked by biological (imitative) or
   non-biological stimuli. These results indicate both that preparatory
   control of imitation uses general mechanisms, and that preparatory
   control of imitation draws on different neural systems from reactive
   imitation control. Based on the regions involved, we hypothesize that
   preparatory control is implemented through top-down attentional biasing
   of visual processing.}},

   that amygdala modulation of hippocampal mnemonic representations, during
   the time of misleading social influence, is associated with reduced
   subsequent anterior-lateral prefrontal cortex activity that reflects
   correction. These findings illuminate the process by which erroneous
   beliefs are, or fail to be, rectified and highlight how past influence
   constrains subsequent correction.}},

   interactions among these regions during exploratory decision making were
   related to learning success. These findings link strategic exploration

Title = {{Dissociating retrieval success from incidental encoing activity during
   emotional memory retrieval, in the medial temporal lobe}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{The memory-enhancing effect of emotion has been linked to the engagement
   of emotion- and memory-related medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions
   (amygdala-AMY; hippocampus-HC; parahippocampus-PHC), during both
   encoding and retrieval. However, recognition tasks used to investigate
   the neural correlates of retrieval make it difficult to distinguish MTL
   engagement linked to retrieval success (RS) from that linked to
   incidental encoding success (ES) during retrieval. This issue has been
   investigated for retrieval of non-emotional memories, but not for
   emotional memory retrieval. To address this, we used event-related
   functional MRI in conjunction with an emotional distraction and two
   episodic memory tasks (one testing memory for distracter items and the
   other testing memory for new/lure items presented in the first memory
   task). This paradigm allowed for dissociation of MTL activity
   specifically linked to RS from that linked to both RS and incidental ES
   during retrieval. There were two novel findings regarding the neural
   correlates of emotional memory retrieval. First, greater emotional RS
   was identified bilaterally in AMY, HC, and PHC. However, AMY activity
   was most impacted when accounting for ES activity, as only RS activity
   in left AMY was dissociated from ES activity during retrieval, whereas
   portions of HC and PHC showing greater emotional RS were largely
   uninvolved in ES. Second, an earlier and more anteriorly spread response
   (left AMY and bilateral HC, PHC) was linked to greater emotional RS
   activity, whereas a later and more posteriorly localized response (right
   posterior PHC) was linked to greater neutral RS activity. These findings
   shed light on MTL mechanisms subserving the memory-enhancing effect of
   emotion at retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to stimulate a range of social
   behaviors. However, recent studies indicate that the effects of
   intranasal oxytocin are more nuanced than previously thought and that
   contextual factors and individual characteristics moderate the
   beneficiary oxytocin effects. In this randomized-controlled trial we
   examine the influence of intranasally administered oxytocin on neural
   activity during mind-reading with fMRI, taking into account harsh
   caregiving experiences as a potential moderator. Participants were 50
   women who received a nasal spray containing either 16 IU of oxytocin or
   a placebo and had reported how often their mother used love withdrawal
   as a disciplinary strategy. Participants performed an adapted version of
   the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), a task which requires
   individuals to infer mental states by looking at photographs of the eye
   region of faces. We found that oxytocin enhanced neural activation in
   the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and insula during the RMET. Moreover,
   oxytocin increased RMET performance outside the scanner. However, the
   oxytocin induced changes in STG activation and RMET performance were
   only brought about in potentially less socially proficient individuals
   who had low RMET performance, that is, participants reporting higher
   levels of maternal love withdrawal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   the Moral Condemnation of Harm}},
Journal = {{EMOTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{573-587}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Moral condemnation of harmful behavior is influenced by both cognitive
   and affective processes. However, despite much recent research, the
   proximate source of affect remains unclear. One obvious contender is
   empathy; simulating the victim's pain could lead one to judge an action
   as wrong ({''}outcome aversion{''}). An alternative, less obvious source
   is one's own aversion to performing the action itself ({''}action
   aversion{''}). To dissociate these alternatives, we developed a scale
   that assessed individual aversions to (a) witnessing others experience
   painful outcomes (e.g., seeing someone fall down stairs); and (b)
   performing actions that are harmless yet aversive (e.g., stabbing a
   fellow actor with a fake stage knife). Across 4 experiments, we found
   that moral condemnation of both first-person and third-party harmful
   behavior in the context of moral dilemmas is better predicted by one's
   aversion to action properties than by an affective response to victim
   suffering. In a fifth experiment, we manipulated both action aversion
   and the degree of expected suffering across a number of actions and
   found that both factors make large, independent contributions to moral
   judgment. Together, these results suggest we may judge others' actions
   by imagining what it would feel like to perform the action rather than
   experience the consequences of the action. Accordingly, they provide a
   counterpoint to a dominant but largely untested assumption that empathy
   is the key affective response governing moral judgments of harm.}},

Title = {{Can we predict burnout severity from empathy-related brain activity?}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Empathy cultivates deeper interpersonal relationships and is important
   for socialization. However, frequent exposure to emotionally-demanding
   situations may put people at risk for burnout. Burnout has become a
   pervasive problem among medical professionals because occupational
   burnout may be highly sensitive to empathy levels. To better understand
   empathy-induced burnout among medical professionals, exploring the
   relationship between burnout severity and strength of empathy-related
   brain activity may be key. However, to our knowledge, this relationship
   has not yet been explored. We studied the relationship between
   self-reported burnout severity scores and psychological measures of
   empathic disposition, emotional dissonance and alexithymia in medical
   professionals to test two contradictory hypotheses: Burnout is explained
   by (1) `compassion fatigue'; that is, individuals become emotionally
   over involved; and (2) `emotional dissonance'; that is, a gap between
   felt and expressed emotion, together with reduced emotional regulation.
   Then, we tested whether increased or decreased empathy-related brain
   activity measured by fMRI was associated with burnout severity scores
   and psychological measures. The results showed that burnout severity of
   medical professionals is explained by `reduced' empathy-related brain
   activity. Moreover, this reduced brain activity is correlated with
   stronger emotional dissonance and alexithymia scores and also greater
   empathic disposition. We speculate that reduced emotion recognition
   (that is, alexithymia) might potentially link with stronger emotional
   dissonance and greater burnout severity alongside empathy-related brain
   activity. In this view, greater empathic disposition in individuals with
   higher burnout levels might be due to greater difficulty identifying
   their own emotional reactions. Our study sheds new light on the ability
   to predict empathy-induced burnout.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine brain activation during facial
   emotion discrimination in first-episode of psychosis. Eighteen patients
   underwent an fMRI while performing a facial emotion discrimination task
   during the acute episode, before starting antipsychotic drugs. A second
   fMRI and clinical evaluation were performed after evident clinical
   improvement. An equivalent control group underwent the same two fMRIs
   with a similar period of time between exams. The voxel-wise approach
   showed pre-treatment hypoactivation in ventro-limbic regions (cluster
   including right hippocampus and left amygdala; cluster size 528; p
   cluster <0.004) and facial perception involved in ventral-posterior
   regions (bilateral lingual gyrus, calcarine fissure and occipital
   superior gyrus, (k = 1,508, p < 0.001) and fronto-temporal regions. The
   region of interest approach also confirmed hypoactivation in right and
   left amygdala (cluster corrected p = 0.035 and 0.043, respectively).
   After treatment and clinical improvement, the voxel-wise approach showed
   a significant increase in activity in lingual gyrus and calcarine
   fissure in the group of patients. The regions of interest analysis
   showed an increase in amygdala activity during anger discrimination also
   in the group of patients. The results suggest a state-dependent model
   depicting a flattened and aberrant response of amygdala to emotion
   discrimination that could explain the seemingly contradictory previous
   findings of hypo-and hyper-amygdala activation.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are sophisticated social beings. Social cues from others are
   exceptionally salient, particularly during adolescence. Understanding
   how adolescents interpret and learn from variable social signals can
   provide insight into the observed shift in social sensitivity during
   this period. The present study tested 120 participants between the ages
   of 8 and 25 years on a social reinforcement learning task where the
   probability of receiving positive social feedback was parametrically
   manipulated. Seventy-eight of these participants completed the task
   during fMRI scanning. Modeling trial-by-trial learning, children and
   adults showed higher positive learning rates than did adolescents,
   suggesting that adolescents demonstrated less differentiation in their
   reaction times for peers who provided more positive feedback. Forming
   expectations about receiving positive social reinforcement correlated
   with neural activity within the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral
   striatum across age. Adolescents, unlike children and adults, showed
   greater insular activity during positive prediction error learning and
   increased activity in the supplementary motor cortex and the putamen
   when receiving positive social feedback regardless of the expected
   outcome, suggesting that peer approval may motivate adolescents toward
   action. While different amounts of positive social reinforcement
   enhanced learning in children and adults, all positive social
   reinforcement equally motivated adolescents. Together, these findings
   indicate that sensitivity to peer approval during adolescence goes
   beyond simple reinforcement theory accounts and suggest possible
   explanations for how peers may motivate adolescent behavior.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The central goal of presurgical language mapping is to identify brain
   regions that subserve cortical language function to minimize
   postsurgical language deficits. Presurgical language mapping in patients
   with epilepsy presents a key challenge because of the atypical pattern
   of hemispheric language dominance found in this population, with higher
   incidences of bilateral and right-biased language dominance than
   typical. In this prospective study, we combine magnetoencephalography
   with a panel of tasks designed to separately assess receptive and
   expressive function to provide a sensitive measure of language function
   in 15 candidates for resective surgery. We report the following: 4 of 15
   patients (27\%) showed left hemisphere dominance across all tasks, 4 of
   15 patients (27\%) showed right hemisphere dominance across all tasks,
   and 7 of 15 (46\%) showed discordant language dominance, with
   right-dominant receptive and left-dominant expressive language. All
   patients with discordant language dominance showed this right-receptive
   and left-expressive pattern. Results provide further evidence supporting
   the importance of using a panel of tasks to assess separable aspects of
   language function. The clinical relevance of the findings is discussed,
   especially about current clinical operative measures for assessing
   language dominance, which use single hemisphere procedure (intracarotid
   amobarbital procedure and awake intraoperative stimulation) for
   determining language laterality.}},

Abstract = {{Aim This study aimed to examine differences in brain activation for

   imaging (fMRI). Methods AIA (n=15) and NA (n=15) underwent fMRI while
   performing easy tasks for which performance feedback (PF), social reward
   (SR) (such as compliments), or monetary reward (MR) was given. Using the
   no reward (NR) condition, three types of contrasts (PF-NR, SR-NR, and
   MR-NR) were analyzed. Results In NA, we observed activation in the
   reward-related subcortical system, self-related brain region, and other
   brain areas for the three contrasts, but these brain areas showed almost
   no activation in AIA. Instead, AIA showed significant activation in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for the PF-NR contrast and the negative
   correlation was found between the level of activation in the left
   superior temporal gyrus (BA 22) and the duration of Internet game use
   per day in AIA. Conclusion These findings suggest that AIA show reduced
   levels of self-related brain activation and decreased reward sensitivity
   irrespective of the type of reward and feedback. AIA may be only
   sensitive to error monitoring regardless of positive feelings, such as
   sense of satisfaction or achievement.}},

Abstract = {{In the current functional MRI study, we investigated interactions
   between reward and threat processing. Visual cues at the start of each
   trial informed participants about the chance of winning monetary reward
   and/or receiving a mild aversive shock. We tested two competing
   hypothesis: according to the `salience hypothesis', in the condition
   involving both reward and threat, enhanced activation would be observed
   because of increased salience; according to the `competition
   hypothesis', the processing of reward and threat would trade-off against
   each other, leading to reduced activation. Analysis of skin conductance
   data during a delay phase revealed an interaction between reward and
   threat processing, such that the effect of reward was reduced during
   threat and the effect of threat was reduced during reward. Analysis of
   imaging data during the same task phase revealed interactions between
   reward and threat processing in several regions, including the
   midbrain/ventral tegmental area, caudate, putamen, bed nucleus of the
   stria terminalis, anterior insula, middle frontal gyrus and dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex. Taken together, our findings reveal
   conditions during which reward and threat trade-off against each other
   across multiple sites. Such interactions are suggestive of competitive
   processes and may reflect the organization of opponent systems in the
   brain.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety is the cognitive state related to the inability to control
   emotional responses to perceived threats. Anxiety is inversely related
   to brain activity associated with the cognitive regulation of emotions.
   Mindfulness meditation has been found to regulate anxiety. However, the
   brain mechanisms involved in meditation-related anxiety relief are
   largely unknown. We employed pulsed arterial spin labeling MRI to
   compare the effects of distraction in the form of attending to the
   breath (ATB; before meditation training) to mindfulness meditation
   (after meditation training) on state anxiety across the same subjects.
   Fifteen healthy subjects, with no prior meditation experience,
   participated in 4 d of mindfulness meditation training. ATB did not
   reduce state anxiety, but state anxiety was significantly reduced in
   every session that subjects meditated. Meditation-related anxiety relief
   was associated with activation of the anterior cingulate cortex,
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula. Meditation-related
   activation in these regions exhibited a strong relationship to anxiety
   relief when compared to ATB. During meditation, those who exhibited

Abstract = {{Although much is known about the neural dynamics of maladaptive
   affective styles, the mechanisms of happiness and well-being are less
   clear. One possibility is that the neural processes of trait happiness
   are the opposite of those involved in depression/anxiety: `rose-colored
   glasses' cause happy people to focus on positive cues while remaining
   oblivious to threats. Specifically, because negative affective styles
   have been associated with increased amygdala activation to negative
   stimuli, it may be happy people will not show this enhanced response,
   and may even show reduced amygdala activation to negative stimuli.
   Alternatively, if well-being entails appropriate sensitivity to
   information, happy people may process any relevant cues-positive or
   negative-to facilitate appropriate responding. This would mean that
   happiness is associated with increased amygdala activation to both
   positive and negative stimuli. Forty-two participants viewed affective
   stimuli during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Happier
   participants showed greater amygdala responses to positive stimuli.
   Moreover, no significant relationships were found between happiness and
   responses to negative stimuli. In other words, for happy people, a
   tuning toward positive did not come at the cost of losing sensitivity to
   negativity. This work suggests that trait happiness is associated with a
   balanced amygdala response to positivity and negativity.}},

Abstract = {{Mindfulness-an attentive non-judgmental focus on present experiences-is
   increasingly incorporated in psychotherapeutic treatments as a skill
   fostering emotion regulation. Neurobiological mechanisms of actively
   induced emotion regulation are associated with prefrontally mediated
   down-regulation of, for instance, the amygdala. We were interested in
   neurobiological correlates of a short mindfulness instruction during
   emotional arousal. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   investigated effects of a short mindfulness intervention during the cued
   expectation and perception of negative and potentially negative pictures
   (50\% probability) in 24 healthy individuals compared to 22 controls.
   The mindfulness intervention was associated with increased activations
   in prefrontal regions during the expectation of negative and potentially
   negative pictures compared to controls. During the perception of
   negative stimuli, reduced activation was identified in regions involved
   in emotion processing (amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus). Prefrontal and
   right insular activations when expecting negative pictures correlated
   negatively with trait mindfulness, suggesting that more mindful
   individuals required less regulatory resources to attenuate emotional
   arousal. Our findings suggest emotion regulatory effects of a short
   mindfulness intervention on a neurobiological level.}},

Abstract = {{Acute peripheral inflammation with corresponding increases in peripheral
   cytokines affects neuropsychological functions and induces
   depression-like symptoms. However, possible effects of increased immune
   responses on social cognition remain unknown. Therefore, this study
   investigated the effects of experimentally induced acute inflammation on
   performance and neural responses during a social cognition task
   assessing Theory of Mind (ToM) ability. In this double-blind randomized
   crossover functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 18 healthy
   right-handed male volunteers received an injection of bacterial
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0.4 ng/kg) or saline, respectively. Plasma
   levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as mood ratings
   were analyzed together with brain activation during a validated ToM task
   (i.e. Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test). LPS administration induced
   pronounced transient increases in pro- (IL-6, TNF-alpha) and
   anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL-1ra) cytokines as well as decreases in
   mood. Social cognition performance was not affected by acute
   inflammation. However, altered neural activity was observed during the
   ToM task after LPS administration, reflected by increased responses in
   the fusiform gyrus, temporo-parietal junction, superior temporal gyrus
   and precuneus. The increased task-related neural responses in the LPS
   condition may reflect a compensatory strategy or a greater social
   cognitive processing as a function of sickness.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathy is a personality disorder associated with callous and
   impulsive behavior and criminal recidivism. It has long been theorized
   that psychopaths have deficits in processing reward and punishment.
   Here, we use structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   examine the neural correlates of reward and loss sensitivity in a group
   of criminal psychopaths. Forty-one adult male prison inmates (n = 18
   psychopaths and n = 23 non-psychopaths) completed a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging task involving the gain or loss of money. Across the
   entire sample of participants, monetary gains elicited robust activation
   within the ventral striatum (VS). Although psychopaths and
   non-psychopaths did not significantly differ with respect to overall
   levels of VS response to reward vs loss, we observed significantly
   different correlations between VS responses and psychopathy severity
   within each group. Volumetric analyses of striatal subregions revealed a
   similar pattern of correlations, specifically for the right accumbens
   area within VS. In a separate sample of inmates (n = 93 psychopaths and
   n = 117 non-psychopaths) who completed a self-report measure of
   appetitive motivation, we again found that the correlation with
   psychopathy severity differed between groups. These convergent results
   offer novel insight into the neural substrates of reward and loss
   processing in psychopathy.}},

Abstract = {{The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is consistently involved in
   tasks requiring the processing of mental states, and much rarer so by
   tasks that do not involve mental state inferences. We hypothesized that
   the dmPFC might be more generally involved in high construal of stimuli,
   defined as the formation of concepts or ideas by omitting non-essential
   features of stimuli, irrespective of their social or non-social nature.
   In an fMRI study, we presented pictures of a person engaged in everyday
   activities (social stimuli) or of objects (non-social stimuli) and
   induced a higher level of construal by instructing participants to
   generate personality traits of the person or categories to which the
   objects belonged. This was contrasted against a lower level task where
   participants had to describe these same pictures visually. As predicted,
   we found strong involvement of the dmPFC in high construal, with
   substantial overlap across social and non-social stimuli, including
   shared activation in the vmPFC/OFC, parahippocampal, fusiform and

Abstract = {{Recent studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the loss of
   reward sensitivity in the aging brain. Although such an age effect might
   be due to a decline of physiological processes, it may also be a
   consequence of age-related changes in motivational preference for
   different rewards. Here, we examined whether the age effects on neural
   correlates of reward anticipation are modulated by the type of expected
   reward. Functional magnetic resonance images were acquired in 24 older
   (60-78 years) and 24 young participants (20-28 years) while they
   performed an incentive delay task offering monetary or social rewards.
   Anticipation of either reward type recruited brain structures associated
   with reward, including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Region of interest
   analysis revealed an interaction effect of reward type and age group in
   the right NAcc: enhanced activation to cues of social reward was
   detected in the older subsample while enhanced activation to cues of
   monetary reward was detected in the younger subsample. Our results
   suggest that neural sensitivity to reward-predicting cues does not
   generally decrease with age. Rather, neural responses in the NAcc appear
   to be modulated by the type of reward, presumably reflecting age-related
   changes in motivational value attributed to different types of reward.}},

Abstract = {{Major depression goes along with affective and social-cognitive
   deficits. Most research on affective deficits in depression has,
   however, only focused on unimodal emotion processing, whereas in daily
   life, emotional perception is often highly dependent on the evaluation
   of multimodal inputs. We thus investigated emotional audiovisual
   integration in patients with depression and healthy subjects. Subjects
   rated the expression of happy, neutral and fearful faces while
   concurrently being exposed to emotional or neutral sounds. Results
   demonstrated group differences in left inferior frontal gyrus and
   inferior parietal cortex when comparing incongruent to congruent happy
   facial conditions, mainly due to a failure of patients to deactivate
   these regions in response to congruent stimulus pairs. Moreover, healthy
   subjects decreased activation in right posterior superior temporal
   gyrus/sulcus and midcingulate cortex when an emotional stimulus was
   paired with a neutral rather than another emotional one. In contrast,
   patients did not show such deactivation when neutral stimuli were
   integrated. These results demonstrate aberrant neural response in
   audiovisual processing in depression, indicated by failure to deactivate
   regions involved in inhibition and salience processing when congruent
   and neutral audiovisual stimuli pairs are integrated, providing a

Abstract = {{Emotional reactivity and the ability to modulate an emotional state,
   which are important factors for psychological well-being, are often
   dysregulated in psychiatric disorders. Neural correlates of emotional
   states have mostly been studied at the group level, thereby neglecting
   individual differences in the intensity of emotional experience. This
   study investigates the relationship between brain activity and
   interindividual variation in subjective affect ratings. A standardized
   mood induction (MI) procedure, using positive facial expression and
   autobiographical memories, was applied to 54 healthy participants (28
   female), who rated their subjective affective state before and after the
   MI. We performed a regression analysis with brain activation during MI
   and changes in subjective affect ratings. An increase in positive
   affective ratings correlated with activity in the amygdala, hippocampus
   and the fusiform gyrus (FFG), whereas reduced positive affect correlated
   with activity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Activations in
   the amygdala, hippocampus and FFG are possibly linked to strategies
   adopted by the participants to achieve mood changes. Subgenual cingulate
   cortex activation has been previously shown to relate to rumination.
   This finding is in line with previous observations of the subgenual
   cingulate's role in emotion regulation and its clinical relevance to
   therapy and prognosis of mood disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Although empathy is crucial for successful social interactions,
   excessive sharing of others' negative emotions may be maladaptive and
   constitute a source of burnout. To investigate functional neural
   plasticity underlying the augmentation of empathy and to test the
   counteracting potential of compassion, one group of participants was
   first trained in empathic resonance and subsequently in compassion. In
   response to videos depicting human suffering, empathy training, but not
   memory training (control group), increased negative affect and brain
   activations in anterior insula and anterior midcingulate cortex-brain
   regions previously associated with empathy for pain. In contrast,
   subsequent compassion training could reverse the increase in negative
   effect and, in contrast, augment self-reports of positive affect. In
   addition, compassion training increased activations in a non-overlapping
   brain network spanning ventral striatum, pregenual anterior cingulate
   cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex. We conclude that training
   compassion may reflect a new coping strategy to overcome empathic
   distress and strengthen resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD), which is characterized by the fear of
   being rejected and negatively evaluated, involves altered brain
   activation during the processing of negative emotions in a social
   context. Although associated temperament traits, such as shyness or
   behavioral inhibition, have been studied, there is still insufficient
   knowledge to support the dimensional approach, which assumes a continuum
   from subclinical to clinical levels of social anxiety symptoms. This
   study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the
   neural bases of individual differences in social anxiety. Our sample
   included participants with both healthy/subclinical as well as clinical
   levels of social anxiety. Forty-six participants with a wide range of
   social anxiety levels performed a gender decision task with emotional
   facial expressions during fMRI scanning. Activation in the left anterior
   insula and right lateral prefrontal cortex in response to angry faces
   was positively correlated with the level of social anxiety in a
   regression analysis. The results substantiate, with a dimensional
   approach, those obtained in previous studies that involved SAD patients
   or healthy and subclinical participants. It may help to refine further
   therapeutic strategies based on markers of social anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Although face detection likely played an essential adaptive role in our

   been few rigorous studies investigating its neural correlates. MJH, a
   prosopagnosic with bilateral lesions to the ventral temporal-occipital
   cortices encompassing the posterior face areas (fusiform and occipital
   face areas), expresses no subjective difficulty in face detection,
   suggesting that these posterior face areas do not mediate face detection
   exclusively. Despite his normal contrast sensitivity and visual acuity
   in foveal vision, the present study nevertheless revealed significant
   face detection deficits in MJH. Compared with controls, MJH showed a
   lower tolerance to noise in the phase spectrum for faces (vs. cars),
   reflected in his higher detection threshold for faces. MJH's lesions in
   bilateral occipito-temporal cortices thus appear to have produced a
   deficit not only in face individuation, but also in face detection.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) represent a formidable challenge for
   psychiatry and neuroscience because of their high prevalence, lifelong
   nature, complexity and substantial heterogeneity. Facing these obstacles
   requires large-scale multidisciplinary efforts. Although the field of
   genetics has pioneered data sharing for these reasons, neuroimaging had
   not kept pace. In response, we introduce the Autism Brain Imaging Data
   Exchange (ABIDE)-a grassroots consortium aggregating and openly sharing
   1112 existing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (R-fMRI) data sets with corresponding structural MRI and phenotypic
   information from 539 individuals with ASDs and 573 age-matched typical
   controls (TCs; 7-64 years) (http://fcon\_ 1000. projects. nitrc.
   org/indi/abide/). Here, we present this resource and demonstrate its
   suitability for advancing knowledge of ASD neurobiology based on
   analyses of 360 male subjects with ASDs and 403 male age-matched TCs. We
   focused on whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity and also survey
   a range of voxel-wise measures of intrinsic functional brain
   architecture. Whole-brain analyses reconciled seemingly disparate themes
   of both hypo-and hyperconnectivity in the ASD literature; both were
   detected, although hypoconnectivity dominated, particularly for
   corticocortical and interhemispheric functional connectivity.
   Exploratory analyses using an array of regional metrics of intrinsic
   brain function converged on common loci of dysfunction in ASDs (mid-and
   posterior insula and posterior cingulate cortex), and highlighted less
   commonly explored regions such as the thalamus. The survey of the ABIDE
   R-fMRI data sets provides unprecedented demonstrations of both
   replication and novel discovery. By pooling multiple international data
   sets, ABIDE is expected to accelerate the pace of discovery setting the
   stage for the next generation of ASD studies.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies in adults have revealed that attentional distraction
   modulates the late positive potential (LPP) during emotion regulation.
   To determine whether early visual components reflect developmental
   changes in attentional distraction during adolescence, we collected
   event-related potentials from 20 young adolescents, 18 older
   adolescents, and 18 young adults as they performed a distraction task
   (counting) while viewing affective images. Consistent with previous
   findings obtained in distraction studies, the distraction task
   (counting) reduced emotional modulation of the LPP. At an early-stage of
   processing, counting reduced emotional mbdulation of P1 and increased
   the negativity bias of early frontal negativity (eFN) for negatively
   valenced pictures compared to simple viewing with no distraction.
   sLO-RETA analyses further revealed eFN indexing of rostral prefrontal
   cortical activation, a cortical area that has been shown in recent fMRI
   studies to be activated by distraction. Moreover, P1 amplitudes in young
   and older adolescents did not differ but were both larger than the P1s
   in young adults. In addition, eFN amplitudes significantly decreased
   with age. The dissociable distraction patterns between the posterior P1
   and eFN provide evidence not only for the timing hypothesis of emotion
   regulation but also for different developmental trajectories of visual
   processing areas and the prefrontal cortex during affective processing
   in adolescence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Task preparation and neural activation in stimulus-specific brain
   regions: An fMRI study with the cued task-switching paradigm}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{39-51}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the role of posterior brain regions related to
   task-relevant stimulus processing in task preparation, we used a cued
   task-switching paradigm in which a pre-cue informed participants about
   the upcoming task on a trial: face discrimination or number comparison.
   Employing an event-related fMRI design, we examined for changes of
   activity in face- and number-related posterior brain regions (right
   fusiform face area (FFA) and right intraparietal sulcus (IPSnum),
   respectively), and explored the functional connectivity of these areas
   with other brain regions, during the (preparation) interval between cue
   onset and onset of the (to-be-responded) target stimulus. The results
   revealed task-relevant posterior brain regions to be modulated during
   this period: activation in task-relevant stimulus-specific regions was
   selectively enhanced and their functional connectivity to task-relevant
   anterior brain regions strengthened (right FFA - face task, right IPSnum
   - number task) while participants prepared for the cued task.
   Additionally, activity in task-relevant posterior brain regions was
   influenced by residual activation from the preceding trial in the right
   FFA and the right IPSnum, respectively. These findings indicate that,
   during task preparation, the activation pattern in currently
   task-relevant posterior brain regions is shaped by residual activation
   as well as preparatory modulation prior to the onset of the critical
   stimulus, even without participants being instructed to imagine the
   stimulus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Early postnatal infection with human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) may
   contribute to an adverse cognitive outcome in early preterm-born
   children (PT). We here set out to explore whether long-term
   neurobiological consequences of such an infection are detectable using
   fMRI in children and adolescents who were born very preterm and who
   either did (PThCMV+) or did not (PThCMV-) suffer from an early postnatal
   hCMV-infection, when compared with typically developing healthy control
   (HC) subjects. Overall, data from 71 children and adolescents could be
   included, 34 PT (of which 15 were PT (hCMV+) and 19 were PT (hCMV-)) and
   37 HC. Using a recently established dual use fMRI task, we investigated
   language and visuospatial functions. There were significant activation
   differences in the left hippocampus (PT > HC and PThCMV+ > HC), and in
   the right anterior cingulate cortex (PThCMV- > PThCMV+) when performing
   the language task. Surprisingly, only a small region in the occipital
   cortex showed a significant activation difference (HC > PT (HCMV-)) when
   performing the visuospatial task. Targeted analyses revealed differences
   in gray matter volume, but not density, in several brain regions. Our
   results suggest that long-term neurobiological consequences of an early
   postnatal hCMV infection are detectable even in older children and
   adolescents formerly born very preterm, compatible with a higher effort
   when performing a cognitive task. This suggests that measures to prevent
   such an infection are warranted. Furthermore, an interrelation of brain
   structure and function was detected that may constitute a severe
   confound when using fMRI to compare structurally differing groups. Hum

Abstract = {{Naturalistic observation and experimental studies in humans and other

   triggers helping behavior. The aim of the present study is to clarify
   the neurofunctional basis of social influences on individual helping
   behavior. We investigate whether when participants witness an emergency,
   while performing an unrelated color-naming task in an fMRI scanner, the
   number of bystanders present at the emergency influences neural activity
   in regions related to action preparation. The results show a decrease in
   activity with the increase in group size in the left pre- and
   postcentral gyri and left medial frontal gyrus. In contrast, regions
   related to visual perception and attention show an increase in activity.
   These results demonstrate the neural mechanisms of social influence on
   automatic action preparation that is at the core of helping behavior

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that depression is a risk factor for dementia;
   however, the relationship between the two conditions is not fully
   understood. A novel gene (TOMM40) has been consistently associated with
   Alzheimer's disease (AD), but has received no attention in depression.
   We conducted a three-level cross-sectional study to investigate the
   association of the TOMM40 rs2075650 SNP with depression. We recruited a
   community sample of 1220 participants (571 controls, 649 lifetime
   depression) to complete a psychiatric background questionnaire, the
   Brief Symptom Inventory, and Big Five Inventory at Level-1, 243 (102
   controls, 97 remitted, 44 currently depressed) to complete a face-toface
   clinical interview and neuropsychological testing at Level-2 and 58 (33
   controls, 25 remitted) to complete an emotional face-processing task
   during fMRI at Level-3. Our results indicated that the TOMM40 rs2075650
   G allele was a significant risk factor for lifetime depression (p =
   0.00006) and, in depressed subjects, was a significant predictor of low
   extraversion (p = 0.009). Currently depressed risk allele carriers
   showed subtle executive dysfunction (p =0.004) and decreased positive
   memory bias (p =0.021) together with reduced activity in the posterior
   (p((FwE)) = 0.045) and anterior (p((FwE)) = 0.041) cingulate during sad
   face emotion processing. Our results suggest that TOMM40 rs2075650 may
   be a risk factor for the development of depression characterized by
   reduced extraversion, impaired executive function, and decreased
   positive emotional recall, and reduced top-down cortical control during
   sad emotion processing.}},

Abstract = {{Unaffected first-degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia
   (i.e., those at familial high-risk {[}FHR]), demonstrate social
   dysfunction qualitatively similar though less severe than that of their
   affected relatives. These social difficulties may be the consequence of
   genetically conferred disruption to aspects of the default mode network
   (DMN), such as the dMPFC subsystem, which overlaps with the network of
   brain regions recruited during social cognitive processes. In the
   present study, we investigate this possibility, testing DMN connectivity
   and its relationship to social functioning in FHR using resting-state
   fMRI. Twenty FHR individuals and 17 controls underwent fMRI during a
   resting-state scan. Hypothesis-driven functional connectivity analyses
   examined ROI-to-ROI correlations between the DMN's hubs, and regions of
   the dMPFC subsystem and MTL subsystem. Connectivity values were examined
   in relationship to a measure of social functioning and
   empathy/perspective-taking. Results demonstrate that FHR exhibit reduced
   connectivity specifically within the dMPFC subsystem of the DMN. Certain
   ROI-to-ROI correlations predicted aspects of social functioning and
   empathy/perspective-taking across all participants. Together, the data
   indicate that disruption to the dMPFC subsystem of the DMN may be
   associated with familial risk for schizophrenia, and that these
   intrinsic connections may carry measurable consequences for social
   functioning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Extinction is an important mechanism to inhibit initially acquired fear
   responses. There is growing evidence that the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC) inhibits the amygdala and therefore plays an important
   role in the extinction of delay fear conditioning. To our knowledge,
   there is no evidence on the role of the prefrontal cortex in the
   extinction of trace conditioning up to now. Thus, we compared brain
   structures involved in the extinction of human delay and trace fear
   conditioning in a between-subjects-design in an fMRI study. Participants
   were passively guided through a virtual environment during learning and
   extinction of conditioned fear. Two different lights served as
   conditioned stimuli (CS); as unconditioned stimulus (US) a mildly
   painful electric stimulus was delivered. In the delay conditioning group
   (DCG) the US was administered with offset of one light (CS+), whereas in
   the trace conditioning group (TCG) the US was presented 4s after CS+
   offset. Both groups showed insular and striatal activation during early
   extinction, but differed in their prefrontal activation. The vmPFC was
   mainly activated in the DCG, whereas the TCG showed activation of the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during extinction. These results
   point to different extinction processes in delay and trace conditioning.
   VmPFC activation during extinction of delay conditioning might reflect
   the inhibition of the fear response. In contrast, dlPFC activation
   during extinction of trace conditioning may reflect modulation of
   working memory processes which are involved in bridging the trace
   interval and hold information in short term memory.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the neural basis of poor impulse control in Internet
   addiction (IA) is important for understanding the neurobiological
   mechanisms of this syndrome. The current study investigated how neuronal
   pathways implicated in response inhibition were affected in IA using a
   Go-Stop paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Twenty-three control subjects aged 15.2 +/- 0.5 years (mean 6 S.D.) and
   eighteen IA subjects aged 15.1 +/- 1.4 years were studied. Effective
   connectivity within the response inhibition network was quantified using
   (stochastic) dynamic causal modeling (DCM). The results showed that the
   indirect frontal-basal ganglia pathway was engaged by response
   inhibition in healthy subjects. However, we did not detect any
   equivalent effective connectivity in the IA group. This suggests the IA
   subjects fail to recruit this pathway and inhibit unwanted actions. This
   study provides a clear link between Internet addiction as a behavioral
   disorder and aberrant connectivity in the response inhibition network.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 20}},
Abstract = {{Members of the Critical Neuroscience initiative raised the question
   whether the perceived normative significance of neuroscience is
   justified by the discipline's actual possibilities. In this paper I show
   how brain research was assigned the ultimate political, social, and
   moral authority by some leading researchers who suggested that
   neuroscientists should change their research priorities, promising
   solutions to social challenges in order to increase research funds.
   Discussing the two examples of cognitive enhancement and the
   neuroscience of (im)moral behavior I argue that there is indeed a gap
   between promises and expectations on the one hand and knowledge and
   applications on the other. However it would be premature to generalize
   this to the neurosciences at large, whose knowledge producing,
   innovative, and economic potentials have just recently been confirmed by
   political and scientific decision-makers with the financial support for
   the Human Brain Project and the BRAIN Initiative, Finally, I discuss two
   explanations for the analyzed communication patterns and argue why
   Critical Neuroscience is necessary, but not sufficient. A more general
   Critical Science movement is required to improve the scientific
   incentive system.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{267}},

Abstract = {{Although extensively investigated in sociocognitive neuroscience,
   empathy is difficult to study. The first difficulty originates in its
   multifaceted nature. According to the multidimensional model, empathy
   combines emotional, automatic (simulation), cognitive (mentalizing) and
   regulatory (executive functions) processes. Substantial functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data demonstrated that co-activations
   in the mirror neuron system (MNS) and mentalizing network (MENT) sustain
   this co-recruitment of so-called first-and second-person-like processes.
   Because of the poor temporal resolution of fMRI techniques, we currently
   lack evidence about the precise timing of the MNS-MENT combination. An
   important challenge is, thus, to disentangle how MNS and MENT
   dynamically work together along time in empathy. Moreover, the role of
   the executive functions in the MNS-MENT combination time course is still
   unknown. Second, empathy - feeling into - is closely related to sympathy
   - feeling with - and both phenomena are often conflated in experimental
   studies on intersubjectivity. In this electrical neuroimaging (EEG)
   pilot-study, we tested whether the egocentered vs. heterocentered
   visuo-spatial mechanisms respectively associated with sympathy and
   empathy differentially modulate the dynamic combination of the MNS-MENT
   activations in their respective neural time course. For that, we
   employed our newly developed behavioral paradigm assessing the
   visuospatial - but not emotional - features of empathy and sympathy.
   Using a data-driven approach, we report that empathy and sympathy are
   underlied by sequential activations in the MNS from the insula to the
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) between 63 ms and 424 ms. However, at
   333-424 ms, empathy triggered greater co-activations in the right IFG
   and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (executive functions).
   Linking together our present and prior (Thirioux et al., 2010) findings
   from the same dataset, we suggest that this greater recruitment of the
   right dlPFC monitors the shift from egocentered and first-person-like
   mechanisms in the MNS to heterocentered and second-person-like
   mechanisms in the left temporo-parietal junction within the MENT, i.e.,
   reflecting the onset of perspective-change processes in the neural time
   course of empathy. Contrasting with sympathy, this recruitment of the
   executive functions could modulate the output end of the mirroring
   processing in the premotor and sensorimotor cortices. (C) 2014 IBRO.

Title = {{A Correspondence between Individual Differences in the Brain's Intrinsic

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Although neural activity often reflects the processing of external
   inputs, intrinsic fluctuations in activity have been observed throughout
   the brain. These may relate to patterns of self-generated thought that
   can occur while not performing goal-driven tasks. To understand the
   relationship between self-generated mental activity and intrinsic neural
   fluctuations, we developed the New York Cognition Questionnaire (NYC-Q)
   to assess the content and form of an individual's experiences during the
   acquisition of resting-state fMRI data. The data were collected as a
   part of the Nathan Kline Rockland Enhanced sample. We decomposed NYC-Q
   scores using exploratory factor analysis and found that self-reported
   thoughts clustered into distinct dimensions of content (future related,
   past related, positive, negative, and social) and form (words, images,
   and specificity). We used these components to perform an individual
   difference analysis exploring how differences in the types of
   self-generated thoughts relate to whole brain measures of intrinsic
   brain activity (fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations,
   regional homogeneity, and degree centrality). We found patterns of
   self-generated thoughts related to changes that were distributed across
   a wide range of cortical areas. For example, individuals who reported
   greater imagery exhibited greater low frequency fluctuations in a region
   of perigenual cingulate cortex, a region that is known to participate in
   the so-called default-mode network. We also found certain forms of
   thought were associated with other areas, such as primary visual cortex,
   the insula, and the cerebellum. For example, individuals who reported
   greater future thought exhibited less homogeneous neural fluctuations in
   a region of lateral occipital cortex, a result that is consistent with
   the claim that particular types of self-generated thought depend on
   processes that are decoupled from sensory processes. These data provide
   evidence that self-generated thought is a heterogeneous category of
   experience and that studying its content can be helpful in understanding
   brain dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the differences in brain fMRI signal complexity in
   patients with schizophrenia while performing the Cyberball social
   exclusion task, using measures of Sample entropy and Hurst exponent (H).
   13 patients meeting diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM IV) criteria for schizophrenia and 16
   healthy controls underwent fMRI scanning at 1.5 T. The fMRI data of both
   groups of participants were pre-processed, the entropy characterized and
   the Hurst exponent extracted. Whole brain entropy and H maps of the
   groups were generated and analysed. The results after adjusting for age
   and sex differences together show that patients with schizophrenia
   exhibited higher complexity than healthy controls, at mean whole brain
   and regional levels. Also, both Sample entropy and Hurst exponent agree
   that patients with schizophrenia have more complex fMRI signals than
   healthy controls. These results suggest that schizophrenia is associated
   with more complex signal patterns when compared to healthy controls,
   supporting the increase in complexity hypothesis, where system
   complexity increases with age or disease, and also consistent with the
   notion that schizophrenia is characterised by a dysregulation of the
   nonlinear dynamics of underlying neuronal systems.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural evidence suggests that English regular past tense forms are
   automatically decomposed into their stem and affix (played = play+ed)
   based on an implicit linguistic rule, which does not apply to the
   idiosyncratically formed irregular forms (kept). Additionally, regular,
   but not irregular inflections, are thought to be processed through the
   procedural memory system (left inferior frontal gyrus, basal ganglia,
   cerebellum). It has been suggested that this distinction does not to
   apply to second language (L2) learners of English; however, this has not
   been tested at the brain level. This fMRI study used a masked-priming
   task with regular and irregular prime-target pairs
   (played-play/kept-keep) to investigate morphological processing in
   native and highly proficient late L2 English speakers. No between-groups
   differences were revealed. Compared to irregular pairs, regular pairs
   activated the pars opercularis, bilateral caudate nucleus and the right
   cerebellum, which are part of the procedural memory network and have
   been connected with the processing of morphologically complex forms. Our
   study is the first to provide evidence for native-like involvement of
   the procedural memory system in processing of regular past tense by late
   L2 learners of English.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitions and emotions can be influenced by bodily physiology. Here, we
   investigated whether the processing of brief fear stimuli is selectively
   gated by their timing in relation to individual heartbeats. Emotional
   and neutral faces were presented to human volunteers at cardiac systole,
   when ejection of blood from the heart causes arterial baroreceptors to
   signal centrally the strength and timing of each heartbeat, and at
   diastole, the period between heartbeats when baroreceptors are
   quiescent. Participants performed behavioral and neuroimaging tasks to
   determine whether these interoceptive signals influence the detection of
   emotional stimuli at the threshold of conscious awareness and alter
   judgments of emotionality of fearful and neutral faces. Our results show
   that fearful faces were detected more easily and were rated as more
   intense at systole than at diastole. Correspondingly, amygdala responses
   were greater to fearful faces presented at systole relative to diastole.
   These novel findings highlight a major channel by which short-term
   interoceptive fluctuations enhance perceptual and evaluative processes
   specifically related to the processing of fear and threat and counter
   the view that baroreceptor afferent signaling is always inhibitory to
   sensory perception.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{568}},
Pages = {{50-55}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have consistently identified a network of brain
   regions responsible for making inferences of others' mental states. This
   network includes the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior superior
   temporal sulcus (pSTS) at the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and
   temporal poles. Although TPJ and MPFC are key nodes of the Theory of
   Mind (ToM) network, their relative functional roles are still debated.
   This study sought to examine the contribution of these regions in causal
   attribution and to explore the nature of the ToM network in people with
   autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Participants watched a series of comic
   strip vignettes in the MRI scanner, and identified the most logical
   ending to each vignette, which sometimes required intentional causal
   attribution. Independent component analysis was done to isolate
   temporally correlated brain networks. The functional networks for
   intentional causality included the TPJ and MPFC, with an increased
   contribution of TPJ. There was also a significant group difference in
   the TPJ, with reduced response in participants with ASD. These results
   suggest an increased role of TPJ in intentional causality. In addition,
   the reduced response in ASD in TPJ may reflect their difficulties in
   social cognition. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   avoidance' while evaluating emotional stimuli explicitly?}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: The affective personality trait `harm avoidance' (HA) from
   Cloninger's psychobiological personality model determines how an
   individual deals with emotional stimuli. Emotional stimuli are processed
   by a neural network that include the left and right amygdalae as
   important key nodes. Explicit, implicit and passive processing of
   affective stimuli are known to activate the amygdalae differently
   reflecting differences in attention, level of detailed analysis of the
   stimuli and the cognitive control needed to perform the required task.
   Previous studies revealed that implicit processing or passive viewing of
   affective stimuli, induce a left amygdala response that correlates with
   HA. In this new study we have tried to extend these findings to the
   situation in which the subjects were required to explicitly process
   emotional stimuli.
   Methods: A group of healthy female participants was asked to rate the
   valence of positive and negative stimuli while undergoing fMRI.
   Afterwards the neural responses of the participants to the positive and
   to the negative stimuli were separately correlated to their HA scores
   and compared between the low and high HA participants.
   Results: Both analyses revealed increased neural activity in the left
   laterobasal (LB) amygdala of the high HA participants while they were
   rating the positive and the negative stimuli.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that the left amygdala response to
   explicit processing of affective stimuli does correlate with HA.}},

Abstract = {{Legal decisions often require logical reasoning about the mental states

   that elicit strong or weak disgust matched on punishment severity using
   the US Federal Sentencing Guidelines. An extraneous sentence at the end
   of each vignette described the perpetrator's personality using traits or
   biological language, mimicking the increased use of scientific evidence
   presented in courts. Behavioral results indicate that crimes weak in
   disgust receive significantly less punishment than the guidelines
   recommend. Neuroimaging results indicate that brain regions active
   during logical reasoning respond less to crimes weak in disgust and
   biological descriptions of personality, demonstrating the impact of
   emotion and social cognition on logical reasoning mechanisms necessary

Abstract = {{Event simulation (ES) is the situational inference process in which
   perceived event features such as objects, agents, and actions are
   associated in the brain to represent the whole situation. ES provides a
   common basis for various cognitive processes, such as perceptual
   prediction, situational understanding/prediction, and social cognition
   (such as mentalizing/trait inference). Here, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging was used to elucidate the neural substrates underlying
   important subdivisions within ES. First, the study investigated whether
   ES depends on different neural substrates when it is conducted
   explicitly and implicitly. Second, the existence of neural substrates
   specific to the future-prediction component of ES was assessed. Subjects
   were shown contextually related object pictures implying a situation and
   performed several picture-word-matching tasks. By varying task goals,
   subjects were made to infer the implied situation implicitly/explicitly
   or predict the future consequence of that situation. The results
   indicate that, whereas implicit ES activated the lateral prefrontal
   cortex and medial/lateral parietal cortex, explicit ES activated the
   medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and medial/lateral
   temporal cortex. Additionally, the left temporoparietal junction plays
   an important role in the future-prediction component of ES. These
   findings enrich our understanding of the neural substrates of the
   implicit/explicit/predictive aspects of ES-related cognitive processes.}},

Volume = {{91}},

Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The ability to suppress irrelevant information declines with age, while
   the ability to enhance relevant information remains largely intact. We
   examined mechanisms behind this dissociation in an fMRI study, using a
   selective attention task in which relevant and irrelevant information
   appeared simultaneously. Slowing of response times due to distraction by
   irrelevant targets was larger in older than younger participants.
   Increased distraction was related to larger increases in activity and
   connectivity in areas of the dorsal attention network, indicating a more
   pronounced (re-)orientation of attention. The decreases in accuracy in
   target compared to nontarget trials were smaller in older compared to
   younger participants. In older adults we found increased recruitment of
   areas in the fronto-parietal control network (FPCN) during target
   detection. Moreover, older adults showed increased connectivity between
   the FPCN, supporting cognitive control, and somatomotor areas implicated
   in response selection and execution. This connectivity increase was
   related to improved target detection, suggesting that older adults
   engage additional cognitive control, which might enable the observed
   intact performance in detecting and responding to target stimuli. (C)

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{70-76}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Adolescence is a transitional period between childhood and adulthood and
   is characterized by emotional instability. Underlying this behavior may
   be an imbalance between the limbic subcortical areas and the prefrontal
   cortex. Here, we investigated differences in these regions during
   adolescence and young adulthood. Fifty subjects aged 10 to 24 viewed and
   rated neutral, negative, and positive pictures (IAPS: International
   Affective Picture System), while being scanned with functional MRI. Only
   those trials in which there was a match between the subject's response
   and the IAPS rating were included in the analyses. Task performance
   (matching accuracy, reaction times) did not differ across age. Activity
   in the amygdala and hippocampus decreased with age when processing
   emotional salient stimuli versus neutral stimuli. In contrast,
   activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex increased with age.
   Importantly, we show for the first time that these age-related changes
   are paralleled by an increase in functional coupling of the amygdala and
   hippocampus with the orbitofrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex. These findings are in line with the general notion that brain
   development from childhood to adulthood is characterized by a gradual
   increase in frontal control over subcortical regions. Understanding
   these developmental changes is important as these may underlie typical
   adolescent behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The neural bases underlying social risk perception in purchase decisions}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{120-128}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Social considerations significantly influence daily purchase decisions,
   and the perception of social risk (i.e., the anticipated disapproval of
   others) is crucial in dissuading consumers from making purchases.
   However, the neural basis for consumers' perception of social risk
   remains undiscovered, and this novel study clarifies the relevant neural
   processes. A total of 26 volunteers were scanned while they evaluated
   purchase intention of products (purchase intention task) and their
   anticipation of others' disapproval for possessing a product (social
   risk task), using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The fMRI
   data from the purchase intention task was used to identify the brain
   region associated with perception of social risk during purchase
   decision making by using subjective social risk ratings for a parametric
   modulation analysis. Furthermore, we aimed to explore if there was a
   difference between participants' purchase decisions and their explicit
   evaluations of social risk, with reference to the neural activity
   associated with social risk perception. For this, subjective social risk
   ratings were used for a parametric modulation analysis on fMRI data from
   the social risk task. Analysis of the purchase intention task revealed a
   significant positive correlation between ratings of social risk and
   activity in the anterior insula, an area of the brain that is known as
   part of the emotion-related network. Analysis of the social risk task
   revealed a significant positive correlation between ratings of social
   risk and activity in the temporal parietal junction and the medial
   prefrontal cortex, which are known as theory-of-mind regions. Our
   results suggest that the anterior insula processes consumers' social
   risk implicitly to prompt consumers not to buy socially unacceptable
   products, whereas ToM-related regions process such risk explicitly in
   considering the anticipated disapproval of others. These findings may
   prove helpful in understanding the mental processes involved in purchase
   decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Sleep deprivation reduces the rate of rapid picture processing}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{169-176}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Object recognition becomes impaired at faster presentation rates and
   here we show the neuroanatomical foci of where this might be exacerbated
   by sleep deprivation (SD). Twenty healthy human participants were asked
   to detect a target house in serially presented house pictures that
   appeared at 1-15 images/s. Temporal response profiles relating fMRI
   signal magnitude to presentation frequency were derived from
   task-responsive regions. Following SD, the inverted U-shaped response
   profile within parahippocampal place area was lower and peaked at a
   slower presentation rate than when participants slept normally.
   Contrastingly, SD did not shift the relatively monotonic early visual
   cortex responses. The intraparietal sulci but not the frontal eye fields
   or medial frontal region, showed similar shifts in temporal response
   profiles following SD, suggesting differential contribution of areas
   mediating attention control towards limiting rapid object processing. As
   nodes of the default mode network (DMN) continued to show monotonically
   increasing deactivation at higher presentation frequencies even
   following SD, the observed state modulations of temporal responses
   likely represent temporal limitations in object processing as opposed to
   task disengagement. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A growing number of studies suggest the brain's ``default network{''}
   becomes engaged when individuals recall their personal past or simulate
   their future. Recent reports of heterogeneity within the network raise
   the possibility that these autobiographical processes comprised of
   multiple component processes, each supported by distinct
   functional-anatomic subsystems. We previously hypothesized that a medial
   temporal subsystem contributes to autobiographical memory and future
   thought by enabling individuals to retrieve prior information and bind
   this information into a mental scene. Conversely, a dorsal medial
   subsystem was proposed to support social-reflective aspects of
   autobiographical thought, allowing individuals to reflect on the mental
   states of one's self and others (i.e. ``mentalizing{''}). To test these
   hypotheses, we first examined activity in the default network subsystems
   as participants performed two commonly employed tasks of episodic
   retrieval and mentalizing. In a subset of participants, relationships
   among task-evoked regions were examined at rest, in the absence of an
   overt task. Finally, large-scale fMRI meta-analyses were conducted to
   identify brain regions that most strongly predicted the presence of
   episodic retrieval and mentalizing, and these results were compared to
   meta-analyses of autobiographical tasks. Across studies,
   laboratory-based episodic retrieval tasks were preferentially linked to
   the medial temporal subsystem, while mentalizing tasks were
   preferentially linked to the dorsal medial subsystem. In turn,
   autobiographical tasks engaged aspects of both subsystems. These results
   suggest the default network is a heterogeneous brain system whose
   subsystems support distinct component processes of autobiographical
   thought. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral inhibition (BI) is a temperament characterized by heightened
   negative affect and social reticence to unfamiliar peers. In a
   longitudinal study, 291 infants were assessed for BI at 24 and 36 months
   of age. At age 7, N2 amplitude was measured during a Flanker task. Also
   at age 7, children experienced social exclusion in the lab during an
   interaction with an unfamiliar peer and an experimenter. Our findings
   indicate that children characterized as high in BI, relative to those
   low in BI, had larger (i.e., more negative) N2 amplitudes. Additionally,
   among children with a large N2, BI was positively related to withdrawal
   and negatively related to assertiveness during social exclusion. These
   findings suggest that variations in conflict detection among
   behaviorally inhibited children plays a role in their social behavior
   during stressful social situations. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \&

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mammalian studies show that frustration is experienced when
   goal-directed activity is blocked. Despite frustration's strongly
   negative role in health, aggression and social relationships, the neural
   mechanisms are not well understood. To address this we developed a task
   in which participants were blocked from obtaining a reward, an
   established method of producing frustration. Levels of experienced
   frustration were parametrically varied by manipulating the participants'
   motivation to obtain the reward prior to blocking. This was achieved by
   varying the participants' proximity to a reward and the amount of effort
   expended in attempting to acquire it. In experiment 1, we confirmed that
   proximity and expended effort independently enhanced participants'
   self-reported desire to obtain the reward, and their self-reported
   frustration and response vigor (key-press force) following blocking. In
   experiment 2, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   show that both proximity and expended effort modulated brain responses
   to blocked reward in regions implicated in animal models of reactive
   aggression, including the amygdala, midbrain periaqueductal grey (PAG),
   insula and prefrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that frustration may
   serve an energizing function, translating unfulfilled motivation into
   aggressive-like surges via a cortical, amygdala and PAG network. (C)

Abstract = {{In humans, spatial integration develops slowly, continuing through
   childhood into adolescence. On the assumption that this protracted
   course depends on the formation of networks with slowly developing
   top-down connections, we compared effective connectivity in the visual
   cortex between 13 children (age 7-13) and 14 adults (age 21-42) using a
   passive perceptual task. The subjects were scanned while viewing
   bilateral gratings, which either obeyed Gestalt grouping rules
   {[}colinear gratings (CG)] or violated them {[}non-colinear gratings
   (NG)]. The regions of interest for dynamic causal modeling were
   determined from activations in functional MRI contrasts stimuli >
   background and CG > NG. They were symmetrically located in V1 and V3v
   areas of both hemispheres. We studied a common model, which contained
   reciprocal intrinsic and modulatory connections between these regions.
   An analysis of effective connectivity showed that top-down modulatory
   effects generated at an extrastriate level and interhemispheric
   modulatory effects between primary visual areas (all inhibitory) are
   significantly weaker in children than in adults, suggesting that the
   formation of feedback and interhemispheric effective connections
   continues into adolescence. These results are consistent with a model in
   which spatial integration at an extrastriate level results in top-down
   messages to the primary visual areas, where they are supplemented by
   lateral (interhemispheric) messages, making perceptual encoding more
   efficient and less redundant. Abnormal formation of top-down inhibitory
   connections can lead to the reduction of habituation observed in
   migraine patients.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years research explored different acupuncture stimulation
   techniques but interest has focused primarily on somatic acupuncture and
   on a limited number of acupoints. As regards ear Acupuncture (EA) there
   is still some criticism about the clinical specificity of auricular
   points/areas representing organs or structures of the body. The aim of
   this study was to verify through (Functional magnetic resonance imaging)
   fMRI the hypothesis of EA point specificity using two auricular points
   having different topographical locations and clinical significance. Six
   healthy volunteers underwent two experimental fMRI sessions: the first
   was dedicated to the stimulation of Thumb Auricular Acupoint (TAA) and
   the second to the stimulation of Brain Stem Auricular Acupoint (BSAA).
   The stimulation of the needle placed in the TAA of the left ear produced
   an increase in activation bilaterally in the parietal operculum, region
   of the secondary somatosensory area SII. Stimulation of the needle
   placed in the BSAA of the left ear showed a pattern that largely
   overlapped regions belonging to the pain matrix, as shown to be involved
   in previous somatic acupuncture studies but with local differences in
   the left amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum. The
   differences in activation patterns between TAA and BSAA stimulation
   support the specificity of the two acupoints. Moreover, the peculiarity
   of the regions involved in BSAA stimulation compared to those involved
   in the pain matrix, is in accordance with the therapeutic indications of
   this acupoint that include head pain, dizziness and vertigo. Our results
   provide preliminary evidence on the specificity of two auricular
   acupoints; further research is warranted by means of fMRI both in
   healthy volunteers and in patients carrying neurological/psychiatric
   syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{We review emerging research on the psychological and biological factors

   with classic theories of group processes and intergroup relations in an
   effort to move beyond merely describing the effects of specific social
   out-groups on the brain and behavior. Instead, we emphasize the
   underlying psychological processes that govern intergroup interactions
   more generally: forming and updating our representations of ``us{''} and
   ``them{''} via social identification and functional relations between
   groups. This approach highlights the dynamic nature of social identity
   and the context-dependent nature of intergroup relations. We argue that
   this theoretical integration can help reconcile seemingly discrepant
   findings in the literature, provide organizational principles for
   understanding the core elements of intergroup dynamics, and highlight
   several exciting directions for future research at the interface of

Abstract = {{Little is known about brain mechanisms recruited during the monitoring
   and appraisal of social conflicts-for instance, when individuals compete
   with each other for the same resources. We designed a novel experimental
   task inducing resource conflicts between two individuals. In an
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) design,
   participants played with another human participant or against a
   computer, who across trials chose either different (no-conflict) or the
   same tokens (conflict trials) in order to obtain monetary gains. In
   conflict trials, the participants could decide whether they would share
   the token, and the resulting gain, with the other person or instead keep
   all points for themselves. Behaviorally, participants shared much more
   often when playing with a human partner than with a computer. fMRI
   results demonstrated that the dorsal mediofrontal cortex was selectively
   activated during human conflicts. This region might play a key role in
   detecting situations in which self- and social interest are incompatible
   and require behavioral adjustment. In addition, we found a
   conflict-related response in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   that correlated with measures of social relationship and individual
   sharing behavior. Taken together, these findings reveal a key role of
   these prefrontal areas for the appraisal and resolution of interpersonal
   resource conflicts.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals can experience embarrassment when exposed to self-feedback
   images, depending on the extent of the divergence from the internal
   representation of the standard self. Our previous work implicated the
   anterior insular cortex (AI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in
   the processing of embarrassment; however, their exact functional
   contributions have remained uncertain. Here, we explored the effects of
   being observed by others while viewing self-face images on the extent of
   embarrassment, and the activation and connectivity patterns in the AI
   and ACC. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging
   hyperscanning in pairs of healthy participants using an interaction
   system that allowed an individual to be observed by a partner in real
   time. Being observed increased the extent of embarrassment reported when
   viewing self-face images; a corresponding increase in self-related
   activity in the right AI suggested that this region played a direct role
   in the subjective experience. Being observed also increased the
   functional connectivity between the caudal ACC and prefrontal regions,
   which are involved in processing the reflective self. The ACC might
   therefore serve as a hub, integrating information about the reflective
   self that is used in evaluating perceptual self-face images.}},

Abstract = {{People believe that women are more emotionally intense than men, but the
   scientific evidence is equivocal. In this study, we tested the novel
   hypothesis that men and women differ in the neural correlates of
   affective experience, rather than in the intensity of neural activity,
   with women being more internally (interoceptively) focused and men being
   more externally (visually) focused. Adult men (n = 17) and women (n =
   17) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study while
   viewing affectively potent images and rating their moment-to-moment
   feelings of subjective arousal. We found that men and women do not
   differ overall in their intensity of moment-to-moment affective
   experiences when viewing evocative images, but instead, as predicted,
   women showed a greater association between the momentary arousal ratings
   and neural responses in the anterior insula cortex, which represents
   bodily sensations, whereas men showed stronger correlations between
   their momentary arousal ratings and neural responses in the visual
   cortex. Men also showed enhanced functional connectivity between the
   dorsal anterior insula cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex,
   which constitutes the circuitry involved with regulating shifts of
   attention to the world. These results demonstrate that the same
   affective experience is realized differently in different people, such
   that women's feelings are relatively more self-focused, whereas men's
   feelings are relatively more world-focused.}},

Abstract = {{Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been associated with stress reactivity in
   affective disorders and is most densely expressed in the amygdala. An
   important stressor associated with affective disorders is the experience
   of childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM). We investigated whether the
   interaction of NPY risk genotype and CEM would affect brain activation.
   From the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety, 33 healthy
   controls and 85 patients with affective disorders were scanned with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while making gender decisions of
   emotional facial expressions. Results showed interactions between
   genotype and CEM, within carriers of the risk genotype, CEM was
   associated with higher amygdala activation, whereas CEM did not
   influence activation in non-risk carriers. In the posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC), less activation was seen in those with CEM and the risk
   genotype, whereas genotype did not influence PCC activation in those
   without CEM. In addition, those carrying the risk genotype and with
   experience of CEM made a faster gender decision than those without CEM.
   Thus, the combined effect of carrying NPY risk genotype and a history of
   CEM affected amygdala and PCC reactivity, areas related to emotion,
   self-relevance processing and autobiographical memory. These results are
   consistent with the notion that the combination of risk genotype and CEM
   may cause hypervigilance.}},

Abstract = {{Depressive cognitive schemas play an important role in the emergence and
   persistence of major depressive disorder (MDD). The current study
   adapted emotion regulation techniques to reflect elements of cognitive
   behavioural therapy (CBT) and related psychotherapies to delineate
   neurocognitive abnormalities associated with modulating the negative
   cognitive style in MDD. Nineteen non-medicated patients with MDD and 19
   matched controls reduced negative or enhanced positive feelings elicited
   by emotional scenes while undergoing functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Although both groups showed significant emotion regulation
   success as measured by subjective ratings of affect, the controls were
   significantly better at modulating both negative and positive emotion.
   Both groups recruited regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) when regulating negative
   emotions. Only in controls was this accompanied by reduced activity in
   sensory cortices and amygdala. Similarly, both groups showed enhanced
   activity in VLPFC and ventral striatum when enhancing positive affect;
   however, only in controls was ventral striatum activity correlated with
   regulation efficacy. The results suggest that depression is associated
   with both a reduced capacity to achieve relief from negative affect
   despite recruitment of ventral and dorsal prefrontal cortical regions
   implicated in emotion regulation, coupled with a disconnect between
   activity in reward-related regions and subjective positive affect.}},

Abstract = {{Much work in the field of social cognition shows that adopting an
   abstract (vs concrete) mindset alters the way people construe the world,
   thereby exerting substantial effects across innumerable aspects of human
   behavior. In order to investigate the cognitive and neural basis of
   these effects, we scanned participants as they performed two widely used
   tasks that induce an abstracting vs concretizing mindsets. Specifically,
   participants: (i) indicated `why' perform certain activities (a task
   that involves abstraction) or `how' the same activities are performed (a
   task that involves concretization) and (ii) generated superordinate
   categories for certain objects (a task that involves abstraction) or
   subordinate exemplars for the same objects (a task that involves
   concretization). We conducted a conjunction analysis of the two tasks,
   in order to uncover the neural activity associated with abstraction and
   concretization. The results showed that concretization was associated
   with activation in fronto-parietal regions implicated in goal-directed
   action; abstraction was associated with activity within posterior
   regions implicated in visual perception. We discuss these findings in
   light of construal-level theory's notion of abstraction.}},

Abstract = {{Personal identity critically depends on the creation of stories about
   the self and one's life. The present study investigates the neural
   substrates of autobiographical reasoning, a process central to the
   construction of such narratives. During functional magnetic resonance
   imaging scanning, participants approached a set of personally
   significant memories in two different ways: in some trials, they
   remembered the concrete content of the events (autobiographical
   remembering), whereas in other trials they reflected on the broader
   meaning and implications of their memories (autobiographical reasoning).
   Relative to remembering, autobiographical reasoning recruited a
   left-lateralized network involved in conceptual processing {[}including
   the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior frontal gyrus,
   middle temporal gyrus and angular gyrus]. The ventral MPFC-an area that
   may function to generate personal/affective meaning-was not consistently
   engaged during autobiographical reasoning across participants but,
   interestingly, the activity of this region was modulated by individual
   differences in interest and willingness to engage in self-reflection.
   These findings support the notion that autobiographical reasoning and
   the construction of personal narratives go beyond mere remembering in
   that they require deriving meaning and value from past experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Data from developmental psychology suggests a link between the growth of
   socio-emotional competences and the infant's sensitivity to the salience
   of social stimuli. The aim of the present study was to find evidence for
   this relationship in healthy adults. Thirty-five participants were
   recruited based on their score above the 85th or below the 15th
   percentile of the empathy quotient questionnaire (EQ, Baron-Cohen and
   Wheelwright, 2004). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
   used to compare neural responses to cues of social and non-social
   (monetary) reward. When compared to the high-EQ group, the low-EQ group
   showed reduced activity of the brain s reward system, specifically the
   right nucleus accumbens, in response to cues predictive of social reward
   (videos showing gestures of approval)-but increased activation in this
   area for monetary incentives. Our data provide evidence for a link
   between self-reported deficits in social proficiency and reduced
   sensitivity to the motivational salience of positive social stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. How attractive someone is
   perceived to be depends on the individual or cultural standards to which
   this person is compared. But although comparisons play a central role in
   the way people judge the appearance of others, the brain processes
   underlying attractiveness comparisons remain unknown. In the present
   experiment, we tested the hypothesis that attractiveness comparisons
   rely on the same cognitive and neural mechanisms as comparisons of
   simple nonsocial magnitudes such as size. We recorded brain activity
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants
   compared the beauty or height of two women or two dogs. Our data support
   the hypothesis of a common process underlying these different types of
   comparisons. First, we demonstrate that the distance effect
   characteristic of nonsocial comparisons also holds for attractiveness
   comparisons. Behavioral results indicated, for all our comparisons,
   longer response times for near than far distances. Second, the neural
   correlates of these distance effects overlapped in a frontoparietal
   network known for its involvement in processing simple nonsocial
   quantities. These results provide evidence for overlapping processes in
   the comparison of physical attractiveness and nonsocial magnitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the well-known role of the amygdala in mediating emotional
   interference during tasks requiring cognitive resources, no definite
   conclusion has yet been reached regarding the differential roles of
   functionally and anatomically distinctive subcomponents of the amygdala
   in such processes. In this study, we examined female participants and
   attempted to separate the neural processes for the detection of
   emotional information from those for the regulation of cognitive
   interference from emotional distractors by adding a temporal gap between
   emotional stimuli and a subsequent cognitive Stroop task. Reaction time
   data showed a significantly increased Stroop interference effect
   following emotionally negative stimuli compared with neutral stimuli,
   and functional magnetic resonance imaging data revealed that the
   anterior ventral amygdala (avAMYG) showed greater responses to negative
   stimuli compared with neutral stimuli. In addition, individuals who
   scored high in neuroticism showed greater posterior dorsal amygdala
   (pdAMYG) responses to incongruent compared with congruent Stroop trials
   following negative stimuli, but not following neutral stimuli. Taken
   together, the findings of this study demonstrated functionally
   distinctive contributions of the avAMYG and pdAMYG to the
   emotion-modulated Stroop interference effect and suggested that the
   avAMYG encodes associative values of emotional stimuli whereas the
   pdAMYG resolves cognitive interference from emotional distractors.}},

Abstract = {{Social rejection often increases aggression, but the neural mechanisms
   underlying this effect remain unclear. This experiment tested whether
   neural activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and
   anterior insula in response to social rejection predicted greater
   subsequent aggression. Additionally, it tested whether executive
   functioning moderated this relationship. Participants completed a
   behavioral measure of executive functioning, experienced social
   rejection while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and
   then completed a task in which they could aggress against a person who
   rejected them using noise blasts . We found that dACC activation and
   executive functioning interacted to predict aggression. Specifically,
   participants with low executive functioning showed a positive
   association between dACC activation and aggression, whereas individuals
   with high executive functioning showed a negative association. Similar
   results were found for the left anterior insula. These findings suggest
   that social pain can increase or decrease aggression, depending on an
   individual's regulatory capability.}},

Abstract = {{In everyday life, people adaptively prepare for the future by simulating
   dynamic events about impending interactions with people, objects and
   locations. Previous research has consistently demonstrated that a
   distributed network of frontal-parietal-temporal brain regions supports
   this ubiquitous mental activity. Nonetheless, little is known about the
   manner in which specific regions of this network contribute to component
   features of future simulation. In two experiments, we used a functional
   magnetic resonance (fMR)-repetition suppression paradigm to demonstrate
   that distinct frontal-parietal-temporal regions are sensitive to
   processing the scenarios or what participants imagined was happening in
   an event (e.g. medial prefrontal, posterior cingulate, temporal-parietal
   and middle temporal cortices are sensitive to the scenarios associated
   with future social events), people (medial prefrontal cortex), objects
   (inferior frontal and premotor cortices) and locations (posterior
   cingulate/retrosplenial, parahippocampal and posterior parietal
   cortices) that typically constitute simulations of personal future
   events. This pattern of results demonstrates that the neural substrates
   of these component features of event simulations can be reliably
   identified in the context of a task that requires participants to
   simulate complex, everyday future experiences.}},

Abstract = {{The tendency to approach or avoid novel people is a fundamental human
   behavior and is a core dimension of social anxiety. Resting state fMRI
   was used to test for an association between social inhibition and
   intrinsic connectivity in 40 young adults ranging from low to high in
   social inhibition. Higher levels of social inhibition were associated
   with specific patterns of reduced amygdala-cingulate cortex
   connectivity. Connectivity was reduced between the superficial amygdala
   and the rostral cingulate cortex and between the centromedial amygdala
   and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Social inhibition also
   modulated connectivity in several well-established intrinsic networks;
   higher social inhibition correlated with reduced connectivity with
   default mode and dorsal attention networks and enhanced connectivity in
   salience and executive control networks. These findings provide
   important preliminary evidence that social inhibition reflects
   differences in the underlying intrinsic connectivity of the brain in the
   absence of social stimuli or stressors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The regulation of emotions is an integral part of our mental health. It
   has only recently been investigated using brain imaging techniques. In
   most studies, participants are instructed by a cue to inhibit a specific
   emotional reaction. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
   alternative situation where a person decides to inhibit an emotion as an
   act of endogenous self-control. Healthy participants viewed highly
   arousing pictures with negative valence. In the endogenous condition,
   participants could freely choose on each trial to inhibit or feel the
   emotions elicited by the picture. In an exogenous condition, a visual
   cue instructed them to either feel or inhibit the emotion elicited by
   the picture. Participants' subjective ratings of intensity of
   experienced emotion showed an interaction effect between source of
   control (endogenous/exogenous) and feel/inhibit based on a stronger
   modulation between feel and inhibition for the endogenous compared to
   the exogenous condition. Endogenous inhibition of emotions was
   associated with dorso-medial prefrontal cortex activation, whereas
   exogenous inhibition was found associated with lateral prefrontal cortex
   activation. Thus, the brain regions for both endogenous and exogenous
   inhibition of emotion are highly similar to those for inhibition of
   motor actions in Brass and Haggard (J Neurosci 27:9141-9145, 2007), Kuhn
   et al. (Hum Brain Mapp 30:2834-2843, 2009). Functional connectivity
   analyses showed that dorsofrontomedial cortex exerts greater control
   onto pre-supplementary motor area during endogenous inhibition compared
   to endogenous feel. This functional dissociation between an endogenous,
   fronto-medial and an exogenous, fronto-lateral inhibition centre has
   important implications for our understanding of emotion regulation in
   health and psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Albeit histologically low grade (WHO I degrees) brain tumors,
   craniopharyngiomas and/or their surgical removal frequently affect the
   hypothalamus, amongst other brain regions at risk. Due to rich
   hypothalamic connections with prefrontal and limbic regions,
   hypothalamic injury may adversely affect neural substrates of emotion
   processing and higher cognitive control, including memory and executive
   functions. The current study is the first to investigate the
   consequences of hypothalamic involvement on neural substrates of
   emotional and cognitive functioning.
   Ten patients with childhood craniopharyngioma and known hypothalamic
   involvement and fifteen age- and intelligence matched control subjects
   (median age: 17.8 and 17.3 yrs.) were studied with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging and an emotional face recognition task. During
   encoding, participants were asked to classify neutral and emotional
   faces. In a subsequent recognition phase, participants had to recognize
   these old faces within a set of new faces.
   Behavioral performance was comparable between patients and controls.
   Neural activity revealed, however, differential recruitment of
   fronto-limbic brain regions during recognition. Patients exhibited an
   abnormal pattern of task-induced activation and deactivation in the
   anterior and posterior rostral medial prefrontal cortex and a higher
   functional coupling between anterior rostral medial prefrontal cortex
   and the thalamus. Additionally, we found a higher reactivity in the
   patients' amygdala to emotional relative to neutral faces when compared
   to healthy controls.
   Our data provide first evidence that hypothalamic damage impacts neural
   correlates of memory retrieval in medial prefrontal cortex, indicating a
   less efficient use of an area involved in executive control processes.
   We propose that the deactivation failure in the patients' anterior
   rostral medial prefrontal cortex is related to an increased coupling
   with the thalamus and reflects a reduced efficiency to flexibly adapt to
   task demands. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Research in social neuroscience has uncovered a social knowledge network
   that is particularly attuned to making social judgments. However, the
   processes that are being performed by both regions within this network
   and those outside of this network that are nevertheless engaged in the
   service of making a social judgment remain unclear. To help address
   this, we drew upon research in semantic memory, which suggests that
   making a semantic judgment engages 2 distinct control processes: A
   controlled retrieval process, which aids in bringing goal-relevant
   information to mind from long-term stores, and a selection process,
   which aids in selecting the information that is goal-relevant from the
   information retrieved. In a neuroimaging study, we investigated whether
   controlled retrieval and selection for social information engage
   distinct portions of both the social knowledge network and regions
   outside this network. Controlled retrieval for social information
   engaged an anterior ventrolateral portion of the prefrontal cortex,
   whereas selection engaged both the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and
   temporoparietal junction within the social knowledge network. These
   results suggest that the social knowledge network may be more involved
   with the selection of social information than the controlled retrieval
   of it and incorporates lateral prefrontal regions in accessing memory
   for making social judgments.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has modified both the conceptualization and treatment of

   Technology-based studies identify AN and BN as ``brain circuit{''}
   disorders; epidemiologic studies reveal that the narrow racial, ethnic
   and income profile of individuals no longer holds true for AN. The major
   organs affected long term-the brain and skeletal system-both respond to
   improved nutrition, with maintenance of body weight the best predictor
   of recovery. Twin studies have revealed gene x environment interactions,
   including both the external (social) and internal (pubertal)
   environments of boys and of girls. Family-based treatment has the best
   evidence base for effectiveness for younger patients. Medication plays a
   limited role in AN, but a major role in BN. Across diagnoses, the most

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated resting-state abnormalities in midline
   regions in vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome and
   minimally conscious state patients. However, the functional implications
   of these resting-state abnormalities remain unclear. Recent findings in
   healthy subjects have revealed a close overlap between the neural
   substrate of self-referential processing and the resting-state activity
   in cortical midline regions. As such, we investigated task-related
   neural activity during active self-referential processing and various
   measures of resting-state activity in 11 patients with disorders of
   consciousness (DOC) and 12 healthy control subjects. Overall, the
   results revealed that DOC patients exhibited task-specific signal
   changes in anterior and posterior midline regions, including the
   perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) and posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC). However, the degree of signal change was significantly
   lower in DOC patients compared with that in healthy subjects. Moreover,
   reduced signal differentiation in the PACC predicted the degree of
   consciousness in DOC patients. Importantly, the same midline regions
   (PACC and PCC) in DOC patients also exhibited severe abnormalities in
   the measures of resting-state activity, that is functional connectivity
   and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Taken together, our
   results provide the first evidence of neural abnormalities in both the
   self-referential processing and the resting state in midline regions in
   DOC patients. This novel finding has important implications for clinical
   utility and general understanding of the relationship between the self,
   the resting state, and consciousness. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1997-2008, 2014.

Abstract = {{There are at least two fundamental unanswered questions in the
   literature on autism spectrum disorders (ASD): Are abnormalities in
   white (WM) and gray matter (GM) consistent with one another? Are WM
   morphometric alterations consistent with alterations in the GM of
   regions connected by these abnormal WM bundles and vice versa? The aim
   of this work is to bridge this gap. After selecting voxel-based
   morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging studies comparing autistic and
   normally developing groups of subjects, we conducted an activation
   likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to estimate consistent brain
   alterations in ASD. Multidimensional scaling was used to test the
   similarity of the results. The ALE results were then analyzed to
   identify the regions of concordance between GM and WM areas. We found
   statistically significant topological relationships between GM and WM
   abnormalities in ASD. The most numerous were negative concordances,
   found bilaterally but with a higher prevalence in the right hemisphere.
   Positive concordances were found in the left hemisphere. Discordances
   reflected the spatial distribution of negative concordances. Thus, a
   different hemispheric contribution emerged, possibly related to
   pathogenetic factors affecting the right hemisphere during early
   developmental stages. Besides, WM fiber tracts linking the brain
   structures involved in social cognition showed abnormalities, and most
   of them had a negative concordance with the connected GM regions. We
   interpreted the results in terms of altered brain networks and their
   role in the pervasive symptoms dramatically impairing communication and
   social skills in ASD patients. Hum Brain Mapp 35:2073-2098, 2014. (c)

Abstract = {{Potential sources of multisensory influences on low-level sensory
   cortices include direct projections from sensory cortices of different
   modalities, as well as more indirect feedback inputs from higher order
   multisensory cortical regions. These multiple architectures may be
   functionally complementary, but the exact roles and inter-relationships
   of the circuits are unknown. Using a fully balanced context
   manipulation, we tested the hypotheses that: (1) feedforward and lateral
   pathways subserve speed functions, such as detecting peripheral stimuli.
   Multisensory integration effects in this context are predicted in
   peripheral fields of low-level sensory cortices. (2) Slower feedback
   pathways underpin accuracy functions, such as object discrimination.
   Integration effects in this context are predicted in higher-order
   association cortices and central/foveal fields of low-level sensory
   cortex. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to compare the
   effects of central versus peripheral stimulation on audiovisual
   integration, while varying speed and accuracy requirements for
   behavioral responses. We found that interactions of task demands and
   stimulus eccentricity in low-level sensory cortices are more complex
   than would be predicted by a simple dichotomy such as our hypothesized
   peripheral/speed and foveal/accuracy functions. Additionally, our
   findings point to individual differences in integration that may be
   related to skills and strategy. Overall, our findings suggest that
   instead of using fixed, specialized pathways, the exact circuits and
   mechanisms that are used for low-level multisensory integration are much
   more flexible and contingent upon both individual and contextual factors

Abstract = {{The negotiation of social order is intimately connected to the capacity
   to infer and track status relationships. Despite the foundational role
   of status in social cognition, we know little about how the brain
   constructs status from social interactions that display it. Although
   emerging cognitive neuroscience reveals that status judgments depend on
   the intraparietal sulcus, a brain region that supports the comparison of
   targets along a quantitative continuum, we present evidence that status
   judgments do not necessarily reduce to ranking targets along a
   quantitative continuum. The process of judging status also fits a social
   interdependence analysis. Consistent with third-party perceivers judging
   status by inferring whose goals are dictating the terms of the
   interaction and who is subordinating their desires to whom, status
   judgments were associated with increased recruitment of medial pFC and
   STS, brain regions implicated in mental state inference.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Social influence is prominent across the lifespan, but
   sensitivity to influence is especially high during adolescence and is
   often associated with increased risk taking. Such risk taking can have
   dire consequences. For example, in American adolescents, traffic-related
   crashes are leading causes of nonfatal injury and death. Neural measures
   may be especially useful in understanding the basic mechanisms of
   adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence.
   Methods: We examined neural responses to social exclusion as potential
   predictors of risk taking in the presence of peers in recently licensed
   adolescent drivers. Risk taking was assessed in a driving simulator
   session occurring approximately 1 week after the neuroimaging session.
   Results: Increased activity in neural systems associated with the
   distress of social exclusion and mentalizing during an exclusion episode
   predicted increased risk taking in the presence of a peer (controlling
   for solo risk behavior) during a driving simulator session outside the
   neuroimaging laboratory 1 week later. These neural measures predicted
   risky driving behavior above and beyond self-reports of susceptibility
   to peer pressure and distress during exclusion.
   Conclusions: These results address the neural bases of social influence
   and risk taking; contribute to our understanding of social and emotional
   function in the adolescent brain; and link neural activity in specific,
   hypothesized, regions to risk-relevant outcomes beyond the neuroimaging
   laboratory. Results of this investigation are discussed in terms of the
   mechanisms underlying risk taking in adolescents and the public health
   implications for adolescent driving. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent

Abstract = {{Evaluating the costs and benefits of our own choices is central to most
   forms of decision-making and its mechanisms in the brain are becoming
   increasingly well understood. To interact successfully in social
   environments, it is also essential to monitor the rewards that others
   receive. Previous studies innonhumanprimates have found neurons in the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that signal the net value (benefit minus
   cost) of rewards that will be received oneself and also neurons that
   signal when a reward will be received by someone else. However, little
   is understood about the way in which the human brain engages in
   cost-benefit analyses during social interactions. Does theACCsignal the
   net value (the benefits minus the costs) of rewards that others will
   receive? Here, using fMRI, we examined activity time locked to cues that
   signaled the anticipated reward magnitude (benefit) to be gained and the
   level of effort (cost) to be incurred either by a subject themselves or
   by a social confederate. We investigated whether activity in the ACC
   covaries with the net value of rewards that someone else will receive
   when that person is required to exert effort for the reward. We show
   that, although activation in the sulcus of the ACC signaled the costs on
   all trials, gyral ACC (ACCg) activity varied parametrically only with
   the net value of rewards gained by others. These results suggest that
   the ACCg plays an important role in signaling cost-benefit information
   by signaling the value of others' rewards during social interactions.}},

   RESTRAINED EATERS}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{266}},
Pages = {{116-126}},
Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{Restrained eaters (REs) characterized by less efficient response
   inhibition are at risk for future onset of binge eating and bulimic
   pathology. Previous imaging studies investigating REs have been based on
   task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and little is
   known about resting-state neural activity underlying restrained eating.
   To illuminate this issue, we investigated resting-state fMRI differences
   between REs (n = 22) and unrestrained eaters (UREs) (n= 30) using
   regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis, which measures the temporal
   synchronization of spontaneous fluctuations. Samples were equated on
   body mass index (BMI) and caloric deprivation levels (i. e., 14 +/- 2.1
   h since last evening meal) before undergoing fMRI. Correlation analyses
   were performed between the ReHo index of identified regions and response
   inhibition based on stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) within each sample.
   Compared with UREs, REs showed more ReHo in brain regions associated
   with food reward (i. e., orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsal-lateral
   prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)), attention (i. e., lingual gyrus, cuneus,
   inferior parietal lobule) and somatosensory functioning (i. e.,
   paracentral lobule, anterior insula). In addition, ReHo values for the
   left dlPFC and left anterior insula, respectively, were negatively and
   positively correlated with SSRT among REs but not UREs. In concert with
   previous studies, these results suggest altered local synchronization
   may help to explain why dieting to maintain or lose weight often fails
   or increases risk for binge eating among REs. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published

Abstract = {{Social animals constantly make decisions together. What determines if
   individuals will subsequently adjust their behavior to align with
   collective choices? Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in
   humans, we characterize a novel temporal model of brain response from
   the time a collective decision is made to the time an individual action
   is required. We reveal that whether a behavioral modification will occur
   is determined not necessarily by the brain's response to the initial
   social influence, but by how that response (specifically in the
   orbitofrontal cortex; OFC) is mirrored at a later time when the
   individual selects their own action. This result suggests that the OFC
   may reconstitute an initial state of collective influence when
   individual action is subsequently needed. Importantly, these dynamics
   vary across individuals as a function of trait conformity and mediate
   the relationship between this personality characteristic and behavioral
   adjustment toward the group.}},

Abstract = {{The ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been primarily implicated in
   reward-motivated behavior. Recently, aberrant dopaminergic VTA signaling
   has also been implicated in anxiety-like behaviors in animal models.
   These findings, however, have yet to be extended to anxiety in humans.
   Here we hypothesized that clinical anxiety is linked to dysfunction of
   the mesocorticolimbic circuit during threat processing in humans;
   specifically, excessive or dysregulated activity of the
   mesocorticolimbic aversion circuit may be etiologically related to
   errors in distinguishing cues of threat versus safety, also known as
   ``overgeneralization of fear.{''} To test this, we recruited 32 females
   with generalized anxiety disorder and 25 age-matched healthy control
   females. We measured brain activity using fMRI while participants
   underwent a fear generalization task consisting of pseudo-randomly
   presented rectangles with systematically varying widths. A mid-sized
   rectangle served as a conditioned stimulus (CS; 50\% electric shock
   probability) and rectangles with widths of CS +/- 20\%, +/- 40\%, and
   +/- 60\% served as generalization stimuli (GS; never paired with
   electric shock). Healthy controls showed VTA reactivity proportional to
   the cue's perceptual similarity to CS (threat). In contrast, patients
   with generalized anxiety disorder showed heightened and less
   discriminating VTA reactivity to GS, a feature that was positively
   correlated with trait anxiety, as well as increased mesocortical and
   decreased mesohippocampal coupling. Our results suggest that the human
   VTA and the mesocorticolimbic system play a crucial role in threat
   processing, and that abnormalities in this system are implicated in
   maladaptive threat processing in clinical anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in dopaminergic (DA)
   cells within the ventral tegmental area (VTA)/nucleus accumbens (NAc)
   circuitry appear to be a candidate mechanism for the neuroadaptive
   changes that follow stress and reward responses in animal models.
   However, the role of the BDNF gene variants in responses to salient cues
   through DA neurotransmission in humans remains unexplored. Here, we
   studied the effect of the common functional BDNF Val(66)Met (rs6265)
   polymorphism on rewarding experiences in the striatum and DA-mediated
   responses to stress. Seventy-two healthy controls were genotyped for the
   BDNF Val(66)Met polymorphism and underwent the monetary incentive delay
   task during an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session.
   Forty-nine of them also underwent a sustained pain challenge with and
   without placebo administration with potential analgesic properties
   during PET measures of DA D-2/3-receptor-mediated neurotransmission.
   Neuroimaging results revealed a significant effect of BDNF (Met(66)
   carriers > Val/Val) on brain responses during the anticipation of
   monetary losses, baseline D-2/3 receptor availability, and
   pain-stress-induced DA release in the NAc. Conversely, BDNF Met(66)
   carriers showed no activation in response to monetary gains and a
   blunted DA response to the analgesic placebo in the NAc. These results
   provide initial human evidence regarding the effect of the BDNF
   Val(66)Met polymorphism on DA-mediated responses to stress, its
   cognitive regulation by positive expectations, and the anticipatory
   responses to monetary gains and losses in the VTA-NAc pathway. Our
   results are of relevance to the neurobiology of stress and reward
   interactions and the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Alterations of social cognition and dysfunctional interpersonal
   expectations are thought to play an important role in the etiology of
   depression and have, thus, become a key target of psychotherapeutic
   interventions. The underlying neurobiology, however, remains elusive.
   Based upon the idea of a close link between affective and introspective
   processes relevant for social interactions and alterations thereof in
   states of depression, we used a meta-analytically informed network
   analysis to investigate resting-state functional connectivity in an
   introspective socio-affective (ISA) network in individuals with and
   without depression. Results of our analysis demonstrate significant
   differences between the groups with depressed individuals showing
   hyperconnectivity of the ISA network. These findings demonstrate that
   neurofunctional alterations exist in individuals with depression in a
   neural network relevant for introspection and socio-affective
   processing, which may contribute to the interpersonal difficulties that
   are linked to depressive symptomatology.}},

Abstract = {{Humans typically discount future gains more than losses. This phenomenon
   is referred to as the ``sign effect{''} in experimental and behavioral
   economics. Although recent studies have reported associations between
   the sign effect and important social problems, such as obesity and
   incurring multiple debts, the biological basis for this phenomenon
   remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that enhanced
   loss-related neural processing in magnitude and/or delay representation
   are causes of the sign effect. We examined participants performing
   intertemporal choice tasks involving future gains or losses and compared
   the brain activity of those who exhibited the sign effect and those who
   did not. When predicting future losses, significant differences were
   apparent between the two participant groups in terms of striatal
   activity representing delay length and in insular activity representing
   sensitivity to magnitude. Furthermore, participants with the sign effect
   exhibited a greater insular response to the magnitude of loss than to
   that of gain, and also a greater striatal response to the delay of loss
   than to that of gain. These findings may provide a new biological
   perspective for the development of novel treatments and preventive
   measures for social problems associated with the sign effect.}},

Abstract = {{Opening and closing the eyes are fundamental behaviors for directing
   attention to the external versus internal world. However, it remains
   unclear whether the states of eyes-open (EO) relative to eyes-closed
   (EC) are associated with different topological organizations of
   functional neural networks for exteroceptive and interoceptive
   processing (processing the external world and internal state,
   respectively). Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging and neural network analysis to investigate the topological
   properties of functional networks of the human brain when the eyes were
   open versus closed. The brain networks exhibited higher cliquishness and
   local efficiency, but lower global efficiency during the EO state
   compared to the EC state. These properties suggest an increase in
   specialized information processing along with a decrease in integrated
   information processing in EO (vs. EC). More importantly, the
   ``exteroceptive{''} network, including the attentional system (e.g.,
   superior parietal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule), ocular motor
   system (e.g., precentral gyrus and superior frontal gyrus), and arousal
   system (e.g., insula and thalamus), showed higher regional nodal
   properties (nodal degree, efficiency and betweenness centrality) in EO
   relative to EC. In contrast, the ``interoceptive{''} network, composed
   of visual system (e.g., lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus and cuneus),
   auditory system (e.g., Heschl's gyurs), somatosensory system (e.g.,
   postcentral gyrus), and part of the default mode network (e.g., angular
   gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus), showed significantly higher
   regional properties in EC vs. EO. In addition, the connections across
   sensory modalities were altered by volitional eye opening. The
   synchronicity between the visual system and the motor, somatosensory and
   auditory systems, characteristic of EC, was attenuated in EO. Further,
   the connections between the visual system and the attention, arousal and
   subcortical systems were increased in EO. These results may indicate
   that EO leads to a suppression of sensory modalities (other than visual)
   to allocate resources to exteroceptive processing. Our findings suggest
   that the topological organization of human brain networks dynamically
   switches corresponding to the information processing modes as we open or
   close our eyes. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral studies indicate that theory of mind and counterfactual
   reasoning are strongly related cognitive processes. In a neuroimaging
   study, we explored the common and distinct regions underlying these
   inference processes. We directly compared false belief reasoning
   (inferring an agent's false belief about an object's location or
   content) and counterfactual reasoning (inferring what the object's
   location or content would be if an agent had acted differently), both in
   contrast with a baseline condition of conditional reasoning (inferring
   what the true location or content of an object is). Results indicate
   that these three types of reasoning about social scenarios are supported
   by activations in the mentalizing network (left temporo-parietal
   junction and precuneus) and the executive control network (bilateral
   prefrontal cortex {[}PFC] and right inferior parietal lobule). In
   addition, representing a false belief or counterfactual state (both not
   directly observable in the external world) recruits additional activity
   in the executive control network (left dorsolateral PFC and parietal
   lobe). The results further suggest that counterfactual reasoning is a
   more complex cognitive process than false belief reasoning, showing
   stronger activation of the dorsomedial, left dorsolateral PFC,
   cerebellum and left temporal cortex. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   examine the neural substrates of social cognition and face processing in
   a group of healthy young adults to examine the neural substrates of
   social cognition.
   Methods: Fifty-seven undergraduates completed a battery of social
   cognition tasks and were assessed with electroencephalography (EEG)
   during a face-perception task. A subset (N=22) were administered a
   face-perception task during functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: Variance in the N170 EEG was predicted by social attribution
   performance and by a quantitative measure of empathy. Neurally, face
   processing was more bilateral in females than in males. Variance in fMRI
   voxel count in the face-sensitive fusiform gyrus was predicted by
   quantitative measures of social behavior, including the Social
   Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Empathizing Quotient.
   Conclusions: When measured as a quantitative trait, social behaviors in
   typical and pathological populations share common neural pathways. The
   results highlight the importance of viewing neurodevelopmental and
   neuropsychiatric disorders as spectrum phenomena that may be informed by
   studies of the normal distribution of relevant traits in the general
   population. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Across a wide variety of domains, experts differ from novices in their
   response to stimuli linked to their respective field of expertise. It is
   currently unknown whether similar patterns can be observed with regard
   to social expertise. The current study therefore focuses on social
   openness, a central social skill necessary to initiate social contact.
   Human body odors were used as social cues, as they inherently signal the
   presence of another human being. Using functional MRI, hemodynamic brain
   responses to body odors of women reporting a high (n = 14) or a low (n =
   12) level of social openness were compared. Greater activation within
   the inferior frontal gyrus and the caudate nucleus was observed in high
   socially open individuals compared to individuals low in social
   openness. With the inferior frontal gyrus being a crucial part of the
   human mirror neuron system, and the caudate nucleus being implicated in
   social reward, it is discussed whether human body odor might constitute
   more of a significant and rewarding social signal to individuals high in
   social openness compared to individuals low in social openness process.}},

Abstract = {{Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on autism
   spectrum condition (ASC) have identified dysfunctions in specific brain
   networks involved in social and non-social cognition that persist into
   adulthood. Although increasing numbers of fMRI studies have revealed
   atypical functional connectivity in the adult ASC brain, such functional
   alterations at the network level have not yet been fully characterized
   within the recently developed graph-theoretical framework. Here, we
   applied a graph-theoretical analysis to resting-state fMRI data acquired
   from 46 adults with ASC and 46 age- and gender-matched controls, to
   investigate the topological properties and organization of autistic
   brain network. Analyses of global metrics revealed that, relative to the
   controls, participants with ASC exhibited significant decreases in
   clustering coefficient and characteristic path length, indicating a
   shift towards randomized organization. Furthermore, analyses of local
   metrics revealed a significantly altered organization of the hub nodes
   in ASC, as shown by analyses of hub disruption indices using multiple
   local metrics and by a loss of `' hubness `' in several nodes (e. g.,
   the bilateral superior temporal sulcus, right dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex, and precuneus) that are critical for social and non-social
   cognitive functions. In particular, local metrics of the anterior
   cingulate cortex consistently showed significant negative correlations
   with the Autism-Spectrum Quotient score. Our results demonstrate altered
   patterns of global and local topological properties that may underlie
   impaired social and non-social cognition in ASC.}},

Title = {{Spatially Distributed Effects of Mental Exhaustion on Resting-State FMRI
   Networks}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{Brain activity during rest is spatially coherent over functional
   connectivity networks called resting-state networks. In restingstate
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, independent component analysis
   yields spatially distributed network representations reflecting distinct
   mental processes, such as intrinsic (default) or extrinsic (executive)
   attention, and sensory inhibition or excitation. These aspects can be
   related to different treatments or subjective experiences. Among these,
   exhaustion is a common psychological state induced by prolonged mental
   performance. Using repeated functional magnetic resonance imaging
   sessions and spatial independent component analysis, we explored the
   effect of several hours of sustained cognitive performances on the
   resting human brain. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   was performed on the same healthy volunteers in two days, with and
   without, and before, during and after, an intensive psychological
   treatment (skill training and sustained practice with a flight
   simulator). After each scan, subjects rated their level of exhaustion
   and performed an N-back task to evaluate eventual decrease in cognitive
   performance. Spatial maps of selected resting-state network components
   were statistically evaluated across time points to detect possible
   changes induced by the sustained mental performance. The intensive
   treatment had a significant effect on exhaustion and effort ratings, but
   no effects on N-back performances. Significant changes in the most
   exhausted state were observed in the early visual processing and the
   anterior default mode networks (enhancement) and in the fronto-parietal
   executive networks (suppression), suggesting that mental exhaustion is
   associated with a more idling brain state and that internal attention
   processes are facilitated to the detriment of more extrinsic processes.
   The described application may inspire future indicators of the level of
   fatigue in the neural attention system.}},

Title = {{fNIRS derived hemodynamic signals and electrodermal responses in a
   sequential risk-taking task}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{1557}},
Pages = {{141-154}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{The study measured cortical hemodynamic signals and peripheral
   correlates of decision makers during a dynamic risky task, the Just One
   More task (PM), in which the risky decision entails choosing whether to
   incrementally increase accumulated earnings at the risk of ruin (going
   bust ending up with nothing). Twenty subjects participated in multiple
   instantiations of this task in which the probability of ruin and size of
   the stakes varied. Physiological correlates were simultaneously
   quantified by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) over
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and electrodermal activity (EDA).
   First, in the task decision phase (i.e., when subjects are contemplating
   options before making a choice) probability of ruin had a dissociating
   effect on fNIRS and EDA. fNIRS derived DLPFC hemodynamic signals
   reflected a subjective value signal, correlating positively with
   individual risk attitude. Contrary, EDA reflected the probability of
   ruin in terms of a common affective measure, irrespective of individuals
   risk attitude. Second, during the task outcome phase (i.e., the time
   after subjects have made a choice and observed the outcomes) fNIRS and
   EDA revealed opposite patterns. While fNIRS derived DLPFC hemodynamic
   signals were larger in response to gains, EDA signals were larger in
   response to losses; both patterns were statistically independent of
   individual risk attitude. Lastly, fNIRS derived DLPFC hemodynamic
   signals in the decision phase correlated positively with the mean round
   earnings, providing a measure of the quality of the individual
   decision-making performance. Together with the positive correlation with
   individual risk attitude, our findings indicate that fNIRS signals, but
   not EDA, could be taken as a useful method for studying individual risk
   attitude and task performance in dynamic risky decision-making. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{The mind-reading hypothesis of humor and the inner eye theory of
   laughter both claim that readers' mentalizing about characters in jokes
   is essential for perceiving humor. On the basis of this notion, we
   hypothesized that point-to-other verbal jokes (in which one character
   said funny things about the other character) induced more theory of mind
   (TOM) processing than point-to-self verbal jokes (in which one character
   said funny things about him/herself to the other character). Our
   hypothesis was tested by comparing percent signal changes of these two
   conditions in six core components of the ToM neural network. A
   whole-brain analysis was also conducted. Results from both the region of
   interest (ROI) analysis and the whole-brain analysis show that theory of
   mind network is more activated when subjects read point-to-other jokes
   than when they read point-to-self jokes. Moreover, the whole-brain
   results provide support for the viewpoint that the right hemisphere,
   especially the right frontal lobe, is important in ToM and humor
   processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The integrity of structural connectivity in a functional brain network
   supports the efficiency of neural processing within relevant brain
   regions. This study aimed to quantitatively investigate the short- and
   long-range fibers, and their differential roles in the lower cognitive
   efficiency in aging and dementia. Three groups of healthy young, healthy
   older adults and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) participated in
   this combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI) study on prospective memory (PM). Short- and
   long-range fiber tracts within the PM task engaged brain networks were
   generated. The correlation between the fMRI signal change, PM
   performance and the DTI characters were calculated. FMRI results showed
   that the PM-specific frontal activations in three groups were
   distributed hierarchically along the rostrocaudal axis in the frontal
   lobe. In an overall PM condition generally activated brain network among
   the three groups, tractography was used to generate the short-range
   fibers, and they were found impaired in both healthy older adults and AD
   patients. However, the long-range fiber tracts were only impaired in AD.
   Additionally, the mean diffusivity (MD) of short- range but not
   long-range fibers was positively correlated with fMRI signal change and
   negatively correlated with the efficiency of PM performance. This study
   suggests that the disintegrity of short-range fibers may contribute more
   to the lower cognitive efficiency and higher compensatory brain
   activation in healthy older adults and more in AD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary neuroscience and the advanced technology of neuroimaging
   has increasingly permeated the field of criminal law and criminology.
   This technology is extremely useful in medicine, but its critics warn of
   hasty, simplified, or potentially misleading interpretations of such
   displays of brain activity The precise images and empirical measurements
   of brain pathology led to the rapid growth in the field of
   neurocriminology. Its paradigm recalls the heritage of positivistic
   biological theories of criminality in the late 19th and early 20th
   century, which was largely abandoned in the second half of the 20th
   century. Neurocriminology explores the connection between an
   individuals' structural or functional brain anomalies, and their
   antisocial behaviour. By identifying pathological brains, it strives to
   recognize potential risks in the social body and react accordingly.
   Indeed, rigorous use of the most advanced neuroscientific technologies
   in criminal law promises efficient and reliable shortcuts to solving
   criminal cases. Such techniques include detecting deceit, and so-called
   ``brain fingerprinting{''} (looking for memory traces). These
   approaches, initially used in pre-trial investigations, quickly found
   their way into the criminal courts in India and the United States. In
   spite of strong critiques from both the legal and neuroscientific
   communities, they now have full probative value. Modern neuroscientific
   techniques within the context of criminology and criminal law can
   therefore be perceived as an efficient surveillance mechanism a tool to
   recognize the criminal in the brain and to reveal the crime from the
   brain.}},

Abstract = {{Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and major depressive disorder
   (MDD) share numerous features, including dysphoric affect, irritability,
   suicidality, and a heightened sensitivity to perceived interpersonal
   rejection. However, these disorders are associated with divergent
   profiles of reactivity to rejection: Individuals with MDD are more
   likely to respond with withdrawal and isolation, and those with BPD
   appear to respond with increased approach behaviors and greater
   hostility. Potential mechanisms underlying these divergent patterns of
   response have not been elaborated. The goal of the present study was to
   assess whether prefrontal cortical asymmetry is associated with these
   behavioral profiles. EEG alpha activity was recorded at baseline and
   after individuals with BPD, MDD and healthy controls (HCs) participated
   in a rejection task. Although no differences were found at baseline,
   results demonstrated that following rejection, individuals with BPD
   showed greater left cortical activation, consistent with approach
   motivation, whereas those with MDD showed greater right cortical
   activation, consistent with withdrawal motivation. HCs evidenced a more
   balanced cortical profile, as hypothesized. Although BPD and MDD are
   highly comorbid, are easily confused, and are phenomenologically similar
   in a number of ways, individuals with these two disorders respond in
   very different ways to perceived rejection.}},

Abstract = {{The tendency to trust and to cooperate increases from adolescence to
   adulthood. This social development has been associated with improved
   mentalizing and age-related changes in brain function. Thus far, there
   is limited imaging data investigating these associations. We used two
   trust games with a trustworthy and an unfair partner to explore the
   brain mechanisms underlying trust and cooperation in subjects ranging
   from adolescence to mid-adulthood. Increasing age was associated with
   higher trust at the onset of social interactions, increased levels of
   trust during interactions with a trustworthy partner and a stronger
   decline in trust during interactions with an unfair partner. Our
   findings demonstrate a behavioural shift towards higher trust and an
   age-related increase in the sensitivity to others' negative social
   signals. Increased brain activation in mentalizing regions, i.e.
   temporo-parietal junction, posterior cingulate and precuneus, supported
   the behavioural change. Additionally, age was associated with reduced
   activation in the reward-related orbitofrontal cortex and caudate
   nucleus during interactions with a trustworthy partner, possibly
   reflecting stronger expectations of trustworthiness. During unfair
   interactions, age-related increases in anterior cingulate activation, an
   area implicated in conflict monitoring, may mirror the necessity to
   inhibit pro-social tendencies in the face of the partner's actual levels
   of cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Expectations about an upcoming emotional event have the power to shape
   one's subsequent affective response for better or worse. Here, we used
   mediation analyses to examine the relationship between brain activity
   when anticipating the need to cognitively reappraise aversive images,
   amygdala responses to those images and subsequent success in diminishing
   negative affect. We found that anticipatory activity in right
   rostrolateral prefrontal cortex was associated with greater subsequent
   left amygdala responses to aversive images and decreased regulation
   success. In contrast, anticipatory ventral anterior insula activity was
   associated with reduced amygdala responses and greater reappraisal
   success. In both cases, left amygdala responses mediated the
   relationship between anticipatory activity and reappraisal success.
   These results suggest that anticipation facilitates successful
   reappraisal via reduced anticipatory prefrontal `cognitive' elaboration
   and better integration of affective information in paralimbic and

Abstract = {{Social interactions occur within a variety of different
   contexts-cooperative/competitive-and often involve members of our social
   network. Here, we investigated whether social network modulated the
   value placed on positive outcomes during a competitive context. Eighteen
   human participants played a simple card-guessing game with three
   different competitors: a close friend (in-network), a confederate
   (out-of-network) and a random number generator (non-social condition)
   while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Neuroimaging
   results at the time of outcome receipt demonstrated a significant main
   effect of competitor across multiple regions of medial prefrontal
   cortex, with Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) responses strongest
   when competing against one's friend compared with all other conditions.
   Striatal BOLD responses demonstrated a more general sensitivity to
   positive compared with negative monetary outcomes, which an exploratory
   analysis revealed to be stronger when interacting with social, compared
   with non-social, competitors. Interestingly, a Granger causality
   analysis indicated directed influences sent from an medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) region, which shows social network differentiation of
   outcomes, and the ventral striatum bilaterally. Our results suggest that
   when competing against others of varying degrees of social network, mPFC
   differentially values these outcomes, perhaps treating in-network
   outcomes as more informative, leaving the striatum to more general value
   computations.}},

Abstract = {{Social comparisons are an important means by which we gain information
   about the self, but little is known about the neural mechanisms
   underlying comparative social judgment, as most prior functional
   magnetic resonance imaging research on this topic has investigated
   judgments of self or others in isolation. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC) has routinely been implicated in social cognitive tasks that
   rely on such absolute judgments about the self or others, but it is
   unclear whether activity in this region is modulated by personal
   relevance of social stimuli or self-similarity of judgment targets.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that these
   forces interact to determine vmPFC response during social comparisons,
   as well as neural activity in the bilateral anterior insulae.
   Comparisons between the self and similar others exhibit a unique
   response in this region when compared with other judgment contexts,
   suggesting that the special psychological status afforded to these

Abstract = {{Recently, it has been shown that the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is

   imaging (fMRI) study, we directly tested this hypothesis by
   investigating whether medial prefrontal activity in error observation is
   restricted to situations that enable simulation. To this aim, we
   compared brain activity related to the observation of errors that can be
   simulated (human errors) with brain activity related to errors that
   cannot be simulated (machine errors). We show that medial prefrontal
   activity is not only restricted to the observation of human errors but
   also occurs when observing errors of a machine. In addition, our data
   indicate that the MPFC reflects a domain general mechanism of monitoring

Abstract = {{Behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized by vigilance to
   novelty, sensitivity to approach-withdrawal cues and social reticence in
   childhood, is associated with risk for anxiety in adolescence.
   Independent studies link reward hyper-responsivity to BI, adolescent
   anxiety and dopamine gene variants. This exploratory study extends these
   observations by examining the impact of DRD4 genotype and reward
   hyper-responsivity on the BI-anxiety link. Adolescents (N = 78)
   completed a monetary incentive delay task in the fMRI environment.
   Participants were characterized based on a continuous score of BI and
   the 7-repeat allele (7R+) of the DRD4 functional polymorphism.
   Parent-report and self-report measures of anxiety were also collected.
   Across the entire sample, striatal activation increased systematically
   with increases in the magnitude of anticipated monetary gains and
   losses. DRD4 status moderated the relation between BI and activation in
   the caudate nucleus. Childhood BI was associated with parent report of
   adolescent anxiety among 7R+ participants with elevated levels of
   striatal response to incentive cues. DRD4 genotype influenced the
   relations among neural response to incentives, early childhood BI and
   anxiety. The findings help refine our understanding of the role
   reward-related brain systems play in the emergence of anxiety in
   temperamentally at-risk individuals, building a foundation for future
   larger scale studies.}},

Abstract = {{Reminders of mortality influence human social cognition, but whether and
   how reminders of mortality affect brain activity underlying social
   cognition remains unclear. To test whether increasing mortality salience
   modulates neural responses to others' suffering, we scanned healthy
   adults who viewed video clips showing others in pain using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. One group of participants were primed to
   increase mortality salience and another group were primed with negative
   affect in terms of fear/anxiety. We found that perceiving painful vs
   non-painful stimuli in the pre-priming session activated the
   midcingulate/dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (MCC/dMPFC), bilateral
   anterior insula/inferior frontal cortex, bilateral secondary
   somatosensory cortex and left middle temporal gyrus. However, MCC/dMPFC
   activity in response to perceived pain in others was significantly
   decreased in the post-priming session by the mortality salience priming,
   but was not influenced by the negative affect priming. Moreover,
   subjective fear of death induced by the priming procedures mediated the
   change in MCC/dMPFC activity across the priming procedures. Subjective
   fear of death also moderated the co-variation of MCC/dMPFC and left
   insular activity during perception of others in pain. Our findings
   indicate that reminders of mortality decrease neural responses to
   others' suffering and this effect is mediated by the subjective fear of
   death.}},

Abstract = {{This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate
   brain activation during preparatory and regulatory control while
   participants (N = 24) were instructed either to simply view or decrease
   their emotional response to, pleasant, neutral or unpleasant pictures. A
   main effect of emotional valence on brain activity was found in the
   right precentral gyrus, with greater activation during positive than
   negative emotion regulation. A main effect of regulation phase was
   evident in the bilateral anterior prefrontal cortex (PFC), precuneus,
   posterior cingulate cortex, right putamen and temporal and occipital
   lobes, with greater activity in these regions during preparatory than
   regulatory control. A valence X regulation interaction was evident in
   regions of ventromedial PFC and anterior cingulate cortex, reflecting
   greater activation while regulating negative than positive emotion, but
   only during active emotion regulation (not preparation). Conjunction
   analyses revealed common brain regions involved in differing types of
   emotion regulation including selected areas of left lateral PFC,
   inferior parietal lobe, temporal lobe, right cerebellum and bilateral
   dorsomedial PFC. The right lateral PFC was additionally activated during

Abstract = {{Psychopaths show a reduced ability to recognize emotion facial
   expressions, which may disturb the interpersonal relationship
   development and successful social adaptation. Behavioral hypotheses
   point toward an association between emotion recognition deficits in
   psychopathy and amygdala dysfunction. Our prediction was that amygdala
   dysfunction would combine deficient activation with disturbances in
   functional connectivity with cortical regions of the face-processing
   network. Twenty-two psychopaths and 22 control subjects were assessed
   and functional magnetic resonance maps were generated to identify both
   brain activation and task-induced functional connectivity using
   psychophysiological interaction analysis during an emotional
   face-matching task. Results showed significant amygdala activation in
   control subjects only, but differences between study groups did not
   reach statistical significance. In contrast, psychopaths showed
   significantly increased activation in visual and prefrontal areas, with
   this latest activation being associated with psychopaths'
   affective-interpersonal disturbances. Psychophysiological interaction
   analyses revealed a reciprocal reduction in functional connectivity
   between the left amygdala and visual and prefrontal cortices. Our
   results suggest that emotional stimulation may evoke a relevant cortical
   response in psychopaths, but a disruption in the processing of emotional
   faces exists involving the reciprocal functional interaction between the
   amygdala and neocortex, consistent with the notion of a failure to
   integrate emotion into cognition in psychopathic individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneous fluctuations can be measured in the brain that reflect
   dissociable functional networks oscillating at synchronized frequencies,
   such as the default mode network (DMN). In contrast to its diametrically
   opposed task-positive counterpart, the DMN predominantly signals during
   a state of rest, and inappropriate regulation of this network has been
   associated with inattention, a core characteristic of
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To examine whether
   abnormalities can be identified in the DMN component of patients with
   ADHD, we applied an independent components analysis to resting state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired from 22 male
   medication-naive adults with ADHD and 23 neurotypical individuals. We
   observed a stronger coherence of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (dlPFC) with the DMN component in patients with ADHD which correlated
   with measures of selective attention. The increased left dlPFC-DMN
   coherence also surfaced in a whole-brain replication analysis involving
   an independent sample of 9 medication-naive adult patients and 9
   controls. In addition, a post hoc seed-to-voxel functional connectivity
   analysis using the dlPFC as a seed region to further examine this
   region's suggested connectivity differences uncovered a higher temporal
   coherence with various other neural networks and confirmed a reduced
   anticorrelation with the DMN. These results point to a more diffuse
   connectivity between functional networks in patients with ADHD.
   Moreover, our findings suggest that state-inappropriate neural activity
   in ADHD is not confined to DMN intrusion during attention-demanding
   contexts, but also surfaces as an insufficient suppression of dlPFC
   signaling in relation to DMN activity during rest. Together with
   previous findings, these results point to a general dysfunction in the
   orthogonality of functional networks. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1261-1272, 2014.

Abstract = {{Making inferences beyond the literal meaning of sentences occurs with
   certain scalar expressions via scalar implicatures. For example, adults
   usually interpret some as some but not all. On the basis of behavioral
   research, it has been suggested that processing implicatures is
   cognitively costly. However, many studies have used cases where
   sentences with some did not match the context in which they were
   presented. Our study aimed to examine whether the processing cost is
   linked to implicature generation, to the mismatch between the
   implicature and the context, or to both processes. To do so, we explored
   the neural patterns of implicature generation and implicature mismatch
   using fMRI. Thirteen participants performed a sentence-picture matching
   task (where pictures determined the context) with mismatched
   implicatures, successful implicatures or no implicature conditions.
   Several brain regions were identified when comparing cases of
   implicature mismatch and cases without implicatures. One of these
   regions, left-IFG, was jointly activated for mismatched and successful
   implicatures, as observed in a conjunction analysis. By contrast,
   left-MFG and medial-frontal-gyrus, were identified when comparing cases
   of implicature mismatch with cases of successful implicatures. Thus, the
   left IFG can be interpreted as being linked to implicature generation,
   whereas the other two areas seem to participate in the processing of the
   mismatch between the implicature and its context. Our results indicate
   that scalar implicatures induce processing cost in different ways. This
   should be considered in future research. Hum Brain Mapp 35:1503-1514,

Abstract = {{People preferentially imitate others who are similar to them or have
   high social status. Such imitative biases are thought to have evolved
   because they increase the efficiency of cultural acquisition. Here we
   focused on distinguishing between self-similarity and social status as
   two candidate mechanisms underlying neural responses to a person's race
   during imitation. We used fMRI to measure neural responses when 20
   African American (AA) and 20 European American (EA) young adults
   imitated AA, EA and Chinese American (CA) models and also passively
   observed their gestures and faces. We found that both AA and EA
   participants exhibited more activity in lateral frontoparietal and
   visual regions when imitating AAs compared with EAs or CAs. These
   results suggest that racial self-similarity is not likely to modulate
   neural responses to race during imitation, in contrast with findings
   from previous neuroimaging studies of face perception and action
   observation. Furthermore, AA and EA participants associated AAs with
   lower social status than EAs or CAs, suggesting that the social status
   associated with different racial groups may instead modulate neural
   activity during imitation of individuals from those groups. Taken
   together, these findings suggest that neural responses to race during
   imitation are driven by socially learned associations rather than
   self-similarity. This may reflect the adaptive role of imitation in
   social learning, where learning from higher status models can be more
   beneficial. This study provides neural evidence consistent with
   evolutionary theories of cultural acquisition. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Objective Movement dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) is well
   documented but its cause remains unclear. This study examined whether
   motor symptoms are caused by sensory impairment, executive dysfunction
   or other factors.
   Methods We examined the integration of tactile and motor programmes
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in early stage PD
   patients compared with neurologically normal controls, to investigate
   neural mechanisms underlying movement dysfunction.
   Results Twenty-two control participants exhibited activation in an
   extensive network of cortical regions involved in tactile-motor
   integration. Decreased activation in somatosensory and motor regions
   during performance of passive tactile and movement tasks was found in 21
   PD patients. The extrastriate visual cortex exhibited greater activation
   in controls during performance of the tasks. In contrast, greater
   activation in bilateral prefrontal regions was found in PD patients.
   Conclusions These results indicate that the extrastriate visual cortex
   is a multisensory region playing an important role in sensorimotor
   integration. The findings suggest that PD patients exhibit decreased
   activation in the extrastriate visual cortex, possibly related to
   dysfunctional integrative processing, and compensatory activity in the
   prefrontal cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Resting-state functional near-infrared spectroscopy (R-fNIRS) is an
   active area of interest and is currently attracting considerable
   attention as a new imaging tool for the study of resting-state brain
   function. Using variations in hemodynamic concentration signals, R-fNIRS
   measures the brain's low-frequency spontaneous neural activity,
   combining the advantages of portability, low-cost, high temporal
   sampling rate and less physical burden to participants. The temporal
   synchronization of spontaneous neuronal activity in anatomically
   separated regions is referred to as resting-state functional
   connectivity (RSFC). In the past several years, an increasing body of
   R-fNIRS RSFC studies has led to many important findings about functional
   integration among local or whole-brain regions by measuring
   inter-regional temporal synchronization. Here, we summarize recent
   advances made in the R-fNIRS RSFC methodologies, from the detection of
   RSFC (e.g., seed-based correlation analysis, independent component
   analysis, whole-brain correlation analysis, and graph-theoretical
   topological analysis), to the assessment of RSFC performance (e.g.,
   reliability, repeatability, and validity), to the application of RSFC in
   studying normal development and brain disorders. The literature reviewed
   here suggests that RSFC analyses based on R-fNIRS data are valid and
   reliable for the study of brain function in healthy and diseased
   populations, thus providing a promising imaging tool for cognitive
   science and clinics.}},

Title = {{Brain, body, and cognition: Neural, physiological and self-report
   correlates of phobic and normative fear}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{98}},
Pages = {{59-69}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The phobic fear response appears to resemble an intense form of normal
   threat responding that can be induced in a nonthreatening situation.
   However, normative and phobic fear are rarely contrasted directly, thus
   the degree to which these two types of fear elicit similar neural and
   bodily responses is not well understood. To examine biological
   correlates of normal and phobic fear, 21 snake phobic and 21 nonphobic
   controls saw videos of slithering snakes, attacking snakes and fish in
   an event-related fMRI design. Simultaneous eletrodermal, pupillary, and
   self-reported affective responses were collected. Nonphobic fear
   activated a network of threat-responsive brain regions and involved
   pupillary dilation, electrodermal response and self-reported affect
   selective to the attacking snakes. Phobic fear recruited a large array
   of brain regions including those active in normal fear plus additional
   structures and also engendered increased pupil dilation, electrodermal
   and self-reported responses that were greater to any snake versus fish.
   Importantly, phobics showed greater between- and within-subject
   concordance among neural, electrodermal, pupillary, and subjective
   report measures. These results suggest phobic responses recruit
   overlapping but more strongly activated and more extensive networks of
   brain activity as compared to normative fear, and are characterized by
   greater concordance among neural activation, peripheral physiology and
   self-report. It is yet unclear whether concordance is unique to
   psychopathology, or rather simply an indicator of the intense fear seen
   in the phobic response, but these results underscore the importance of
   synchrony between brain, body, and cognition during the phobic reaction.

Abstract = {{Some autistic children pass classic Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks that
   others fail, but the significance of this finding is at present unclear.
   We identified two such groups of primary school age (labelled ToM+ and
   ToM-) and a matched comparison group of typically developing children
   (TD). Five years later we tested these participants again on a ToM test
   battery appropriate for adolescents and conducted an fMRI study with a
   story based ToM task. We also assessed autistic core symptoms at these
   two time points. At both times the ToM-group showed more severe social
   communication impairments than the ToM+ group, and while showing an
   improvement in mentalizing performance, they continued to show a
   significant impairment compared to the NT group. Two independent ROI
   analyses of the BOLD signal showed activation of the mentalizing network
   including medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate and lateral
   temporal cortices. Strikingly, both ToM+ and ToM- groups showed very
   similar patterns of heightened activation in comparison with the NT
   group. No differences in other brain regions were apparent. Thus,
   autistic adolescents who do not have a history of mentalizing as
   children who did have such a history. This finding indicates that
   heterogeneity at the behavioural level may nevertheless map onto a
   similar phenotype at the neuro-cognitive level. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Title = {{Developmental changes of neuronal networks associated with strategic
   social decision-making}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{37-46}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: One of the important prerequisites for successful social
   interaction is the willingness of each individual to cooperate socially.
   Using the ultimatum game, several studies have demonstrated that the
   process of decision-making to cooperate or to defeat in interaction with
   a partner is associated with activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AI),
   and inferior frontal cortex (IFC). This study investigates developmental
   changes in this neuronal network.
   Methods: 15 healthy children (8-12 years), 15 adolescents (13-18 years)
   and 15 young adults (19-28 years) were investigated using the ultimatum
   game. Neuronal networks representing decision-making based on strategic
   thinking were characterized using functional MRI.
   Results: In all age groups, the process of decision-making in reaction
   to unfair offers was associated with hemodynamic changes in similar
   regions. Compared with children, however, healthy adults and adolescents
   revealed greater activation in the IFC and the fusiform gyrus, as well
   as the nucleus accumbens. In contrast, healthy children displayed more
   activation in the AI, the dorsal part of the ACC, and the DLPFC. There
   were no differences in brain activations between adults and adolescents.
   Conclusion: The neuronal mechanisms underlying strategic social decision
   making are already developed by the age of eight. Decision-making based
   on strategic thinking is associated with age-dependent involvement of
   different brain regions. Neuronal networks underlying theory of mind and
   reward anticipation are more activated in adults and adolescents with
   regard to the increasing perspective taking with age. In relation to
   emotional reactivity and respective compensatory coping in younger ages,
   children have higher activations in a neuronal network associated with
   emotional processing and executive control. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The medial pFC (mPFC) is frequently reported to play a central role in

   of mental states (beliefs and desires). The level of demands on
   cognitive control (high vs. low) and the nature of the demands on
   reasoning (deductive vs. abductive) were varied orthogonally between
   conditions. Activation in dorsal mPFC was modulated by the need for
   control, whereas rostral mPFC was modulated by reasoning demands. These
   findings fit with previously suggested domain-general functions for
   different parts of mPFC and suggest that these functions are recruited
   selectively in the service of ToM.}},

   in 15 highly hypnotically susceptible volunteers to investigate changes
   in brain activity accompanying different experiences of loss of
   self-control of movement. Suggestions of external personal control and
   internal personal control over involuntary movements modelled delusions
   of control and spirit possession respectively. A suggestion of
   impersonal control by a malfunctioning machine modelled technical
   delusions of control, where involuntary movements are attributed to the
   influence of machines. We found that (i) brain activity and/or
   connectivity significantly varied with different experiences and
   attributions of loss of agency; (ii) compared to the impersonal control
   condition, both external and internal personal alien control were
   associated with increased connectivity between primary motor cortex (M1)
   and brain regions involved in attribution of mental states and
   representing the self in relation to others; (iii) compared to both
   personal alien control conditions, impersonal control of movement was
   associated with increased activity in brain regions involved in error
   detection and object imagery; (iv) there were no significant differences
   in brain activity, and minor differences in M1 connectivity, between the
   external and internal personal alien control conditions. Brain networks
   supporting error detection and object imagery, together with
   representation of self and others, are differentially recruited to
   support experiences of impersonal and personal control of involuntary
   movements. However, similar brain systems underpin attributions and
   experiences of external and internal alien control of movement. Loss of
   self-agency for movement can therefore accompany different kinds of
   experience of alien control supported by distinct brain mechanisms.
   These findings caution against generalization about single cognitive
   processes or brain systems underpinning different experiences of loss of
   self-control of movement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   These outputs are particularly desirable in case of neuropsychiatric

   particular disorders. This paper presents a scheme for automated
   classification from magnetic resonance images based on multiresolution

   algorithm, utilizing support vector machines classifier, is introduced
   and tested on a dataset containing 104 patients with first episode

Abstract = {{Developmental models of psychopathology posit that exposure to social
   stressors may confer risk for depression in adolescent girls by
   disrupting neural reward circuitry. The current study tested this
   hypothesis by examining the relationship between early adolescent social
   stressors and later neural reward processing and depressive symptoms.
   Participants were 120 girls from an ongoing longitudinal study of
   precursors to depression across adolescent development. Low parental
   warmth, peer victimization, and depressive symptoms were assessed when
   the girls were 11 and 12 years old, and participants completed a
   monetary reward guessing fMRI task and assessment of depressive symptoms
   at age 16. Results indicate that low parental warmth was associated with
   increased response to potential rewards in the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC), striatum, and amygdala, whereas peer victimization was
   associated with decreased response to potential rewards in the mPFC.
   Furthermore, concurrent depressive symptoms were associated with
   increased reward anticipation response in mPFC and striatal regions that
   were also associated with early adolescent psychosocial stressors, with
   mPFC and striatal response mediating the association between social
   stressors and depressive symptoms. These findings are consistent with
   developmental models that emphasize the adverse impact of early
   psychosocial stressors on neural reward processing and risk for
   depression in adolescence. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The current fMRI study investigates the neural foundations of evaluating
   oneself and others during early adolescence and young adulthood.
   Eighteen early adolescents (ages 11-14, M = 12.6) and 19 young adults
   (ages 22-31, M = 25.6) evaluated whether academic, physical, and social
   traits described themselves directly (direct self-evaluations),
   described their best friend directly (direct other-evaluations),
   described themselves from their best friend's perspective (reflected
   self-evaluations),or in general could change over time (control
   malleability-evaluations). Compared to control evaluations, both
   adolescents and adults recruited cortical midline structures during
   direct and reflected self-evaluations, as well as during direct
   other-evaluations, converging with previous research. However, unique to
   this study was a significant three-way interaction between age group,
   evaluative perspective, and domain within bilateral ventral striatum.
   Region of interest analyses demonstrated a significant evaluative
   perspective by domain interaction within the adolescent sample only.
   Adolescents recruited greatest bilateral ventral striatum during
   reflected social self evaluations, which was positively correlated with
   age and pubertal development. These findings suggest that reflected
   social self-evaluations, made from the inferred perspective of a close
   peer, may be especially self-relevant, salient, or rewarding to
   adolescent self processing - particularly during the progression through
   adolescence - and this feature persists into adulthood. (C) 2014 The

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Attention modulation when confronted with emotional stimuli is
   considered a critical aspect of executive function, yet rarely studied
   during childhood and adolescence, a developmental period marked with
   changes in these processes. We employed a novel, and child-friendly fMRI
   task that used emotional faces to investigate the neural underpinnings
   of the attention-emotion interaction in a child and adolescent sample (n
   = 23, age M = 13.46, SD = 2.86, range = 8.05-16.93 years). Results
   implied modulation of activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) due
   to emotional distractor valence, which marginally correlated with
   participant age. Additionally, parent-reported emotional reactivity
   predicted the trajectory of BOLD signal increase for fearful emotional
   face distractors such that participants low in emotional reactivity had
   a steeper latency to peak activation. Results imply that the use of the
   OFC to modulate attention in the face of social/emotional stimuli may
   mature with age and may be tightly coupled with adaptive emotional
   functioning. Findings are discussed in the context of risk for the
   development of psychiatric disorders, where increased emotional

Abstract = {{Previous research has noted disrupted patterns of neural activation
   during emotion, processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD). However, prior research relied on, designs that may place greater
   cognitive load on individuals with ASD. In order to address this issue,
   we adapted the fMRI task of Ochsner et al. (2004a) for children by,
   presenting fewer stimuli, with fewer valence levels, and longer stimuli
   duration. A localizer sample of, typically developing children (n = 26)
   was used to construct regions of interest involved in emotional,
   processing. Activations in these regions during self- and
   other-referential emotion processing was, compared in age, IQ, gender
   matched groups (n = 17 ASD, n = 16 TD). Matched samples replicate,
   condition contrasts of the localizer, but no group differences were
   found in behavior measures or, neural activation. An exploratory
   functional connectivity analysis in a subset of the matched groups, also
   did not detect striking differences between the groups. These findings
   suggest that disruptions in activation in emotion processing neural
   networks in ASD is partially a function of task related cognitive load.

Abstract = {{The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1344706 in ZNF804A is one of

   the ability to understand other people's mental states. This skill,
   commonly referred to as Theory of Mind (ToM), has consistently been
   found to be impaired in schizophrenia. Using functional magnetic

   rs1344706 impacted on activity and connectivity of key areas of the ToM
   network, including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal
   junction, and the posterior cingulate cortex, which show aberrant
   activity in schizophrenia patients, too. We aimed to replicate these
   results in an independent sample of 188 healthy German volunteers. In
   order to assess the reliability of brain activity elicited by the ToM
   task, 25 participants performed the task twice with an interval of 14
   days showing excellent accordance in recruitment of key ToM areas.
   Confirming our previous results, we observed decreasing activity of the
   left temporo-parietal junction, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and the
   posterior cingulate cortex with increasing number of risk alleles during
   ToM. Complementing our replication sample with the discovery sample,
   analyzed in a previous report (total N = 297), further revealed negative
   genotype effects in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex as well as in
   the temporal and parietal regions. In addition, as shown previously,
   rs1344706 risk allele dose positively predicted increased frontal
   temporo-parietal connectivity. These findings confirm the effects of the
   psychosis risk variant in ZNF804A on the dysfunction of the ToM network.}},

Abstract = {{This study tested the possible relationship between reported visual
   awareness ({''}I see a visual stimulus in front of me{''}) and the
   social attribution of awareness to someone else ({''}That person is
   aware of an object next to him{''}). Subjects were tested in two steps.
   First, in an fMRI experiment, subjects were asked to attribute states of
   awareness to a cartoon face. Activity associated with this task was
   found bilaterally within the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) among other
   areas. Second, the TPJ was transiently disrupted using single-pulse
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). When the TMS was targeted to
   the same cortical sites that had become active during the social
   attribution task, the subjects showed symptoms of visual neglect in that
   their detection of visual stimuli was significantly affected. In control
   trials, when TMS was targeted to nearby cortical sites that had not
   become active during the social attribution task, no significant effect
   on visual detection was found. These results suggest that there may be
   at least some partial overlap in brain mechanisms that participate in
   the social attribution of sensory awareness to other people and in
   attributing sensory awareness to oneself.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that human faces induce stronger involuntary
   orienting responses than other visual objects. Yet, the timing of this
   preferential orienting response at the neural level is still unknown.
   Here, we used an antisaccade paradigm to investigate the neural dynamics
   preceding the onset of reflexive and voluntary saccades elicited by
   human faces and nonface visual objects, normalized for their global
   low-level visual properties. High-density event-related potentials
   (ERPs) were recorded in observers as they performed interleaved pro- and
   antisaccades toward a lateralized target. For reflexive saccades, we
   report an ERP modulation specific to faces as early as 4060 ms following
   stimulus onset over parieto-occipital sites, further predicting the
   speed of saccade execution. This was not linked to differences in the
   programming of the saccadic eye movements, as it occurred early in time.
   For the first time, we present electrophysiological evidence of early
   target selection to faces in reflexive orienting responses over
   parieto-occipital cortex that facilitates the triggering of saccades
   toward faces. We argue for a 2-stage process in the representation of a
   face in involuntary spatial orienting with an initial, rapid implicit
   processing of the visual properties of a face, followed by subsequent
   stimulus categorization depicted by the N170 component.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{165-170}},

Abstract = {{Conspecifics are potential mates, and can be the most dangerous threats.
   With conspecifics we engage in complex social interactions. Therefore,
   it is important to rapidly detect the presence of conspecifics in a
   scene. Images of humans attract attention, and do so already in
   9-months-old infants, showing that the distinction between conspecifics
   and other animals emerges early in development However, despite a wealth
   of evidence on the behavioral differences between the processing of
   conspecifics and other animals, the neural mechanisms that underlie the
   recognition of conspecifics remain unknown. In this experiment, we used
   recursive feature elimination to individuate brain regions that show
   selective effects for the faces of conspecifics, individuating reliable
   conspecific effects in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   (v1PFC). Consistent with the importance of conspecifics recognition for
   reorienting attention and for social cognition, this region shows
   functional connectivity with the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ),
   implicated in reorienting attention and in the attribution of mental
   states to others. Our results suggest that the right vIPFC plays an
   important role for the recognition of conspecifics and may function as a
   gateway for the attribution of mental states to an object. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) present a set of cognitive,
   affective and motor symptoms that resemble those of patients with
   lesions to the cerebellum. Although there is some evidence for overall
   structural alterations in this brain region in WS, explorations on
   cerebellar white matter and cerebellar cortex volumes remain rather
   neglected. We aimed to compare absolute and relative cerebellar volumes,
   as well as patterns of white matter to cortex volumes in this brain
   region, between a group of individuals with WS and a group of healthy
   controls. T1 -weighted magnetic resonance images were acquired in 17
   individuals with WS and in 15 typically developing individuals. Our
   results showed that even though individuals from the clinical group had
   significantly smaller cerebrums (and cerebellums), cerebellar volumes
   relative to intracranial volumes were significantly enlarged. In
   addition, while gray matter was relatively spared and white matter
   disproportionately reduced in the cerebrum in WS, relative cerebellar
   cortex and white matter volumes were preserved. These findings support
   the hypothesis that volume alterations in the cerebellum are associated
   with the cognitive, affective and motor profiles in WS. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an effective treatment for
   depression, targets self-referential processing of emotional stimuli. We
   examined the effects of CBT on brain functioning during self-referential
   processing in depressive patients using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). Depressive patients (n = 23) and healthy participants (n
   = 15) underwent fMRI scans during a self-referential task using
   emotional trait words. The depressive patients had fMRI scans before and
   after completing a total of 12 weekly sessions of group CBT for
   depression, whereas the healthy participants underwent fMRI scans 12
   weeks apart with no intervention. Before undergoing CBT, the depressive
   patients showed hyperactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
   during self-referential processing of negative words. Following CBT,
   MPFC and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) activity during
   self-referential processing among depressive patients was increased for
   positive stimuli, whereas it was decreased for negative stimuli.
   Improvements in depressive symptoms were negatively correlated with vACC
   activity during self-referential processing of negative stimuli. These
   results suggest that CBT-related improvements in depressive symptoms are
   associated with changes in MPFC and vACC activation during

   have argued for decades, however, such inter- and transdisciplinary
   collaborations are potentially fraught with tensions between
   researchers. This essay build on such claims by arguing that the
   tensions of transdisciplinary research also exist within researchers'
   own experiences of working between disciplines - a phenomenon that we
   call ``disciplinary double consciousness{''} (DDC). Building on previous
   work that has characterized similar spaces (and especially on the
   Critical Neuroscience literature), we argue that
   ``neuro-collaborations{''} inevitably engage researchers in DDC - a
   phenomenon that allows us to explore the useful dissonance that
   researchers can experience when working between a ``home{''} discipline
   and a secondary discipline. Our case study is a five-year research
   project in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) lie detection
   involving a transdisciplinary research team made up of social
   scientists, a neuroscientist, and a humanist. In addition to theorizing
   neuro-collaborations from the inside-out, this essay presents practical
   suggestions for developing transdisciplinary infrastructures that could
   support future neuro-collaborations.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{1556}},

Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Pro-social lying, which serves to benefit listeners, is considered more
   socially and morally acceptable than anti-social lying, which serves to
   harm listeners. However, it is still unclear whether the neural
   mechanisms underlying the moral judgment of pro-social lying differ from
   those underlying the moral judgment of anti-social lying. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural
   activities associated with moral judgment in anti- and pro-social lying.
   During fMRI scanning, subjects were provided with scenarios describing a
   protagonist's anti- and pro-social lying and were then asked to judge
   whether the protagonist's act was morally appropriate. The behavioral
   data showed that anti-social lying was mostly judged to be morally
   inappropriate and that pro-social lying was mainly judged to be morally
   appropriate. The functional imaging data revealed dissociable neural
   systems for moral judgment in anti- and pro-social lying. The
   anti-social lying, which was judged to be morally inappropriate, was
   associated with increased activity in the right ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex, right middle frontal gyrus, right precuneus/posterior cingulate
   gyms, left posterior cingulate gyms, and bilateral temporoparietal
   junction when compared with the control condition. The pro-social lying,
   which was judged to be morally appropriate, was associated with
   increased activity in the right middle temporal gyms, right
   supramarginal gyms, and the left middle cingulate gyrus when compared
   with the control condition. No overlapping activity was observed during
   the moral judgment of anti- and pro-social lying. Our data suggest that
   cognitive and neural processes for the moral judgment of lying are
   modulated by whether the lie serves to harm or benefit listeners. (C)

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Although behavioral and neuropsychological studies have suggested two
   distinct routes of phonological access, their neural substrates have not
   been clearly elucidated. Here, we designed an artificial language (based
   on Korean Hangul) that can be read either through addressed (i.e., whole
   word mapping) or assembled (i.e., grapheme-to-phoneme mapping)
   phonology. Two matched groups of native English-speaking participants
   were trained in one of the two conditions, one hour per day for eight
   days. Behavioral results showed that both groups correctly named more
   than 90\% of the trained words after training. At the neural level, we
   found a clear dissociation of the neural pathways for addressed and
   assembled phonologies: There was greater involvement of the anterior
   cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, right orbital frontal
   cortex, angular gyrus and middle temporal gyrus for addressed phonology,
   but stronger activation in the left precentral gyrus/inferior frontal
   gyrus and supramarginal gyrus for assembled phonology. Furthermore, we
   found evidence supporting the strategy-shift hypothesis, which
   postulates that, with practice, reading strategy shifts from assembled
   to addressed phonology. Specifically, compared to untrained words,
   trained words in the assembled phonology group showed stronger
   activation in the addressed phonology network and less activation in the
   assembled phonology network. Our results provide clear brain-imaging
   evidence for the dual-route models of reading.}},

Abstract = {{A parietal-frontal network in primates is thought to support many
   behaviors occurring in the space around the body, including
   interpersonal interactions and maintenance of a particular ``comfort
   zone{''} or distance from other people ({''}personal space{''}). To
   better understand this network in humans, we used functionalMRIto
   measure the responses to moving objects (faces, cars, simple spheres)
   and the functional connectivity of two regions in this network, the
   dorsal intraparietal sulcus (DIPS) and the ventral premotor cortex
   (PMv). We found that both areas responded more strongly to faces that
   were moving toward (vs away from) subjects, but did not show this bias
   in response to comparable motion in control stimuli (cars or spheres).
   Moreover, these two regions were functionally interconnected. Tests of
   activity-behavior associations revealed that the strength of DIPS-PMv
   connectivity was correlated with the preferred distance that subjects
   chose to stand from an unfamiliar person (personal space size). In
   addition, the magnitude of DIPS and PMv responses was correlated with
   the preferred level of social activity. Together, these findings suggest
   that this parietal-frontal network plays a role in everyday interactions
   with others.}},

Abstract = {{Morality is a fundamental component of human cultures and has been
   defined as prescriptive norms regarding how people should treat one
   another, including concepts such as justice, fairness, and rights. Using
   fMRI, the current study examined the extent to which dispositions in
   justice sensitivity (i.e., how individuals react to experiences of
   injustice and unfairness) predict behavioral ratings of praise and blame
   and how they modulate the online neural response and functional
   connectivity when participants evaluate morally laden (good and bad)
   everyday actions. Justice sensitivity did not impact the
   neuro-hemodynamic response in the action-observation network but instead
   influenced higher-order computational nodes in the right temporoparietal
   junction (rTPJ), right dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   (rdlPFC, dmPFC) that process mental states understanding and maintain
   goal representations. Activity in these regions predicted praise and
   blame ratings. Further, the hemodynamic response in rTPJ showed a
   differentiation between good and bad actions 2 s before the response in
   rdlPFC. Evaluation of good actions was specifically associated with
   enhanced activity in dorsal striatum and increased the functional
   coupling between the rTPJ and the anterior cingulate cortex. Together,
   this study provides important knowledge in how individual differences in
   justice sensitivity impact neural computations that support
   psychological processes involved in moral judgment and mental-state
   reasoning.}},

Title = {{Neuroimaging correlates of handwriting quality as children learn to read

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Reading and writing are related but separable processes that are crucial
   skills to possess in modern society. The neurobiological basis of
   reading acquisition and development, which critically depends on
   phonological processing, and to a lesser degree, beginning writing as it
   relates to letter perception, are increasingly being understood. Yet
   direct relationships between writing and reading development, in
   particular, with phonological processing is not well understood. The
   main goal of the current preliminary study was to examine individual
   differences in neurofunctional and neuroanatomical patterns associated
   with handwriting in beginning writers/readers. In 46 56 year-old
   beginning readers/writers, ratings of handwriting quality, were
   rank-ordered from best to worst and correlated with brain activation
   patterns during a phonological task using functional MRI, and with
   regional gray matter volume from structural T1 MRI. Results showed that
   better handwriting was associated negatively with activation and
   positively with gray matter volume in an overlapping region of the pars
   triangularis of right inferior frontal gyrus. This region, in particular
   in the left hemisphere in adults and more bilaterally in young children,
   is known to be important for decoding, phonological processing, and
   subvocal rehearsal. We interpret the dissociation in the directionality
   of the association in functional activation and morphometric properties
   in the right inferior frontal gyrus in terms of neural efficiency, and
   suggest future studies that interrogate the relationship between the
   neural mechanisms underlying reading and writing development.}},

Abstract = {{There is widespread interest in identifying computational and
   neurobiological mechanisms that influence the ability to choose
   long-term benefits over more proximal and readily available rewards in
   domains such as dietary and economic choice. We present the results of a
   human fMRI study that examines how neural activity relates to observed
   individual differences in the discounting of future rewards during an
   intertemporal monetary choice task. We found that a region of left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dIPFC) BA-46 was more active in trials
   where subjects chose delayed rewards, after controlling for the
   subjective value of those rewards. We also found that the connectivity
   from dIPFC BA-46 to a region of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
   widely associated with the computation of stimulus values, increased at
   the time of choice, and especially during trials in which subjects chose
   delayed rewards. Finally, we found that estimates of effective
   connectivity between these two regions played a critical role in
   predicting out-of-sample, between-subject differences in discount rates.
   Together with previous findings in dietary choice, these results suggest
   that a common set of computational and neurobiological mechanisms
   facilitate choices in favor of long-term reward in both settings.}},

Title = {{The Role of Attention in a Joint-Action Effect}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{The most common explanation for joint-action effects has been the action
   co-representation account in which observation of another's action is
   represented within one's own action system. However, recent evidence has
   shown that the most prominent of these joint-action effects (i.e., the
   Social Simon effect), can occur when no co-actor is present. In the
   current work we examined whether another joint-action phenomenon (a
   movement congruency effect) can be induced when a participant performs
   their part of the task with a different effector to that of their
   co-actor and when a co-actor's action is replaced by an
   attention-capturing luminance signal. Contrary to what is predicted by
   the action co-representation account, results show that the basic
   movement congruency effect occurred in both situations. These findings
   challenge the action co-representation account of this particular effect
   and suggest instead that it is driven by bottom-up mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperation is a hallmark of human society. Humans often cooperate with
   strangers even if they will not meet each other again. This so-called
   indirect reciprocity enables large-scale cooperation among nonkin and
   can occur based on a reputation mechanism or as a succession of
   pay-it-forward behavior. Here, we provide the functional and anatomical
   neural evidence for two distinct mechanisms governing the two types of
   indirect reciprocity. Cooperation occurring as reputation-based
   reciprocity specifically recruited the precuneus, a region associated
   with self-centered cognition. During such cooperative behavior, the
   precuneus was functionally connected with the caudate, a region linking
   rewards to behavior. Furthermore, the precuneus of a cooperative subject
   had a strong resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) with the
   caudate and a large gray matter volume. In contrast, pay-it-forward
   reciprocity recruited the anterior insula (AI), a brain region
   associated with affective empathy. The AI was functionally connected
   with the caudate during cooperation occurring as pay-it-forward
   reciprocity, and its gray matter volume and rsFC with the caudate
   predicted the tendency of such cooperation. The revealed difference is
   consistent with the existing results of evolutionary game theory:
   although reputation-based indirect reciprocity robustly evolves as a
   self-interested behavior in theory, pay-it-forward indirect reciprocity
   does not on its own. The present study provides neural mechanisms
   underlying indirect reciprocity and suggests that pay-it-forward
   reciprocity may not occur as myopic profit maximization but elicit
   emotional rewards.}},

Title = {{Modulating Intrinsic Connectivity: Adjacent Subregions within

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Supplementary motor area (SMA), the inferior frontal junction (IFJ),
   superior frontal junction (SFJ) and parietal cortex are active in many
   cognitive tasks. In a previous study, we found that subregions of each
   of these major areas were differentially active in component processes
   of executive function during working memory tasks. In the present study,
   each of these subregions was used as a seed in a whole brain functional
   connectivity analysis of working memory and resting state data. These
   regions show functional connectivity to different networks, thus
   supporting the parcellation of these major regions into functional
   subregions. Many regions showing significant connectivity during the
   working memory residual data (with task events regressed from the data)
   were also significantly connected during rest suggesting that these
   network connections to subregions within major regions of cortex are
   intrinsic. For some of these connections, task demands modulate activity
   in these intrinsic networks. Approximately half of the connections
   significant during task were significant during rest, indicating that
   some of the connections are intrinsic while others are recruited only in
   the service of the task. Furthermore, the network connections to
   traditional `task positive' and `task negative' (a.k.a `default mode')
   regions shift from positive connectivity to negative connectivity
   depending on task demands. These findings demonstrate that such
   task-identified subregions are part of distinct networks, and that these
   networks have different patterns of connectivity for task as they do
   during rest, engaging connections both to task positive and task
   negative regions. These results have implications for understanding the
   parcellation of commonly active regions into more specific functional
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{When conducting auditory investigations using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), there are inherent potential confounds that
   need to be considered. Traditional continuous fMRI acquisition methods
   produce sounds >90 dB which compete with stimuli or produce neural
   activation masking evoked activity. Sparse scanning methods insert a
   period of reduced MRI-related noise, between image acquisitions, in
   which a stimulus can be presented without competition. In this study, we
   compared sparse and continuous scanning methods to identify the optimal
   approach to investigate acoustically evoked cortical, thalamic and
   midbrain activity in the cat. Using a 7T magnet, we presented broadband
   noise, 10 kHz tones, or 0.5 kHz tones in a block design, interleaved
   with blocks in which no stimulus was presented. Continuous scanning
   resulted in larger clusters of activation and more peak voxels within
   the auditory cortex. However, no significant activation was observed
   within the thalamus. Also, there was no significant difference found,
   between continuous or sparse scanning, in activations of midbrain
   structures. Higher magnitude activations were identified in auditory
   cortex compared to the midbrain using both continuous and sparse
   scanning. These results indicate that continuous scanning is the
   preferred method for investigations of auditory cortex in the cat using
   fMRI. Also, choice of method for future investigations of midbrain
   activity should be driven by other experimental factors, such as
   stimulus intensity and task performance during scanning. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Rumination is a form of thought characterized by repetitive focus on
   discomforting emotions or stimuli. In chronic pain disorders, rumination
   can impede treatment efficacy. The brain mechanisms underlying
   rumination about chronic pain are not understood. Interestingly, a link
   between rumination and functional connectivity (FC) of the brain's
   default mode network (DMN) has been identified within the context of
   mood disorders. We, and others, have also found DMN dysfunction in
   chronic pain populations. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a key
   node of the DMN that is anatomically connected with the descending pain
   modulatory system. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that in patients
   with chronic pain, the mPFC exhibits abnormal FC related to the
   patient's degree of rumination about their pain. Seventeen patients with
   idiopathic temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and 17 age-and sex-matched
   healthy controls underwent resting state functional MRI, and rumination
   about pain was assessed through the rumination subscale of the Pain
   Catastrophizing Scale. Compared with healthy controls, we found that TMD
   patients exhibited enhanced mPFC FC with other DMN regions, including
   the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus (PCu) and retrosplenial
   cortex. We also found that individual differences in pain rumination in
   the chronic pain patients (but not in healthy controls) were positively
   correlated to mPFC FC with the PCC/PCu, retrosplenial cortex, medial
   thalamus, and periaqueductal/periventricular gray. These data implicate
   communication within the DMN and of the DMN with the descending
   modulatory system as a mechanism underlying the degree to which patients
   ruminate about their chronic pain.}},

   (ASD) have generally focused on the perception of emotional words and
   facial affect. Brain imaging studies have suggested that the fusiform
   gyrus is associated with both the comprehension of language and face
   recognition. We hypothesized that patients with ASD would have decreased
   ability to recognize affect via emotional words and facial emoticons,
   relative to healthy comparison subjects. In addition, we expected that
   this decreased ability would be associated with altered activity of the
   fusiform gyrus in patients with ASD. Ten male adolescents with ASDs and
   ten age and sex matched healthy comparison subjects were enrolled in
   this case-control study. The diagnosis of autism was further evaluated
   with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Brain activity was
   assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in response
   to emotional words and facial emoticon presentation. Sixty emotional
   words (45 pleasant words +15 unpleasant words) were extracted from a
   report on Korean emotional terms and their underlying dimensions. Sixty
   emoticon faces (45 pleasant faces +15 unpleasant faces) were extracted
   and modified from on-line sites. Relative to healthy comparison
   subjects, patients with ASD have increased activation of fusiform gyrus
   in response to emotional aspects of words. In contrast, patients with
   ASD have decreased activation of fusiform gyrus in response to facial
   emoticons, relative to healthy comparison subjects. We suggest that
   patients with ASD are more familiar with word descriptions than facial
   expression as depictions of emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Aberrant emotional salience attribution has been reported to be an
   important clinical feature in patients with schizophrenia. Real life
   stimuli that incorporate both positive and negative emotional traits
   lead to affective asymmetry such as negativity bias and positivity
   offset. In this study, we investigated the neural correlates of
   emotional salience attribution in patients with schizophrenia when
   affective asymmetry was processed. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia
   and 14 healthy controls were scanned using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) while performing an emotion judgment task in which two
   pictures were juxtaposed. The task consisted of responding to affective
   asymmetry condition (ambivalent and neutral) and affective symmetry
   conditions (positive and negative), and group comparisons were performed
   for each condition. Significantly higher activity in the medial
   prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus was observed for the
   ambivalent condition than for the other conditions in controls, but not
   in patients. Compared with controls, patients showed decreased
   activities in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex, insula, and putamen for the ambivalent condition, but
   no changes were observed for the neutral condition. Multiple prefrontal
   hypoactivities during salience attribution of negativity bias in
   schizophrenia may underlie deficits in the integrative processing of
   emotional information. Regional abnormalities in the salience network
   may be the basis of defective emotional salience attribution in
   schizophrenia, which is likely involved in symptom formation and social
   dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Authenticity of vocal emotion expression affects emotion recognition and
   brain activity in the so-called Theory of Mind (ToM) network, which is
   implied in the ability to explain and predict behavior by attributing
   mental states to other individuals. Exploiting the variability of the
   fundamental frequency (F0 contour), which varies more (higher contour)
   in play-acted expressions than authentic ones, we examined whether
   contour biases explicit categorization toward a particular authenticity
   or emotion category. Moreover, we tested whether contour modulates
   blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response in the ToM network and
   explored the role of task as a top-down modulator. The effects of
   contour on BOLD signal were analyzed by contrasting high and low contour
   stimuli within two previous fMRI studies that implemented emotion and
   authenticity rating tasks. Participants preferentially categorized
   higher contour stimuli as play-acted and lower contour stimuli as sad.
   Higher contour was found to up-regulate activation task-independently in
   the primary auditory cortex. Stimulus contour and task were found to
   interact in a network including medial prefrontal cortex, with an
   increase in BOLD signal for low-contour stimuli during explicit
   perception of authenticity and an increase for high-contour stimuli
   during explicit perception of emotion. Contour-induced BOLD effects
   appear to be purely stimulus-driven in early auditory and intonation
   perception, while being strongly task-dependent in regions involved in
   higher cognition.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{An important question in social neuroscience is the similarities and
   differences in the neural representations between the self and close
   others. Most studies examining this topic have identified the medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC) region as the primary area involved in this
   process. However, several studies have reported conflicting data, making
   further investigation of this topic very important. In this functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the brain
   activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when Chinese
   participants passively listened to their self-name (SN), their mother's
   name (MN), and unknown names (UN). The results showed that compared with
   UN recognition, SN perception was associated with a robust activation in
   a widely distributed bilateral network, including the cortical midline
   structure (the MPFC and ACC), the inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle
   temporal gyrus. The SN invoked the bilateral superior temporal gyrus in
   contrast to the MN; the MN recognition provoked a stronger activation in
   the central and posterior brain regions in contrast to the SN
   recognition. The SN and MN caused an activation of overlapping areas,
   namely, the ACC, MPFC, and superior frontal gyrus. These results suggest
   that Chinese individuals utilize certain common brain region in
   processing both the SN and the MN. The present findings provide evidence
   for the neural basis of the self and close others for Chinese
   individuals.}},

Title = {{Brain Activity and Functional Coupling Changes Associated with
   Self-Reference Effect during Both Encoding and Retrieval}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Information that is processed with reference to oneself, i.e.
   Self-Referential Processing (SRP), is generally associated with better
   remembering compared to information processed in a condition not related
   to oneself. This positive effect of the self on subsequent memory
   performance is called as Self-Reference Effect (SRE). The neural basis
   of SRE is still poorly understood. The main goal of the present work was
   thus to highlight brain changes associated with SRE in terms of activity
   and functional coupling and during both encoding and retrieval so as to
   assess the relative contribution of both processes to SRE. For this
   purpose, we used an fMRI event-related self-referential paradigm in 30
   healthy young subjects and measured brain activity during both encoding
   and retrieval of self-relevant information compared to a semantic
   control condition. We found that SRE was associated with brain changes
   during the encoding phase only, including both greater activity in the
   medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and greater functional
   coupling between these brain regions and the posterior cingulate cortex.
   These findings highlight the contribution of brain regions involved in
   both SRP and episodic memory and the relevance of the communication
   between these regions during the encoding process as the neural
   substrates of SRE. This is consistent with the idea that SRE reflects a
   positive effect of the reactivation of self-related memories on the
   encoding of new information in episodic memory.}},

   The voltage-gated cation channel activity gene set, consisting of genes
   related to neuronal excitability, was robustly linked to performance in
   working memory-related tasks across ages and to schizophrenia.
   Functional brain imaging in 707 healthy participants linked this gene

   Personality Disorder Revealed by Resting-State Functional MRI}},

Abstract = {{Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD) is a personality disorder that is
   most commonly associated with the legal and criminal justice systems.
   The study of the brain in APD has important implications in legal
   contexts and in helping ensure social stability. However, the neural
   contribution to the high prevalence of APD is still unclear. In this
   study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of APD.
   Thirty-two healthy individuals and thirty-five patients with APD were
   recruited. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was
   analyzed for the whole brain of all subjects. Our results showed that
   APD patients had a significant reduction in the ALFF in the right
   orbitofrontal cortex, the left temporal pole, the right inferior
   temporal gyrus, and the left cerebellum posterior lobe compared to
   normal controls. We observed that the right orbitofrontal cortex had a
   negative correlation between ALFF values and MMPI psychopathic deviate
   scores. Alterations in ALFF in these specific brain regions suggest that
   APD patients may be associated with abnormal activities in the
   fronto-temporal network. We propose that our results may contribute in a
   clinical and forensic context to a better understanding of APD.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Child development is seriously affected by social interactions with
   caregivers, which may lead to forming social minds in our daily life
   afterward. However, the underlying neural mechanism for such
   interactions has not yet been revealed. This article introduces a
   magnetoencephalographic (MEG) hyperscanning system to examine
   brain-to-brain interactions between a mother and her child. We used two
   whole-head MEG systems placed in the same magnetically-shielded room.
   One is a 160-channel gradiometer system for an adult and the other is a
   151-channel gradiometer system for a child. We developed an audio-visual
   presentation system, which enabled a mother and her child to look at
   each other in real time. In each MEG system, a video camera was placed
   behind a half-mirror screen for visual presentation to obtain the
   subjects' facial expressions. The visual presentation system is capable
   of displaying not only real-time facial expression but also processed
   facial expression such as a still face or delayed facial expressions. A
   projector system displays the side-by-side face images of the mother and
   child, and the images are divided into each face using splitting mirrors
   and each face is displayed on the half-mirror screen in front of the
   other subject. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the first MEG
   hyperscanning system in a single shielded room, and may contribute to
   elucidating brain-to-brain interactions not only between a mother and
   her child but also in general inter-individual, brain-to-brain
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The current study examined how specific neurological systems contribute

   individuals with traumatic brain injuries to examine the contribution of
   the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)a region important for
   executive function and attentionto the expression of neuroticism and
   conscientiousness factors and facets. Results from Voxel-Based
   Lesion-Symptom Mapping analyses revealed that focal damage to the left
   DLPFC (Brodmann's area 9) was associated with high neuroticism and low
   conscientious factor and facet scores (anxiety and self-discipline,
   respectively). Compared with lesioned and normal controls, veterans with
   damage in left DLPFC also reported higher neuroticism and lower
   conscientiousness facet scores, slower reaction times on the California
   Computerized Assessment Package assessment, and lower scores on the
   Delis-Kaplan executive function battery. Findings suggest that while
   neuroticism and conscientiousness remain psychometrically independent
   personality dimensions, their component facets may rely on a common

Abstract = {{Guilt, shame, and embarrassment are quintessential moral emotions with
   important regulatory functions for the individual and society. Moral
   emotions are, however, difficult to study with neuroimaging methods
   because their elicitation is more intricate than that of basic emotions.
   Here, using functional MRI (fMRI), we employed a novel social prejudice
   paradigm to examine specific brain regions associated with real-time
   moral emotion, focusing on guilt and related moral-negative emotions.
   The paradigm induced intense moral-negative emotion (primarily guilt) in
   22 low-prejudice individuals through preprogrammed feedback indicating
   implicit prejudice against Black and disabled people. fMRI data
   indicated that this experience of moral-negative emotion was associated
   with increased activity in anterior paralimbic structures, including the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula, in addition to
   areas associated with mentalizing, including the dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus. Of significance was
   prominent conflict-related activity in the supragenual ACC, which is
   consistent with theories proposing an association between acute guilt
   and behavioral inhibition. Finally, a significant negative association
   between self-reported guilt and neural activity in the pregenual ACC
   suggested a role of self-regulatory processes in response to
   moral-negative affect. These findings are consistent with the
   multifaceted self-regulatory functions of moral-negative emotions in
   social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{During the approximately 18-32 thousand years of domestication {[}1],

   lineages split approximately 90-100 million years ago {[}4]. In this
   first comparative neuroimaging study of a nonprimate and a primate
   species, we made use of this special combination of shared environment
   and evolutionary distance. We presented dogs and humans with the same
   set of vocal and nonvocal stimuli to search for functionally analogous
   voice-sensitive cortical regions. We demonstrate that voice areas exist
   in dogs and that they show a similar pattern to anterior temporal voice
   areas in humans. Our findings also reveal that sensitivity to vocal
   emotional valence cues engages similarly located nonprimary auditory
   regions in dogs and humans. Although parallel evolution cannot be
   excluded, our findings suggest that voice areas may have a more ancient
   evolutionary origin than previously known.}},

Abstract = {{When explaining the reasons for others' behavior, perceivers often
   overemphasize underlying dispositions and personality traits over the
   power of the situation, a tendency known as the fundamental attribution
   error. One possibility is that this bias results from the spontaneous
   processing of others' mental states, such as their momentary feelings or
   more enduring personality characteristics. Here, we use fMRI to test
   this hypothesis. Participants read a series of stories that described a
   target's ambiguous behavior in response to a specific social situation
   and later judged whether that act was attributable to the target's
   internal dispositions or to external situational factors. Neural regions
   consistently associated with mental state inference-especially, the
   medial pFC-strongly predicted whether participants later made
   dispositional attributions. These results suggest that the spontaneous
   engagement of mentalizing may underlie the biased tendency to attribute
   behavior to dispositional over situational forces.}},

Abstract = {{Visual speech influences the perception of heard speech. A classic
   example of this is the McGurk effect, whereby an auditory /pa/ overlaid
   onto a visual /ka/ induces the fusion percept of /ta/. Recent behavioral
   and neuroimaging research has highlighted the importance of both
   articulatory representations and motor speech regions of the brain,
   particularly Broca's area, in audiovisual (AV) speech integration.
   Alternatively, AV speech integration may be accomplished by the sensory
   system through multisensory integration in the posterior STS. We
   assessed the claims regarding the involvement of the motor system in AV
   integration in two experiments: (i) examining the effect of articulatory
   suppression on the McGurk effect and (ii) determining if motor speech
   regions show an AV integration profile. The hypothesis regarding
   experiment (i) is that if the motor system plays a role in McGurk
   fusion, distracting the motor system through articulatory suppression
   should result in a reduction of McGurk fusion. The results of experiment
   (i) showed that articulatory suppression results in no such reduction,
   suggesting that the motor system is not responsible for the McGurk
   effect. The hypothesis of experiment (ii) was that if the brain
   activation to AV speech in motor regions (such as Broca's area) reflects
   AV integration, the profile of activity should reflect AV integration:
   AV > AO (auditory only) and AV > VO (visual only). The results of
   experiment (ii) demonstrate that motor speech regions do not show this
   integration profile, whereas the posterior STS does. Instead, activity
   in motor regions is task dependent. The combined results suggest that AV
   speech integration does not rely on the motor system.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies of conceptual knowledge in the brain focus on a narrow
   range of concrete conceptual categories, rely on the researchers'
   intuitions about which object belongs to these categories, and assume a
   broadly taxonomic organization of knowledge. In this fMRI study, we
   focus on concepts with a variety of concreteness levels; we use a state
   of the art lexical resource (WordNet 3.1) as the source for a relatively
   large number of category distinctions and compare a taxonomic style of
   organization with a domain-based model (an example domain is Law).
   Participants mentally simulated situations associated with concepts when
   cued by text stimuli. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we find
   evidence that all Taxonomic categories and Domains can be distinguished
   from fMRI data and also observe a clear concreteness effect: Tools and
   Locations can be reliably predicted for unseen participants, but less
   concrete categories (e. g., Attributes, Communications, Events, Social
   Roles) can only be reliably discriminated within participants. A second
   concreteness effect relates to the interaction of Domain and Taxonomic
   category membership: Domain (e. g., relation to Law vs. Music) can be
   better predicted for less concrete categories. We repeated the analysis
   within anatomical regions, observing discrimination between all/most
   categories in the left mid occipital and left mid temporal gyri, and
   more specialized discrimination for concrete categories Tool and
   Location in the left precentral and fusiform gyri, respectively. Highly
   concrete/abstract Taxonomic categories and Domain were segregated in
   frontal regions. We conclude that both Taxonomic and Domain class
   distinctions are relevant for interpreting neural structuring of
   concrete and abstract concepts.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated associations between delusions in
   psychotic disorders and abnormalities of brain areas involved in social
   cognition, including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior
   cingulate cortex, and lateral temporal cortex (LTC). General population
   studies have linked subclinical delusional thinking to impaired social
   cognition, raising the question of whether a specific pattern of brain
   activity during social perception is associated with delusional beliefs.
   Here, we tested the hypothesis that subclinical delusional thinking is
   associated with changes in neural function, while subjects made
   judgments about themselves or others {[}'social reflection' (SR)].
   Neural responses during SR and non-social tasks, as well as
   resting-state activity, were measured using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging in 22 healthy subjects. Delusional thinking was
   measured using the Peters et al. Delusions Inventory. Delusional
   thinking was negatively correlated with responses of the left LTC during
   SR (r = -0.61, P = 0.02, Bonferroni corrected), and connectivity between
   the left LTC and left ventral MPFC, and was positively correlated with
   connectivity between the left LTC and the right middle frontal and
   inferior temporal cortices. Thus, delusional thinking in the general
   population may be associated with reduced activity and aberrant
   functional connectivity of cortical areas involved in SR.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{283-291}},

Abstract = {{Research on intertemporal behavior has emphasized trait-like variance.
   However, recent studies have begun to explore situational factors that
   affect intertemporal preference. In this study, we examined the
   associations between emotional primes and both behavior and brain
   function during intertemporal decision making. Twenty-two participants
   completed a dual task in which they were required to make intertemporal
   choices while holding an expressive face in memory. From trial-to-trial,
   the facial expression varied between three alternatives: (i) fearful,
   (ii) happy and (iii) neutral. Brain activity was recorded using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging for 16 participants. Behavioral
   data indicated that fearful (relative to happy) faces were associated
   with greater preference for larger but later rewards. During observation
   of fearful faces, greater signal change was observed in the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. During subsequent decision making, the
   fear prime was associated with greater signal increase in structures
   including the posterior sector of the anterior cingulate cortex.
   Individual differences in this activity correlated with the magnitude of
   the priming effect on behavior. These findings suggest that incidental
   emotions affect intertemporal choice. Increased farsightedness after the
   fear prime may be explained by an `inhibition spillover' effect.}},

Abstract = {{Group membership is an important aspect of our everyday behavior.
   Recently, we showed that existing relevant in-group labels increased
   activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) compared with
   out-group labels, suggesting a role of the MPFC in social
   categorization. However, the question still remains whether this
   increase in MPFC activation for in-group representation is solely
   related with previous experience with the in-group. To test this, we
   randomly assigned participants to a red or blue team and in a subsequent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment they categorized red
   and blue team words as belonging to either the in-group or the
   out-group. Results showed that even under these minimal conditions
   increased activation was found in the MPFC when participants indicated
   that they belonged to a group, as compared with when they did not. This
   effect was found to be associated with the level of group
   identification. These results confirm the role of MPFC in social
   categorization.}},

Abstract = {{Research has illustrated that the brain regions implicated in moral
   cognition comprise a robust and broadly distributed network. However,
   understanding how these brain regions interact and give rise to the
   complex interplay of cognitive processes underpinning human moral
   cognition is still in its infancy. We used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to examine patterns of activation for `difficult' and `easy'
   moral decisions relative to matched non-moral comparators. This revealed
   an activation pattern consistent with a relative functional double
   dissociation between the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and
   ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Difficult moral decisions
   activated bilateral TPJ and deactivated the vmPFC and OFC. In contrast,
   easy moral decisions revealed patterns of activation in the vmPFC and
   deactivation in bilateral TPJ and dorsolateral PFC. Together these
   results suggest that moral cognition is a dynamic process implemented by
   a distributed network that involves interacting, yet functionally

Abstract = {{Mental effort is a limited resource which must be invested to perform
   mental tasks. The amount of mental effort investment that an individual
   experiences during task performance can be measured afterwards with the
   help of self-rating scales. Earlier research suggests that integration
   of information about somatic state changes is crucial for the
   self-evaluation of mental effort investment. Damage to the pathways
   which convey information about somatic state changes can lead to an
   inability to self-evaluate mental effort investment, while conceptually
   similar evaluations of task difficulty can still be performed. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activation,
   while subjects rated their mental effort investment and the difficulty
   of a previously performed task. Our results show stronger activation of
   the left anterior insular cortex (aIC) during evaluation of mental
   effort. Additionally, the activity in left aIC during task performance
   was modulated by changes in task demand in a similar way as the
   self-ratings of mental effort. We argue that aIC does not only play a
   role in the integration of self-related information during
   self-evaluation of mental effort investment, but that left aIC might
   also be involved in the experience of mental effort during task
   performance.}},

   more accurate in the categorization of fearful expressions relative to
   males. In Experiment 2, 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging data
   were acquired for a separate sample of 21 healthy females and 17 healthy
   males while performing the FEPT. Activation to neutral facial
   expressions was subtracted from activation to sad, angry, fearful and
   happy facial expressions. Although females and males demonstrated
   activation in some overlapping regions for all emotions, many regions
   were exclusive to females or males. For anger, sad and happy, males
   displayed a larger extent of activation than did females, and greater
   height of activation was detected in diffuse cortical and subcortical
   regions. For fear, males displayed greater activation than females only
   in right postcentral gyri. With one exception in females, performance
   was not associated with activation. Results suggest that females and

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are
   both characterized by social dysfunction, but no study to date has
   compared neural responses to social rewards in ASDs and SAD. Neural
   responses during social and non-social reward anticipation and outcomes
   were examined in individuals with ASD (n = 16), SAD (n = 15) and a
   control group (n = 19) via functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Analyses modeling all three groups revealed increased nucleus accumbens
   (NAc) activation in SAD relative to ASD during monetary reward
   anticipation, whereas both the SAD and ASD group demonstrated decreased
   bilateral NAc activation relative to the control group during social
   reward anticipation. During reward outcomes, the SAD group did not
   differ significantly from the other two groups in ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex activation to either reward type. Analyses comparing
   only the ASD and SAD groups revealed greater bilateral amygdala
   activation to social rewards in SAD relative to ASD during both
   anticipation and outcome phases, and the magnitude of left amygdala
   hyperactivation in the SAD group during social reward anticipation was
   significantly correlated with the severity of trait anxiety symptoms.
   Results suggest reward network dysfunction to both monetary and social
   rewards in SAD and ASD during reward anticipation and outcomes, but that
   NAc hypoactivation during monetary reward anticipation differentiates
   ASD from SAD.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAnxious youth have shown altered behavioral performance on the
   dot-probe task, but neural activation patterns provoked by the task
   remain poorly understood. In particular, neural mechanisms of threat
   disengagement, a clinically relevant construct, have been inadequately
   explored.
   MethodDuring fMRI acquisition, 121 youth (ages 9-13; 90 with Generalized
   Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, and/or Social Phobia; 31
   nonanxious controls) completed a dot-probe task, which required
   participants to identify the location of a dot replacing either a
   neutral or fearful face in a pair containing both faces. We assessed
   neural substrates of threat disengagement by comparing congruent trials
   (in which the dot replaces the fearful face) to incongruent trials (in
   which the dot replaces the neutral face).
   ResultsAcross subjects, decreased rostrodorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (rdACC) activity was observed specifically during incongruent trials.
   Nonanxious youth showed a convergent pattern in bilateral
   parahippocampal and hippocampal regions, whereas anxious youth showed an
   opposing pattern in these limbic areas, suggesting less integration of
   response across cortical and limbic areas relevant to threat appraisal.
   Reduced functional connectivity between rdACC and left
   parahippocampus/hippocampus was associated with greater anxiety.
   ConclusionsIn the largest dot-probe fMRI sample to date, both anxious
   and nonanxious youth showed a neural pattern consistent with successful
   disengagement of threat reactivity in the rdACC. However, anxious youth
   showed evidence of abnormal disengagement in bilateral
   parahippocampal/hippocampal clusters when attention was directed away
   from threat. Early interventions targeting neural mechanisms of threat
   disengagement may be beneficial, for example, by increasing integration
   across rdACC and limbic regions.}},

Title = {{Trusting Humans and Avatars: A Brain Imaging Study Based on Evolution

Abstract = {{Avatars, as virtual humans possessing realistic faces, are increasingly
   used for social and economic interaction on the Internet. Research has
   already determined that avatar-based communication may increase
   perceived interpersonal trust in anonymous online environments. Despite
   this trust-inducing potential of avatars, however, we hypothesize that
   in trust situations, people will perceive human faces differently than
   they will perceive avatar faces. This prediction is based on evolution
   theory, because throughout human history the majority of interaction
   among people has taken place in face-to-face settings. Therefore, unlike
   perception of an avatar face, perception of a human face and the related
   trustworthiness discrimination abilities must be part of the genetic
   makeup of humans. Against this background, we conducted a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging experiment based on a multiround trust game
   to gain insight into the differences and similarities of interactions
   between humans versus human interaction with avatars. Our results
   indicate that (1) people are better able to predict the trustworthiness
   of humans than the trustworthiness of avatars; (2) decision making about
   whether or not to trust another actor activates the medial frontal
   cortex significantly more during interaction with humans, if compared to
   interaction with avatars; this brain area is of paramount importance for
   the prediction of other individuals' thoughts and intentions
   (mentalizing), a notably important ability in trust situations; and (3)
   the trustworthiness learning rate is similar, whether interacting with
   humans or avatars. Thus, the major implication of this study is that
   although interaction on the Internet may have benefits, the lack of real
   human faces in communication may serve to reduce these benefits, in turn
   leading to reduced levels of collaboration effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Social dysfunction is a hallmark characteristic of
   schizophrenia. Part of it may stem from an inability to efficiently
   encode social information into memory and retrieve it later. This study
   focused on whether patients with schizophrenia show a memory boost for
   socially relevant information and engage the same neural network as
   controls when processing social stimuli that were previously encoded
   into memory. Methods: Patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls
   performed a social and nonsocial picture recognition memory task while
   being scanned. We calculated memory performance using d'. Our main
   analysis focused on brain activity associated with recognition memory of
   social and nonsocial pictures. Results: Our study included 28 patients
   with schizophrenia and 26 controls. Healthy controls demonstrated a
   memory boost for socially relevant information. In contrast, patients
   with schizophrenia failed to show enhanced recognition sensitivity for
   social pictures. At the neural level, patients did not engage the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) as much as controls while
   recognizing social pictures. Limitations: Our study did not include
   direct measures of self-referential processing. All but 3 patients were
   taking antipsychotic medications, which may have altered both the
   behavioural performance during the picture recognition memory task and
   brain activity. Conclusion: Impaired social memory in patients with
   schizophrenia may be associated with altered DMPFC activity. A reduction
   of DMPFC activity may reflect less involvement of self-referential
   processes during memory retrieval. Our functional MRI results contribute
   to a better mapping of the neural disturbances associated with social
   memory impairment in patients with schizophrenia and may facilitate the
   development of innovative treatments, such as transcranial magnetic
   stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{Social exclusion results in lowered satisfaction of basic needs and

   participants' immediate behavioral response during exclusion from an

   exchanged looks with two virtual partners in an exchange where the
   player who had just been looked at chose whom to look at next. While
   some participants received as many looks as the virtual players
   (included), others were ignored after two initial looks (excluded).
   Excluded participants reported lower basic need satisfaction, lower
   evaluation of the interaction, and devaluated their interaction partners
   more than included participants, demonstrating that people are sensitive
   to epistemic ostracism. In line with William's need-threat model,
   eye-tracking results revealed that excluded participants did not
   withdraw from the unfavorable interaction, but increased the number of
   looks to the player who could potentially reintegrate them.}},

Abstract = {{Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a common psychiatric disorder
   whose core feature is interpersonal difficulties relying on a fear of
   rejection and abandonment and the perception of social pain.
   Consequently, self-injurious behaviours such as superficial cutting
   occur in 70-80\% of BPD patients, associated with the improvement of
   emotional state. The majority of BPD patients report no pain associated
   with SIB whereas BPD patients are overrepresented in chronic pain
   patients. Thus, studying pain perception in such patients may help to
   understand the physiopathology of BPD but also the interaction between
   affective and physical dimensions of pain. Self-injurious behaviours may
   be an inadequate strategy to regulate social/psychological pain. At a
   neurobiological level, there is evidence for opioid dysregulation:
   stimulation of dysfunctional opioid receptors by self-injurious
   behaviours and overutilization of opioid analgesics. Promising
   therapeutic strategies should target neuroanatomical and neurobiological
   dysfunctions, which lead to abnormal pain identification in BPD
   patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral evidence suggests that young and older adults show a benefit
   in source memory accuracy when processing materials in reference to the
   self. In the young, activity within the medial prefrontal cortex
   supports this source memory benefit at study. In this investigation, we
   examined whether the same neural regions support this memory benefit in
   both age groups. Using fMRI, we scanned participants while they studied
   and retrieved pictures of objects paired with one of three scenes
   (source) under self-reference and other-reference conditions. At the
   time of study, half of the items were presented once and half twice,
   allowing us to match behavioral performance between the groups. Both
   groups showed equivalent source accuracy benefits for objects encoded
   self-referentially. Activity in the left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex
   supported subsequent source memory in both age groups for the
   self-referenced relative to the other-referenced items. At the time of
   test, source accuracy for both the self- and other-referenced items was
   supported by a network of regions including the precuneus in both age
   groups. At both study and test, little in the way of age differences
   emerged, suggesting that when they are matched on behavioral
   performance, young and older adults engage similar regions in support of
   source memory when processing materials in reference to the self;
   however, when we did not match performance, age differences in
   functional recruitment were prevalent. These results suggest that by
   capitalizing on preserved processes (self-referential encoding), older
   adults can show improvement in memory for source details that they would
   typically not remember well, relative to the young.}},

Abstract = {{The neural basis of individual differences in positive and negative
   social decisions and behaviors in healthy populations is yet
   undetermined. Recent work has focused on the potential role of the
   anterior insula in guiding social and nonsocial decision making, but the
   specific nature of its activation during such decision making remains
   unclear. To identify the neural regions mediating individual differences
   in helpful and harmful decisions and to assess the nature of insula
   activation during such decisions, in the present study we used a novel
   fMRI task featuring intentional and unintentional decisions to
   financially harm or help persons in need. Based on a whole-brain,
   unbiased approach, our findings indicate that individual differences in
   dorsal anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and right
   temporo-parietal junction activation are associated with behavioral
   tendencies to financially harm or help another. Furthermore, activity in
   the dorsal anterior insula and ACC was greatest during unintended
   outcomes, whether these were gains or losses for a charity or for
   oneself, supporting models of the role of these regions in salience
   prediction error signaling. Together, the results suggest that
   individual differences in risk anticipation, as reflected in the dorsal
   anterior insula and dorsal ACC, guide social decisions to refrain from
   harming others.}},

   Capgras delusion}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{75-85}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Perception of familiar faces depends on a core system analysing visual
   appearance and an extended system dealing with inference of mental
   states and emotional responses. Damage to the core system impairs face
   perception as seen in prosopagnosia. In contrast, patients with Capgras
   delusion show intact face perception but believe that closely related
   persons are impostors. It has been suggested that two deficits are
   necessary for the delusion, an aberrant perceptual or affective
   experience that leads to a bizarre belief as well as an impaired ability
   to evaluate beliefs. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   compared neural activity to familiar and unfamiliar faces in a patient
   with Capgras delusion and an age matched control group. We provide
   evidence that Capgras delusion is related to dysfunctional activity in
   the extended face processing system. The patient, who developed the
   delusion for the partner after a large right prefrontal lesion sparing
   the ventromedial and medial orbitofrontal cortex, lacked neural activity
   to the partner's face in left posterior cingulate cortex and left
   posterior superior temporal sulcus. Further, we found impaired
   functional connectivity of the latter region with the left superior
   frontal gyrus and to a lesser extent with the right superior frontal
   sulcus/middle frontal gyrus. The findings of this case study suggest
   that the first factor in Capgras delusion may be reduced neural activity
   in the extended face processing system that deals with inference of
   mental states while the second factor may be due to a lesion in the
   right middle frontal gyrus. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroscientists have long sought to study the dynamic activity of the
   human brain-what's happening in the brain, that is, while people are
   thinking, feeling, and acting. Ideally, an inside look at brain function
   would simultaneously and continuously measure the biochemical state of
   every cell in the central nervous system. While such a miraculous method
   is science fiction, a century of progress in neuroimaging technologies
   has made such simultaneous and continuous measurement a plausible
   fiction. Despite this progress, practitioners of modern neuroimaging
   struggle with two kinds of limitations: those that attend the particular
   neuroimaging methods we have today and those that would limit any method
   of imaging neural activity, no matter how powerful.
   In this essay, I consider the liabilities and potential of techniques
   that measure human brain activity. I am concerned here only with methods
   that measure relevant physiologic states of the central nervous system
   and relate those measures to particular mental states. I will consider
   in particular the preeminent method of functional neuroimaging: BOLD
   fMRI. While there are several practical limits on the biological
   information that current technologies can measure, these limits-as
   important as they are-are minor in comparison to the fundamental logical
   restraints on the conclusions that can be drawn from brain imaging
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Since the mid-1980s, psychologists and neuroscientists have used brain
   imaging to test hypotheses about human thought processes and their
   neural instantiation. In just three decades, functional neuroimaging has
   been transformed from a crude clinical tool to a widely used research
   method for understanding the human brain and mind. Such rapidly achieved
   success is bound to evoke skepticism. A degree of skepticism toward new
   methods and ideas is both inevitable and useful in any field. It is
   especially valuable in a science as young as cognitive neuroscience and
   its even younger siblings, social and affective neuroscience. Healthy
   skepticism encourages us to check our assumptions, recognize the
   limitations of our methods, and proceed thoughtfully. Skepticism itself,
   however, also must be examined.
   In this article, I review the most commonly voiced criticisms of
   functional neuroimaging. In the spirit of healthy skepticism, I will
   critically examine these criticisms themselves. Each contains at least a
   kernel of truth, although I will argue that in some cases the kernel has
   been overextended in ways that are inaccurate or misleading.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},

Pages = {{89-97}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It has been firmly established that opening and closing the eyes
   strongly modulate the electro- and magnetoencephalography (EEG and MEG)
   signals acquired during wakeful rest. Certain features of the resting
   EEG are altered in chronic alcoholics and their offspring, and have been
   proposed as biomarkers for alcoholism. Spontaneous brain oscillations
   are also affected by pharmacological manipulations, but the spectral and
   spatial characteristics of these changes are not clear. This study
   examined effects of the eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting
   paradigm and alcohol challenge on the spatial profile of spontaneous MEG
   and EEG oscillations. Whole-head MEG and scalp EEG signals were acquired
   simultaneously from healthy social drinkers (n = 17) who participated in
   both alcohol (0.6 g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg for women) and placebo
   conditions in a counterbalanced design. Power of the signal was
   calculated with Fast Fourier Transform and was decomposed into its
   constituent theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (8 12 Hz), and beta (15-20 Hz)
   frequency bands. High-resolution structural MRI images were additionally
   obtained from all participants and used to constrain distributed minimum
   norm inverse source power estimates. The spatial estimates of the main
   generator nodes were in agreement with studies using a combined fMRI-EEG
   approach. Alpha band oscillations dominated the spectral profile and
   their source was estimated to the medial parieto-occipital area. Power
   in theta and beta bands was weaker overall and their sources were
   estimated to a more focal medial prefrontal area. EO and EC manipulation
   most strongly modulated power in the alpha band, but a wide-band power
   increase was observed during the EC condition. Alcohol intoxication
   increased alpha power, particularly during the EC condition. Application
   of this methodology to cohorts of chronic alcoholics or individuals at
   risk could potentially provide insight into the neural basis of
   oscillatory differences that may be predictive of the vulnerability to
   alcoholism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the significance of human touch, brain responses to
   interpersonal manual touch have been rarely investigated. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to study brain activity in eight
   healthy adults whose left hand was touched by two individuals, in
   separate runs and in 20-s blocks, either by holding, smoothing, or
   poking. Acceleration was measured from both the subject's and the
   touching person's hands for postimaging control of the stimuli.
   Independent component analysis of the functional magnetic resonance
   imaging data unraveled three functional networks involving the primary
   somatosensory cortex (SI). One network comprised the contralateral and
   another the ipsilateral Brodmann area 3. The third network included area
   2 bilaterally, left-hemisphere middle temporal gyrus and dorsolateral
   prefrontal regions, ventral prefrontal cortices bilaterally, and middle
   cingulate cortex. The response shapes and polarities varied between the
   three networks. The contralateral area 3 differentiated the responses
   between the three types of touch stimuli, and the response magnitudes
   depended on the variability of the touch within each block. However, the
   responses of the other two networks were strikingly similar to all
   stimuli. The subjects' reports on the pleasantness of the touch did not
   correlate with the characteristics of the SI responses. These findings
   imply area-specific processing of the natural human touch in three
   networks including the SI cortex, with only area 2 connected to a
   functional network of brain areas that may support social interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Request and emblematic gestures, despite being both communicative

   functional magnetic resonance imaging, while participants watched videos
   of an actor, either blindfolded or not, performing emblems, request
   gestures, or meaningless control movements. A left-lateralized network
   was more activated by both types of communicative gestures than by
   meaningless movements, regardless of the accessibility of the actor's
   eyes. Strikingly, when eye contact was taken into account as a factor, a
   right-lateralized network was more strongly activated by emblematic
   gestures performed by the non-blindfolded actor than by those performed
   by the blindfolded actor. Such modulation possibly reflects the
   integration of information conveyed by the eyes with the representation
   of emblems. Conversely, a wider right-lateralized network was more
   strongly activated by request gestures performed by the blindfolded than
   by those performed by the non-blindfolded actor. This probably reflects
   the effect of the conflict between the observed action and its
   associated contextual information, in which relevant social cues are
   missing.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Morality is made of rules and values that guide human
   behavior. They barely change among different cultures. Social
   accomplishments are the result of moral development, due to a taint of
   fairness which pervades any human activity. The moral functions are the
   consequence of evolution and have their own specific neural circuits.
   Aim. To describe their appearance, starting and underlying mechanisms in
   the normal brain.
   Development. Moral responses are basically homogeneous. They are linked
   to the emotional development, as much basic and individual (fear, wrath)
   as social (compassion, justice). Their emergence is the result of the
   emotional dichotomies pleasure/pain and reward/punishment, which lead to
   the basic moral dichotomy good/bad. For their working it is required the
   running of the prefrontal cortex (ventromedian and dorsolateral), the
   anterior cingular cortex and the superior temporal sulcus, that asses
   and elaborate and utilitarian moral response; and also the insula, the
   amygdale and the hypothalamus, that perform a quicker and emotionally
   rooted response. In addition, the mirror neuronal system
   (fronto-parietal) enables motor learning and empathy, linking this
   factor to the theory of mind.
   Conclusions. Moral sense and its responses underlay the complex social
   development that humans have reached and enjoyed. Thus opens ways for
   improving benefits in human groups and individuals alike. In addition,
   the knowledge of the normal function of the moral circuits is permeating
   and influencing the many areas of neuroculture.}},

Abstract = {{The processing of human and nonhuman concepts (e. g., agreeable vs.
   edible) during basic comprehension and reasoning tasks has become a
   major topic of scientific inquiry. To ensure that the experimental
   effects obtained from such studies reflect the hypothesised semantic
   distinction, potential confounds such as psycholinguistic and/or lexical
   properties of the exact stimuli chosen need to be addressed. In the
   current study, normative data of such properties were obtained for a
   series of 875 French adjectives by asking 8 groups of 20 participants to
   each rate all words on one dimension of theoretical interest. The
   collected ratings indicate the extent to which each adjective evokes a
   sensory experience (concreteness), captures an enduring attribute
   (temporal stability), refers to a visible characteristic (visibility),
   denotes a neutral or an affectively laden concept (valence), signifies
   an attribute of low or high intensity, is familiar to the reader and can
   be used to describe people and/or inanimate entities such as objects. In
   addition, for each item its exact grammatical class (adjective vs. past
   participle adjective), length (i.e., number of letters, number of
   syllables), and word frequency was retrieved from the lexique3 corpus.
   The resulting database enables researchers to consider pivotal
   psycholinguistic and lexical properties when selecting human and
   nonhuman stimuli for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) may negatively affect the ability to
   recognize emotions. This study aimed to determine the cortical
   correlates of facial emotion processing (happy, sad, fearful, and
   neutral) in patients with well-characterized left TLE (LTLE) and to
   examine the effect of seizure control on emotion processing. We enrolled
   34 consecutive patients with LTLE and 30 matched healthy control (HC)
   subjects. Participants underwent functional MRI (fMRI) with an
   event-related facial emotion recognition task. The seizures of seventeen
   patients were controlled (no seizure in at least 3 months; LTLE-sz), and
   17 continued to experience frequent seizures (LTLE+sz). Mood was
   assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Profile of
   Mood States (POMS). There were no differences in demographic
   characteristics and measures of mood between HC subjects and patients
   with LTLE. In patients with LTLE, fMRI showed decreased blood
   oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in the
   hippocampus/parahippocampus and cerebellum in processing of happy faces
   and increased BOLD signal in occipital regions in response to fearful
   faces. Comparison of groups with LTLE+sz and LTLE-sz showed worse BDI
   and POMS scores in LTLE+sz (all p < 0.05) except for POMS
   tension/anxiety (p = 0.067). Functional MRI revealed increased BOLD
   signal in patients with LTLE+sz in the left precuneus and left
   parahippocampus for ``fearful{''} faces and in the left periarcheocortex
   for ``neutral{''} faces. There was a correlation between the fMRI and
   Total Mood Disturbance in the left precuneus in LTLE-sz (p = 0.019) and
   in LTLE+sz (p = 0.018). Overall, LTLE appears to have a relatively minor
   effect on the cortical underpinnings of facial emotion processing, while
   the effect of seizure state (controlled vs. not controlled) is more
   pronounced, indicating a significant relationship between seizure
   control and emotion processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Declarative memory-the ability to learn, store, and retrieve
   information-has been consistently reported to be altered in
   schizophrenia, and hippocampal-parahippocampal dysfunction has been
   implicated in this deficit. To elucidate the possible role of genetic
   risk factors in such findings, it is necessary to study healthy
   relatives of patients with schizophrenia who carry risk-associated genes
   but not the confounding factors related to the disorder.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate whether altered brain responses, particularly
   in the hippocampus and parahippocampus, during the encoding phase of a
   simple declarative memory task are also observed in unaffected siblings
   who are at increased genetic risk for schizophrenia.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Functional magnetic resonance imaging
   was used with a simple visual declarative memory paradigm to test for
   differences in neural activation across normal control participants,
   patients with schizophrenia, and their healthy siblings. This study was
   conducted at a research center and included a total of 308 participants
   (181 normal control participants, 65 healthy siblings, and 62 patients
   with schizophrenia); all participants were white of European ancestry.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All participants completed a declarative
   memory task involving incidental encoding of neutral visual scenes
   interleaved with crosshair fixation while undergoing functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. Differences in hippocampus and parahippocampus
   activation and coupling across groups and correlations with accuracy
   were analyzed. Analyses were repeated in pairwise-matched samples.
   RESULTS Both patients with schizophrenia and their healthy siblings
   showed reduced parahippocampal activation (bilaterally) and
   hippocampal-parietal (BA 40) coupling during the encoding of novel
   stimuli when compared with normal control participants. There was a
   significant positive correlation between parahippocampal activation
   during encoding and the visual-memory score.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that altered
   hippocampal-parahippocampal function during encoding is an intermediate
   biologic phenotype related to increased genetic risk for schizophrenia.
   Therefore, measuring hippocampal-parahippocampal function with
   neuroimaging represents a potentially useful approach to understanding
   genetic mechanisms that confer risk for schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with
   neurocognitive deficits. However, the neural substrates underlying such
   deficits remain unknown.
   Methods: To examine executive control and emotional processing in OSA,
   10 children age 7 to 11 y with polysomnographically diagnosed OSA and 7
   age-and sex-matched controls underwent a color-word Stroop task and an
   empathy task consisting of dynamic visual scenarios depicting
   interpersonal harm or neutral actions in a magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) scanner. Functional MRI data were processed using MATLAB 7.12 with
   SPM8 for region of interest (ROI) analyses, and a general linear model
   was used with regressors for each trial type in each task.
   Results: For the Stroop task, accuracy was similar in the two groups,
   with no differences in the effect of incongruency on success rates. OSA
   showed greater neural activity than controls in eight ROI clusters for
   incongruent versus congruent trials (P < 0.001). Within the a priori
   ROIs, the anterior cingulate cortex was significantly different between
   groups (P < 0.05). For perceiving harm versus neutral actions, ROI
   analysis revealed a significant correlation between apnea-hypopnea index
   and left amygdala activity in harm versus neutral actions (r = -0.71, P
   < 0.05).
   Conclusions: These results provide the first functional MRI evidence
   that cognitive and empathetic processing is influenced by obstructive
   sleep apnea (OSA) in children. Children with OSA show greater neural
   recruitment of regions implicated in cognitive control, conflict
   monitoring, and attentional allocation in order to perform at the same
   level as children without OSA. When viewing empathy-eliciting scenarios,
   the severity of OSA predicted less sensitivity to harm in the left
   amygdala.}},

Abstract = {{Cocaine addiction is characterized by persistent decision-making
   deficits, which are linked to structural and functional abnormalities in
   frontolimbic systems. Moral judgment is as a special instance of
   decision making, in which both cognitive and emotional signals must be
   adequately integrated to decide how to resolve moral dilemmas. Here, we
   employed a moral dilemmas functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   task to explore possible alterations of frontolimbic systems in
   cocaine-dependent subjects. We also explored if these alterations relate
   to more basic deficits in functional connectivity within these systems
   during spontaneous resting-state activation. Ten cocaine-dependent
   subjects and 14 non-drug-using controls participated in the study.
   Cocaine-dependent subjects were carefully selected to discard
   potentially confounding co-morbidities, and they underwent a uniform
   supervised abstinence period of 10 days. Both groups were scanned, and
   fMRI maps were generated to identify (1) brain response to moral
   dilemmas; and (2) the strength of functional connectivity within
   frontolimbic systems during resting-state. During the moral dilemmas
   task, cocaine-dependent subjects showed reduced activation involving
   frontolimbic structures as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), left
   insula and brain stem. Connectivity analyses showed that cocaine users
   had less resting-state functional connectivity between ACC, thalamus,
   insula and brain stem. These results demonstrate that cocaine-dependent
   subjects have functional alterations in the frontolimbic systems that

Abstract = {{Aims: The aim of the study was to evaluate rat models of intermittent
   alcohol abuse (heavy session/'heavy session' drinking) in relation to
   inflammatory changes in specific brain regions as well as in the
   periphery. Furthermore, the study was aimed to assess whether there are
   inflammatory changes in the blood of human intermittent alcohol abusers
   who might be associated with changes in neuronal circuitry in the brain,
   as assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which cause
   adverse effects on memory and learning. Methods: Various regimes of
   intermittent alcohol administration have been used in rat models, which
   vary with respect to the dose and duration of ethanol administration as
   well as the time of abstinence. Immunohistological methods were used to
   identify activated microglia in specific brain regions. The response of
   isolated alveolar macrophages to in vitro stimuli was assessed by the
   assay of nitric oxide and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF
   alpha. Blood samples were collected from university students who had
   been heavy session drinkers for 2 years to assess whether there was an
   inflammatory cytokine profile that correlated with cognitive test scores
   as well as fMRI findings. Results: The extent of microglia activation
   appears to depend on the doses and duration of ethanol administration.
   In addition, there is activation of phagocytic cells in the periphery,
   e.g. alveolar macrophages, in the rat models of heavy session drinking.
   Changes in the plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines
   were present in heavy session drinking students, although no changes
   were identified in specific cognitive tests (which may be because of
   compensatory changes in the prefrontal cortex, as identified by fMRI).
   Conclusion: Changes in the cytokine levels induced by intermittent
   ethanol abuse may provoke inflammatory pathways in specific brain
   regions, such as hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (particularly during
   the stage of active neurogenesis in the adolescent brain), which might
   induce cognitive impairment in susceptible individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   uncovers correlated activity between spatially distinct functionally
   related brain regions and offers clues about the integrity of functional
   brain circuits in people with chronic subjective tinnitus. We chose to
   investigate auditory network connectivity, adopting and extending
   previously used analyses methods to provide an independent evaluation of
   replicability. Design: Independent components analysis (ICA) was used to
   identify coherent patterns arising from spontaneous brain signals within
   the resting-state data. The auditory network component was extracted and
   evaluated. Bivariate and partial correlation analyses were performed on
   pre-defined regions of bilateral auditory cortex to assess functional
   connectivity. Study sample: Our design carefully matched participant
   groups for possible confounds, such as hearing status. Twelve patients
   (seven male, five female; mean age 66 years) all with chronic constant
   tinnitus and eleven controls (eight male, three female; mean age 68
   years) took part. Results: No significant differences were found in
   auditory network connectivity between groups after correcting for
   multiple statistical comparisons in the analysis. This contradicts
   previous findings reporting reduced auditory network connectivity;
   albeit at a less stringent statistical threshold. Conclusions: Auditory
   network connectivity does not appear to be reliably altered by the
   experience of chronic subjective tinnitus.}},

Title = {{Neural processes during encoding support durable memory}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The ability to form durable memory is critical for human survival and
   development, but its underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms have not
   been well understood. In particular, existing studies have not clearly
   dissociated the neural processes supporting short- and long-duration
   memories. The present study addressed this issue with functional MRI and
   a modified subsequent memory paradigm. Participants were asked to make
   semantic judgment on a list of 320 words in the scanner. Half of the
   words were tested after a short delay (i.e., 1 day, TI) and again after
   a long delay (i.e., 1 week, T12), whereas the other half were tested
   only once after the long delay (T2). Materials forgotten during T1 were
   categorized as forgotten trials, and those remembered during T2 were
   categorized as long-duration trials. In contrast, trials remembered
   during T1 but not during T12 were categorized as short-duration trials.
   We found that compared to forgotten trials, short-duration trials showed
   decreased activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and
   precuneus, which is consistent with many previous observations.
   Importantly, long-duration trials showed stronger activity in the left
   inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) but less deactivation in the FCC relative
   to short-duration trials. Psychophysiological interactions (PPI)
   analysis revealed stronger functional connectivity between LIFG and PCC
   for long-duration trials than for forgotten trials. Our results suggest
   that strong PCC activity, in combination with strong LIFG activity,
   supports long-lasting memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Wernicke's aphasia occurs after a stroke to classical language
   comprehension regions in the left temporoparietal cortex. Consequently,
   auditory-verbal comprehension is significantly impaired in Wernicke's
   aphasia but the capacity to comprehend visually presented materials
   (written words and pictures) is partially spared. This study used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neural basis of
   written word and picture semantic processing in Wernicke's aphasia, with
   the wider aim of examining how the semantic system is altered after
   damage to the classical comprehension regions. Twelve participants with
   chronic Wernicke's aphasia and 12 control participants performed
   semantic animate-inanimate judgements and a visual height judgement
   baseline task. Whole brain and region of interest analysis in Wernicke's
   aphasia and control participants found that semantic judgements were
   underpinned by activation in the ventral and anterior temporal lobes
   bilaterally. The Wernicke's aphasia group displayed an `over-activation'
   in comparison with control participants, indicating that anterior
   temporal lobe regions become increasingly influential following
   reduction in posterior semantic resources. Semantic processing of
   written words in Wernicke's aphasia was additionally supported by
   recruitment of the right anterior superior temporal lobe, a region
   previously associated with recovery from auditory-verbal comprehension
   impairments. Overall, the results provide support for models in which
   the anterior temporal lobes are crucial for multimodal semantic
   processing and that these regions may be accessed without support from
   classic posterior comprehension regions.}},

Abstract = {{Gender differences in creativity have been widely studied in behavioral
   investigations, but this topic has rarely been the focus of
   neuroscientific research. The current paper presents follow-up analyses
   of a previous fMRI study (Abraham et al., Neuropsychologia
   50(8):1906-1917, 2012b), in which behavioral and brain function during
   creative conceptual expansion as well as general divergent thinking were
   explored. Here, we focus on gender differences within the same sample.
   Conceptual expansion was assessed with the alternate uses task relative
   to the object location task, whereas divergent thinking was assessed in
   terms of responses across both the alternate uses and object location
   tasks relative to n-back working memory tasks. While men and women were
   indistinguishable in terms of behavioral performance across all tasks,
   the pattern of brain activity while engaged in the tasks in question was
   indicative of strategy differences between the genders. Brain areas
   related to semantic cognition, rule learning and decision making were
   preferentially engaged in men during conceptual expansion, whereas women
   displayed higher activity in regions related to speech processing and
   social perception. During divergent thinking, declarative memory related
   regions were strongly activated in men, while regions involved in theory
   of mind and self-referential processing were more engaged in women. The
   implications of gender differences in adopted strategies or cognitive
   style when faced with generative tasks are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene are the
   genetic cause of fragile X syndrome (FXS). The presence of significant
   socioemotional problems has been well documented in FXS although the
   brain basis of those deficits remains unspecified. Here, we investigated
   amygdala dysfunction and its relation to socioemotional deficits and
   FMR1 gene expression in children and adolescents on the FX spectrum
   (i.e., individuals whose trinucleotide CGG repeat expansion from 55 to
   over 200 places them somewhere within the fragile X diagnostic range
   from premutation to full mutation). Participants performed an fMRI task
   in which they viewed fearful, happy, and scrambled faces. Neuroimaging
   results demonstrated that FX participants revealed significantly
   attenuated amygdala activation in Fearful Scrambled and Fearful Happy
   contrasts compared with their neurotypical counterparts, while showing
   no differences in amygdala volume. Furthermore, we found significant
   relationships between FMR1 gene expression, anxiety/social dysfunction
   scores, and reduced amygdala activation in the FX group. In conclusion,
   we report novel evidence regarding a dosage response of the FMR1 gene on
   fear-specific functions of the amygdala, which is associated with
   socioemotional deficits in FXS.}},

Abstract = {{Rhythm is a central characteristic of music and speech, the most
   important domains of human communication using acoustic signals. Here,
   we investigated how rhythmical patterns in music are processed in the
   human brain, and, in addition, evaluated the impact of musical training
   on rhythm processing. Using fMRI, we found that deviations from a
   rule-based regular rhythmic structure activated the left planum
   temporale together with Brocas area and its right-hemispheric homolog
   across subjects, that is, a network also crucially involved in the
   processing of harmonic structure in music and the syntactic analysis of
   language. Comparing the BOLD responses to rhythmic variations between
   professional jazz drummers and musical laypersons, we found that only
   highly trained rhythmic experts show additional activity in
   left-hemispheric supramarginal gyrus, a higher-order region involved in
   processing of linguistic syntax. This suggests an additional functional
   recruitment of brain areas usually dedicated to complex linguistic
   syntax processing for the analysis of rhythmical patterns only in
   professional jazz drummers, who are especially trained to use rhythmical
   cues for communication.}},

Pages = {{19-30}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The goal of the present research is to investigate the temporal dynamics
   of brain regions involved in processing emotional words in a sentence
   context. Both behavioral and ERP data were acquired while participants
   judged the affective meaning of a series of affirmation and negation
   statements. The behavioral results showed that participants were slower
   to respond to sentences that end with low pleasure words than those that
   end with high pleasure words. Furthermore, reaction time differences
   between high and low pleasure words were reduced when presented in
   negation context. Analysis of the ERPs locked to final-word presentation
   revealed that an early effect, N50 (15-85 ms), is sensitive to the
   valence of the final-word. A later N400 (290-470 ms) effect at
   centromedial sites differ for high and low pleasure words when they were
   presented within a negation context. The N400 differences for high and
   low pleasure words were also present in an affirmative context but
   occurred over centroparietal sites. Overall, the results suggested that
   sentence comprehension involves a stage of initial valence information
   extraction, followed by contextual integration, and that different brain
   regions are involved at each comprehension stage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1000-1008}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Deficits in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system have been reported
   in postmortem studies of schizophrenia, and therapeutic interventions in
   schizophrenia often involve potentiation of GABA receptors (GABAR) to
   augment antipsychotic therapy and treat negative affect such as anxiety.
   To map GABAergic mechanisms associated with processing affect, we used a
   benzodiazepine challenge while subjects viewed salient visual stimuli.
   Fourteen stable, medicated schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients and 13
   healthy comparison subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging using the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) technique
   while they viewed salient emotional images. Subjects received
   intravenous lorazepam (LRZ; 0.01 mg/kg) or saline in a single-blinded,
   cross-over design (two sessions separated by 1-3 weeks). A predicted
   group by drug interaction was noted in the dorsal medial prefrontal
   cortex (dmPFC) as well as right superior frontal gyrus and left and
   right occipital regions, such that psychosis patients showed an
   increased BOLD signal to LRZ challenge, rather than the decreased signal
   exhibited by the comparison group. A main effect of reduced BOLD signal
   in bilateral occipital areas was noted across groups. Consistent with
   the role of the dmPFC in processing emotion, state negative affect
   positively correlated with the response to the LRZ challenge in the
   dmPFC for the patients and comparison subjects. The altered response to
   LRZ challenge is consistent with altered inhibition predicted by
   postmortem findings of altered GABAR in schizophrenia. These results
   also suggest that negative affect in schizophrenia/schizoaffective
   disorder is associated-directly or indirectly-with GABAergic function on
   a continuum with normal behavior.}},

Title = {{Touching moments: desire modulates the neural anticipation of active
   romantic caress}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{A romantic caress is a basic expression of affiliative behavior and a
   primary reinforcer. Given its inherent affective valence, its
   performance also would imply the prediction of reward values. For
   example, touching a person for whom one has strong passionate feelings
   likely is motivated by a strong desire for physical contact and
   associated with the anticipation of hedonic experiences. The present
   study aims at investigating how the anticipatory neural processes of
   active romantic caress are modulated by the intensity of the desire for
   affective contact as reflected by passionate feelings for the other.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning was performed in
   romantically involved partners using a paradigm that allowed to isolate
   the specific anticipatory representations of active romantic caress,
   compared with control caress, while testing for the relationship between
   neural activity and measures of feelings of passionate love for the
   other. The results demonstrated that right posterior insula activity in
   anticipation of romantic caress significantly co-varied with the
   intensity of desire for union with the other. This effect was
   independent of the sensory-affective properties of the performed touch,
   like its pleasantness. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis
   showed that the same posterior insula cluster interacted with brain
   regions related to sensory-motor functions as well as to the processing
   and anticipation of reward. The findings provide insight on the neural
   substrate mediating between the desire for ana the performance of
   romantic caress. In particular, we propose that anticipatory activity
   patterns in posterior insula may modulate subsequent sensory-affective
   processing of skin-to-skin contact.}},

   connectivity in autism spectrum disorders: a theory of mixed over- and
   under-connectivity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging technologies and research has shown that autism is largely
   a disorder of neuronal connectivity. While advanced work is being done
   with fMRI, MRI-DTI, SPECT and other forms of structural and functional
   connectivity analyses, the use of EEG for these purposes is of
   additional great utility. Cantor et al. (1986) were the first to examine
   the utility of pairwise coherence measures for depicting connectivity
   impairments in autism. Since that time research has shown a combination
   of mixed over and under-connectivity that is at the heart of the primary
   symptoms of this multifaceted disorder. Nevertheless, there is reason to
   believe that these simplistic pairwise measurements under represent the
   true and quite complicated picture of connectivity anomalies in these
   persons. We have presented three different forms of multivariate
   connectivity analysis with increasing levels of sophistication
   (including one based on principle components analysis, sLORETA source
   coherence, and Granger causality) to present a hypothesis that more
   advanced statistical approaches to EEG coherence analysis may provide
   more detailed and accurate information than pairwise measurements. A
   single case study is examined with findings from MR-DTI, pairwise and
   coherence and these three forms of multivariate coherence analysis. In
   this case pairwise coherences did not resemble structural connectivity,
   whereas multivariate measures did. The possible advantages and
   disadvantages of different techniques are discussed. Future work in this
   area will be important to determine the validity and utility of these
   techniques.}},

Month = {{FEB 25}},
Abstract = {{The dynorphin/kappa-opioid receptor (KOP-R) system has been shown to
   play a role in different types of behavior regulation, including
   reward-related behavior and drug craving. It has been shown that alleles
   with 3 or 4 repeats (HH genotype) of the variable nucleotide tandem
   repeat (68-bp VNTR) functional polymorphism of the prodynorphin (PDYN)
   gene are associated with higher levels of dynorphin peptides than
   alleles with 1 or 2 repeats (LL genotype). We used fMRI on N = 71
   prescreened healthy participants to investigate the effect of this
   polymorphism on cerebral activation in the limbic-corticostriatal loop
   during reward anticipation. Individuals with the HH genotype showed
   higher activation than those with the LL genotype in the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) when anticipating a possible monetary
   reward. In addition, the HH genotype showed stronger functional coupling
   (as assessed by effective connectivity analyses) of mOFC with VMPFC,
   subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and ventral striatum during reward
   anticipation. This hints at a larger sensitivity for upcoming rewards in
   individuals with the HH genotype, resulting in a higher motivation to
   attain these rewards. These findings provide first evidence in humans
   that the PDYN polymorphism modulates neural processes associated with
   the anticipation of rewards, which ultimately may help to explain
   differences between genotypes with respect to addiction and drug abuse.}},

Title = {{The effect of age on neural processing of pleasant soft touch stimuli}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Tactile interactions with our environment stimulate afferent fibers
   within the skin, which deliver information about sensations of pain,
   texture, itch and other feelings to the brain as a comprehensive sense
   of self. These tactile interactions can stimulate brain regions involved
   in interoception and reward processing. This study examined subjective,
   behavioral, and neural processing as a function of age during
   stimulation of A-beta (A beta and C tactile (CT) afferents using a soft
   brush stroke task. 16 adolescents (ages 15-17), 22 young adults (ages
   20-28), and 20 mature adults (ages 29-55) underwent a simple continuous
   performance task while periodically anticipating and experiencing a soft
   touch to the palm or forearm, during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). fMRI results showed that adolescents displayed greater
   bilateral posterior insula activation than young and mature adults
   across all conditions and stimulus types. Adolescents also demonstrated
   greater bilateral posterior insula activation than young and mature
   adults specifically in response to the soft touch condition. Adolescents
   also exhibited greater activation than mature adults in bilateral
   inferior frontal gyrus and striatum during the soft touch condition.
   However, mature adults showed greater striatum activation than
   adolescents and young adults during anticipation. In the left anterior
   cingulate cortex, mature adults exhibited greater activation than
   adolescents and young adults when anticipating the upcoming touch. These
   results support the hypothesis that adolescents show an exaggerated
   neural response to pleasant stimulation of afferents, which may have
   profound effects on how they approach or avoid social and risky
   situations. In particular, heightened interoceptive reactivity to
   pleasant stimuli might cause adolescents to seek experiences that are
   associated with pleasant stimulation.}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Speech is unique among highly skilled human behaviors in its ease of
   acquisition by virtually all individuals who have normal hearing and
   cognitive ability. Vocal imitation is essential for acquiring speech,
   and it is an important element of social communication. The extent to
   which age-related changes in cognitive and motor function affect the
   ability to imitate speech is poorly understood. We analyzed the
   distributions of response times (RT) for repeating real words and
   pseudowords during fMRI. The average RT for older and younger
   participants was not different In contrast detailed analysis of RT
   distributions revealed age-dependent differences that were associated
   with changes in the time course of the BOLD response and specific
   patterns of regional activation. RT-dependent activity was observed in
   the bilateral posterior cingulate, supplementary motor area, and corpus
   callosum. This approach provides unique insight into the mechanisms
   associated with changes in speech production with aging. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Cognitive regulation of emotions is a fundamental prerequisite for
   intact social functioning which impacts on both well being and
   psychopathology. The neural underpinnings of this process have been
   studied intensively in recent years, without, however, a general
   consensus. We here quantitatively summarize the published literature on
   cognitive emotion regulation using activation likelihood estimation in
   fMRI and PET (23 studies/479 subjects). In addition, we assessed the
   particular functional contribution of identified regions and their
   interactions using quantitative functional inference and meta-analytic
   connectivity modeling, respectively. In doing so, we developed a model
   for the core brain network involved in emotion regulation of emotional
   reactivity. According to this, the superior temporal gyrus, angular
   gyrus and (pre) supplementary motor area should be involved in execution
   of regulation initiated by frontal areas. The dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex may be related to regulation of cognitive processes such as
   attention, while the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex may not necessarily
   reflect the regulatory process per se, but signals salience and
   therefore the need to regulate. We also identified a cluster in the
   anterior middle cingulate cortex as a region, which is anatomically and
   functionally in an ideal position to influence behavior and subcortical
   structures related to affect generation. Hence this area may play a
   central, integrative role in emotion regulation. By focusing on regions
   commonly active across multiple studies, this proposed model should
   provide important a priori information for the assessment of
   dysregulated emotion regulation in psychiatric disorders. (C) 2013

Title = {{Adolescents' risky decision-making activates neural networks related to
   social cognition and cognitive control processes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{This study examines by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging
   the neural mechanisms underlying adolescents' risk decision-making in
   social contexts. We hypothesize that the social context could engage
   brain regions associated with social cognition processes and
   developmental changes are also expected. Sixty participants
   (adolescents: 17-18, and young adults: 21-22 year sold) read narratives
   describing typical situations of decision making in the presence of
   peers. They were asked to make choices in risky situations (e. g.,
   taking or refusing a drug) or ambiguous situations(e. g., eating a
   hamburger or a hotdog). Risky as compared to ambiguous scenarios
   activated bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ), bilateral middle
   temporal gyrus (MTG), right medial prefrontal cortex, and the precuneus
   bilaterally; i.e., brain regions related to social cognition processes,
   such as self reflection and theory of mind (ToM). In addition, brain
   structures related to cognitive control were active {[}right anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC), bilateral orbitofrontal cortex], whereas no significant
   clusters were obtained in the reward system (ventral striatum). Choosing
   the dangerous option involved a further activation of control areas
   (ACC) and emotional and social cognition areas (temporal pole).
   Adolescents employed more neural resources than young adults in the
   right DLPFC and the right TPJ in risk situations. When choosing the
   dangerous option, young adults showed a further engagement in ToM
   related regions (bilateral MTG) and in motor control regions related to
   the planning of actions (pre-supplementary motor area). Finally, the
   right insula and the right superior temporal gyrus were more activated
   in women than in men, suggesting more emotional involvement and more
   intensive modeling of the others' perspective in the risky conditions.
   These findings call for more comprehensive developmental accounts of
   decision making in social contexts that incorporate the role of
   emotional and social cognition processes.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the neurostructural foundations of the
   human personality in young adults. High-resolution structural
   T1-weighted MR images of 71 healthy young individuals were processed
   using voxel-based morphometric (VBM) approach. Multiple regression
   analyses were performed to identify the associations between personality
   traits and gray matter volume (GMV). The Eysenck Personality
   Questionnaire-Revised, Short Scale for Chinese was chosen to assess the
   personality traits. This scale includes four dimensions, namely,
   extraversion, neuroticism, psychoticism, and lie. Particularly, we
   studied on two dimensions (extraversion and neuroticism) of Eysenck's
   personality. Our results showed that extraversion was negatively
   correlated with GMV of the bilateral amygdala, the bilateral
   parahippocampal gyrus, the right middle temporal gyrus, and the left
   superior frontal gyrus, all of which are involved in emotional and
   social cognitive processes. These results might suggest an association
   between extraversion and affective processing. In addition, a positive
   correlation was detected between neuroticism and GMV of the right
   cerebellum, a key brain region for negative affect coordination.
   Meanwhile, a negative association was revealed between GMV of the left
   superior frontal gyrus and neuroticism. These results may prove that
   neuroticism is related to several brain regions involved in regulating
   negative emotions. Based on those findings, we concluded that brain
   regions involved in social cognition and affective process accounted for
   modulation and shaping of personality traits among young individuals.
   Results of this study may serve as a basis for elucidating the
   anatomical factors of personality.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{Anticipatory and consummatory dissociation of hedonic experience may
   manifest as anhedonia in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear if this
   temporal dissociation of pleasure experience is also relevant in other
   symptoms like social anhedonia in the schizophrenia disorder spectrum.
   The present study applied two incentive delay tasks involving different
   incentive types (money vs. social affective images) to a sample of 28
   participants with elevated social anhedonia (SocAnh) and 38 healthy
   controls from a population of 476 college students. The results showed
   that the SocAnh group had comparable anticipatory sensitivity and
   consummatory pleasure towards monetary incentives as the controls; but
   they exhibited significant decrease in both anticipatory sensitivity and
   consummatory experience to positive social affective images. These
   findings demonstrate the presence of a domain-specific deficit in people
   with social anhedonia towards social affective information, and suggest
   that incentive types could confound the findings on the dissociation of
   anticipatory vs. consummatory hedonic capacities.}},

Title = {{Age differences in medial prefrontal activity for subsequent memory of
   truth value}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{Much research has demonstrated that aging is marked by decreased source
   memory relative to young adults, yet a smaller body of work has
   demonstrated that increasing the socioemotional content of source
   information may be one way to reduce age-related performance
   differences. Although dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) activity may
   support source memory among young and older adults, the extent to which
   one activates dorsal vs. ventral mPFC may reflect one's personal
   connection with incoming information. Because truth value may be one
   salient marker that impacts one's connection with information and
   allocation of attention toward incoming material, we investigated
   whether the perceived truth value of information differently impacts
   differences in mPFC activity associated with encoding source
   information, particularly with age. Twelve young (18-23 years) and 12
   older adults (63-80 years) encoded true and false statements. Behavioral
   results showed similar memory performance between the age groups. With
   respect to neural activity associated with subsequent memory, young
   adults, relative to older adults, exhibited greater activity in dmPFC
   while older adults displayed enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC) and insula engagement relative to young. These results may
   potentially indicate that young adults focus on a general knowledge
   acquisition goal, while older adults focus on emotionally relevant
   aspects of the material. The findings demonstrate that age-related
   differences in recruitment of mPFC associated with encoding source
   information may in some circumstances underlie age-equivalent behavioral
   performance.}},

Title = {{Visual cortex in aging and Alzheimer's disease: changes in visual field
   maps and population receptive fields}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{Although several studies have suggested that cortical alterations
   underlie such age-related visual deficits as decreased acuity, little is
   known about what changes actually occur in visual cortex during healthy
   aging. Two recent studies showed changes in primary visual cortex (V1)
   during normal aging; however, no studies have characterized the effects
   of aging on visual cortex beyond V1, important measurements both for
   understanding the aging process and for comparison to changes in
   age-related diseases. Similarly, there is almost no information about
   changes in visual cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common
   form of dementia. Because visual deficits are often reported as one of
   the first symptoms of AD, measurements of such changes in the visual
   cortex of AD patients might improve our understanding of how the visual
   system is affected by neurodegeneration as well as aid early detection,
   accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of AD. Here we use fMRI to first
   compare the visual field map (VFM) organization and population receptive
   fields (pRFs) between young adults and healthy aging subjects for
   occipital VFMs V1, V2, V3, and hV4. Healthy aging subjects do not show
   major VFM organizational deficits, but do have reduced surface area and
   increased pRF sizes in the foveal representations of V1, V2, and hV4
   relative to healthy young control subjects. These measurements are
   consistent with behavioral deficits seen in healthy aging. We then
   demonstrate the feasibility and first characterization of these
   measurements in two patients with mild AD, which reveal potential
   changes in visual cortex as part of the pathophysiology of AD. Our data
   aid in our understanding of the changes in the visual processing
   pathways in normal aging and provide the foundation for future research
   into earlier and more definitive detection of AD.}},

   fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Interpersonal conflicts are a common element of many social
   relationships. One possible process in rebuilding social relationships
   is the act of apologizing. Behavioral studies have shown that apologies
   promote forgiveness. However, the neural bases of receiving an apology
   and forgiveness are still unknown. Hence, the aim of the present fMRI
   study was to investigate brain processes involved in receiving an
   apology and active forgiveness of an ambiguous offense. We asked one
   group of participants ( player A) to make decisions, which were either
   positive or negative for another group of participants ( player B). The
   intention of player A was ambiguous to player B. In case of a negative
   impact, participants in the role of player A could send an apology
   message to participants in the role of player B. Subsequently players B
   were asked whether they wanted to forgive player A for making a decision
   with negative consequences. We found that receiving an apology yielded
   activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left middle temporal
   gyrus, and left angular gyrus. In line with previous research we found
   that forgiving judgments activated the right angular gyrus.}},

Title = {{Relationships between Reward Sensitivity, Risk-Taking and Family History
   of Alcoholism during an Interactive Competitive fMRI Task}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with a positive family history for alcoholism
   (FHP) have shown differences from family-history-negative (FHN)
   individuals in the neural correlates of reward processing. FHP, compared
   to FHN individuals, demonstrate relatively diminished ventral striatal
   activation during anticipation of monetary rewards, and the degree of
   ventral striatal activation shows an inverse correlation with specific
   impulsivity measures in alcohol-dependent individuals. Rewards in
   socially interactive contexts relate importantly to addictive
   propensities, yet have not been examined with respect to how their
   neural underpinnings relate to impulsivity-related measures. Here we
   describe impulsivity measures in FHN and FHP individuals as they relate
   to a socially interactive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   task.
   Methods: Forty FHP and 29 FHN subjects without histories of Axis-I
   disorders completed a socially interactive Domino task during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and completed self-report and behavioral
   impulsivity-related assessments.
   Results: FHP compared to FHN individuals showed higher scores (p = .004)
   on one impulsivity-related factor relating to both compulsivity (Padua
   Inventory) and reward/punishment sensitivity (Sensitivity to
   Punishment/Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire). Multiple regression
   analysis within a reward-related network revealed a correlation between
   risk-taking (involving another impulsivity-related factor, the Balloon
   Analog Risk Task (BART)) and right ventral striatum activation under
   reward >punishment contrast (p < 0.05 FWE corrected) in the social task.
   Conclusions: Behavioral risk-taking scores may be more closely
   associated with neural correlates of reward responsiveness in socially
   interactive contexts than are FH status or impulsivity-related
   self-report measures. These findings suggest that risk-taking
   assessments be examined further in socially interactive settings
   relevant to addictive behaviors.}},

Title = {{Contextual and Perceptual Brain Processes Underlying Moral Cognition: A
   Quantitative Meta-Analysis of Moral Reasoning and Moral Emotions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Human morality has been investigated using a
   variety of tasks ranging from judgments of hypothetical dilemmas to
   viewing morally salient stimuli. These experiments have provided insight
   into neural correlates of moral judgments and emotions, yet these
   approaches reveal important differences in moral cognition. Moral
   reasoning tasks require active deliberation while moral emotion tasks
   involve the perception of stimuli with moral implications. We examined
   convergent and divergent brain activity associated with these
   experimental paradigms taking a quantitative meta-analytic approach.
   Data Source: A systematic search of the literature yielded 40 studies.
   Studies involving explicit decisions in a moral situation were
   categorized as active (n = 22); studies evoking moral emotions were
   categorized as passive (n = 18). We conducted a coordinate-based
   meta-analysis using the Activation Likelihood Estimation to determine
   reliable patterns of brain activity.
   Results \& Conclusions: Results revealed a convergent pattern of
   reliable brain activity for both task categories in regions of the
   default network, consistent with the social and contextual information
   processes supported by this brain network. Active tasks revealed more
   reliable activity in the temporoparietal junction, angular gyrus and
   temporal pole. Active tasks demand deliberative reasoning and may
   disproportionately involve the retrieval of social knowledge from
   memory, mental state attribution, and construction of the context
   through associative processes. In contrast, passive tasks reliably
   engaged regions associated with visual and emotional information
   processing, including lingual gyrus and the amygdala. A laterality
   effect was observed in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, with active tasks
   engaging the left, and passive tasks engaging the right. While
   overlapping activity patterns suggest a shared neural network for both
   tasks, differential activity suggests that processing of moral input is
   affected by task demands. The results provide novel insight into
   distinct features of moral cognition, including the generation of moral
   context through associative processes and the perceptual detection of
   moral salience.}},

Title = {{Development of brain mechanisms for processing affective touch}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{Affective tactile stimulation plays a key role in the maturation of
   neural circuits, but the development of brain mechanisms processing
   touch is poorly understood. We therefore used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain responses to soft brush stroking
   of both glabrous (palm) and hairy (forearm) skin in healthy children
   (5-13 years), adolescents (14-17 years), and adults (25-35 years).
   Adult-defined regions-of-interests in the primary somatosensory cortex
   (SI), secondary somatosensory cortex (SID, insular cortex and right
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) were significantly and
   similarly activated in all age groups. Whole-brain analyses revealed
   that responses in the ipsilateral SII were positively correlated with
   age in both genders, and that responses in bilateral regions near the
   pSTS correlated significantly and strongly with age in females but not
   in males. These results suggest that brain mechanisms associated with
   both sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational aspects of touch
   are largely established in school-aged children, and that there is a
   general continuing maturation of SII and a female-specific increase in
   pSTS sensitivity with age. Our work establishes a groundwork for future
   comparative studies of tactile processing in developmental disorders
   characterized by disrupted social perception such as autism.}},

   early visual cortex. Furthermore, we report an unexpected main effect of
   increased left parietal cortex activation associated with suppressed
   fearful faces compared to suppressed houses. This parietal finding is
   the first report of increased dorsal stream activation for a social
   object despite suppression, which suggests that information can reach
   parietal cortex for a class of emotionally salient social objects, even
   in the absence of awareness.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm
   originally employed by Takahashi et al. was adapted to look for
   emotion-specific differences in functional brain activity within a
   healthy German sample (N = 14), using shame-and guilt-related stimuli
   and neutral stimuli. Activations were found for both of these emotions
   in the temporal lobe (shame condition: anterior cingulate cortex,
   parahippocampal gyrus; guilt condition: fusiform gyrus, middle temporal
   gyrus). Specific activations were found for shame in the frontal lobe
   (medial and inferior frontal gyrus), and for guilt in the amygdala and
   insula. This is consistent with Takahashi et al.'s results obtained for
   a Japanese sample (using Japanese stimuli), which showed activations in
   the fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, middle occipital gyrus and
   parahippocampal gyrus. During the imagination of shame, frontal and
   temporal areas (e. g. middle frontal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus)
   were responsive regardless of gender. In the guilt condition, women only
   activate temporal regions, whereas men showed additional frontal and
   occipital activation as well as a responsive amygdala. The results
   suggest that shame and guilt share some neural networks, as well as
   having individual areas of activation. It can be concluded that frontal,
   temporal and limbic areas play a prominent role in the generation of
   moral feelings.}},

Abstract = {{Lifetime experiences shape people's attitudes toward sexual stimuli.
   Visual sexual stimulation (VSS), for instance, may be perceived as
   pleasurable by some, but as disgusting or ambiguous by others. VSS
   depicting explicit penile-vaginal penetration (PEN) is relevant in this
   respect, because the act of penetration is a core sexual activity. In
   this study, 20 women without sexual complaints participated. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and a single-target implicit
   association task to investigate how brain responses to PEN were
   modulated by the initial associations in memory (PEN-'hot' vs
   PEN-disgust) with such hardcore pornographic stimuli. Many brain areas
   responded to PEN in the same way they responded to disgust stimuli, and
   PEN-induced brain activity was prone to modulation by subjective disgust
   ratings toward PEN stimuli. The relative implicit PEN-disgust (relative
   to PEN-'hot') associations exclusively modulated PEN-induced brain
   responses: comparatively negative (PEN-disgust) implicit associations
   with pornography predicted the strongest PEN-related responses in the
   basal forebrain (including nucleus accumbens and bed nucleus of stria
   terminalis), midbrain and amygdala. Since these areas are often
   implicated in visual sexual processing, the present findings should be
   taken as a warning: apparently their involvement may also indicate a
   negative or ambivalent attitude toward sexual stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{While impairments in emotion recognition are consistently reported in
   schizophrenia, there is some debate on the experience of emotion. Only
   few studies investigated neural correlates of emotional experience in
   schizophrenia. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study
   compared a standard visual mood induction paradigm with an audiovisual
   method aimed at eliciting emotions more automatically. To investigate
   the interplay of sensory, cognitive and emotional mechanisms during
   emotion experience, we examined connectivity patterns between brain
   areas. Sixteen schizophrenia patients and sixteen healthy subjects
   participated in two different mood inductions (visual and audiovisual)
   that were administered for different emotions (happiness, sadness and
   neutral). Confirming the dissociation of behavioral and neural
   correlates of emotion experience, patients rated their mood similarly to
   healthy subjects but showed differences in neural activations. Sensory
   brain areas were activated less, increased activity emerged in higher
   cortical areas, particularly during audiovisual stimulation.
   Connectivity was increased between primary and secondary sensory
   processing areas in schizophrenia. These findings support the hypothesis
   of a deficit in filtering and processing sensory information alongside
   increased higher-order cognitive effort compensating for perception
   deficits in the affective domain. This may suffice to recover emotion
   experience in ratings of clinically stable patients but may fail during
   acute psychosis.}},

Abstract = {{An individual's affective style is influenced by many things, including
   the manner in which an individual responds to an emotional challenge.
   Emotional response is composed of a number of factors, two of which are
   the initial reactivity to an emotional stimulus and the subsequent
   recovery once the stimulus terminates or ceases to be relevant. However,
   most neuroimaging studies examining emotional processing in humans focus
   on the magnitude of initial reactivity to a stimulus rather than the
   prolonged response. In this study, we use functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to study the time course of amygdala activity in healthy adults
   in response to presentation of negative images. We split the amygdala
   time course into an initial reactivity period and a recovery period
   beginning after the offset of the stimulus. We find that initial
   reactivity in the amygdala does not predict trait measures of affective
   style. Conversely, amygdala recovery shows predictive power such that
   slower amygdala recovery from negative images predicts greater trait
   neuroticism, in addition to lower levels of likability of a set of
   social stimuli (neutral faces). These data underscore the importance of
   taking into account temporal dynamics when studying affective processing
   using neuroimaging.}},

Abstract = {{Both behavioral and neuroimaging evidence support a female advantage in

   investigating the relationship between the brain's response to faces and

   cycle. First, functional magnetic resonance images were acquired in 20
   young women {[}10 freely cycling and 10 taking oral contraception (OC)]
   during two phases of their cycle: mid-cycle and menstruation. We found
   stronger neural responses to faces in the right fusiform face area (FFA)
   in women taking oral contraceptives (vs freely cycling women) and during
   mid-cycle (vs menstruation) in both groups. Mean blood oxygenation
   level-dependent response in both left and right FFA increased as
   function of the duration of OC use. Next, this relationship between the
   use of OC and FFA response was replicated in an independent sample of
   110 adolescent girls. Finally in a parallel behavioral study carried out
   in another sample of women, we found no evidence of differences in the
   pattern of eye movements while viewing faces between freely cycling
   women vs those taking oral contraceptives. The imaging findings might
   indicate enhanced processing of social cues in women taking OC and women

Abstract = {{Understanding the neural processes that characterize elite performers is
   a first step to develop a neuroscience model that can be used to improve
   performance in stressful circumstances. Adventure racers are elite
   athletes that operate in small teams in the context of environmental and
   physical extremes. In particular, awareness of team member's emotional
   status is critical to the team's ability to navigate high-magnitude
   stressors. Thus, this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study
   examined the hypothesis that adventure racers would show altered emotion
   processing in brain areas that are important for resilience and social
   awareness. Elite adventure racers (n = 10) were compared with healthy
   volunteers (n = 12) while performing a simple emotion face-processing
   (modified Hariri) task during fMRI. Across three types of emotional
   faces, adventure racers showed greater activation in right insula, left
   amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate. Additionally, compared with
   healthy controls adventure racers showed attenuated right medial
   prefrontal cortex activation. These results are consistent with previous
   studies showing elite performers differentially activate neural
   substrates underlying interoception. Thus, adventure racers
   differentially deploy brain resources in an effort to recognize and
   process the internal sensations associated with emotions in others,

Abstract = {{This study provides exploratory evidence about how behavioral and neural
   responses to standard moral dilemmas are influenced by religious belief.
   Eleven Catholics and 13 Atheists (all female) judged 48 moral dilemmas.
   Differential neural activity between the two groups was found in
   precuneus and in prefrontal, frontal and temporal regions. Furthermore,
   a double dissociation showed that Catholics recruited different areas
   for deontological (precuneus; temporoparietal junction) and utilitarian
   moral judgments {[}dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); temporal
   poles], whereas Atheists did not (superior parietal gyrus for both types
   of judgment). Finally, we tested how both groups responded to personal
   and impersonal moral dilemmas: Catholics showed enhanced activity in
   DLPFC and posterior cingulate cortex during utilitarian moral judgments
   to impersonal moral dilemmas and enhanced responses in anterior
   cingulate cortex and superior temporal sulcus during deontological moral
   judgments to personal moral dilemmas. Our results indicate that moral
   judgment can be influenced by an acquired set of norms and conventions
   transmitted through religious indoctrination and practice. Catholic
   individuals may hold enhanced awareness of the incommensurability
   between two unequivocal doctrines of the Catholic belief set, triggered
   explicitly in a moral dilemma: help and care in all circumstances-but
   thou shalt not kill.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence suggests that abnormalities in the synchronized
   oscillatory activity of neurons in schizophrenia may lead to impaired
   neural activation and temporal coding and thus lead to neurocognitive
   dysfunctions, such as deficits in facial affect recognition. To gain an
   insight into the neurobiological processes linked to facial affect
   recognition, we investigated both induced and evoked oscillatory
   activity by calculating the Event Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP)
   and the Inter Trial Coherence (ITC) during facial affect recognition.
   Fearful and neutral faces as well as nonface patches were presented to
   24 patients with schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy controls while EEG
   was recorded. The participants' task was to recognize facial
   expressions. Because previous findings with healthy controls showed that
   facial feature decoding was associated primarily with oscillatory
   activity in the theta band, we analyzed ERSP and ITC in this frequency
   band in the time interval of 140-200 ms, which corresponds to the N170
   component. Event-related theta activity and phase-locking to facial
   expressions, but not to nonface patches, predicted emotion recognition
   performance in both controls and patients. Event-related changes in
   theta amplitude and phase-locking were found to be significantly weaker
   in patients compared with healthy controls, which is in line with
   previous investigations showing decreased neural synchronization in the
   low frequency bands in patients with schizophrenia. Neural synchrony is
   thought to underlie distributed information processing. Our results
   indicate a less effective functioning in the recognition process of
   facial features, which may contribute to a less effective social
   cognition in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Social anhedonia (SA), the diminished pleasure from social
   relationships, is a prominent characteristic of the vulnerability and
   manifestation of schizophrenia disorder. However, SA can develop for
   multiple reasons and little is known about its neural basis; these 2
   issues hinder the utility and sensitivity of SA as a marker of
   schizophrenia pathology. This study investigated whether lateral
   prefrontal cortex (LPFC) deficits in social reward processing are
   associated with both SA and other schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms.
   During functional MRI (fMRI), a community sample of healthy adults (N =
   30) with high and low SA viewed positive, negative, and neutral facial
   expressions. Afterward, participants completed an online daily diary in
   which they rated schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms and occurrence of
   interpersonal conflict each day for 21 days. Compared with low SA, high
   SA participants had less ventral (V) LPFC activity to positive versus
   neutral expressions. In addition, participants with a combination of
   high SA and low VLPFC activity to positive versus neutral expressions
   had worse daily diary ratings of schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms,
   including worse cognition, paranoia, motivation/productivity, and
   vigor/positive affect (i.e., psychomotor activation). Finally, among
   high SA participants, VLPFC activity predicted the daily relationship
   between distress from interpersonal conflict and symptom-severity;
   specifically, high SA participants with low VLPFC activity had worse
   paranoia on days of high conflict distress. These findings indicate that
   VLPFC deficits in positive emotion are associated with both SA and other
   schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms and that understanding the interaction
   of SA, VLPFC function, and social stress could facilitate the use of SA
   in the prevention and treatment of schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundExaggerated amygdala and reduced ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC) responsiveness during emotional processing have been
   reported in studies examining individual anxiety disorders. Studies are
   needed, however, which directly compare activation of amygdalo-cortical
   circuitry across multiple anxiety disorders within the same study. Here
   we compared cortico-limbic neurocircuitry across three different anxiety
   disorders using a well-validated emotional probe task.
   MethodsSixty-five adult volunteers, including 22 healthy controls (HC)
   and participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for either posttraumatic stress
   disorder (14 PTSD), panic disorder (14 PD), or specific animal phobia
   (15 SP), underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 T
   while passively viewing backward-masked images of faces expressing fear,
   happy, and neutral emotions.
   ResultsA group comprising all three anxiety disorders showed greater
   activation within the left amygdala and reduced activation within the
   vmPFC compared to the HC group during the masked fear versus neutral
   condition. Pairwise group comparisons showed that amygdala activation
   only reached significance for the PTSD versus HCs, whereas decreased
   vmPFC was only evident for SP and PD groups versus the HC group.
   Furthermore, activation did not differ among the anxiety groups when
   contrasted directly with one another. A similar pattern was observed for
   masked happy versus neutral faces.
   ConclusionsExclusive of specific diagnostic category, anxiety disorders
   were generally associated with increased activation of the amygdala and
   reduced activation within vmPFC. Categorical distinctions were generally
   weak or not observed and suggest that functional differences may reflect
   the magnitude of responses within a common neurocircuitry across
   disorders rather than activation of distinct systems. (C) 2013 Wiley

   whether emotional dysregulation in BPD occurs not only during the
   perception of emotional stimuli, but also during the anticipation of
   upcoming emotional pictures in the absence of concrete stimuli. Eighteen
   female patients with a diagnosis of BPD and 18 healthy control subjects
   anticipated cued visual stimuli with prior known emotional valence or
   prior unknown emotional content during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Brain activity during the anticipation of emotional stimuli was
   compared between both groups. When anticipating negative pictures, BPD
   patients demonstrated less signal change in the left dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) and left middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and
   enhanced activations in the left pregenual ACC, left posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC) as well as in left visual cortical areas including the
   lingual gyrus. During the anticipation of ambiguously announced stimuli,
   brain activity in BPD was also reduced in the left MCC extending into
   the medial and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Results point
   out that deficient recruitment of brain areas related to
   cognitive-emotional interaction already during the anticipation phase
   may add to emotional dysregulation in BPD. Stronger activation of the
   PCC could correspond to an increased autobiographical reference in BPD.
   Moreover, increased preparatory visual activity during negative
   anticipation may contribute to hypersensitivity toward emotional cues in
   this disorder.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based
   online binary decision decoding framework is developed. Fourteen healthy
   subjects are asked to mentally make ``yes{''} or ``no{''} decisions in
   answers to the given questions. For obtaining ``yes{''} decoding, the
   subjects are asked to perform a mental task that causes a cognitive load
   on the prefrontal cortex, while for making ``no{''} decoding, they are
   asked to relax. Signals from the prefrontal cortex are collected using
   continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscopy. It is observed and verified,
   using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the support vector
   machine (SVM) classifications, that the cortical hemodynamic responses
   for making a ``yes{''} decision are distinguishable from those for
   making a ``no{''} decision. Using mean values of the changes in the
   concentration of hemoglobin as features, binary decisions are classified
   into two classes, ``yes{''} and ``no,{''} with an average classification
   accuracy of 74.28 \% using LDA and 82.14 \% using SVM. These results
   demonstrate and suggest the feasibility of fNIRS for a brain-computer
   interface.}},

Abstract = {{Background The self-referential memory (SRM) effect refers to the
   phenomenon that stimuli processed with reference to the self are better
   remembered than those referenced to others. Studies have shown that
   schizophrenia patients do not have this memorial advantage for
   self-referenced information. The current study investigated the
   electrophysiological mechanism of the abolished SRM effect in
   schizophrenia.
   Method Twenty schizophrenia patients and 22 controls were recruited to
   complete an SRM task. We used a high-time resolution event-related
   potential (ERP) technique to analyze the electrophysiological
   differences between patients and controls during self- and
   other-reflection processing.
   Results Behavior data indicated that healthy controls had a typical SRM
   bias that was absent in the schizophrenia patients. ERP comparison
   between groups showed that the schizophrenia patients presented smaller
   voltages in both self- and other-reflection conditions in the 160-260ms
   (P2 component) and 800-1200ms (positive slow wave) time windows over the
   pre/frontal cortex. Furthermore, the N2 amplitudes (270-380ms) differed
   between self- and other-reflection conditions in patients but not in
   normal controls. More importantly, we found that the P3 amplitudes in
   the parietal cortex correlated significantly with the SRM bias score in
   the patients (r=-0.688).
   Conclusions These results provide comprehensive and direct
   electrophysiological evidence for self- and other-reflective dysfunction
   in schizophrenia patients and contribute to our understanding of the
   underlying neural substrates of the abolished SRM effect in
   schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundRecent research has highlighted the role of emotion-based
   impulsivity (negative and positive urgency personality traits) for
   alcohol use and abuse, but has yet to examine how these personality
   traits interact with the brain's motivational systems. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested whether urgency traits and
   mood induction affected medial prefrontal responses to alcohol odors
   (AcO).
   MethodsTwenty-seven social drinkers (mean age=25.2, 14 males) had 6 fMRI
   scans while viewing negative, neutral, or positive mood images (3 mood
   conditions) during intermittent exposure to AcO and appetitive control
   (AppCo) aromas.
   ResultsVoxel-wise analyses (p<0.001) confirmed {[}AcO>AppCo] activation
   throughout medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventromedial PFC (vmPFC)
   regions. Extracted from a priori mPFC and vmPFC regions and analyzed in
   Odor (AcO, AppCo)xMood factorial models, AcO activation was greater than
   AppCo in left vmPFC (p<0.001), left mPFC (p=0.002), and right vmPFC
   (p=0.01) regions. Mood did not interact significantly with activation,
   but the covariate of trait negative urgency accounted for significant
   variance in left vmPFC (p=0.01) and right vmPFC (p=0.01) {[}AcO>AppCo]
   activation. Negative urgency also mediated the relationship between
   vmPFC activation and both (i) subjective craving and (ii) problematic
   drinking.
   ConclusionsThe trait of negative urgency is associated with neural
   responses to alcohol cues in the vmPFC, a region involved in reward
   value and emotion-guided decision-making. This suggests that negative
   urgency might alter subjective craving and brain regions involved in
   coding reward value.}},

Abstract = {{Recent fMRI studies indicate that the posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) and the mirror system are involved in analyzing goal-directed
   actions performed by non-human objects. However, these studies have some
   limitations: the animations showed moving shapes that resemble humans
   and human movement, or showed the interaction of two moving shapes
   rather than one alone. This may have prompted participants to assume a
   human agent instead of an object. To avoid this potential confound, in
   this study, animations showed a small circular shape (agent) jumping
   toward a bigger circular shape (goal) with an obstacle separating them.
   We manipulated agency of the small circular shape by showing its
   movements as self-propelled (Agent condition) or as launched by a lever
   mechanism (Non-agent condition). The small shape succeeded in avoiding
   an obstacle and reaching the goal object or failed to do so. Our results
   showed that goal-directed actions performed by an agentic shape
   recruited the mirror system (the inferior parietal lobe and the premotor
   cortex) in comparison with shapes that were launched. Success or failure
   to avoid the obstacle had no effect on these areas. These results
   complement and further extend previous findings indicating that the
   mirror system does not appear to be selective for biological actions and
   their goals, nor does it require the presence of a human, human body
   parts or human-made objects. Instead, it seems to play a general role in
   representing goaldirected actions of agents regardless of their form.

Abstract = {{Most studies assessing facial affect recognition in patients with TLE
   reported emotional disturbances in patients with TLE. Results from the
   few fMRI studies assessing neural correlates of affective face
   processing in patients with TLE are divergent. Some, but not all, found
   asymmetrical mesiotemporal activations, i.e., stronger activations
   within the hemisphere contralateral to seizure onset. Little is known
   about the association between neural correlates of affect processing and
   subjective evaluation of the stimuli presented. Therefore, we
   investigated the neural correlates of processing dynamic fearful faces
   in 37 patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE; 18 with
   left-sided TLE (lTLE), 19 with right-sided TLE (rTLE)) and 20 healthy
   subjects. We additionally assessed individual ratings of the fear
   intensity and arousal perception of the fMRI stimuli and correlated
   these data with the activations induced by the fearful face paradigm and
   activation lateralization within the mesiotemporal structures (in terms
   of individual lateralization indices, LIs). In healthy subjects,
   whole-brain analysis showed bilateral activations within a widespread
   network of mesial and lateral temporal, occipital, and frontal areas.
   The patient groups activated different parts of this network. In
   patients with lTLE, we found predominantly right-sided activations
   within the mesial and lateral temporal cortices and the superior frontal
   gyrus. In patients with rTLE, we observed bilateral activations in the
   posterior regions of the lateral temporal lobe and within the occipital
   cortex. Mesiotemporal region-of-interest analysis showed bilateral
   symmetric activations associated with watching fearful faces in healthy
   subjects. According to the region of interest and LI analyses, in the
   patients with lTLE, mesiotemporal activations were lateralized to the
   right hemisphere. In the patients with rTLE, we found left-sided
   mesiotemporal activations. In patients with lTLE, fear ratings were
   comparable to those of healthy subjects and were correlated with
   relatively stronger activations in the right compared to the left
   amygdala. Patients with rTLE showed significantly reduced fear ratings
   compared to healthy subjects, and we did not find associations with
   amygdala lateralization. Although we found stronger activations within
   the contralateral mesial temporal lobe in the majority of all patients,
   our results suggest that only in the event of left-sided mesiotemporal
   damage is the right mesial temporal lobe able to preserve intact facial
   fear recognition. In the event of right-sided mesiotemporal damage, fear
   recognition is disturbed. This underlines the hypothesis that the right
   amygdala is biologically predisposed to processing fear, and its
   function cannot be fully compensated in the event of right-sided
   mesiotemporal damage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral studies have shown an alcohol-approach bias in
   alcohol-dependent patients: the automatic tendency to faster approach
   than avoid alcohol compared with neutral cues, which has been associated
   with craving and relapse. Although this is a well-studied psychological
   phenomenon, little is known about the brain processes underlying
   automatic action tendencies in addiction. We examined 20
   alcohol-dependent patients and 17 healthy controls with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while performing an implicit
   approach-avoidance task. Participants pushed and pulled pictorial cues
   of alcohol and soft-drink beverages, according to a content-irrelevant
   feature of the cue (landscape/portrait). The critical fMRI contrast
   regarding the alcohol-approach bias was defined as (approach alcohol >
   avoid alcohol) > (approach soft drink > avoid soft drink). This was
   reversed for the avoid-alcohol contrast: (avoid alcohol > approach
   alcohol) > (avoid soft drink>approach soft drink). In comparison with
   healthy controls, alcohol-dependent patients had stronger behavioral
   approach tendencies for alcohol cues than for soft-drink cues. In the
   approach, alcohol fMRI contrast patients showed larger
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses in the nucleus accumbens and
   medial prefrontal cortex, regions involved in reward and motivational
   processing. In alcohol-dependent patients, alcohol-craving scores were
   positively correlated with activity in the amygdala for the
   approach-alcohol contrast. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was not
   activated in the avoid-alcohol contrast in patients vs controls. Our
   data suggest that brain regions that have a key role in reward and
   motivation are associated with the automatic alcohol-approach bias in
   alcohol-dependent patients.}},

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin has recently been shown to enhance eye gaze
   and emotion recognition in healthy men. Here, we report a randomized
   double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that examined the neural and
   behavioral effects of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin on emotion
   recognition in individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS), a clinical
   condition characterized by impaired eye gaze and facial emotion
   recognition. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined
   whether oxytocin would enhance emotion recognition from facial sections
   of the eye vs the mouth region and modulate regional activity in brain
   areas associated with face perception in both adults with AS, and a
   neurotypical control group. Intranasal administration of the
   neuropeptide oxytocin improved performance in a facial emotion
   recognition task in individuals with AS. This was linked to increased
   left amygdala reactivity in response to facial stimuli and increased
   activity in the neural network involved in social cognition. Our data
   suggest that the amygdala, together with functionally associated
   cortical areas mediate the positive effect of oxytocin on social
   cognitive functioning in AS.}},

Abstract = {{In previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
   concerning romantic love, several brain regions including the caudate
   and putamen have consistently been found to be more responsive to
   beloved-related than control stimuli. In those studies, infatuated
   individuals were typically instructed to passively view the stimuli or
   to think of the viewed person. In the current study, we examined how the
   instruction to attend to, or ignore the beloved modulates the response
   of these brain areas. Infatuated individuals performed an oddball task
   in which pictures of their beloved and friend served as targets and
   distractors. The dorsal striatum showed greater activation for the
   beloved than friend, but only when they were targets. The dorsal
   striatum actually tended to show less activation for the beloved than
   the friend when they were distractors. The longer the love and
   relationship duration, the smaller the response of the dorsal striatum
   to beloved-distractor stimuli was. We interpret our findings in terms of
   reinforcement learning. By virtue of using a cognitive task with a full
   factorial design, we show that the dorsal striatum is not activated by
   beloved-related information per se, but only by beloved-related
   information that is attended. Hum Brain Mapp 35:503-512, 2014. (c) 2012

Title = {{Disruption of Functional Organization Within the Primary Motor Cortex in

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence suggests that motor impairments are prevalent in
   autism spectrum disorder (ASD), relate to the social and communicative
   deficits at the core of the diagnosis and may reflect abnormal
   connectivity within brain networks underlying motor control and
   learning. Parcellation of resting-state functional connectivity data
   using spectral clustering approaches has been shown to be an effective
   means of visualizing functional organization within the brain but has
   most commonly been applied to explorations of normal brain function.
   This article presents a parcellation of a key area of the motor network,
   the primary motor cortex (M1), a key area of the motor control network,
   in adults, typically developing (TD) children and children with ASD and
   introduces methods for selecting the number of parcels, matching parcels
   across groups and testing group differences. The parcellation is based
   solely on patterns of connectivity between individual M1 voxels and all
   voxels outside of M1, and within all groups, a gross dorsomedial to
   ventrolateral organization emerged within M1 which was left-right
   symmetric. Although this gross organizational scheme was present in both
   groups of children, statistically significant group differences in the
   size and segregation of M1 parcels within regions of the motor
   homunculus corresponding to the upper and lower limbs were observed.
   Qualitative comparison of the M1 parcellation for children with ASD with
   that of younger and older TD children suggests that these organizational
   differences, with a lack of differentiation between lower limb/trunk
   regions and upper limb/hand regions, may be due, at least in part, to a
   delay in functional specialization within the motor cortex. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia has been associated with abnormal task-related brain
   activation in sensory and motor regions as well as social cognition
   network. Recently, two studies investigated temporal correlation between
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI)
   low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) in schizophrenia but reported mixed
   results. This may be due to the different frequency bands used in these
   studies. Here we utilized R-fMRI to measure the amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) in three
   different frequency bands (slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.08 Hz;
   and typical band: 0.01-0.08 Hz) in 69 patients with schizophrenia and 62
   healthy controls. We showed that there were significant differences in
   ALFF/fALFF between the two bands (slow-5 and slow-4) in regions
   including basal ganglia, midbrain, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
   Importantly, we also identified significant interaction between
   frequency bands and groups in inferior occipital gyrus, precunus, and
   thalamus. The results suggest that the abnormalities of LFOs in
   schizophrenia is dependent on the frequency band and suggest that future
   studies should take the different frequency bands into account when
   measure intrinsic brain activity. Hum Brain Mapp 35:627-637, 2014. (c)

Abstract = {{The embodied view of language processing proposes that comprehension
   involves multimodal simulations, a process that retrieves a
   comprehender's perceptual, motor, and affective knowledge through
   reactivation of the neural systems responsible for perception, action,
   and emotion. Although evidence in support of this idea is growing, the
   contemporary neuroanatomical model of language suggests that
   comprehension largely emerges as a result of interactions between
   frontotemporal language areas in the left hemisphere. If
   modality-specific neural systems are involved in comprehension, they are
   not likely to operate in isolation but should interact with the brain
   regions critical to language processing. However, little is known about
   the ways in which language and modality-specific neural systems
   interact. To investigate this issue, we conducted a functional MRI study
   in which participants listened to stories that contained visually vivid,
   action-based, and emotionally charged content. Activity of neural
   systems associated with visual-spatial, motor, and affective processing
   were selectively modulated by the relevant story content. Importantly,
   when functional connectivity patterns associated with the left inferior
   frontal gyrus (LIFG), the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG),
   and the bilateral anterior temporal lobes (aTL) were compared, both LIFG
   and pMTG, but not the aTL, showed enhanced connectivity with the three
   modality-specific systems relevant to the story content. Taken together,
   our results suggest that language regions are engaged in perceptual,
   motor, and affective simulations of the described situation, which
   manifest through their interactions with modality-specific systems. On
   the basis of our results and past research, we propose that the LIFG and
   pMTG play unique roles in multimodal simulations during story
   comprehension.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity to inhibit a planned action gives human behavior its
   characteristic flexibility. How this mechanism operates and what factors
   influence a decision to act or not act remain relatively unexplored. We
   used EEG readiness potentials (RPs) to examine preparatory activity
   before each action of an ongoing sequence, in which one action was
   occasionally omitted. We compared RPs between sequences in which
   omissions were instructed by a rule (e.g., omit every fourth action) and
   sequences in which the participant themselves freely decided which
   action to omit. RP amplitude was reduced for actions that immediately
   preceded a voluntary omission but not a rule-based omission. We also
   used the regular temporal pattern of the action sequences to explore
   brain processes linked to omitting an action by time-locking EEG
   averages to the inferred time when an action would have occurred had it
   not been omitted. When omissions were instructed by a rule, there was a
   negative-going trend in the EEG, recalling the rising ramp of an RP. No
   such component was found for voluntary omissions. The results are
   consistent with a model in which spontaneously fluctuating activity in
   motor areas of the brain could bias free decisions to act or not.}},

Title = {{Association between the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene and mesolimbic
   responses to rewards}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: There has been significant progress in identifying genes
   that confer risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the
   heterogeneity of symptom presentation in ASDs impedes the detection of
   ASD risk genes. One approach to understanding genetic influences on ASD
   symptom expression is to evaluate relations between variants of ASD
   candidate genes and neural endophenotypes in unaffected samples. Allelic
   variations in the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene confer small but
   significant risk for ASDs for which the underlying mechanisms may
   involve associations between variability in oxytocin signaling pathways
   and neural response to rewards. The purpose of this preliminary study
   was to investigate the influence of allelic variability in the OXTR gene
   on neural responses to monetary rewards in healthy adults using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Methods: The moderating effects of three single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) (rs1042778, rs2268493 and rs237887) of the OXTR gene on
   mesolimbic responses to rewards were evaluated using a monetary
   incentive delay fMRI task.
   Results: T homozygotes of the rs2268493 SNP demonstrated relatively
   decreased activation in mesolimbic reward circuitry (including the
   nucleus accumbens, amygdala, insula, thalamus and prefrontal cortical
   regions) during the anticipation of rewards but not during the outcome
   phase of the task. Allelic variation of the rs1042778 and rs237887 SNPs
   did not moderate mesolimbic activation during either reward anticipation
   or outcomes.
   Conclusions: This preliminary study suggests that the OXTR SNP
   rs2268493, which has been previously identified as an ASD risk gene,
   moderates mesolimbic responses during reward anticipation. Given
   previous findings of decreased mesolimbic activation during reward
   anticipation in ASD, the present results suggest that OXTR may confer
   ASD risk via influences on the neural systems that support reward
   anticipation.}},

Title = {{Is inhibitory control a `no-go' in adolescents with autism spectrum
   disorder?}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a range of
   neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by social communication
   deficits, repetitive behaviours, and restrictive interests. Impaired
   inhibition has been suggested to exacerbate the core symptoms of ASD.
   This is particularly critical during adolescence when social skills are
   maturing to adult levels. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we
   identified the location and timing pattern of neural activity associated
   with inhibition in adolescents with autism, compared to typically
   developing adolescents.
   Methods: The MEG data from 15 adolescents with ASD and 15 age-matched
   controls (13 to 17 years) were collected during a go/no-go task with
   inverse ratios of go/no-go trials in two conditions: an inhibition
   condition (1:2) and a baseline condition (2:1). No-go trials from the
   two conditions were analyzed using beamformer source localizations from
   200 ms to 400 ms post-stimulus onset. Significant activations were
   determined using permutation testing.
   Results: Adolescents with ASD recruited first the right middle frontal
   gyrus (200 to 250 ms) followed by the left postcentral gyrus (250 to 300
   ms) and finally the left middle frontal and right medial frontal gyri
   (300 to 400 ms). Typically developing adolescents recruited first the
   left middle frontal gyrus (200 to 250 ms), followed by the left superior
   and inferior frontal gyri (250 to 300 ms), then the right middle
   temporal gyrus (300 to 350 ms), and finally the superior and precentral
   gyri and right inferior lobule (300 to 400 ms).
   Conclusions: Adolescents with ASD showed recruitment limited largely to
   the frontal cortex unlike typically developing adolescents who recruited
   parietal and temporal regions as well. These findings support the
   presence of an atypical, restricted inhibitory network in adolescents
   with ASD compared to controls.}},

   Disorder}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Proneness to self-blaming moral emotions such as shame and guilt is
   increased in major depressive disorder (MDD), and may play an important
   role in vulnerability even after symptoms have subsided. Social
   psychologists have argued that shame-proneness is relevant for
   depression vulnerability and is distinct from guilt. Shame depends on
   the imagined critical perception of others, whereas guilt results from
   one's own judgement. The neuroanatomy of shame in MDD is unknown. Using
   fMRI, we compared 21 participants with MDD remitted from symptoms with
   no current co-morbid axis-I disorders, and 18 control participants with
   no personal or family history of MDD. The MDD group exhibited higher
   activation of the right amygdala and posterior insula for shame relative
   to guilt (SPM8). This neural difference was observed despite equal
   levels of rated negative emotional valence and frequencies of induced
   shame and guilt experience across groups. These same results were found
   in the medication-free MDD subgroup (N = 15). Increased amygdala and
   posterior insula activations, known to be related to sensory perception
   of emotional stimuli, distinguish shame from guilt responses in remitted
   MDD. People with MDD thus exhibit changes in the neural response to
   shame after symptoms have subsided. This supports the hypothesis that
   shame and guilt play at least partly distinct roles in vulnerability to
   MDD. Shame-induction may be a more sensitive probe of residual amygdala
   hypersensitivity in MDD compared with facial emotion-evoked responses
   previously found to normalize on remission.}},

Abstract = {{Personality disorders are common in nonpsychotic siblings of patients
   with schizophrenia and some personality traits in this group may be
   associated with an increased risk for full-blown psychosis. We sought to
   establish if faulty right-hemisphere activation induced by social
   cognitive tasks, as previously described in patients with schizophrenia,
   is associated with specific personality symptoms in their unaffected
   siblings. We observed that cluster B personality symptoms in this group
   were inversely related to activation in the right temporo parietal
   junction (rTPL, a structure critical in social cognitive processing) in
   response to a basic emotion processing task and also to social
   competence, whereas in contrast to our initial hypothesis, cluster A
   traits were not associated with right hemisphere activation during
   emotion processing or with social competence. These findings suggest the
   existence of clinical traits in at risk individuals which share a common
   neurobiological substrate with schizophrenia, in regards to social
   performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The search for an Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker is one of the most
   relevant contemporary research topics due to the high prevalence and
   social costs of the disease. Functional connectivity (PC) of the default
   mode network (DMN) is a plausible candidate for such a biomarker. We
   evaluated 22 patients with mild AD and 26 age- and gender-matched
   healthy controls. All subjects underwent resting functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) in a 3.0 T scanner. To identify the DMN,
   seed-based FC of the posterior cingulate was calculated. We also
   measured the sensitivity/specificity of the method, and verified a
   correlation with cognitive performance. We found a significant
   difference between patients with mild AD and controls in average
   z-scores: DMN, whole cortical positive (WCP) and absolute values. DMN
   individual values showed a sensitivity of 77.3\% and specificity of
   70\%. DMN and WCP values were correlated to global cognition and
   episodic memory performance. We showed that individual measures of DMN
   connectivity could be considered a promising method to differentiate AD,
   even at an early phase, from normal aging. Further studies with larger
   numbers of participants, as well as validation of normal values, are
   needed for more definitive conclusions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{Distance describes more than physical space: we speak of close friends
   and distant relatives, and of the near future and distant past. Did
   these ubiquitous spatial metaphors arise in language coincidentally or
   did they arise because they are rooted in a common neural computation?
   To address this question, we used statistical pattern recognition
   techniques to analyze human fMRI data. First, a machine learning
   algorithm was trained to discriminate patterns of fMRI responses based
   on relative egocentric distance within trials from one distance domain
   (e.g., photographs of objects relatively close to or far away from the
   viewer in spatial distance trials). Next, we tested whether the decision
   boundary generated from this training could distinguish brain responses
   according to relative egocentric distance within each of two separate
   distance domains (e.g., phrases referring to the immediate or more
   remote future within temporal distance trials; photographs of
   participants' friends or acquaintances within social distance trials).
   This procedure was repeated using all possible combinations of distance
   domains for training and testing the classifier. In all cases,
   above-chance decoding across distance domains was possible in the right
   inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Furthermore, the representational
   similarity structure within this brain area reflected participants' own
   judgments of spatial distance, temporal soon-ness, and social
   familiarity. Thus, the right IPL may contain a parsimonious encoding of
   proximity to self in spatial, temporal, and social frames of reference.}},

Title = {{Temporal Constraints of Behavioral Inhibition: Relevance of
   Inter-stimulus Interval in a Go-Nogo Task}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{The capacity to inhibit prepotent and automatic responses is crucial for
   proper cognitive and social development, and inhibitory impairments have
   been considered to be key for some neuropsychiatric conditions. One of
   the most used paradigms to analyze inhibitory processes is the Go-Nogo
   task (GNG). This task has been widely used in psychophysical and
   cognitive EEG studies, and more recently in paradigms using fMRI.
   However, a technical limitation is that the time resolution of fMRI is
   poorer than that of the EEG technique. In order to compensate for these
   temporal constraints, it has become common practice in the fMRI field to
   use longer inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) than those used in EEG
   protocols. Despite the noticeable temporal differences between these two
   techniques, it is currently assumed that both approaches assess similar
   inhibitory processes. We performed an EEG study using a GNG task with
   both short ISI (fast-condition, FC, as in EEG protocols) and long ISI
   (slow-condition, SC, as in fMRI protocols). We found that in the FC
   there was a stronger Nogo-N2 effect than in the SC. Moreover, in the FC,
   but not in the SC, the number of preceding Go trials correlated
   positively with the Nogo-P3 amplitude and with the Go trial reaction
   time; and negatively with commission errors. In addition, we found
   significant topographical differences for the Go-P3 elicited in FC and
   SC, which is interpreted in terms of different neurotransmitter
   dynamics. Taken together, our results provide evidence that frequency of
   stimulus presentation in the GNG task strongly modulates the behavioral
   response and the evoked EEG activity. Therefore, it is likely that
   short-ISI EEG protocols and long-ISI fMRI protocols do not assess
   equivalent inhibitory processes.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify the
   brain-based mechanisms of uncertainty and certainty associated with
   answers to multiple-choice questions involving common misconceptions
   about electric circuits. Twenty-two scientifically novice participants
   (humanities and arts college students) were asked, in an fMR1 study,
   whether or not they thought the light bulbs in images presenting
   electric circuits were lighted up correctly, and if they were certain or
   uncertain of their answers. When participants reported that they were
   unsure of their responses, analyses revealed significant activations in
   brain areas typically involved in uncertainty (anterior cingulate
   cortex, anterior insula cortex, and superior/dorsomedial frontal cortex)
   and in the left middle/superior temporal lobe. Certainty was associated
   with large bilateral activations in the occipital and parietal regions
   usually involved in visuospatial processing. Correct-and-certain answers
   were associated with activations that suggest a stronger mobilization of
   visual attention resources when compared to incorrect-and-certain
   answers. These findings provide insights into brainbased mechanisms of
   uncertainty that are activated when common misconceptions, identified as
   such by science education research literature, interfere in decision
   making in a school-like task. We also discuss the implications of these
   results from an educational perspective.}},

Title = {{Regional Brain Changes Occurring during Disobedience to ``Experts{''} in
   Financial Decision-Making}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{It is well recognized that individuals follow ``Expert'' advice, even
   when flawed and offers no advantage, and sometimes leads to
   disadvantages. The neurobiology underlying this is uncertain, and in
   particular there is an incomplete understanding of which brain regions
   are most involved when individuals chose to disobey an expert. To study
   this we examined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   differences during an investment game where subjects received
   differentially credible investment advice. Participants (n = 42; 32
   males) played an investment game, in which they could Buy or Not Buy a
   sequence of stocks. The better they did, the more money they made.
   Participants received either ``Expert'' advice or ``Peer'' advice. Those
   receiving Expert advice were told the advice came from a certified
   financial ``Expert''. Those receiving Peer Advice were told the advice
   was that of the student administering the scans, who deliberately
   dressed and acted casually. Both streams of advice were predetermined
   and identical. The advice was scripted to be helpful initially, but
   progressively worse as the task continued, becoming 100\% wrong by the
   end of the task. Subjects receiving Expert Advice followed the advice
   significantly longer on average, even though this was progressively
   worse advice. Thus, following Expert advice had poorer consequences for
   individuals, but this did not dissuade them from continuing to follow
   the advice. In contrast, when subjects disobeyed Expert advice they
   exhibited significant anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and superior
   frontal gyrus activation relative to those disobeying Peer advice. These
   findings may suggest that in subjects who defy authority, or believe
   they are doing so (in this case by disobeying an ``Expert'') there is
   increased activation of these two brain regions. This may have relevance
   to several areas of behavior, and the potential role of these two brain
   regions in regard to disobedience behavior requires further study.}},

Title = {{Social Alienation in Schizophrenia Patients: Association with Insula
   Responsiveness to Facial Expressions of Disgust}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Among the functional neuroimaging studies on emotional
   face processing in schizophrenia, few have used paradigms with facial
   expressions of disgust. In this study, we investigated whether
   schizophrenia patients show less insula activation to macro-expressions
   (overt, clearly visible expressions) and micro-expressions (covert, very
   brief expressions) of disgust than healthy controls. Furthermore,
   departing from the assumption that disgust faces signal social
   rejection, we examined whether perceptual sensitivity to disgust is
   related to social alienation in patients and controls. We hypothesized
   that high insula responsiveness to facial disgust predicts social
   alienation.
   Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure insula
   activation in 36 schizophrenia patients and 40 healthy controls. During
   scanning, subjects passively viewed covert and overt presentations of
   disgust and neutral faces. To measure social alienation, a social
   loneliness scale and an agreeableness scale were administered.
   Results: Schizophrenia patients exhibited reduced insula activation in
   response to covert facial expressions of disgust. With respect to
   macro-expressions of disgust, no between-group differences emerged. In
   patients, insula responsiveness to covert faces of disgust was
   positively correlated with social loneliness. Furthermore, patients'
   insula responsiveness to covert and overt faces of disgust was
   negatively correlated with agreeableness. In controls, insula
   responsiveness to covert expressions of disgust correlated negatively
   with agreeableness.
   Discussion: Schizophrenia patients show reduced insula responsiveness to
   micro-expressions but not macro-expressions of disgust compared to
   healthy controls. In patients, low agreeableness was associated with
   stronger insula response to micro- and macro-expressions of disgust.
   Patients with a strong tendency to feel uncomfortable with social
   interactions appear to be characterized by a high sensitivity for facial
   expression signaling social rejection. Given the associations of insula
   responsiveness to covert disgust expression with low agreeableness in
   healthy individuals, insula responsiveness to expressions of disgust
   might be in general a neural marker of the personality trait of
   agreeableness.}},

Abstract = {{An optimal balance between efficient exploitation of available resources
   and creative exploration of alternatives is critical for adaptation and
   survival. Previous studies associated these behavioral drives with,
   respectively, the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic system and
   frontopolar-intraparietal networks. We study the activation of these
   systems in two age and gender-matched groups of experienced
   decision-makers differing in prior professional background, with the aim
   to understand the neural bases of individual differences in
   decision-making efficiency (performance divided by response time). We
   compare brain activity of entrepreneurs (who currently manage the
   organization they founded based on their venture idea) and managers (who
   are constantly involved in making strategic decisions but have no
   venture experience) engaged in a gambling-task assessing exploitative
   vs. explorative decision-making. Compared with managers, entrepreneurs
   showed higher decision-making efficiency, and a stronger activation in

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Evidence that the human premotor cortex (PMC) is activated by cognitive
   functions involving the motor domain is classically explained as the
   reactivation of a motor program decoupled from its executive functions,
   and exploited for different purposes by means of a motor simulation. In
   contrast, the evidence that PMC contributes to the sequencing of
   non-biological events cannot be explained by the simulationist theory.
   Here we investigated how motor simulation and event sequencing coexist
   within the PMC and how these mechanisms interact when both functions are
   executed. We asked patients with depth electrodes implanted in the PMC
   to passively observe a randomized arrangement of images depicting
   biological actions and physical events and, in a second block, to
   sequence them in the correct order. This task allowed us to disambiguate
   between the simple observation of actions, their sequencing (recruiting
   different motor simulation processes), as well as the sequencing of
   non-biological events (recruiting a sequencer mechanism non dependant on
   motor simulation). We analysed the response of the gamma, alpha and beta
   frequency bands to evaluate the contribution of each brain rhythm to the
   observation and sequencing of both biological and non-biological
   stimuli. We found that motor simulation (biological>physical) and event
   sequencing (sequencing>observation) differently affect the three
   investigated frequency bands: motor simulation was reflected on the
   gamma and, partially, in the beta, but not in the alpha band. In
   contrast, event sequencing was also reflected on the alpha band.}},

Title = {{Regional Homogeneity of Intrinsic Brain Activity in Happy and Unhappy
   Individuals}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Why are some people happier than others? This question has
   intrigued many researchers. However, limited work has addressed this
   question within a neuroscientific framework.
   Methods: The present study investigated the neural correlates of trait
   happiness using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rs-fMRI) approach. Specifically, regional homogeneity (ReHo) was
   examined on two groups of young adults: happy and unhappy individuals (N
   = 25 per group).
   Results: Decreased ReHo in unhappy relative to happy individuals was
   observed within prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, superior
   temporal lobe, and retrosplenial cortex. In contrast, increased ReHo in
   unhappy relative to happy individuals was observed within the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, middle cingulate gyrus, putamen, and
   thalamus. In addition, the ReHo within the left thalamus was negatively
   correlated with Chinese Happiness Inventory (CHI) score within the happy
   group.
   Limitations: As an exploratory study, we examined how general trait
   happiness is reflected in the regional homogeneity of intrinsic brain
   activity in a relatively small sample. Examining other types of
   happiness in a larger sample using a multitude of intrinsic brain
   activity indices are warranted for future work.
   Conclusions: The local synchronization of BOLD signal is altered in
   unhappy individuals. The regions implicated in this alteration partly
   overlapped with previously identified default mode network, emotional
   circuitry, and rewarding system, suggesting that these systems may be
   involved in happiness.}},

Abstract = {{Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) studies have reported that prefrontal
   hemodynamic dysfunction during executive function tasks may be a
   promising biomarker of psychiatric disorders, because its portability
   and noninvasiveness allow easy measurements in clinical settings. Here,
   we investigated the degree to which prefrontal NIRS signals are
   genetically determined. Using a 52-channel NIRS system, we monitored the
   oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) signal changes in 38 adult pairs of right-handed
   monozygotic (MZ) twins and 13 pairs of same-sex right-handed dizygotic
   (DZ) twins during a letter version of the verbal fluency task.
   Heritability was estimated based on a classical twin paradigm using
   structured equation modeling. Significant genetic influences were
   estimated in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left frontal
   pole. The degrees of heritability were 66\% and 75\% in the variances,
   respectively. This implies that the prefrontal hemodynamic dysfunction
   observed during an executive function task measured by NIRS may be an
   efficient endophenotype for large-scale imaging genetic studies in
   psychiatric disorders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neurons are able to express long-lasting and activity-dependent
   modulations of their synapses. This plastic property supports memory and
   conveys an extraordinary adaptive value, because it allows an individual
   to learn from, and respond to, changes in the environment. Molecular and
   physiological changes at the cellular level as well as network
   interactions are required in order to encode a pattern of synaptic
   activity into a long-term memory. While the cellular mechanisms linking
   synaptic plasticity to memory have been intensively studied, those
   regulating network interactions have received less attention. Combining
   high-resolution fMRI and in vivo electrophysiology in rats, we have
   previously reported a functional remodelling of long-range hippocampal
   networks induced by long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic plasticity
   in the perforant pathway. Here, we present new results demonstrating an
   increased bilateral coupling in the hippocampus specifically supported
   by the mossy cell commissural/associational pathway in response to LTP.
   This fMRI-measured increase in bilateral connectivity is accompanied by
   potentiation of the corresponding polysynaptically evoked commissural
   potential in the contralateral dentate gyrus and depression of the
   inactive convergent commissural pathway to the ipsilateral dentate. We
   review these and previous findings in the broader context of memory
   consolidation.}},

Abstract = {{Verbal insight problem solving means to break mental sets, to select the
   novel semantic information and to form novel, task-related associations.
   Although previous studies have identified the brain regions associated
   with these key processes, the interaction among these regions during
   insight is still unclear. In the present study, we explored the
   functional connectivity between the key regions during solving Chinese
   `chengyu' riddles by using event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Results showed that both insight and noninsight solutions
   activated the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, middle temporal gyri and
   hippocampi, and these regions constituted a frontal to temporal to
   hippocampal neural pathway. Compared with noninsight solution, insight
   solution had a stronger functional connectivity between the inferior
   frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus in the right hemisphere. Our
   study reveals the neural pathway of information processing during verbal
   insight problem solving, and supports the right-hemisphere advantage
   theory of insight. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{When people are confronted with social dilemmas, their decision-making
   strategies tend to be associated with individual social preferences;
   prosocials have an intrinsic willingness to cooperate, while proselfs
   need extrinsic motivators signaling personal gain. In this study, the
   biological roots for the proselfs/prosocials concept are explored by
   investigating the neural correlates of cooperative versus defect
   decisions when participants engage in a series of one-shot, anonymous
   prisoner's dilemma situations. Our data are in line with previous
   studies showing that prosocials activate several social cognition
   regions of the brain more than proselfs (here: medial prefrontal cortex,
   temporo-parietal junction, and precuneus BA 7 (Brodmann area 7), and
   that dispositional trust positively affects prosocials' decisions to
   cooperate. At the neural level, however, dispositional trust appears to
   exert a greater marginal effect on brain activity of proselfs in three
   social cognition regions, which does not translate into an increase in
   cooperation. An event-related analysis shows that cooperating prosocials
   show significantly more activation in the precuneus (BA 7) than
   proselfs. Based on previous research, we interpret this result to be
   consistent with prosocials' enhanced tendency to infer the intentions of
   others in social dilemma games, and the importance of establishing norm
   congruence when they decide to cooperate.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{36-49}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Facial expressions play a critical role in social interactions by
   eliciting rapid responses in the observer. Failure to perceive and
   experience a normal range and depth of emotion seriously impact
   interpersonal communication and relationships. As has been demonstrated
   across a number of domains, abnormal emotion processing in individuals
   with psychopathy plays a key role in their lack of empathy. However, the
   neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific
   to particular emotions such as fear and perhaps sadness. Moreover,
   findings are inconsistent across studies. In the current experiment, 80
   incarcerated adult males scoring high, medium, and low on the Hare
   Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning while viewing dynamic facial
   expressions of fear, sadness, happiness, and pain. Participants who
   scored high on the PCL-R showed a reduction in neuro-hemodynamic
   response to all four categories of facial expressions in the face
   processing network (inferior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and
   superior temporal sulcus (STS)) as well as the extended network
   (inferior frontal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)), which supports
   a pervasive deficit across emotion domains. Unexpectedly, the response
   in dorsal insula to fear, sadness, and pain was greater in psychopaths
   than non-psychopaths. Importantly, the orbitofrontal cortex and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), regions critically implicated in
   affective and motivated behaviors, were significantly less active in
   individuals with psychopathy during the perception of all four emotional
   expressions.}},

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the
   neural substrates of empathy, Theory of Mind (ToM), and self-other
   differentiation involved in the adaptive understanding of people's
   internal states. Three conditions were distinguished in both sad and
   neutral (no obvious emotion) contexts. The empathy condition involved
   imagining what another person is feeling while the more cognitively
   loaded ToM condition involved imagining what would make another person
   feel better. The self-reference condition required participants to
   imagine how they would feel in someone else's situation. Areas
   previously implicated in empathy, ToM, and self-other differentiation
   were identified within the different conditions, regardless of emotional
   context. Specifically, the frontal and temporal poles responded more
   strongly for ToM than for empathy. The self-reference condition was
   associated with stronger dorsolateral prefrontal response than the
   empathy condition, while the reverse comparison revealed a stronger role
   for right frontal pole. Activations in frontal pole and orbitofrontal
   cortex were shared between the three conditions. Contrasts of parameter
   estimates demonstrated modulation by emotional context. The findings of
   common and differential patterns of responding observed in prefrontal
   and temporal regions suggest that within the social cognition network
   empathy, ToM and self-other differentiation have distinct roles that are

Title = {{Lateral prefrontal cortex activity during cognitive control of emotion
   predicts response to social stress in schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Pages = {{43-53}},
Abstract = {{LPFC dysfunction is a well-established neural impairment in
   schizophrenia and is associated with worse symptoms. However, how LPFC
   activation influences symptoms is unclear. Previous findings in healthy
   individuals demonstrate that lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) activation
   during cognitive control of emotional information predicts mood and
   behavior in response to interpersonal conflict, thus impairments in
   these processes may contribute to symptom exacerbation in schizophrenia.
   We investigated whether schizophrenia participants show LPFC deficits
   during cognitive control of emotional information, and whether these
   LPFC deficits prospectively predict changes in mood and symptoms
   following real-world interpersonal conflict. During fMRI, 23 individuals
   with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 24 healthy controls
   completed the Multi-Source Interference Task superimposed on neutral and
   negative pictures. Afterwards, schizophrenia participants completed a
   21-day online daily-diary in which they rated the extent to which they
   experienced mood and schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms, as well as the
   occurrence and response to interpersonal conflict. Schizophrenia
   participants had lower dorsal LPFC activity (BA9) during cognitive
   control of task-irrelevant negative emotional information. Within
   schizophrenia participants, DLPFC activity during cognitive control of
   emotional information predicted changes in positive and negative mood on
   days following highly distressing interpersonal conflicts. Results have
   implications for understanding the specific role of LPFC in response to
   social stress in schizophrenia, and suggest that treatments targeting
   LPFC-mediated cognitive control of emotion could promote adaptive
   response to social stress in schizophrenia. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{The neurobiological underpinnings of effort-related monetary reward
   processing of gambling disorder have not been previously studied. To
   date neuroimaging studies lack in large sample sizes and as a
   consequence less attention has been given to brain reward processing
   that could potentially be attributed to comorbid conditions such as
   depressive mood state. We assessed monetary reward processing using an
   effort-dependent task during 3 tesla functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. We investigated a large sample of male, right-handed, slot
   machine-playing disordered gamblers (DGs; N = 80) as well as age- and
   smoking-matched male healthy controls (HCs; N = 89). Depressive symptoms
   were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). DGs and HCs
   were divided into subgroups ({''}high{''} and ``low{''}) based on their
   BDI scores. Effort-related monetary reward processing did not differ
   between the complete groups of HCs and DGs. Brain activation during
   receipt of monetary reward though revealed a significant Group x BDI
   interaction: DGs with higher BDI scores compared to DGs with lower BDI
   scores showed greater brain activity in the right insula cortex and
   dorsal striatum while no differences were observed for HCs with higher
   versus lower BDI scores. Our results suggest that effort related aspects
   of monetary motivation, i.e. when monetary output is tied to
   performance, are not altered in DG. Additionally, our findings
   strengthen the need for subgroup comparisons in future investigations of
   the disorder as part of a personalized medicine approach. (C) 2014 The

Pages = {{1-9}},
Abstract = {{Affect recognition deficits found in individuals with
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) across the lifespan may
   bias the development of cognitive control processes implicated in the
   pathophysiology of the disorder. This study aimed to determine the
   mechanism through which facial expressions influence cognitive control
   in young adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood. Fourteen probands with
   childhood ADHD and 14 comparison subjects with no history of ADHD were
   scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a
   face emotion go/no-go task. Event-related analyses contrasted activation
   and functional connectivity for cognitive control collapsed over face
   valence and tested for variations in activation for response execution
   and inhibition as a function of face valence. Probands with childhood
   ADHD made fewer correct responses and inhibitions overall than
   comparison subjects, but demonstrated comparable effects of face emotion
   on response execution and inhibition. The two groups showed similar
   frontotemporal activation for cognitive control collapsed across face
   valence, but differed in the functional connectivity of the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with fewer interactions with the
   subgenual cingulate cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, and putamen in
   probands than in comparison subjects. Further, valence-dependent
   activation for response execution was seen in the amygdala, ventral
   striatum, subgenual cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex in
   comparison subjects but not in probands. The findings point to
   functional anomalies in limbic networks for both the valence-dependent
   biasing of cognitive control and the valence-independent cognitive
   control of face emotion processing in probands with childhood ADHD. This
   limbic dysfunction could impact cognitive control in emotional contexts
   and may contribute to the social and emotional problems associated with
   ADHD. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{100-108}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Although social cognitive impairments are key determinants
   of functional outcome in schizophrenia their neural bases are poorly
   understood. This study investigated neural activity during imitation and
   observation of finger movements and facial expressions in schizophrenia,
   and their correlates with self-reported empathy.
   Methods: 23 schizophrenia outpatients and 23 healthy controls were
   studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they
   imitated, executed, or simply observed finger movements and facial
   emotional expressions. Between-group activation differences, as well as
   relationships between activation and self-reported empathy, were
   evaluated.
   Results: Both patients and controls similarly activated neural systems
   previously associated with these tasks. We found no significant
   between-group differences in task-related activations. There were,
   however, between-group differences in the correlation between
   self-reported empathy and right inferior frontal (pars opercularis)
   activity during observation of facial emotional expressions. As in
   previous studies, controls demonstrated a positive association between
   brain activity and empathy scores. In contrast, the pattern in the
   patient group reflected a negative association between brain activity
   and empathy.
   Conclusions: Although patients with schizophrenia demonstrated largely
   normal patterns of neural activation across the finger movement and
   facial expression tasks, they reported decreased self perceived empathy
   and failed to show the typical relationship between neural activity and
   self-reported empathy seen in controls. These findings suggest that
   patients show a disjunction between automatic neural responses to low
   level social cues and higher level, integrative social cognitive
   processes involved in self-perceived empathy. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Striatal connectivity changes following gambling wins and near-misses:
   Associations with gambling severity}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{232-239}},
Abstract = {{Frontostriatal circuitry is implicated in the cognitive distortions
   associated with gambling behaviour. `Near-miss' events, where
   unsuccessful outcomes are proximal to a jackpot win, recruit overlapping
   neural circuitry with actual monetary wins. Personal control over a
   gamble (e.g., via choice) is also known to increase confidence in one's
   chances of winning (the `illusion of control').
   Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we examined
   changes in functional connectivity as regular gamblers and non-gambling
   participants played a slot-machine game that delivered wins, near-misses
   and full-misses, and manipulated personal control. We focussed on
   connectivity with striatal seed regions, and associations with gambling
   severity, using voxel-wise regression.
   For the interaction term of near-misses (versus full-misses) by personal
   choice (participant-chosen versus computer-chosen), ventral striatal
   connectivity with the insula, bilaterally, was positively correlated
   with gambling severity. In addition, some effects for the contrast of
   wins compared to all non-wins were observed at an uncorrected (p < .001)
   threshold: there was an overall increase in connectivity between the
   striatal seeds and left orbitofrontal cortex and posterior insula, and a
   negative correlation for gambling severity with the connectivity between
   the right ventral striatal seed and left anterior cingulate cortex.
   These findings corroborate the `non-categorical' nature of reward
   processing in gambling: near-misses and full-misses are objectively
   identical outcomes that are processed differentially. Ventral striatal
   connectivity with the insula correlated positively with gambling
   severity in the illusion of control contrast, which could be a risk
   factor for the cognitive distortions and loss-chasing that are
   characteristic of problem gambling. (C) 2014 The Authors. The Authors.

Title = {{Dissecting psychiatric spectrum disorders by generative embedding}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{98-111}},
Abstract = {{This proof-of-concept study examines the feasibility of defining
   subgroups in psychiatric spectrum disorders by generative embedding,
   using dynamical system models which infer neuronal circuit mechanisms
   from neuroimaging data. To this end, we re-analysed an fMRI dataset of
   41 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 42 healthy controls
   performing a numerical n-back working-memory task. In our
   generative-embedding approach, we used parameter estimates from a
   dynamic causal model (DCM) of a visual-parietal-prefrontal network to
   define a model-based feature space for the subsequent application of
   supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. First, using a linear
   support vector machine for classification, we were able to predict
   individual diagnostic labels significantly more accurately (78\%) from
   DCM-based effective connectivity estimates than from functional
   connectivity between (62\%) or local activity within the same regions
   (55\%). Second, an unsupervised approach based on variational Bayesian
   Gaussian mixture modelling provided evidence for two clusters which
   mapped onto patients and controls with nearly the same accuracy (71\%)
   as the supervised approach. Finally, when restricting the analysis only
   to the patients, Gaussian mixture modelling suggested the existence of
   three patient subgroups, each of which was characterised by a different
   architecture of the visual-parietal-prefrontal working-memory network.
   Critically, even though this analysis did not have access to information
   about the patients' clinical symptoms, the three neurophysiologically
   defined subgroups mapped onto three clinically distinct subgroups,
   distinguished by significant differences in negative symptom severity,
   as assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). In
   summary, this study provides a concrete example of how psychiatric
   spectrum diseases may be split into subgroups that are defined in terms
   of neurophysiological mechanisms specified by a generative model of
   network dynamics such as DCM. The results corroborate our previous
   findings in stroke patients that generative embedding, compared to
   analyses of more conventional measures such as functional connectivity
   or regional activity, can significantly enhance both the
   interpretability and performance of computational approaches to clinical
   classification. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{The neural basis of theory of mind and its relationship to social
   functioning and social anhedonia in individuals with schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{154-163}},
Abstract = {{Theory of mind (ToM), the ability to attribute and reason about the
   mental states of others, is a strong determinant of social functioning
   among individuals with schizophrenia. Identifying the neural bases of
   ToM and their relationship to social functioning may elucidate
   functionally relevant neurobiological targets for intervention. ToM
   ability may additionally account for other social phenomena that affect
   social functioning, such as social anhedonia (SocAnh). Given recent
   research in schizophrenia demonstrating improved neural functioning in
   response to increased use of cognitive skills, it is possible that
   SocAnh, which decreases one's opportunity to engage in ToM, could
   compromise social functioning through its deleterious effect on
   ToM-related neural circuitry. Here, twenty individuals with
   schizophrenia and 18 healthy controls underwent fMRI while performing
   the False-Belief Task. Aspects of social functioning were assessed using
   multiple methods including self-report (Interpersonal Reactivity Index,
   Social Adjustment Scale), clinician-ratings (Global Functioning Social
   Scale), and performance-based tasks (MSCEIT-Managing Emotions). SocAnh
   was measured with the Revised Social Anhedonia Scale. Region-of-interest
   and whole-brain analyses revealed reduced recruitment of medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC) for ToM in individuals with schizophrenia.
   Across all participants, activity in this region correlated with most
   social variables. Mediation analysis revealed that neural activity for
   ToM in MPFC accounted for the relationship between SocAnh and social
   functioning. These findings demonstrate that reduced recruitment of MPFC
   for ToM is an important neurobiological determinant of social
   functioning. Furthermore, SocAhn may affect social functioning through
   its impact on ToM-related neural circuitry. Together, these findings
   suggest ToM ability as an important locus for intervention. (C) 2013 The

Title = {{Increased BOLD signal in the fusiform gyrus during implicit emotion
   processing in anorexia nervosa}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{266-273}},
Abstract = {{Background: The behavioural literature in anorexia nervosa (AN) has
   suggested impairments in psychosocial functioning and studies using
   facial expression processing tasks (FEPT) have reported poorer
   recognition and slower identification of emotions.
   Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used alongside
   a FEPT, depicting neutral, mildly happy and happy faces, to examine the
   neural correlates of implicit emotion processing in AN. Participants
   were instructed to specify the gender of the faces. Levels of
   depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and eating disorder
   behaviour were obtained and principal component analysis (PCA) was
   performed to acquire uncorrelated variables.
   Results: fMRI analysis revealed a greater blood-oxygenation level
   dependent (BOLD) response in AN in the right fusiform gyrus to all
   facial expressions. This response showed a linear increase with the
   happiness of the facial expression and was found to be stronger in those
   not taking medication. PCA analysis revealed a single component
   indicating a greater level of general clinical symptoms.
   Conclusion: Neuroimaging findings would suggest that alterations in
   implicit emotion processing in AN occur during early perceptual
   processing of social signals and illustrate greater engagement on the
   FEPT. The lack of separate components using PCA suggests that the
   questionnaires used might not be suited as predictive measures. (C) 2013

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{374-382}},
Abstract = {{The development of language, social interaction and communicative skills
   is remarkably different in the child with autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD). Atypical brain connectivity has frequently been reported in this
   patient population. However, the neural correlates underlying their
   disrupted language development and functioning are still poorly
   understood. Using resting state fMRI, we investigated the functional
   connectivity properties of the language network in a group of ASD
   patients with clear comorbid language impairment (ASD-LI; N = 19) and
   compared them to the language related connectivity properties of 23
   age-matched typically developing children. A verb generation task was
   used to determine language components commonly active in both groups.
   Eight joint language components were identified and subsequently used as
   seeds in a resting state analysis. Interestingly, both the interregional
   and the seed-based whole brain connectivity analysis showed preserved
   connectivity between the classical intrahemispheric language centers,
   Wernicke's and Broca's areas. In contrast however, a marked loss of
   functional connectivity was found between the right cerebellar region
   and the supratentorial regulatory language areas. Also, the connectivity
   between the interhemispheric Broca regions and modulatory control
   dorsolateral prefrontal region was found to be decreased. This
   disruption of normal modulatory control and automation function by the
   cerebellum may underlie the abnormal language function in children with
   ASD-LI. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Enhanced subgenual cingulate response to altruistic decisions in
   remitted major depressive disorder}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{701-710}},
Abstract = {{Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with
   functional abnormalities in fronto-mesolimbic networks contributing to
   decision-making, affective and reward processing impairments. Such
   functional disturbances may underlie a tendency for enhanced altruism
   driven by empathy-based guilt observed in some patients. However,
   despite the relevance of altruistic decisions to understanding
   vulnerability, as well as everyday psychosocial functioning, in MDD,
   their functional neuroanatomy is unknown.
   Methods: Using a charitable donations experiment with fMRI, we compared
   14 medication-free participants with fully remitted MDD and 15
   demographically-matched control participants without MDD.
   Results: Compared with the control group, the remitted MDD group
   exhibited enhanced BOLD response in a septal/subgenual cingulate cortex
   (sgACC) region for charitable donation relative to receiving simple
   rewards and higher striatum activation for both charitable donation and
   simple reward relative to a low level baseline. The groups did not
   differ in demographics, frequency of donations or response times,
   demonstrating only a difference in neural architecture.
   Conclusions: We showed that altruistic decisions probe residual sgACC
   hypersensitivity in MDD even after symptoms are fully remitted. The
   sgACC has previously been shown to be associated with guilt which
   promotes altruistic decisions. In contrast, the striatum showed common
   activation to both simple and altruistic rewards and could be involved
   in the so-called ``warm glow{''} of donation. Enhanced neural response
   in the depression group, in areas previously linked to altruistic
   decisions, supports the hypothesis of a possible association between
   hyper-altruism and depression vulnerability, as shown by recent
   epidemiological studies. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Self-face recognition is one of the most distinctive
   features in human beings. Disturbances of self-face recognition in
   people with schizophrenia may reflect the underlying neurobiological and
   psychological factors of the disorder. Our aim was to establish whether
   differences in preference for the similarity to the true self-face
   appearance could be found between patients with schizophrenia and a
   matched control group.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 14 right-handed patients with schizophrenia and 14
   control subjects were enrolled. Subjects were photographed, the pictures
   were converted to black and white, halved vertically, and four faces
   were used: normal face (NF), mirrored face (MF), face composed from two
   left halves of the face (LLF) and from two right halves of face (RRF).
   Four pairs of faces were exposed to subjects and they chose which they
   felt was closest to their true appearance.
   RESULTS: No significant differences for preference were found between
   the patients and control subjects. Post-hoc analysis of the pooled
   groups showed a significant difference for preference of NF vs. RRF (20
   vs. 8 probands; chi(2)=5.14, df=1, p<0.05). 18 subjects from the two
   groups did not change the right-left visual field focus through all four
   exposures.
   CONCLUSIONS: The absence of significant differences for preference for
   true self-image between schizophrenia patients and control subjects
   might show that self-face recognition is of little importance from the
   evolutionary perspective. Additional measurements such as eye-tracking
   control and random multiple projections of the same pairs of faces would
   contribute to a more thorough interpretation of the findings in future
   studies of similar design.}},

   drama improvisation. Participants viewed negative, positive, and neutral
   pictures while attempting to decrease, increase, or not modulate their
   emotional reactions. Subjective reactions were assessed via on-line
   ratings. After the intervention, the training group showed less cerebral
   activity as compared to the control group within different regions
   related to emotional regulation and attention including prefrontal
   regions and the bilateral inferior parietal lobule, the right precentral

Abstract = {{The main requirement for Gardenfors's ``meeting of the minds{''} is that
   speakers' mental spaces are sufficiently similar. If this requirement is
   not met, communication cannot take place. This meeting of the minds is
   not always easy to achieve even among interlocutors who share a mother
   tongue, and it becomes even more complicated when an interlocutor is
   speaking in his/her second language. The reason for this is that the
   ``geometries of meaning{''} of different languages frequently do not
   match. In this paper the focus is on what happens when two languages,
   i.e. Croatian and English, conceptualize space in different ways, that
   is, when they have different geometries of space. We first look at the
   findings of neuroscience, psycholinguistics and cognitive linguistics.
   Next, we compare Croatian and English and analyze what consequenes these
   differences in the conceptualization of space have for Croatians as L2
   speakers of English when it comes to English path verbs. Finally, we
   look at what crosslinguistic differences between Croatian and English
   can reveal about the English path verbs.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOPATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{394-407}},
Abstract = {{Background/Aims: Several components of social cognition are compromised
   in schizophrenia (SCZ) from the early stage of the illness. In this
   study we first investigated whether mirror neuron-driven embodied
   simulation (mnES) is altered in first-episode SCZ. Second, we tested
   whether emotional cues impact on the mnES in SCZ patients. Methods:
   Twenty-two SCZ patients and 22 healthy controls (HCs) observed
   goal-related actions in either a neutral or emotional context during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Results: Observation of
   neutral action elicited a lower activity in the frontoparietal network
   in SCZ patients, as compared to HCs. Particularly, activation in the
   left inferior parietal lobule in response to the same condition
   negatively correlated with patients' self-experience disturbances.
   Moreover, observation of an action performed by an angry agent produced
   poorer neural activity in the right anterior insula in SCZ patients as
   compared to HCs. This difference was mostly due to the negative
   beta-values shown by SCZ patients, which positively correlated with
   their empathy scores. No differences were found contingent upon the
   observation of an action performed by a happy agent. Conclusion: Our
   results show that emotional cues allow SCZ patients to partially recover
   mnES. However, their understanding of the emotional components of the
   actions of others will likely remain deficient. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG,

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{2221-2230}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patients with schizophrenia show disturbances in both visual
   perception and social cognition. Perception of biological motion (BM) is
   a higher-level visual process, and is known to be associated with social
   cognition. BM induces activation in the ``social brain network{''},
   including the superior temporal sulcus (STS). Although deficits in the
   detection of BM and atypical activation in the STS have been reported in
   patients with schizophrenia, it remains unclear whether other nodes of
   the ``social brain network{''} are also atypical in patients with
   schizophrenia.
   Purpose: We aimed to explore whether brain regions other than STS were
   involved during BM perception in patients with schizophrenia, using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Methods and patients: Seventeen patients with schizophrenia, and 17
   age-and sex-matched healthy controls, underwent fMRI scanning during a
   one-back visual task, containing three experimental conditions: (1) BM,
   (2) scrambled motion (SM), and (3) static condition. We used one-sample
   t-tests to examine neural responses selective to BM versus SM within
   each group, and two-sample t-tests to directly compare neural patterns
   to BM versus SM in schizophrenics versus controls.
   Results: We found significant activation in the STS region when BM was
   contrasted with SM in both groups, with no significant difference
   between groups. On the contrary, significant activation in the medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ)
   was found only in the control group. When we directly compared the two
   groups, the healthy controls showed significant greater activation in
   left MPFC and TPJ to BM versus SM than patients with schizophrenia.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that patients with schizophrenia show
   normal activation to biologically and socially relevant motion stimuli
   in the STS, but atypical activation in other regions of the social brain
   network, specifically MPFC and TPJ. Moreover, these results were not due
   to atypical processing of motion, suggesting that patients with
   schizophrenia lack in the recruitment of neural circuits needed for the
   visual perception of social cognition.}},

Title = {{The role of the dominant versus the non-dominant hemisphere: An fMRI
   study of Aphasia recovery following stroke}},
Journal = {{APHASIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1426-1447}},
Abstract = {{Background: Speech production is one of the most frequently affected
   cognitive functions following stroke; however, the neural mechanisms
   underlying the recovery of speech function are still incompletely
   understood.
   Aims: The current study aims to address the differential contributions
   of the dominant and non-dominant hemispheres in recovery from aphasia
   following stroke by comparing data from four stroke patients and 12
   control participants to assess the patterns of activation during speech
   production tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   scanning.
   Methods \& Procedures: Four chronic stroke patients (three
   left-hemisphere lesion and one right-hemisphere lesion) diagnosed with
   Broca's aphasia at the acute phase, but now recovered to near normal
   speech ability, were tested on speech production tasks (phonemic
   fluency, categorical fluency and picture naming) whilst undergoing fMRI.
   These patients were compared with 12 healthy controls undergoing the
   same procedure.
   Outcomes \& Results: Individual subject analysis showed activation peaks
   in perilesional areas in three out of four patients. This included one
   patient with right-hemisphere lesion, who also showed predominant
   perilesional activation. Group analysis of control participants showed
   predominately left-hemisphere activation, but not exclusively so.
   Laterality indexes were calculated and showed predominant
   left-hemisphere lateralisation in the control group (LI = 0.4). Three
   out of the four patients showed speech lateralised to the same
   hemisphere as their lesion and the fourth patient showed speech
   lateralised to the opposite hemisphere to their lesion. Different speech
   production tasks resulted in varying lateralisation indices (LIs) within
   participants.
   Conclusions: The data suggest that perilesional areas support recovery
   of speech in the chronic phase post-stroke regardless of the site of the
   lesion. The study has implications for the understanding of functional
   recovery as well as for the paradigms used in fMRI to localise speech
   production areas. Specifically, a variety of speech tasks are required
   to elicit activation that is representative of the range of cortical
   involvement in speech in healthy adults and that also allows for
   accurate reporting of the extent of recovery experienced in patients.}},

Title = {{Brain activation associated with motor imagery of coordination exercises

Abstract = {{The purposes of the present study were: (1) to investigate the brain
   activation associated with coordination exercises done by one person and
   those by two persons and (2) to examine the interrelationships between
   the brain activation and social abilities. We were interested in testing
   the hypothesis that viewing two-person coordination exercises evokes
   more sophisticated brain activation than viewing one-person coordination
   exercises. Thirty Japanese college students served as subjects. There
   were two sessions in this study: the functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) session and the social ability session. In the fMRI
   session, the subjects were instructed to imagine they were performing
   coordination exercises. Also, we examined the social abilities from the
   viewpoint of empathising. Empathising was measured by self-reports on
   the Systemising, Empathy and Autism Spectrum Quotients (SQ, EQ and AQ).
   Regarding brain activation, blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
   activation was significant in specific areas such as the left cuneus
   (Brodmann area: BA 17) when the subjects imagined they were performing
   exercises involving two persons, as compared with the cases when they
   imagined they were performing exercises involving only one person. The
   fMRI results showed that exercises done by two persons require more
   sophisticated communication than those done by one person. Furthermore,
   the results of this study suggested that those with more autistic traits
   may undergo difficulties in the exercises done by two persons,
   especially in the case of playing a role as a follower.}},

   obstructive sleep apnea: a resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging study}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{1819-1826}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that obstructive sleep
   apnea (OSA) is associated with abnormal brain structural deficits.
   However, little is known about the changes in local synchronization of
   spontaneous activity in patients with OSA. The primary aim of the
   present study was to investigate spontaneous brain activity in patients
   with OSA compared with good sleepers (GSs) using regional homogeneity
   (ReHo) analysis based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI).
   Methods: Twenty-five untreated male patients with severe OSA and 25 male
   GSs matched for age and years of education were included in this study.
   The ReHo method was calculated to assess the strength of local signal
   synchrony and was compared between the two groups. The observed mean
   ReHo values were entered into Statistical Package for the Social
   Sciences software to assess their correlation with behavioral
   performance.
   Results: Compared with GSs, patients with OSA showed significantly lower
   ReHo in the right medial frontal gyrus (BA11), right superior frontal
   gyrus (BA10), right cluster of the precuneus and angular gyrus (BA39),
   and left superior parietal lobule (BA7), and higher ReHo in the right
   posterior lobe of the cerebellum, right cingulate gyrus (BA23), and
   bilateral cluster covering the lentiform nucleus, putamen, and insula
   (BA13). The lower mean ReHo value in the right cluster of the precuneus
   and angular gyrus had a significant negative correlation with sleep time
   (r=-0.430, P=0.032), and higher ReHo in the right posterior lobe of the
   cerebellum showed a significant positive correlation with stage 3 sleep
   (r=0.458, P=0.021) and in the right cingulate gyrus showed a significant
   positive correlation with percent rapid eye movement sleep (r=0.405,
   P=0.045).
   Conclusion: Patients with OSA showed significant regional spontaneous
   activity deficits in default mode network areas. The ReHo method is a
   useful noninvasive imaging tool for detection of early changes in
   cerebral ReHo in patients with OSA.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined neural correlates of empathy in adolescence while
   observing harmful acts. A total of 32 participants (aged 12-19 years)
   viewed pictures depicting negative (offenders inflicting intentional
   harm) and positive (friends socializing) social situations. After
   viewing each picture, participants could allocate hypothetical points to
   either the offender or the victim in a dictator game. Behaviorally,
   participants of all ages acted prosocially towards victims, fairly
   towards positive individuals and punishingly towards offenders. Brain
   imaging analyses showed that viewing negative situations was associated
   with more activation in the bilateral intraparietal lobule and the
   superior temporal sulcus (STS), whereas viewing positive situations was
   associated with more medial prefrontal cortex and left temporal parietal
   junction activity. Analyses testing for associations between brain
   activity and self-reported empathy showed that the STS was correlated
   negatively with reports of understanding others' distress and the
   willingness to help others. Together, the findings suggest that
   adolescents show similar prosocial behavior, as previously reported in
   adults with greater STS activity, when observing negative social acts
   that is modulated by an individual's empathy for others. (C) 2014 S.

Abstract = {{Throughout adolescence, progress in the understanding of the moral
   domain as well as changes in moral behavior is observable. We tested 16
   adolescents (14-16 years of age) and 16 healthy adults (22-31 years of
   age) on the developmental changes in everyday moral decision making
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using verbal stories
   describing everyday moral conflict situations, subjects had to decide
   between a moral standard or a personal desire. In the moral conflict
   situations, adolescents not only chose significantly more often the
   hedonistic alternative than adults, but they also reported higher
   certainty ratings. Contrasted with everyday social conflict situations
   that required a decision between a social-oriented behavior and a
   personal need, moral conflict situations induced an activity increase in
   frontal areas, the middle temporal gyrus, the thalamus, and the
   parahippocampal gyrus in adolescents compared to adults. Moreover, a
   closer look at the moral conflict situations revealed that adolescents
   showed more activity than adults in brain areas that are also centrally
   involved in theory of mind (ToM) during morally oriented decisions in
   contrast to personal-oriented decisions. This indicated that the
   development of moral reasoning may be strongly correlated with the
   development of ToM reasoning.}},

Abstract = {{Self-disclosure is an important performance in human social

   physical and mental health if he is prone to self-disclosure under

   self-disclosure measured by the Jourard Self-disclosure Questionnaire in
   a large sample of college students. Results showed that individual
   self-disclosure was significantly and positively associated with rGMV of
   the left postcentral gyrus, which might be related to strengthen
   individual's ability of body feeling; while self-disclosure was
   significantly and negatively associated with rGMV of the right
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which might be involved in increased
   positive emotion experience seeking (intrinsically rewarding). In
   addition, individual self-disclosure was also associated with smaller
   rWMV in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL). These findings
   suggested a biological basis for individual self-disclosure, distributed

Title = {{Belief in a just world is associated with activity in insula and

   violations}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{514-521}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies identified a network of brain regions involved in the
   perception of norm violations, including insula, anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), and right temporoparietal junction area (RTPJ).
   Activations in these regions are suggested to reflect the perception of
   norm violations and unfairness. The current study aimed to test this
   hypothesis by exploring whether a personal disposition to perceive the
   world as being just is related to neural responses to moral evaluations.
   The just-world-hypothesis describes a cognitive bias to believe in a
   just world in which everyone gets what he or she deserves and deserves
   what he or she gets. Since it has been demonstrated that ACC, RTPJ, and
   insula are involved in the perception of unfairness, we hypothesized
   that individual differences in the belief in a just world are reflected
   by different activations of these brain areas. Participants were
   confronted with scenarios describing norm-violating or -confirming
   behavior. FMRI results revealed an activation of dorsal ACC, RTPJ, and
   insula when perceiving norm violations, but only activity in
   insula/somatosensory cortex correlated with the belief in a just world.
   Thus, our results suggest a role for insula/somatosensory cortex for the
   belief in a just world.}},

   during fear conditioning before (t1) and after CBT (t2).
   Quality-controlled fMRI data from 42 patients and 42 healthy subjects
   (HS) were obtained. Patients were randomized to two variants of CBT (T+,
   n = 22, and T, n = 20). Results: The interaction of diagnosis (PD/AG,
   HS), treatment group (T+, T), time point (t1, t2) and stimulus type
   (conditioned stimulus: yes, no) revealed activation in the left
   hippocampus and the occipitotemporal cortex. The T+ group demonstrated
   increased activation of the hippocampus at t2 (t2 > t1), which was
   positively correlated with treatment outcome, and a decreased
   connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left
   hippocampus across time (t1 > t2). Conclusion: After T+ exposure,
   contingency-encoding processes related to the posterior hippocampus are
   augmented and more de-coupled from processes of the left inferior
   frontal gyrus, previously shown to be dysfunctionally activated in
   PD/AG. Linking single procedural variants to neural substrates offers
   the potential to inform about the optimization of targeted
   psychotherapeutic interventions. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Pages = {{597-614}},
Abstract = {{Previous research shows that when people judge moral acceptability of
   others' harmful behaviour, they not only take into account information
   about the consequences of the act but also an actor's belief while
   carrying out the act. A two-process model has been proposed to account
   for this pattern of moral judgements and posits: (1) a causal process
   that detects the presence of a harmful outcome and is motivated by
   empathic aversion stemming from victim suffering; (2) a mental
   state-based process that attributes beliefs, desires, intentions, etc.
   to the agent in question and is motivated by imagining personally
   carrying out harmful actions. One prediction of this model would be that
   personality traits associated with empathy deficits would find
   accidental harms more acceptable not because they focus on innocent
   intentions but because they have reduced concern for the victim's
   well-being. In this study, we show that one such personality trait, viz.
   alexithymia, indeed exhibits the predicted pattern and this increased
   acceptability of accidental harm in alexithymia is mediated by reduced
   dispositional empathic concern. Results attest to the validity of
   two-process model of intent-based moral judgements and emphasise key
   role affective empathy plays in harm-based moral judgements.}},

Abstract = {{Given the importance and the burden of pathological gambling (PG) and
   its effect on gamblers and their relatives, better comprehension of the
   phenomena involved in its development and persistence is needed. The
   present paper describes the previous 5 years of studies on decision
   making and magnetic resonance imaging in people with PG. Twenty-six
   studies (456 participants with PG) were included. Perseveration in
   monetary tasks was associated with PG despite intact executive planning
   abilities. PG was linked with impairment in decision making under
   uncertainty. Hyperactivation of the reward pathway was repeatedly found.
   PG was also linked with neural hyperactivation of the reward pathway
   during high-risk conditions and hypoactivation in low-risk conditions.
   Furthermore, in PG, near misses activated the brain regions related to
   wins. Numerous similarities were found between PG and substance use
   disorders, highlighting the scientific basis of the recent
   reclassification of PG in the spectrum of addictive disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-nine patients with Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS), 26

   individuals matched in age and social environment (patients' relatives)
   were presented with 80 short sentences half of which were factually

   on the basis of repeated neurological examinations as well as the
   standardized assessment using a Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R).
   fMRI blood oxygen level dependent signal was recorded in an
   event-related design time-locked to the end word of the sentences. In
   the contrast ``incorrect-minus-correct{''} significant activations in
   the relevant brain regions were obtained in 17 (81\%) controls and in 16
   (29\%) patients. Among patients, the 16 responders had a significantly
   longer time since accident than the 39 non-responders. Responders and
   non-responders did not differ in terms of the diagnosis (UWS vs. MCS),
   age, CRS-R score, or the degree of brain atrophy. The data concur with
   the results of several earlier studies on UWS/MCS patients, with the
   difference that the critical stimuli in those studies were semantically
   incongruent or ambiguous propositions rather than factually false ones
   in the present experiment. The hypothesis is discussed that the
   differential response of brain language areas to factually correct and
   incorrect statements does not require conscious perception of the
   statements.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Across many research domains, evidence for complicated grief
   as a distinct psychopathology continues to grow. Previous research from
   neuropsychology has shown an increased attentional bias to emotionally
   relevant stimuli in those suffering from complicated grief. This study
   furthers our understanding of the characteristics that distinguish
   complicated grief. We expand on previous research by (a) testing older
   adults, (b) excluding those with comorbid major depressive disorder, (c)
   using participant-chosen grief-related stimuli, and (d) using a married,
   nonbereaved control group.
   Methods. We recruited 76 older adults in 3 groups: spousally bereaved
   with complicated grief, spousally bereaved with noncomplicated grief,
   and nonbereaved controls. Performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting
   Task, Digit Span Backwards, and the emotional counting Stroop was
   examined.
   Results. Results indicate longer reaction time across 3 blocks of
   grief-related words in the complicated grief group but no difference
   across 3 blocks of the neutral words. The 3 groups performed comparably
   on the other neurocognitive tasks, indicating no cognitive differences
   in working memory or set shifting between groups. Furthermore, these
   effects of complicated grief generalize to older adults and appear
   independent of major depression.
   Discussion. Complicated grief has cognitive interference as a
   neuropsychological component highlighting it as distinct from
   noncomplicated grief.}},

Pages = {{326-331}},
Abstract = {{Attachment to one's kin as an in-group emerges from a fundamental human
   motivation and is vital for human survival. Despite important recent
   advances in the field of social neuroscience, the neural mechanisms
   underlying family-related in-group perception remain obscure. To examine
   the neural basis of perceiving family-related in-group boundaries in
   response to written kinship scenarios, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging in 27 healthy adults and obtained self-report ratings
   of family-related entitativity, which measures to what degree
   participants perceive their family as a coherent and distinct group in
   society. We expected that activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex and
   septo-hypothalamic region would track individual differences in
   entitativity. Perceiving one's family as a distinct and cohesive group
   (high entitativity) was associated with increased subgenual cortex
   response to kinship scenarios. The subgenual cingulate cortex may
   represent a key link between kin-related emotional attachment and group
   perception, providing a neurobiological basis for group belongingness.}},

Abstract = {{Conscious thought involves an interpretive inner monologue pertaining to
   our waking experiences. Previous studies focused on the mechanisms that
   allow us to remember externally presented stimuli, but the
   neurobiological basis of the ability to remember one's internal
   mentations remains unknown. In order to investigate this question, we
   presented participants with sentences and scanned their neural activity
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they incidentally
   produced spontaneous internal mentations. After the scan, we presented
   the sentences again and asked participants to describe the specific
   thoughts they had during the initial presentation of each sentence. We
   categorized experimental trials for each participant according to
   whether they resulted in subsequently reported internal mentations or
   not. The results show that activation within classic language processing
   areas was associated with participants' ability to recollect their
   thoughts. Activation within mostly right lateralized and medial
   ``default-mode network{''} regions was associated with not reporting
   such thoughts.}},

Title = {{Supernatural believers attribute more intentions to random movement than
   skeptics: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{400-411}},
Abstract = {{A host of research has attempted to explain why some believe in the
   supernatural and some do not. One suggested explanation for commonly
   held supernatural beliefs is that they are a by-product of theory of
   mind (ToM) processing. However, this does not explain why skeptics with
   intact ToM processes do not believe. We employed fMRI to investigate
   activation differences in ToM-related brain circuitries between
   supernatural believers (N = 12) and skeptics (N = 11) while they watched
   2D animations of geometric objects moving intentionally or randomly and
   rated the intentionality of the animations. The ToM-related circuitries
   in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were localized by contrasting
   intention-rating-related and control-rating-related brain activation.
   Compared with the skeptics, the supernatural believers rated the random
   movements as more intentional and had stronger activation of the
   ToM-related circuitries during the animation with random movement. The
   strength of the ToM-related activation covaried with the intentionality
   ratings. These findings provide evidence that differences in ToM-related
   activations are associated with supernatural believers' tendency to
   interpret random phenomena in mental terms. Thus, differences in ToM
   processing may contribute to differences between believing and
   unbelieving.}},

   schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{412-423}},
Abstract = {{Patients with schizophrenia often show abnormal social interactions,
   which may explain their social exclusion behaviors. This study aimed to
   elucidate patients' brain responses to social rejection in an
   interactive situation. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia and 16
   healthy controls participated in the functional magnetic resonance
   imaging experiment with the virtual handshake task, in which socially
   interacting contents such as acceptance and refusal of handshaking were
   implemented. Responses to the refusal versus acceptance conditions were
   evaluated and compared between the two groups. Controls revealed higher
   activity in the refusal condition compared to the acceptance condition
   in the right superior temporal sulcus, whereas patients showed higher
   activity in the prefrontal regions, including the frontopolar cortex. In
   patients, contrast activities of the right superior temporal sulcus were
   inversely correlated with the severity of schizophrenic symptoms,
   whereas contrast activities of the left frontopolar cortex were
   positively correlated with the current anxiety scores. The superior
   temporal sulcus hypoactivity and frontopolar hyperactivity of patients
   with schizophrenia in social rejection situations may suggest the
   presence of mentalizing deficits in negative social situations and
   inefficient processes of socially aberrant stimuli, respectively. These
   abnormalities may be one of the neural bases of distorted or paranoid
   beliefs in schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Emotional contagion for pain is intact in autism spectrum disorders}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Perceiving others in pain generally leads to empathic concern,
   consisting of both emotional and cognitive processes. Empathy deficits
   have been considered as an element contributing to social difficulties
   in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here, we used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and short video clips of facial
   expressions of people experiencing pain to examine the neural substrates
   underlying the spontaneous empathic response to pain in autism.
   Thirty-eight adolescents and adults of normal intelligence diagnosed
   with ASD and 35 matched controls participated in the study. In contrast
   to general assumptions, we found no significant differences in brain
   activation between ASD individuals and controls during the perception of
   pain experienced by others. Both groups showed similar levels of
   activation in areas associated with pain sharing, evidencing the
   presence of emotional empathy and emotional contagion in participants
   with autism as well as in controls. Differences between groups could be
   observed at a more liberal statistical threshold, and revealed increased
   activations in areas involved in cognitive reappraisal in ASD
   participants compared with controls. Scores of emotional empathy were
   positively correlated with brain activation in areas involved in
   embodiment of pain in ASD group only. Our findings show that simulation
   mechanisms involved in emotional empathy are preserved in
   high-functioning individuals with autism, and suggest that increased
   reappraisal may have a role in their apparent lack of caring behavior.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{14-19}},
Abstract = {{The topic of social cognition has attracted considerable interest in
   schizophrenia over the last several years. This construct generally
   refers to the detection, processing, and utilization of social
   information and, within the field of schizophrenia, includes several
   skills such as recognizing emotion, understanding the thoughts and
   intentions of others, and interpreting social cues. Individuals with
   schizophrenia show significant impairments in social cognition, and
   these impairments are strongly related to functional outcome. Treating
   social cognition yields significant improvements in real-world outcomes,
   including social functioning and social skill. Importantly, social
   cognitive abilities are linked to specific neural circuits that have
   been shown to be abnormal in individuals with schizophrenia.
   Investigations of these neural networks in patients have also
   demonstrated that brain activation is significantly correlated with
   social functioning, which suggests that abnormal activation in social
   cognitive networks may serve as a mechanism for social dysfunction in
   schizophrenia. Among the many challenges in this area is the issue of
   measurement. There is disagreement about which tasks best measure social
   cognition and many existing measures show poor psychometric properties.
   A recent project, called the Social Cognition Psychometric Evaluation (
   SCOPE) study, aims to address these problems by providing the field with
   a well-validated battery of social cognitive tasks that can be used in
   treatment outcome trials. Research is honing in on the potential
   mechanisms of social cognitive impairment in patients, and with improved
   measurement, there is promise for optimizing behavioral and
   pharmacologic interventions and remediation strategies.}},

Title = {{The 5\% difference: early sensory processing predicts sarcasm perception

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-36}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background. Intact sarcasm perception is a crucial component of social
   cognition and mentalizing (the ability to understand the mental state of
   oneself and others). In sarcasm, tone of voice is used to negate the
   literal meaning of an utterance. In particular, changes in pitch are
   used to distinguish between sincere and sarcastic utterances.
   Schizophrenia patients show well-replicated deficits in auditory
   function and functional connectivity (FC) within and between auditory
   cortical regions. In this study we investigated the contributions of
   auditory deficits to sarcasm perception in schizophrenia.
   Method. Auditory measures including pitch processing, auditory emotion
   recognition (AER) and sarcasm detection were obtained from 76 patients
   with schizophrenia/schizo-affective disorder and 72 controls.
   Resting-state FC (rsFC) was obtained from a subsample and was analyzed
   using seeds placed in both auditory cortex and meta-analysis-defined
   core-mentalizing regions relative to auditory performance.
   Results. Patients showed large effect-size deficits across auditory
   measures. Sarcasm deficits correlated significantly with general
   functioning and impaired pitch processing both across groups and within
   the patient group alone. Patients also showed reduced sensitivity to
   alterations in mean pitch and variability. For patients, sarcasm
   discrimination correlated exclusively with the level of rsFC within
   primary auditory regions whereas for controls, correlations were
   observed exclusively within core-mentalizing regions (the right
   posterior superior temporal gyrus, anterior superior temporal sulcus and
   insula, and left posterior medial temporal gyrus).
   Conclusions. These findings confirm the contribution of auditory
   deficits to theory of mind (ToM) impairments in schizophrenia, and
   demonstrate that FC within auditory, but not core-mentalizing, regions
   is rate limiting with respect to sarcasm detection in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Emotional dysregulation is becoming increasingly recognized
   as an important feature of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
   (ADHD). In this study, two experiments were conducted investigating the
   neural response to either verbally instructed fear (IF) or uninstructed
   (classically conditioned) fear (UF) using the skin conductance response
   (SCR) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Method. In the conditioning phase of the UF experiment (17 ADHD and 17
   healthy controls), subjects experienced an unconditioned stimulus (UCS,
   unpleasant electrodermal stimulation) paired with a former neutral
   conditioned stimulus (CS+), whereas a control stimulus (CS-) was never
   paired with the UCS. In the subsequent test phase, only the CS+ and the
   CS-were presented. In the IF experiment (13 ADHD and 17 healthy
   controls), subjects were only told that an independently experienced UCS
   might occur together with the CS+ but not the CS- during testing. No UCS
   was presented.
   Results. Groups did not detectably differ in SCR or neural responses to
   UF. In IF, ADHD patients showed a trend-line decreased SCR and
   significantly decreased activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex (dACC), a region prominently involved in fear responding, to the
   CS+. This was accompanied by higher amygdala activation to the CS-.
   Conclusions. During IF, ADHD patients showed deficits in regions
   centrally involved in fear learning and expression in terms of
   diminished CS+-related dACC and increased CS--related amygdala signals.
   This suggests an impaired processing of verbally transmitted aversive
   information, which is central for conveying fear information in social
   contexts. This result extends the growing literature on emotional
   alterations in ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Children with conduct problems (CP) are a heterogeneous
   group. Those with high levels of callous-unemotional traits (CP/HCU)
   appear emotionally under-reactive at behavioural and neural levels
   whereas those with low levels of CU traits (CP/LCU) appear emotionally
   over-reactive, compared with typically developing (TD) controls.
   Investigating the degree to which these patterns of emotional reactivity
   are malleable may have important translational implications. Instructing
   participants with CP/HCU to focus on the eyes of fearful faces (i.e. the
   most salient feature) can ameliorate their fear-recognition deficits,
   but it is unknown whether this is mediated by amygdala response. It is
   also unknown whether focusing on fearful eyes is associated with
   increased amygdala reactivity in CP/LCU.
   Method. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure
   neural responses to fearful and calm faces in children with CP/HCU,
   CP/LCU and TD controls (n = 17 per group). On half of trials
   participants looked for a blue dot anywhere within target faces; on the
   other half, participants were directed to focus on the eye region.
   Results. Reaction time (RT) data showed that CP/LCU were selectively
   slowed in the fear/eyes condition. For the same condition, CP/LCU also
   showed increased amygdala and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex
   (sgACC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) responses compared with TD controls.
   RT and amygdala response to fear/eyes were correlated in CP/LCU only. No
   effects of focusing on the eye region were observed in CP/HCU.
   Conclusions. These data extend the evidence base suggesting that CU
   traits index meaningful heterogeneity in conduct problems. Focusing on
   regulating reactive emotional responses may be a fruitful strategy for
   children with CP/LCU.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathy is a disorder characterized by reduced empathy, shallow
   affect and behaviors that cause victims distress, like threats, bullying
   and violence. Neuroimaging research in both institutionalized and
   community samples implicates amygdala dysfunction in the etiology of
   psychopathic traits. Reduced amygdala responsiveness may disrupt
   processing of fear-relevant stimuli like fearful facial expressions. The
   present study links amygdala dysfunction in response to fear-relevant
   stimuli to the willingness of individuals with psychopathic traits to
   cause fear in other people. Thirty-three healthy adult participants
   varying in psychopathic traits underwent whole-brain fMRI scanning while
   they viewed statements that selectively evoke anger, disgust, fear,
   happiness or sadness. During scanning, participants judged whether it is
   morally acceptable to make each statement to another person. Psychopathy
   was associated with reduced activity in right amygdala during judgments
   of fear-evoking statements and with more lenient moral judgments about
   causing fear. No group differences in amygdala function or moral
   judgments emerged for other emotion categories. Psychopathy was also
   associated with increased activity in middle frontal gyrus (BA 10)
   during the task. These results implicate amygdala dysfunction in
   impaired judgments about causing distress in psychopathy and suggest
   that atypical amygdala responses to fear in psychopathy extend across
   multiple classes of stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) patients exhibit a disparity in their actual
   physical identity and their cognitive understanding of their physical
   identity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks have
   contributed to understanding the neural circuitry involved in processing
   identity in healthy individuals. We hypothesized that women recovering
   from AN would show altered neural responses while thinking about their
   identity compared with healthy control women. We compared brain
   activation using fMRI in 18 women recovering from anorexia (RAN) and 18
   healthy control women (CON) using two identity-appraisal tasks. These
   neuroimaging tasks were focused on separable components of identity: one
   consisted of adjectives related to social activities and the other
   consisted of physical descriptive phrases about one's appearance. Both
   tasks consisted of reading and responding to statements with three
   different perspectives: Self, Friend and Reflected. In the comparisons
   of the RAN and CON subjects, we observed differences in fMRI activation
   relating to self-knowledge ('I am', `I look') and perspective-taking ('I
   believe', `Friend believes') in the precuneus, two areas of the dorsal
   anterior cingulate, and the left middle frontal gyrus. These data
   suggest that further exploration of neural components related to
   identity may improve our understanding of the pathology of AN.}},

Abstract = {{Our life is full of stories: some of them depict real-life events and
   were reported, e. g. in the daily news or in autobiographies, whereas
   other stories, as often presented to us in movies and novels, are
   fictional. However, we have only little insights in the neurocognitive
   processes underlying the reading of factual as compared to fictional
   contents. We investigated the neurocognitive effects of reading short
   narratives, labeled to be either factual or fictional. Reading in a
   factual mode engaged an activation pattern suggesting an action-based
   reconstruction of the events depicted in a story. This process seems to
   be past-oriented and leads to shorter reaction times at the behavioral
   level. In contrast, the brain activation patterns corresponding to
   reading fiction seem to reflect a constructive simulation of what might
   have happened. This is in line with studies on imagination of possible
   past or future events.}},

Abstract = {{Two empathy-related processes were recently distinguished
   neuroscientifically: automatic embodied-simulation (ES) based on
   visceromotor representation of another's affective state via
   cingulo-insulary circuit, and emotional sharing relying on cognitive
   `theory of mind' (ToM) via prefrontal-temporoparietal circuit. Evidence
   that these regions are not only activated but also function as networks
   during empathic experience has yet to been shown. Employing a novel
   approach by analyzing fMRI fluctuations of network cohesion while
   viewing films portraying personal loss, this study demonstrates
   increased connectivity during empathic engagement (probed by behavioral
   and parasympathetic indices) both within these circuits, and between
   them and a set of limbic regions. Notably, this effect was
   context-dependent: when witnessing as a determined-loss presented as a
   future event, the ToM and ToM-limbic cohesion positively correlated with
   state-and empathy indices. During the dramatic peak of this condition,
   the ToM cohesion was positively correlated with the trait-empathy index
   of personal distress. However, when the loss was presented as a
   probabilistic real-time occurrence, ToM cohesion negatively correlated
   with state-empathy index, which positively correlated with ES-limbic
   cohesion. In this case, it was the ES-limbic cohesion during the
   emotional peak which was correlated with personal distress scores. The
   findings indicate a dichotomy between regulated empathy toward
   determined-loss and vicarious empathy toward a real-time occurrence.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Previous neuroimaging studies on empathy have not clearly identified
   neural systems that support the three components of empathy: affective
   congruence, perspective-taking, and prosocial motivation. These
   limitations stem from a focus on a single emotion per study, minimal
   variation in amount of social context provided, and lack of prosocial
   motivation assessment. In the current investigation, 32 participants
   completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging session assessing
   empathic responses to individuals experiencing painful, anxious, and
   happy events that varied in valence and amount of social context
   provided. They also completed a 14-day experience sampling survey that
   assessed real-world helping behaviors. The results demonstrate that
   empathy for positive and negative emotions selectively activates regions
   associated with positive and negative affect, respectively. In addition,
   the mirror system was more active during empathy for context-independent
   events (pain), whereas the mentalizing system was more active during
   empathy for context-dependent events (anxiety, happiness). Finally, the
   septal area, previously linked to prosocial motivation, was the only
   region that was commonly activated across empathy for pain, anxiety, and
   happiness. Septal activity during each of these empathic experiences was
   predictive of daily helping. These findings suggest that empathy has
   multiple input pathways, produces affect-congruent activations, and
   results in septally mediated prosocial motivation.}},

Abstract = {{The neuroendocrine state of new mothers may alter their neural
   processing of stressors in the environment through modulatory actions of
   oxytocin on the limbic system. We predicted that amygdala sensitivity to
   negatively arousing stimuli would be suppressed in postpartum compared
   to nulliparous women and that this suppression would be modulated by
   administration of oxytocin nasal spray. We measured brain activation
   (fMRI) and subjective arousal in response to negatively arousing
   pictures in 29 postpartum and 30 nulliparous women who received either
   oxytocin nasal spray or placebo before scanning. Pre- and post-exposure
   urinary cortisol levels were also measured. Postpartum women (placebo)
   demonstrated lower right amygdala activation in response to negative
   images, lower cortisol and lower negative photo arousal ratings to
   nulliparous women. Nulliparous women receiving oxytocin had lower right
   amygdala activation compared to placebo. Cortisol levels in the placebo
   group, and ratings of arousal across all women, were positively
   associated with right amygdala activation. Together, these findings
   demonstrate reductions in both amygdala activation and subjective
   negative arousal in untreated postpartum vs nulliparous women,
   supporting the hypothesis of an attenuated neural response to arousing
   stimuli in postpartum women. A causal role of oxytocin and the timing of
   potential effects require future investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Western cultures encourage self-construals independent of social

   self-construals that rely on how others perceive the self. How are
   culturally specific self-construals mediated by the human brain? Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, we monitored neural responses
   from adults in East Asian (Chinese) and Western (Danish) cultural
   contexts during judgments of social, mental and physical attributes of
   themselves and public figures to assess cultural influences on
   self-referential processing of personal attributes in different
   dimensions. We found that judgments of self vs a public figure elicited
   greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in Danish than
   in Chinese participants regardless of attribute dimensions for
   judgments. However, self-judgments of social attributes induced greater
   activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) in Chinese than in Danish
   participants. Moreover, the group difference in TPJ activity was
   mediated by a measure of a cultural value (i.e. interdependence of
   self-construal). Our findings suggest that individuals in different

   self-reflection by changing the weight of the mPFC and TPJ in the social

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{81-87}},

Abstract = {{The right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is a neural region
   involved in assessing the goals and intentions underlying the motion of
   social agents. Recent research has identified visual cues, such as
   chasing, that trigger animacy detection and intention attribution. When
   readily available in a visual display, these cues reliably activate the
   pSTS. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined if
   attributing intentions to random motion would likewise engage the pSTS.
   Participants viewed displays of four moving circles and were instructed
   to search for chasing or mirror-correlated motion. On chasing trials,
   one circle chased another circle, invoking the percept of an intentional
   agent; while on correlated motion trials, one circle's motion was mirror
   reflected by another. On the remaining trials, all circles moved
   randomly. As expected, pSTS activation was greater when participants
   searched for chasing vs correlated motion when these cues were present
   in the displays. Of critical importance, pSTS activation was also
   greater when participants searched for chasing compared to
   mirror-correlated motion when the displays in both search conditions
   were statistically identical random motion. We conclude that pSTS
   activity associated with intention attribution can be invoked by
   top-down processes in the absence of reliable visual cues for
   intentionality.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{In healthy individuals, direct eye contact initially leads to activation
   of a fast subcortical pathway, which then modulates a cortical route
   eliciting social cognitive processes. The aim of this study was to gain
   insight into the neurobiological effects of direct eye-to-eye contact
   using a virtual reality paradigm in individuals with posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD) related to prolonged childhood abuse. We examined
   16 healthy comparison subjects and 16 patients with a primary diagnosis
   of PTSD using a virtual reality functional magnetic resonance imaging
   paradigm involving direct vs averted gaze (happy, sad, neutral) as
   developed by Schrammel et al. in 2009. Irrespective of the displayed
   emotion, controls exhibited an increased blood oxygenation
   level-dependent response during direct vs averted gaze within the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, left temporoparietal junction and right
   temporal pole. Under the same conditions, individuals with PTSD showed
   increased activation within the superior colliculus (SC)/periaqueductal
   gray (PAG) and locus coeruleus. Our findings suggest that healthy
   controls react to the exposure of direct gaze with an activation of a
   cortical route that enhances evaluative `top-down' processes underlying
   social interactions. In individuals with PTSD, however, direct gaze
   leads to sustained activation of a subcortical route of eye-contact
   processing, an innate alarm system involving the SC and the underlying
   circuits of the PAG.}},

Abstract = {{Human beings constantly engage in attributing causal explanations to
   one's own and to others actions, and theory-of-mind (ToM) is critical in
   making such inferences. Although children learn causal attribution early
   in development, children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are known
   to have impairments in the development of intentional causality. This
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) study investigated the neural correlates of physical and
   intentional causal attribution in people with ASDs. In the fMRI scanner,
   15 adolescents and adults with ASDs and 15 age-and IQ-matched typically
   developing peers made causal judgments about comic strips presented
   randomly in an event-related design. All participants showed robust
   activation in bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus at the
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) in response to intentional causality.
   Participants with ASDs showed lower activation in TPJ, right inferior
   frontal gyrus and left premotor cortex. Significantly weaker functional
   connectivity was also found in the ASD group between TPJ and motor areas
   during intentional causality. DTI data revealed significantly reduced
   fractional anisotropy in ASD participants in white matter underlying the
   temporal lobe. In addition to underscoring the role of TPJ in ToM, this
   study found an interaction between motor simulation and mentalizing
   systems in intentional causal attribution and its possible discord in
   autism.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are often associated with impairments in
   judgment of facial expressions. This impairment is often accompanied by
   diminished eye contact and atypical amygdala responses to face stimuli.
   The current study used a within-subjects design to examine the effects
   of natural viewing and an experimental eye-gaze manipulation on amygdala
   responses to faces. Individuals with ASD showed less gaze toward the eye
   region of faces relative to a control group. Among individuals with ASD,
   reduced eye gaze was associated with higher threat ratings of neutral
   faces. Amygdala signal was elevated in the ASD group relative to
   controls. This elevated response was further potentiated by
   experimentally manipulating gaze to the eye region. Potentiation by the
   gaze manipulation was largest for those individuals who exhibited the
   least amount of naturally occurring gaze toward the eye region and was
   associated with their subjective threat ratings. Effects were largest
   for neutral faces, highlighting the importance of examining neutral
   faces in the pathophysiology of autism and questioning their use as
   control stimuli with this population. Overall, our findings provide
   support for the notion that gaze direction modulates affective response
   to faces in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Branding and advertising have a powerful effect on both familiarity and

   neural response to logos in children. Food advertising is particularly
   pervasive and effective in manipulating choices in children. The purpose
   of this study was to examine how healthy children's brains respond to
   common food and other logos. A pilot validation study was first
   conducted with 32 children to select the most culturally familiar logos,
   and to match food and non-food logos on valence and intensity. A new
   sample of 17 healthy weight children were then scanned using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Food logos compared to baseline were
   associated with increased activation in orbitofrontal cortex and
   inferior prefrontal cortex. Compared to non-food logos, food logos
   elicited increased activation in posterior cingulate cortex. Results
   confirmed that food logos activate some brain regions in children known
   to be associated with motivation. This marks the first study in children
   to examine brain responses to culturally familiar logos. Considering the
   pervasiveness of advertising, research should further investigate how
   children respond at the neural level to marketing.}},

Title = {{Dysfunction of Affective Network in Post Ischemic Stroke Depression: A
   Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Previous studies have demonstrated that stroke
   characteristics and social and psychological factors jointly contribute
   to the development of poststroke depression (PSD). The purpose of this
   study was to identify altered functional connectivity (FC) of the
   affective network (AN) in patients with PSD and to explore the
   correlation between FC and the severity of PSD. Materials and Methods.
   26 PSD patients, 24 stroke patients without depression, and 24
   age-matched normal controls underwent the resting-state functional MRI
   (fMRI) scanning. The bilateral anterior cingulated cortices (ACCs) were
   selected as regions of interest (ROIs). FC was calculated and compared
   among the three groups. The association between FC and Hamilton
   Depression Rate Scale (HDRS) scores of PSD group was investigated.
   Results. The FC of the AN was disrupted in PSD patients compared to
   stroke patients without depression and normal controls. Moreover, the
   left orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus which indicated altered FC
   was significantly correlated with HDRS scores in PSD patients.
   Conclusions. Dysfunction of the affective network may be one of the
   reasons of the development of PSD.}},

Title = {{Paradoxical effects of short-term antidepressant treatment in fMRI
   emotional processing models in volunteers with high neuroticism}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{241-252}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Short-term antidepressant administration has been reported to decrease
   amygdala response to threat in healthy volunteers and depressed
   patients. Neuroticism (N) is a risk factor for depression but has also
   been associated with slow or incomplete remission with antidepressant
   drug treatment. Our aim was to investigate early selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) administration neural effects on implicit
   processing of fearful facial expressions in volunteers with high levels
   of N.
   Method
   Highly neurotic subjects received 20mg/day citalopram versus placebo for
   7 days in a double-blind, between-groups design. On the last day
   haemoperfusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
   during a gender discrimination task with fearful and happy faces were
   acquired. A control group of non-neurotic volunteers was also tested.
   Results
   High-N volunteers had reduced responses to threatening facial
   expressions across key neural circuits compared to low-N volunteers.
   SSRI treatment was found to elevate resting perfusion in the right
   amygdala, increase bilateral amygdalae activation to positive and
   negative facial expressions and increase activation to fearful versus
   happy facial expressions in occipital, parietal, temporal and prefrontal
   cortical areas.
   Conclusions
   These results suggest that 7 days of SSRI administration can increase
   neural markers of fear reactivity in subjects at the high end of the N
   dimension and may be related to early increases in anxiety and agitation
   seen early in treatment. Such processes may be involved in the later
   therapeutic effects through decreased avoidance and increased learning
   about social `threat' cues.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to explore white-matter disruption in social
   anxiety disorder (SAD) patients by using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   and to investigate the relationship between cerebral abnormalities and
   the severity of the symptoms. Eighteen SAD patients and age- and
   gender-matched healthy controls were recruited. DTI scans were performed
   to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient
   (ADC) for each subject. We used voxel-based analysis to determine the
   differences of FA and ADC values between the two groups with two-sample
   t-tests. The SAD patient showed significantly decreased FA values in the
   white matter of the left insula, left inferior frontal gyrus, left
   middle temporal gyrus, and left inferior parietal gyrus and increased
   ADC values in the left insula, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus,
   bilateral middle temporal gyrus, and left inferior parietal gyrus. In
   SAD patients, we observed a significant negative correlation between FA
   values in the left insula and the total LSAS scores and a positive
   correlation between the ADC values in the left inferior frontal gyrus
   and the total LSAS scores. Above results suggested that white-matter
   microstructural changes might contribute to the neuropathology of SAD.}},

Title = {{Independent Component Analysis of Instantaneous Power-Based fMRI}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using spatial
   independent component analysis (sICA) method, a model of ``latent
   variables{''} is often employed, which is based on the assumption that
   fMRI data are linear mixtures of statistically independent signals.
   However, actual fMRI signals are nonlinear and do not automatically meet
   with the requirement of sICA. To provide a better solution to this
   problem, we proposed a novel approach termed instantaneous power based
   fMRI (ip-fMRI) for regularization of fMRI data. Given that the
   instantaneous power of fMRI signals is a scalar value, it should be a
   linear mixture that naturally satisfies the ``latent variables{''}
   model. Based on our simulated data, the curves of accuracy and resulting
   receiver-operating characteristic curves indicate that the proposed
   approach is superior to the traditional fMRI in terms of accuracy and
   specificity by using sICA. Experimental results from human subjects have
   shown that spatial components of a hand movement task-induced activation
   reveal a brain network more specific to motor function by ip-fMRI than
   that by the traditional fMRI. We conclude that ICA decomposition of
   ip-fMRI may be used to localize energy signal changes in the brain and
   may have a potential to be applied to detection of brain activity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Abnormal prefrontal function plays a central role in the cognition
   deficits of schizophrenic patients; however, the character of the
   relationship between discriminant analysis and prefrontal activation
   remains undetermined. Recently, evidence of low prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   activation in individuals with schizophrenia has also been found during
   verbal fluency tests (VFT) and other cognitive tests with several
   neuroimaging methods. The purpose of this study is to assess the
   hemodynamic changes of the PFC and discriminant analysis between
   schizophrenia patients and healthy controls during VFT task by utilizing
   functional optical topography. A total of 99 subjects including 53
   schizophrenic patients and 46 age- and gender-matched healthy controls
   were studied. The results showed that the healthy group had larger
   activation in the right and left PFC than in the middle PFC. Besides,
   the schizophrenic group showed weaker task performance and lower
   activation in the whole PFC than the healthy group. The result of the
   discriminant analysis showed a significant difference with P value
   <0.001 in six channels (CH 23, 29, 31, 40, 42, 52) between the
   schizophrenic and healthy groups. Finally, 68.69\% and 71.72\% of
   subjects are correctly classified as being schizophrenic or healthy with
   all 52 channels and six significantly different channels, respectively.
   Our findings suggest that the left PFC can be a feature region for
   discriminant analysis of schizophrenic diagnosis. (C) The Authors.

Abstract = {{The functional role of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) has been
   implicated in a number of studies, including those investigating face
   perception, voice perception, and face voice integration. However, the
   nature of the STS preference for these `social stimuli' remains unclear,
   as does the location within the STS for specific types of information
   processing. The aim of this study was to directly examine properties of
   the STS in terms of selective response to social stimuli. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan participants whilst
   they were presented with auditory, visual, or audiovisual stimuli of
   people or objects, with the intention of localising areas preferring

   a restricted portion of the right posterior STS (pSTS) with an
   integrative preference for information from people, as compared to
   objects. These results point towards the dedicated role of the STS as a

Title = {{Processing of zero-derived words in English: An fMRI investigation}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{47-53}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Derivational morphological processes allow us to create new words (e.g.
   punish (V) to noun (N) punishment) from base forms. The number of steps
   from the basic units to derived words often varies (e.g., nationality <
   national <nation: two-steps) and there is evidence that complex
   derivations cause more brain activity than simple ones (Meinzer, Lahiri,
   Flaisch, Hannemann, \& Eulitz, 2009). However, all studies to date have
   investigated derivational processes in which morphological complexity is
   related to a change in surface form. It is therefore unclear whether the
   effects reported are attributable to underlying morphological complexity
   or to the processing of multiple surface morphemes. Here we report the
   first study to investigate morphological processing where derivational
   steps are not overtly marked (e.g., bridge-N> bridge-V) i.e.,
   zero-derivation (Aronoff, 1980). We compared the processing of one-step
   (soaking < soak-V) and two-step (bridging < bridge-V < bridge-N)
   derivations together with monomorphemic control words (grumble) in an
   fMRI experiment. Participants were presented with derived forms of words
   (soaking, bridging) in a lexical decision task. Although the surface
   derived -ing forms can be contextually participles, gerunds, or even
   nouns, they are all derived from verbs since the suffix -ing can only be
   attached to verb roots. Crucially, the verb root is the basic form for
   the one-step words, whereas for the two-step words the verb root is zero
   derived from a basic noun. Significantly increased brain activity was
   observed for complex (one-step and two-step) versus simple (zero-step)
   forms in regions involved in morphological processing, such as the left
   inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). Critically, activation was also more
   pronounced for two-step compared to one-step forms. Since both types of
   derived words have the same surface structure, our findings suggest that
   morphological processing is based on underlying morphological
   complexity, independent of overt affixation. This study is the first to
   provide evidence for the processing of zero derivation, and demonstrates
   that morphological processing cannot be reduced to surface form-based
   segmentation. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The neural correlates of response to psychosocial stress and gender
   differences therein are difficult to model experimentally as this type
   of stressor is difficult to induce in a brain imaging environment. The
   Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a behavioral paradigm that reliably
   induces moderate levels of stress was thus modified for the MRI
   environment. To determine the neurobehavioral basis of gender
   differences in response to observing oneself under social evaluative
   stress, 26 subjects (14 females) performed the TSST while being
   videotaped. During fMRI scanning, subjects were shown alternating video
   clips of two CONDITIONS: SELF or a same-sex OTHER performing the TSST.
   Subjects rated their stress level immediately after the video clips.
   GENDER differences in the {[}SELF-OTHER] contrast were analyzed. There
   was a GENDER x CONDITION interaction such that only women reported
   increased subjective stress during video feedback of their TSST session.
   A whole brain analysis (SELF vs. OTHER) showed activation in the
   bilateral insula, inferior, middle and superior frontal gyri. Greater
   recruitment was seen among males in some of these same areas in the
   context of significantly lower stress ratings. Activation of areas
   involved in inhibitory control and sensory awareness might contribute to
   the significantly lower stress ratings in males. Understanding these
   gender differences is relevant to disorders of stress and self-concept.

Abstract = {{Background: Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   studies have shown abnormal functional connectivity in regions involved
   in emotion processing and regulation in pediatric bipolar disorder
   (PBD). Recent studies indicate, however, that task-dependent neural
   changes only represent a small fraction of the brain's total activity.
   How the brain allocates the majority of its resources at resting state
   is still unknown. We used the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation
   (ALFF) method of fMRI to explore the spontaneous neuronal activity in
   resting state in PBD patients.
   Methods: Eighteen PBD patients during the mania phase and 18 sex-,
   age-and education-matched healthy subjects were enrolled in this study
   and all patients underwent fMRI scanning. The ALFF method was used to
   compare the resting-state spontaneous neuronal activity between groups.
   Correlation analysis was performed between the ALFF values and Young
   Mania Rating Scale scores.
   Results: Compared with healthy controls, PBD patients presented
   increased ALFF in bilateral caudate and left pallidum as well as
   decreased ALFF in left precuneus, left superior parietal lobule, and
   bilateral inferior occipital gyrus. Additionally, ALFF values in left
   pallidum were positively correlated with Young Mania Rating Scale score
   in PBD.
   Conclusion: The abnormal resting-state neuronal activities of the basal
   ganglia, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex may play an important
   role in the pathophysiology in PBD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that pharmacologic effects of anxiolytic agents
   can be mapped as functional changes in the fear, stress and anxiety
   brain circuit. In this work we investigated the effects of a standard
   treatment, paroxetine (20 mg/day), in subjects with Social Anxiety
   Disorder (SAD) versus placebo using different fMRI paradigms. The fMRI
   sessions, performed before and after the treatment, consisted of a
   public exposition of recorded performance task (PERPT), an emotional
   face processing task (EFPT) and a 6-min resting state followed by an
   off-scanner public speaking test. Paroxetine significantly improved the
   clinical conditions of SAD patients (n=17) vs. placebo (n=16) as
   measured with Clinical Global Inventory - Improvement (CGI-1) while no
   change was seen when using Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, as expected
   given the small size of the study population. Paroxetine reduced the
   activation of insula, thalamus and subgenual/anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) in PERPT. Resting-state fMRI assessment using Independent
   Component Analysis indicated that paroxetine reduced functional
   connectivity in insula, thalamus and ACC when compared with placebo.
   Both paradigms showed significant correlation with CGI-1 in rostral
   prefrontal cortex. Conversely, paroxetine compared to placebo produced
   activation of right amygdala and bilateral insula and no effects in ACC
   when tested with EFPT. No treatment effects on distress scores were
   observed in the off-scanner Public Speaking Test. Overall this study
   supports the use of fMRI as sensitive approach to explore the
   neurobiological substrate of the effects of pharmacologic treatments
   and, in particular, of resting state fMkI given its simplicity and task
   independence. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Managing cancer-related chronic pain is challenging to health care
   professionals as well as cancer patients and survivors. The management
   of cancer-related pain has largely consisted of pharmacological
   treatments, which has caused researchers to focus on neurotransmitter
   activity as a mediator of patients' perception of pain rather than the
   electrical activity during neurobiological processes of cancer-related
   pain. Consequently, brain-based pain treatment has focused mainly on
   neurotransmitters and not electrical neuromodulation. Neuroimaging
   research has revealed that brain activity is associated with patients'
   perceptions of symptoms across various diagnoses. The brain modulates
   internally generated neural activity and adjusts perceptions according
   to sensory input from the peripheral nervous system. Cancer-related pain
   may result not only from changes in the peripheral nervous system but
   also from changes in cortical activity over time. Thus, cortical
   reorganization by way of the brain's natural, plastic ability
   (neuroplasticity) may be used to manage pain symptoms. Physical and
   psychological distress could be modulated by giving patients tools to
   regulate neural activity in symptom-specific regions of interest.
   Initial research in nononcology populations suggests that encouraging
   neuroplasticity through a learning paradigm can be a useful technique to
   help treat chronic pain. Here we review evidence that indicates a
   measurable link between brain activity and patient-reported
   psychological and physical distress. We also summarize findings
   regarding both the neuroelectrical and neuroanatomical experience of
   symptoms, review research examining the mechanisms of the brain's
   ability to modify its own activity, and propose a brain-computer
   interface as a learning paradigm to augment neuroplasticity for pain
   management.}},

Title = {{Acute stress-induced cortisol elevations mediate reward system activity
   during subconscious processing of sexual stimuli}},

Abstract = {{Stress is thought to alter motivational processes by increasing dopamine
   (DA) secretion in the brain's ``reward system{''}, and its key region,
   the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). However, stress studies using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), mainly found evidence for
   stress-induced decreases in NAcc responsiveness toward reward cues.
   Results from both animal and human PETstudies indicate that the stress
   hormone cortisol may be crucial in the interaction between stress and
   dopaminergic actions. In the present study we therefore investigated
   whether cortisol mediated the effect of stress on DA-related responses
   to -subliminal-presentation of reward cues using the Trier Social Stress
   Test (TSST), which is known to reliably enhance cortisol levels.
   Young healthy males (n = 37) were randomly assigned to the TSST or
   control condition. After stress induction, brain activation was assessed
   using fMRI during a backward-masking paradigm in which potentially
   rewarding (sexual), emotionally negative and neutral stimuli were
   presented subliminally, masked by pictures of inanimate objects.
   A region of interest analysis showed that stress decreased activation in
   the NAcc in response to masked sexual cues (voxel-corrected, p < 05).
   Furthermore, with mediation analysis it was found that high cortisol
   levels were related to stronger NAcc activation, showing that cortisol
   acted as a suppressor variable in the negative relation between stress
   and NAcc activation.
   The present findings indicate that cortisol is crucially involved in the
   relation between stress and the responsiveness of the reward system.
   Although generally stress decreases activation in the NAcc in response
   to rewarding stimuli, high stress-induced cortisol levels suppress this
   relation, and are associated with stronger NAcc activation. Individuals
   with a high cortisol response to stress might on one hand be protected
   against reductions in reward sensitivity, which has been linked to
   anhedonia and depression, but they may ultimately be more vulnerable to
   increased reward sensitivity, and addictions. Future studies
   investigating effects of stress on reward sensitivity should take into
   account the severity of the stressor and the individual cortisol
   response to stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. Alt rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Sex differences in the neural and behavioral response to intranasal

Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{237-248}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Both oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) are known to modulate social
   behavior, and dysfunction in both systems has been postulated as a
   potential cause of certain psychiatric disorders that involve social
   behavioral deficits. In particular, there is growing interest in
   intranasal OT as a potential treatment for certain psychiatric
   disorders, and preliminary preclinical and clinical studies suggest
   efficacy in alleviating some of the associated symptoms. However, the
   vast majority of research participants in these studies have been male,
   and there is evidence for sexually differentiated effects of
   nonapeptides in both humans and non-human animals. To date, no study has
   investigated the effect of intranasal OT on brain function in human
   males and females within the same paradigm. Previously, in a randomized,
   placebo-controlled, double-blind fMRI study, we reported effects of
   intranasal OT and AVP on behavior and brain activity of human males as
   they played an interactive social game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma
   Game. Here, we present findings from an identical study in human
   females, and compare these with our findings from males. Overall, we
   find that both behavioral and neural responses to intranasal OT and AVP
   are highly sexually differentiated. In women; AVP increased conciliatory
   behavior, and both OT and AVP caused women to treat computer partners
   more like humans. In men, AVP increased reciprocation of cooperation
   from both human and computer partners. However, no specific drug effects
   on behavior were shared between men and women. During cooperative
   interactions, both OT and AVP increased brain activity in men within
   areas rich in OT and AVP receptors and in areas playing a key role in
   reward, social bonding, arousal and memory (e.g., the striatum, basal
   forebrain, insula, amygdala and hippocampus), whereas OT and AVP either
   had no effect or in some cases actually decreased brain activity in
   these regions in women. OT treatment rendered neural responses of males
   more similar to responses of females in the placebo group and vice
   versa, raising the prospect of an inverted u-shaped dose response to
   central OT levels. These findings emphasize the need to fully
   characterize the effects of intranasal OT and AVP in both males and
   females and at multiple doses before widespread clinical application
   will be warranted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Research from the University of Florida Center for the Study of Emotion
   and Attention aims to develop neurobiological measures that objecti vely
   discriminate among symptom patterns in patients with anxiety disorders.
   From this perspective, anxiety and mood pathologies are considered to be
   brain disorders, resulting from dysfunction and maladaptive plasticity
   in the neural circuits that determine fearful/defensive and
   appetitive/reward behavior (Insel et al., 2010). We review recent
   studies indicating that an enhanced probe startle reflex during the
   processing of fear memory cues (mediated by cortico-limbic circuitry and
   thus indicative of plastic brain changes), varies systematically in
   strength over a spectrum-wide dimension of anxiety pathology-across and
   within diagnoses-extending from strong focal fear reactions to a
   consistently blunted reaction in patients with more generalized anxiety
   and comorbid mood disorders. Preliminary studies with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) encourage the hypothesis that
   fear/defense circuit dysfunction covaries with this same dimension of
   psychopathology. Plans are described for an extended study of the
   brain's motivation circuitry in anxiety spectrum patients, with the aim
   of defining the specifics of circuit dysfunction in severe disorders. A
   sub-project explores the use of real-time fMRI feedback in circuit
   analysis and as a modality to up-regulate circuit function in the
   context of blunted affect.}},

Abstract = {{Discourse comprehension is a hallmark of human social behaviour and
   refers to the act of interpreting a written or spoken message by
   constructing mental representations that integrate incoming language
   with prior knowledge and experience. Here, we report a human lesion
   study (n = 145) that investigates the neural mechanisms underlying
   discourse comprehension (measured by the Discourse Comprehension Test)
   and systematically examine its relation to a broad range of
   psychological factors, including psychometric intelligence (measured by
   the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale), emotional intelligence (measured
   by the Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test), and
   personality traits (measured by the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness
   Personality Inventory). Scores obtained from these factors were
   submitted to voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping to elucidate their
   neural substrates. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that working
   memory and extraversion reliably predict individual differences in
   discourse comprehension: higher working memory scores and lower
   extraversion levels predict better discourse comprehension performance.
   Lesion mapping results indicated that these convergent variables depend
   on a shared network of frontal and parietal regions, including white
   matter association tracts that bind these areas into a coordinated
   system. The observed findings motivate an integrative framework for
   understanding the neural foundations of discourse comprehension,
   suggesting that core elements of discourse processing emerge from a
   distributed network of brain regions that support specific competencies
   for executive and social function.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Impairments in social cognition have been described in
   schizophrenia and relate to core symptoms of the disorder. Social
   cognition is subserved by a network of brain regions, many of which have
   been implicated in schizophrenia. We hypothesized that deficits in
   connectivity between components of this social brain network may
   underlie the social cognition impairments seen in the disorder. Methods:
   We investigated brain activation and connectivity in a group of
   individuals with schizophrenia making social judgments of
   approachability from faces (n = 20), compared with a group of matched
   healthy volunteers (n = 24), using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Effective connectivity from the amygdala was estimated using
   the psychophysiological interaction approach. Results: While making
   approachability judgments, healthy participants recruited a network of
   social brain regions including amygdala, fusiform gyrus, cerebellum, and
   inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally and left medial prefrontal cortex.
   During the approachability task, healthy participants showed increased
   connectivity from the amygdala to the fusiform gyri, cerebellum, and
   left superior frontal cortex. In comparison to controls, individuals
   with schizophrenia overactivated the right middle frontal gyrus,
   superior frontal gyrus, and precuneus and had reduced connectivity
   between the amygdala and the insula cortex. Discussion: We report
   increased activation of frontal and medial parietal regions during
   social judgment in patients with schizophrenia, accompanied by decreased
   connectivity between the amygdala and insula. We suggest that the
   increased activation of frontal control systems and association cortex
   may reflect a compensatory mechanism for impaired connectivity of the
   amygdala with other parts of the social brain networks in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{From an evolutionary viewpoint, readiness to engage in appropriate
   behavior toward a recognized person seems to be inherent in the human
   brain. In support of this hypothesis, functional neuroimaging studies
   have demonstrated activation in regions relevant to
   relationship-appropriate behavior during the recognition of personally
   familiar (PF) people. Recognition of friends and colleagues activates
   regions involved in real-time communication, including the regions for
   inference about the other's mental state, autobiographical memory
   retrieval, and self-referential processes. Recognition of people related
   by romantic love, maternal love, and lost love induces activation in
   regions involved in motivational, reward, and affective processes,
   reflecting behavioral readiness for mating, caretaking, and yearning,
   respectively. The involvement of motor-associated cortices during
   recognition of a personal enemy may reflect readiness for attack or
   defense. Self-recognition in a body-related modality uniquely activates
   sensory and motor association cortices reflecting the sensorimotor
   origin of the bodily self-concept, with social cognitive processes being
   suppressed or context dependent. Issues and future directions are also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenic patients may report unusual perception of their own body.
   Studies using the rubber hand illusion (RHI) proposed that they exhibit
   a distorted sense of body ownership. However, since the RHI is mostly
   achieved with the contribution of visuo-tactile integration, the
   stronger RHI observed in schizophrenic patients could reflect either a
   general increase of the response to multisensory stimuli or a larger
   influence of visual cues on the tactile sensory experience. The purpose
   of the present study is to investigate patients' perception of their own
   body by means of a behavioral paradigm that measures their proneness to
   the RHI without relying on multisensory integration occurring during
   actual experience of touch. In a previous study we demonstrated in
   healthy participants that expectation of touch experience arising at the
   sight of a human hand approaching a rubber hand is enough to induce a
   sense of ownership over the same hand. Here we take advantage of the
   same paradigm to investigate body ownership in schizophrenia. Patients
   observed the experimenter's hand while approaching - without touching -
   either a rubber hand or a piece of wood placed in front of them. The
   seen object could be either aligned to participant's hand or rotated by
   180 degrees. Phenomenology of the illusion revealed that schizophrenic
   patients exhibited sense of ownership over the rubber hand, but more
   weakly than healthy controls. The present study sheds new light on the
   experience of body ownership in schizophrenic patients, corroborating
   the notion that alterations of bodily self-awareness play an important
   role in schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   significantly and positively correlated in the right putamen, insula,

   central roles in externally modulated motivation (OFC and putamen) also
   contribute to SFAM and CAM, respectively, but in different ways.
   Furthermore, the brain areas in which rGMD correlated with CAM are
   related to cognitive processes associated with distressing emotions and
   social cognition, and these cognitive processes may characterize CAM.}},

Title = {{The functional architecture of S1 during touch observation described

Abstract = {{Recent studies indicate that the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is
   active not only when touch is physically perceived but also when it is
   merely observed to be experienced by another person. This social
   responsivity of S1 has important implications for our understanding of
   S1 functioning. However, S1 activity during touch observation has not
   been characterized in great detail to date. We focused on two features
   of the S1 functional architecture during touch observation, namely the
   topographical arrangement of index and middle finger receptive fields
   (RFs), and their dynamic shrinkage during concurrent activation. Both
   features have important implications for human behavior. We conducted
   two fMRI studies at 7 T, one where touch was physically perceived, and
   one where touch was observed. In the two experiments, participants
   either had their index finger and/or middle finger stimulated using
   paintbrushes, or just observed similar touch events on video. Our data
   show that observing and physically experiencing touch elicits
   overlapping activity changes in S1. In addition, observing touch to the
   index finger or the middle finger alone evoked topographically arranged
   activation foci in S1. Importantly, when co-activated, the index and
   middle finger RFs not only shrank during physical touch perception, but
   also during touch observation. Our data, therefore, indicate a
   similarity between the functional architecture of S1 during touch
   observation and physical touch perception with respect to single-digit
   topography and RF shrinkage. These results may allow the tentative
   conclusion that even primary somatosensory experiences, such as physical
   touch perception, can be shared amongst individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to further elucidate the potential
   mechanisms underlying left hemiparalexia induced by a splenium lesion in
   corpus callosum. A patient KY, who had infarctions in the splenium and
   the left ventral medial occipitotemporal area, was examined with
   neuropsychological tests and fMRI. KY presented left hemiparalexia when
   he read aloud characters presented in central foveal field
   tachistoscopically as well as in free-view field. KY also showed left
   hemialexia for characters in left visual field, while no left
   hemiparalexia occurred when characters were presented in the right
   visual field. KY performed poorly in lexical decision tasks. He could
   judge the directions of Landolt's rings gaps in the left or right visual
   field equally. The result of fMRI indicated that characters in the left
   visual field could not activate the visual word form area (VWFA), such
   as left mid-fusiform cortex. All the above neuropsychological and fMRI
   findings have provided evidences against the assumption of left
   hemineglect dyslexia. Instead, they support the mechanism of
   disconnection of visual word form processing pathway. In conclusion, the
   evidences suggested that the visual information transmission of
   characters in the left visual field from right occipital area to the
   VWFA in the left hemisphere was interrupted by the splenium lesion.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEThe basal ganglia and the cerebellum have both
   emerged as important structures involved in the processing of temporal
   information.
   METHODSWe examined the roles of the cerebellum and striatum in
   predictive motor timing during a target interception task in healthy
   individuals (HC group; n = 21) and in patients with early Parkinson's
   disease (early stage PD group; n = 20) using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging.
   RESULTSDespite having similar hit ratios, the PD failed more often than
   the HC to postpone their actions until the right moment and to adapt
   their behavior from one trial to the next. We found more activation in
   the right cerebellar lobule VI in HC than in early stage PD during
   successful trials. Successful trial-by-trial adjustments were associated
   with higher activity in the right putamen and lobule VI of the
   cerebellum in HC.
   CONCLUSIONSWe conclude that both the cerebellum and striatum are
   involved in predictive motor timing tasks. The cerebellar activity is
   associated exclusively with the postponement of action until the right
   moment, whereas both the cerebellum and striatum are needed for
   successful adaptation of motor actions from one trial to the next. We
   found a general hypoactivation'' of basal ganglia and cerebellum in
   early stage PD relative to HC, indicating that even in early stages of
   the PD there could be functional perturbations in the motor system
   beyond striatum.}},

Abstract = {{Although the visual representation of bodies is essential for
   reproduction, survival, and social communication, little is known about
   the mechanisms of body recognition at the single neuron level. Imaging
   studies showed body-category selective regions in the primate
   occipitotemporal cortex, but it is difficult to infer the stimulus
   selectivities of the neurons from the population activity measured in
   these fMRI studies. To overcome this, we recorded single unit activity
   and local field potentials (LFPs) in the middle superior temporal sulcus
   body patch, defined by fMRI in the same rhesus monkeys. Both the spiking
   activity, averaged across single neurons, and LFP gamma power in this
   body patch was greater for bodies (including monkey bodies, human
   bodies, mammals, and birds) compared with other objects, which fits the
   fMRI activation. Single neurons responded to a small proportion of body
   images. Thus, the category selectivity at the population level resulted
   from averaging responses of a heterogeneous population of single units.
   Despite such strong within-category selectivity at the single unit
   level, two distinct clusters, bodies and nonbodies, were present when
   analyzing the responses at the population level, and a classifier that
   was trained using the responses to a subset of images was able to
   classify novel images of bodies with high accuracy. The body-patch
   neurons showed strong selectivity for individual body parts at different
   orientations. Overall, these data suggest that single units in the
   fMRI-defined body patch are biased to prefer bodies over nonbody
   objects, including faces, with a strong selectivity for individual body
   images.}},

Abstract = {{Panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG) is a prevalent mental disorder
   featuring a substantial complex genetic component. At present, only a
   few established risk genes exist. Among these, the gene encoding
   monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is noteworthy given that genetic variation
   has been demonstrated to influence gene expression and monoamine levels.
   Long alleles of the MAOA-uVNTR promoter polymorphism are associated with
   PD/AG and correspond with increased enzyme activity. Here, we have thus
   investigated the impact of MAOA-uVNTR on therapy response, behavioral
   avoidance and brain activity in fear conditioning in a large controlled
   and randomized multicenter study on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
   in PD/AG. The study consisted of 369 PD/AG patients, and genetic
   information was available for 283 patients. Carriers of the risk allele
   had significantly worse outcome as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety
   scale (46\% responders vs 67\%, P = 0.017). This was accompanied by
   elevated heart rate and increased fear during an anxiety-provoking
   situation, that is, the behavioral avoidance task. All but one panic
   attack that happened during this task occurred in risk allele carriers
   and, furthermore, risk allele carriers did not habituate to the
   situation during repetitive exposure. Finally, functional neuroimaging
   during a classical fear conditioning paradigm evidenced that the
   protective allele is associated with increased activation of the
   anterior cingulate cortex upon presentation of the CS+ during
   acquisition of fear. Further differentiation between high-and low-risk
   subjects after treatment was observed in the inferior parietal lobes,
   suggesting differential brain activation patterns upon CBT. Taken
   together, we established that a genetic risk factor for PD/AG is
   associated with worse response to CBT and identify potential underlying
   neural mechanisms. These findings might govern how psychotherapy can
   include genetic information to tailor individualized treatment
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Verbal social interaction plays an important role both in the etiology
   and treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, the neural basis of
   social interaction has primarily been studied in the individual brain,
   neglecting the inter-individual perspective. Here, we show
   inter-individual neuronal coupling of brain activity during live verbal
   interaction, by investigating 11 pairs of good female friends who were
   instructed to speak about autobiographical life events during
   simultaneous fMRI acquisition. The analysis revealed that the time
   course of neural activity in areas associated with speech production was
   coupled with the time course of neural activity in the interlocutor's
   auditory cortex. This shows the feasibility of the new methodology,
   which may help elucidate basic reciprocal mechanisms of social
   interaction and the underpinnings of disordered communication. In
   particular, it may serve to study the process of psychotherapy on a
   neuronal level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy involves experiencing emotion vicariously, and understanding the
   reasons for those emotions. It may be served partly by a motor
   simulation function, and therefore share a neural basis with imitation
   (as opposed to mimicry), as both involve sensorimotor representations of
   intentions based on perceptions of others' actions. We recently showed a
   correlation between imitation accuracy and Empathy Quotient (EQ) using a
   facial imitation task and hypothesised that this relationship would be
   mediated by the human mirror neuron system. During functional Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (fMRI), 20 adults observed novel `blends' of facial
   emotional expressions. According to instruction, they either imitated
   (i.e. matched) the expressions or executed alternative, pre-prescribed
   mismatched actions as control. Outside the scanner we replicated the
   association between imitation accuracy and EQ. During fMRI, activity was
   greater during mismatch compared to imitation, particularly in the
   bilateral insula. Activity during imitation correlated with EQ in
   somatosensory cortex, intraparietal sulcus and premotor cortex.
   Imitation accuracy correlated with activity in insula and areas serving
   motor control. Overlapping voxels for the accuracy and EQ correlations
   occurred in premotor cortex. We suggest that both empathy and facial
   imitation rely on formation of action plans (or a simulation of others'
   intentions) in the premotor cortex, in connection with representations
   of emotional expressions based in the somatosensory cortex. In addition,
   the insula may play a key role in the social regulation of facial
   expression. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the intentions and desires of those around us is vital for
   adapting to a dynamic social environment. In this paper, a novel
   event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) paradigm with
   dynamic and natural stimuli (2 s video clips) was developed to directly
   examine the neural networks associated with processing of gestures with
   social intent as compared to nonsocial intent. When comparing social to
   nonsocial gestures, increased activation in both the mentalizing (or
   theory of mind) and amygdala networks was found. As a secondary aim, a
   factor of actor-orientation was included in the paradigm to examine how
   the neural mechanisms differ with respect to personal engagement during
   a social interaction versus passively observing an interaction. Activity
   in the lateral occipital cortex and precentral gyrus was found sensitive
   to actor-orientation during social interactions. Lastly, by manipulating
   face-visibility we tested whether facial information alone is the
   primary driver of neural activation differences observed between social
   and nonsocial gestures. We discovered that activity in the posterior
   superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and fusiform gyrus (FFG) was partially
   driven by observing facial expressions during social gestures.
   Altogether, using multiple factors associated with processing of natural
   social interaction, we conceptually advance our understanding of how
   social stimuli is processed in the brain and discuss the application of
   this paradigm to clinical populations where atypical social cognition is
   manifested as a key symptom. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the emotional effects and neural correlates of
   being empathized with while speaking about a currently experienced
   real-life social conflict during fMRI. Specifically, we focused on the
   effects of cognitive empathy in the form of paraphrasing, a technique
   regularly used in conflict resolution. 22 participants underwent fMRI
   while being interviewed on their social conflict and receiving empathic
   or unempathic responses from the interviewer. Skin conductance response
   (SCR) and self-report ratings of feeling understood and emotional
   valence were used to assess emotional responses. Results confirm
   previous findings indicating that cognitive empathy exerts a positive
   short-term effect on emotions in social conflict, while at the same time
   increasing autonomic arousal reflected by SCR. Effects of paraphrasing
   and unempathic interventions as indicated by self-report ratings varied
   depending on self-esteem, pre-interview negative affect, and
   participants' empathy quotient. Empathic responses engaged a
   fronto-parietal network with activity in the right precentral gyms
   (PrG), left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), left inferior parietal gyrus
   (IPG), and right postcentral gyrus (PoG). Processing unempathic
   responses involved a fronto-temporal network with clusters peaking in
   the left inferior frontal gyrus, pars triangularis (IFGTr), and right
   temporal pole (TP). A specific modeling of feeling misunderstood
   activated a network consisting of the IFG, left TP, left Heschl gyrus,
   IFGT, and right precuneus, extending to several limbic regions, such as
   the insula, amygdala, putamen, and anterior cingulate cortex/right
   middle cingulum (ACC/MCC). The results support the effectiveness of a
   widely used conflict resolution technique, which may also be useful for
   professionals who regularly deal with and have to de-escalate situations
   highly charged with negative emotion, e.g. physicians or judges. (C)

Abstract = {{Studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) reveal dysfunction in the
   neural systems mediating object processing (particularly faces) and
   social cognition, but few investigations have systematically assessed
   the specificity of the dysfunction. We compared cortical responses in
   typically developing adolescents and those with ASD to stimuli from
   distinct conceptual domains known to elicit category-related activity in
   separate neural systems. In Experiment 1, subjects made category
   decisions to photographs, videos, and point-light displays of people and
   tools. In Experiment 2, subjects interpreted displays of simple,
   geometric shapes in motion depicting social or mechanical interactions.
   In both experiments, we found a selective deficit in the ASD subjects
   for dynamic social stimuli (videos and point-light displays of people,
   moving geometric shapes), but not static images, in the functionally
   localized lateral region of the right fusiform gyrus, including the
   fusiform face area. In contrast, no group differences were found in
   response to either static images or dynamic stimuli in other brain
   regions associated with face and social processing (e. g. posterior
   superior temporal sulcus, amygdala), suggesting disordered connectivity
   between these regions and the fusiform gyrus in ASD. This possibility
   was confirmed by functional connectivity analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Group functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that
   anxiety disorders are associated with anomalous brain activation and
   functional connectivity (FC). However, brain-based features sensitive
   enough to discriminate individual subjects with a specific anxiety
   disorder and that track symptom severity longitudinally, desirable
   qualities for putative disorder-specific biomarkers, remain to be
   identified. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI during emotional
   face perceptual tasks and a new, large-scale and condition-dependent FC
   and machine learning approach were used to identify features (pair-wise
   correlations) that discriminated patients with social anxiety disorder
   (SAD, N = 16) from controls (N = 19). We assessed whether these features
   discriminated SAD from panic disorder (PD, N = 16), and SAD from
   controls in an independent replication sample that performed a similar
   task at baseline (N: SAD = 15, controls = 17) and following 8-weeks
   paroxetine treatment (N: SAD = 12, untreated controls = 7). High SAD vs
   HCs discrimination (area under the ROC curve, AUC, arithmetic mean of
   sensitivity and specificity) was achieved with two FC features during
   unattended neutral face perception (AUC = 0.88, P<0.05 corrected). These
   features also discriminated SAD vs PD (AUC = 0.82, P = 0.0001) and SAD
   vs HCs in the independent replication sample (FC during unattended angry
   face perception, AUC = 0.71, P = 0.01). The most informative FC was left
   hippocampus-left temporal pole, which was reduced in both SAD samples
   (replication sample P = 0.027), and this FC increased following the
   treatment (post>pre, t((11)) = 2.9, P = 0.007). In conclusion, SAD is
   associated with reduced FC between left temporal pole and left
   hippocampus during face perception, and results suggest promise for
   emerging FC-based biomarkers for SAD diagnosis and treatment effects.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Emotion regulation deficits are a key characteristic of
   bipolar disorder (BD). In the present study, we asked if deficits in
   emotion regulation are also a vulnerability marker for BD. To this end,
   we investigated a healthy group of participants at high-risk for
   developing BD, defined on the basis of a hypomanic personality trait. We
   examined the neural correlates of two emotion regulation strategies,
   reappraisal and distraction.
   Method: Twenty-two individuals with higher risk for BD and twenty-four
   controls were investigated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   paradigm. Participants were presented with negative, positive and
   neutral pictures and were either required to passively view the images,
   to clown-regulate the emotional response by reappraising the pictures'
   content or to perform a distracting arithmetic task.
   Results: High-risk individuals showed increased emotional reactivity to
   negative stimuli, indicated by heightened amygdala activation during
   passive viewing. High-risk participants were also less successful in
   down regulating amygdala activity using reappraisal of negative stimuli.
   During distraction from positive stimuli, high risk individuals showed
   heightened task related activity in the inferior parietal cortex,
   suggesting increased distractibility by task irrelevant positive
   background stimuli. There were no differences in habitual emotion
   regulation as assessed by a self report questionnaire.
   Limitations.: Generalizability of the present results is limited by the
   age- and education-homogenous sample and the small sample size.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to report neural correlates of
   increased emotional reactivity and deficient emotion regulation in
   healthy individuals at risk for BD. Those findings suggest inefficient
   emotion regulation through reappraisal and distraction in individuals
   with high hypomanic personality who are supposed to be at higher risk to
   develop bipolar disorder. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Title = {{Facial emotion recognition and its correlation with executive functions
   in bipolar I patients and healthy controls}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{152}},
Pages = {{288-294}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The ability to recognize facial emotions is altered in
   patients with Bipolar Disorder (BD) during mood episodes and even in
   euthymia, while cognitive functioning is similarly impaired. This
   recognition is considered a fundamental skill for successful social
   interaction. However, it is unclear whether the ability to recognize
   facial emotions is correlated with the cognitive deficits observed in
   BD. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate Facial
   Emotion Recognition (PER) and its correlation with executive function
   (FE) in BD I patients during mania, depression and euthymia compared to
   healthy controls.
   Material and methods: A total of 110 patients with BD I, 18-40 years old
   were included (41 in manic episode; 31 in depressive episode and 38
   euthymic). Patients were assessed for FER and EF (Wisconsin card sorting
   test - WCST), along with 96 healthy volunteers (18-40 years old)
   recruited from the University of Sao Paulo.
   Results: The results showed that BD l patients had lower FER performance
   compared to controls on fear subtests, happiness, the surprise Lest, and
   E'ER total scores. Moreover, BD l manic patients showed poorer
   performance for EF compared to controls. Six out of the seven variables
   of the WCST correlated with E'ER in both healthy controls and BD
   euthymic subjects but not in BD patients during mood episodes.
   Conclusion: Cognitive deficits and difficulties recognizing facial
   emotions are present in all mood episodes in BD l patients, even during
   remission. Although FER is not considered a cognitive domain, these
   results suggest that, along with EF, it has a complementary function.
   Hence, further studies should investigate this issue in larger samples
   and verify whether these similarities also occur at a neurobiological
   level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To study the properties of human primary somatosensory (S1) cortex as
   well as its role in cognitive and social processes, it is necessary to
   noninvasively localize the cortical representations of the body. Being
   arguably the most relevant body parts for tactile exploration, cortical
   representations of fingers are of particular interest. The aim of the
   present study was to investigate the cortical representation of
   individual fingers (D1-D5), using human touch as a stimulus. Utilizing
   the high BOLD sensitivity and spatial resolution at 7T, we found that
   each finger is represented within three subregions of S1 in the
   postcentral gyrus. Within each of these three areas, the fingers are
   sequentially organized (from D1 to D5) in a somatotopic manner.
   Therefore, these finger representations likely reflect distinct
   activations of BAs 3b, 1, and 2, similar to those described in
   electrophysiological work in non-human primates. Quantitative analysis
   of the local BOLD responses revealed that within BA3b, each finger
   representation is specific to its own stimulation without any
   cross-finger responsiveness. This finger response selectivity was less
   prominent in BA 1 and in BA 2. A test-retest procedure highlighted the
   reproducibility of the results and the robustness of the method for BA
   3b. Finally, the representation of the thumb was enlarged compared to
   the other fingers within BAs 1 and 2. These findings extend previous
   human electrophysiological and neuroimaging data but also reveal
   differences in the functional organization of S1 in human and nonhuman
   primates. Hum Brain Mapp 35:213-226, 2014. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The importance of studying connectivity in the aging brain is
   increasingly recognized. Recent studies have shown that connectivity
   within the default mode network is reduced with age and have
   demonstrated a clear relation of these changes with cognitive
   functioning. However, research on age-related changes in other
   functional networks is sparse and mainly focused on prespecified
   functional networks. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity during a
   visual oddball task in a range of functional networks. It was found that
   compared with young participants, elderly showed a decrease in
   connectivity between areas belonging to the same functional network.
   This was found in the default mode network and the somatomotor network.
   Moreover, in all identified networks, elderly showed increased
   connectivity between areas within these networks and areas belonging to
   different functional networks. Decreased connectivity within functional
   networks was related to poorer cognitive functioning in elderly. The
   results were interpreted as a decrease in the specificity of functional
   networks in older participants. Hum Brain Mapp 35:319-330, 2014. (c)

Abstract = {{Here we present a high-resolution functional magnetic resonance (fMRI)
   dataset - 20 participants recorded at high field strength (7 Tesla)

   DTI, susceptibility-weighted image, angiography) as well as measurements
   to assess technical and physiological noise components have been
   acquired. An initial analysis confirms that these data can be used to
   study common and idiosyncratic brain response patterns to complex
   auditory stimulation. Among the potential uses of this dataset are the
   study of auditory attention and cognition, language and music
   perception, and social perception. The auxiliary measurements enable a
   large variety of additional analysis strategies that relate functional
   response patterns to structural properties of the brain. Alongside the
   acquired data, we provide source code and detailed information on all
   employed procedures - from stimulus creation to data analysis. In order
   to facilitate replicative and derived works, only free and open-source

Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Efforts to identify meaningful functional imaging-based biomarkers are
   limited by the ability to reliably characterize inter-individual
   differences in human brain function. Although a growing number of
   connectomics-based measures are reported to have moderate to high
   test-retest reliability, the variability in data acquisition,
   experimental designs, and analytic methods precludes the ability to
   generalize results. The Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility
   (CoRR) is working to address this challenge and establish test-retest
   reliability as a minimum standard for methods development in functional
   connectomics. Specifically, CoRR has aggregated 1,629 typical
   individuals' resting state fMRI (rfMRI) data (5,093 rfMRI scans) from 18
   international sites, and is openly sharing them via the International
   Data-sharing Neuroimaging Initiative (INDI). To allow researchers to
   generate various estimates of reliability and reproducibility, a variety
   of data acquisition procedures and experimental designs are included.
   Similarly, to enable users to assess the impact of commonly encountered
   artifacts (for example, motion) on characterizations of inter-individual
   variation, datasets of varying quality are included.}},

Abstract = {{Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), which is used to measure blood
   oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) from resting brains, is a relatively new
   and powerful method for evaluating regional interactions that occur when
   a participant is not performing an explicit task. Because of the
   sensitiveness to the phase shift and length of time courses of the BOLD
   recordings, region of interest based conventional correlation and
   coherence methods are no longer suitable for rs-fMRI analyses. In this
   paper, we propose a more robust and consistent method, dominant
   frequency mapping, to analyze rs-fMRI data. We found a dominant
   frequency of BOLD recordings, 0.0137Hz, in resting human brains that is
   consistent across participants and brain regions. This frequency is
   detected mainly in Gyrus Rectus, Frontal Medial Orbital, Frontal
   Superior Orbital and Olfactory Sulcus, which control the human social
   behavior, emotion, and decision making. In the meantime, we found that
   BOLD frequencies are most inconsistent in the brain regions of
   PrecentralGyrus, Superior Frontal gyrus, Insula, Caudate nucleus,
   Putamen, and part of the cerebellum, whose functions are about motor.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously observed decreased activation of corticostriatal
   loops involved in planning (cognitive loop) and execution (motor loop)
   of a set shift in patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD) compared
   with control subjects. Here, we aimed to assess whether cognitive
   impairment in PD could drive these differences. Nondemented patients
   underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation and participated
   in our Wisconsin Card Sorting task functional magnetic resonance imaging
   protocol. Patients were separated into 2 groups according to the
   presence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Patients with MCI displayed
   reduced activity in the cognitive corticostriatal loop, which includes
   the caudate nucleus and prefrontal cortex while planning a set shift,
   whereas non-MCI patients exhibited activation patterns similar to those
   of healthy participants from our previous studies. Furthermore, reduced
   activation was observed in the premotor cortex of the MCI patients.
   Finally, hippocampal activity, correlated with individual memory scores,
   suggesting a compensatory mechanism in patients with preserved memory.
   These results suggest that the presence of MCI in PD affects activity in
   the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus as well as motor-related
   regions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Randomized controlled trials have yielded promising results for
   internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) for patients with
   social anxiety disorder (SAD). The present study investigated anxiety
   related neural changes after iCBT for SAD. The amygdala is a critical
   hub in the neural fear network, receptive to change using emotion
   regulation strategies and a putative target for iCBT. Twenty two
   subjects were included in pre- and post-treatment functional magnetic
   resonance imaging at 3T assessing neural changes during an affective
   face processing task. Treatment outcome was assessed using social
   anxiety self-reports and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement
   (CGI-I) scale. ICBT yielded better outcome than ABM (66\% vs. 25\% CGI-I
   responders). A significant differential activation of the left amygdala
   was found with relatively decreased reactivity after iCBT. Changes in
   the amygdala were related to a behavioral measure of social anxiety.
   Functional connectivity analysis in the iCBT group showed that the
   amygdala attenuation was associated with increased activity in the
   medial orbitofrontal cortex and decreased activity in the right
   ventrolateral and dorsolateral (dIPFC) cortices. Treatment-induced
   neural changes with iCBT were consistent with previously reported
   studies on regular CBT and emotion regulation in general. (C) 2013

Title = {{Memory for fearful faces across development: specialization of amygdala
   nuclei and medial temporal lobe structures}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Enhanced memory for emotional faces is a significant component of
   adaptive social interactions, but little is known on its neural
   developmental correlates. We explored the role of amygdaloid complex
   (AC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL) in emotional memory recognition
   across development, by comparing fMRI activations of successful memory
   encoding of fearful and neutral faces in children (n = 12; 8-12 years)
   and adolescents (n = 12; 13-17 years). Memory for fearful faces was
   enhanced compared with neutral ones in adolescents, as opposed to
   children. In adolescents, activations associated with successful
   encoding of fearful faces were centered on baso-lateral AC nuclei,
   hippocampus, enthorhinal and parahippocampal cortices. In children,
   successful encoding of fearful faces relied on activations of
   centro-mesial AC nuclei, which was not accompanied by functional
   activation of MTL memory structures. Successful encoding of neutral
   faces depended on activations in anterior MTL region (hippocampal head
   and body) in adolescents, but more posterior ones (hippocampal tail and
   parahippocampal cortex) in children. In conclusion, two distinct
   functional specializations emerge from childhood to adolescence and
   result in the enhancement of memory for these particular stimuli: the
   specialization of baso-lateral AC nuclei, which is associated with the
   expertise in processing emotional facial expression, and which is
   intimately related to the specialization of MTL memory network. How the
   interplay between specialization of AC nuclei and of MTL memory
   structures is fundamental for the edification of social interactions
   remains to be elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{When individuals' actions are incongruent with those of the group they
   belong to, they may change their initial behavior in order to conform to
   the group norm. This phenomenon is known as ``social conformity.{''} In
   the present study, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain activity in response to group
   opinion during an ultimatum game. Results showed that participants
   changed their choices when these choices conflicted with the normative
   opinion of the group they were members of, especially in conditions of
   unfair treatment. The fMRI data revealed that a conflict with group
   norms activated the brain regions involved in norm violations and
   behavioral adjustment. Furthermore, in the reject-unfair condition, we
   observed that a conflict with group norms activated the medial frontal
   gyrus. These findings contribute to recent research examining neural
   mechanisms involved in detecting violations of social norms, and provide
   information regarding the neural representation of conformity behavior
   in an economic game.}},

   Performance on fMRI Activation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Complex visuospatial processing relies on distributed neural networks
   involving occipital, parietal and frontal brain regions. Effects of
   physiological maturation (during normal brain development) and
   proficiency on tasks requiring complex visuospatial processing have not
   yet been studied extensively, as they are almost invariably
   interrelated. We therefore aimed at dissociating the effects of age and
   performance on functional MRI (fMRI) activation in a complex visual
   search task. In our cross-sectional study, healthy children and
   adolescents (n = 43, 19 females, 7-17 years) performed a complex visual
   search task during fMRI. Resulting activation was analysed with regard
   to the differential effects of age and performance. Our results are
   compatible with an increase in the neural network's efficacy with age:
   within occipital and parietal cortex, the core regions of the visual
   exploration network, activation increased with age, and more so in the
   right than in the left hemisphere. Further, activation outside the
   visual search network decreased with age, mainly in left inferior
   frontal, middle temporal, and inferior parietal cortex. High-performers
   had stronger activation in right superior parietal cortex, suggesting a
   more mature visual search network. We could not see effects of age or
   performance in frontal cortex. Our results show that effects of
   physiological maturation and effects of performance, while usually
   intertwined, can be successfully disentangled and investigated using
   fMRI in children and adolescents.}},

Title = {{Racial Bias in Neural Empathic Responses to Pain}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that perceiving the pain of others activates
   brain regions in the observer associated with both somatosensory and
   affective-motivational aspects of pain, principally involving regions of
   the anterior cingulate and anterior insula cortex. The degree of these
   empathic neural responses is modulated by racial bias, such that
   stronger neural activation is elicited by observing pain in people of
   the same racial group compared with people of another racial group. The
   aim of the present study was to examine whether a more general social
   group category, other than race, could similarly modulate neural
   empathic responses and perhaps account for the apparent racial bias
   reported in previous studies. Using a minimal group paradigm, we
   assigned participants to one of two mixed-race teams. We use the term
   race to refer to the Chinese or Caucasian appearance of faces and
   whether the ethnic group represented was the same or different from the
   appearance of the participant' own face. Using fMRI, we measured neural
   empathic responses as participants observed members of their own group
   or other group, and members of their own race or other race, receiving
   either painful or non-painful touch. Participants showed clear group
   biases, with no significant effect of race, on behavioral measures of
   implicit (affective priming) and explicit group identification. Neural
   responses to observed pain in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula
   cortex, and somatosensory areas showed significantly greater activation
   when observing pain in own-race compared with other-race individuals,
   with no significant effect of minimal groups. These results suggest that
   racial bias in neural empathic responses is not influenced by minimal
   forms of group categorization, despite the clear association
   participants showed with in-group more than out-group members. We
   suggest that race may be an automatic and unconscious mechanism that
   drives the initial neural responses to observed pain in others.}},

   forebrain}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Songbirds are an excellent model for investigating the perception of
   learned complex acoustic communication signals. Male European starlings
   (Sturnus vulgaris) sing throughout the year distinct types of song that
   bear either social or individual information. Although the relative
   importance of social and individual information changes seasonally,
   evidence of functional seasonal changes in neural response to these
   songs remains elusive. We thus decided to use in vivo functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine auditory responses of male
   starlings that were exposed to songs that convey different levels of
   information (species-specific and group identity or individual
   identity), both during (when mate recognition is particularly important)
   and outside the breeding season (when group recognition is particularly
   important). We report three main findings: (1) the auditory area
   caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), an auditory region that is analogous to
   the mammalian auditory cortex, is clearly involved in the
   processing/categorization of conspecific songs; (2) season-related
   change in differential song processing is limited to acaudal part of
   NCM; in the more rostral parts, songs bearing individual information
   induce higher BOLD responses than songs bearing species and group
   information, regardless of the season; (3) the differentiation between
   songs bearing species and group information and songs bearing individual
   information seems to be biased toward the right hemisphere. This study
   provides evidence that auditory processing of behaviorally-relevant
   (conspecific) communication signals changes seasonally,}},

   Behaviorally, we find a model-based algorithm characterized subject
   predictions better than several alternative models. Notably, when the
   agent's prediction was concordant rather than discordant with the
   subject's own likely prediction, participants credited people more than
   algorithms for correct predictions and penalized them less for incorrect
   predictions. Neurally, many components of the mentalizing network medial
   prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, temporoparietal junction,
   and precuneus represented or updated expertise beliefs about both people
   and algorithms. Moreover, activity in lateral orbitofrontal and medial

   people and algorithms. These findings provide basic insights into the

   moves by higher-skilled and lower-skilled players}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Expert soccer players are able to utilize their opponents' early body
   kinematics to predict the direction in which the opponent will move. We
   have previously demonstrated enhanced fMRI activation in experts in the
   motor components of an action observation network (AON) during sports
   anticipation tasks. Soccer players often need to prevent opponents from
   successfully predicting their line of attack, and consequently may try
   to deceive them; for example, by performing a step-over. We examined how
   AON activations and expertise effects are modified by the presence of
   deception. Three groups of participants; higher-skilled males,
   lower-skilled males, and lower-skilled females, viewed video clips in
   point-light format, from a defender's perspective, of a player
   approaching and turning with the ball. The observer's task in the
   scanner was to determine whether the move was normal or deceptive
   (involving a step-over), while whole-brain functional images were
   acquired. In a second counterbalanced block with identical stimuli the
   task was to predict the direction of the ball. Activations of AON for
   identification of deception overlapped with activations from the
   direction identification task. Higher-skilled players showed
   significantly greater activation than lower-skilled players in a subset
   of AON areas; and lower-skilled males in turn showed greater activation
   than lower-skilled females, but females showed more activation in visual
   cortex. Activation was greater for deception identification than for
   direction identification in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial
   frontal cortex, anterior insula, cingulate gyrus, and premotor cortex.
   Conversely, greater activation for direction than deception
   identification was found in anterior cingulate cortex and caudate
   nucleus. Results are consistent with the view that explicit
   identification of deceptive moves entails cognitive effort and also
   activates limbic structures associated with social cognition and
   affective responses.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{People have a memory advantage for faces that belong to the same group,
   for example, that attend the same university or have the same
   personality type. Faces from such in-group members are assumed to
   receive more attention during memory encoding and are therefore
   recognized more accurately. Here we use event-related potentials related
   to memory encoding and retrieval to investigate the neural correlates of
   the in-group memory advantage. Using the minimal group procedure,
   subjects were classified based on a bogus personality test as belonging
   to one of two personality types. While the electroencephalogram was
   recorded, subjects studied and recognized faces supposedly belonging to
   the subject's own and the other personality type. Subjects recognized
   in-group faces more accurately than out-group faces but the effect size
   was small. Using the individual behavioral in-group memory advantage in
   multivariate analyses of covariance, we determined neural correlates of
   the in-group advantage. During memory encoding (300 to 1000 ms after
   stimulus onset), subjects with a high in-group memory advantage elicited
   more positive amplitudes for subsequently remembered in-group than
   out-group faces, showing that in-group faces received more attention and
   elicited more neural activity during initial encoding. Early during
   memory retrieval (300 to 500 ms), frontal brain areas were more
   activated for remembered in-group faces indicating an early detection of
   group membership. Surprisingly, the parietal old/new effect (600 to 900
   ms) thought to indicate recollection processes differed between in-group
   and out-group faces independent from the behavioral in-group memory
   advantage. This finding suggests that group membership affects memory
   retrieval independent of memory performance. Comparisons with a previous
   study on the other-race effect, another memory phenomenon influenced by
   social classification of faces, suggested that the in-group memory
   advantage is dominated by top-down processing whereas the other-race
   effect is also influenced by extensive perceptual experience.}},

Title = {{The effect of retrieval focus and emotional valence on the inferior
   frontal cortex activity during autobiographical recollection}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Although available evidence points to a role of the inferior frontal
   cortex (IFC) in both emotion processing and autobiographical memory (AM)
   recollection, it is unclear what the role of this region is in emotional
   AM recollection. The present study investigated whether IFC activity can
   be influenced by manipulations of the retrieval focus (emotional vs.
   non-emotional) and whether this influence is similar for AMs with
   positive and negative emotional valence. Participants were asked to
   focus either on emotional (Emotion condition) or on non-emotional
   contextual (Context condition) details during the elaboration of
   positive and negative AMs, while fMRI data were collected. The study
   yielded two main findings: (1) Focusing on Emotion compared to Context
   during AM recollection was associated with increased activity in
   bilateral IFC, for positive AMs, whereas negative AMs produced similarly
   high IFC activity during Emotion and Context conditions; (2) There was a
   hemispheric dissociation in the IFC linked to the experiencing of
   emotion and the focus of AM recollection, such that the left IFC
   activity correlated positively with the subjective re-experience of
   emotion during the Emotion condition, whereas the right IFC activity
   correlated negatively with the subjective re-experience of emotion
   during the Context condition, for both positive and negative AMs.
   Overall, the present findings suggest that IFCs involvement during the
   recollection of emotional AMs is susceptible to manipulations of the
   retrieval focus only in the case of positive AMs, and that this region
   plays a role in both the enhancement and inhibition of emotional
   experience during AM recollection.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To characterize the nature and extent of basal ganglia
   involvement in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) genotypes in vivo.
   Methods: Forty-four healthy controls and 39 patients with ALS were
   included in the study. Thirty patients with ALS had a negative C9orf72
   status and 9 patients with ALS carried the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat
   expansion. High-resolution T1-weighted MRI data were used for
   model-based subcortical registration and segmentation. Fifteen
   subcortical structures were studied with both volumetric and vertex-wise
   approaches. Changes in basal ganglia diffusivity parameters were also
   assessed.
   Results: Using age as a covariate, patients with ALS who were C9orf72
   repeat negative showed significant volume reductions in the left caudate
   nucleus (p = 0.01), left hippocampus (p = 0.007), and right accumbens
   nucleus (p = 0.001) compared with healthy controls. Vertex-wise shape
   analyses revealed changes affecting the superior and inferior aspects of
   the bilateral thalami, the lateral and inferior portion of the left
   hippocampus, and the medial and superior aspect of the left caudate.
   Basal ganglia pathology was more extensive in patients with ALS carrying
   the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion.
   Conclusions: ALS is associated with widespread basal ganglia
   involvement. Caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens atrophy
   are key features of ALS. Dysfunction of frontostriatal networks is
   likely to contribute to the unique neuropsychological profile of ALS,
   dominated by executive dysfunction, apathy, and deficits in social
   cognition. Our quantitative imaging findings are consistent with
   postmortem studies and indicate that subcortical gray matter structures
   should be included in future biomarker studies of ALS.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{In life, everyone goes through hurtful events caused by significant
   others: a deceiving friend, a betraying partner, or an unjustly blaming
   parent. In response to painful emotions, individuals may react with
   anger, hostility, and the desire for revenge. As an alternative, they
   may decide to forgive the wrongdoer and relinquish resentment. In the
   present study, we examined the brain correlates of forgiveness using
   functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Healthy participants were
   induced to imagine social scenarios that described emotionally hurtful
   events followed by the indication to either forgive the imagined
   offenders, or harbor a grudge toward them. Subjects rated their
   imaginative skills, levels of anger, frustration, and/or relief when
   imagining negative events as well as following forgiveness. Forgiveness
   was associated with positive emotional states as compared to
   unforgiveness. Granting forgiveness was associated with activations in a
   brain network involved in theory of mind, empathy, and the regulation of
   affect through cognition, which comprised the precuneus, right inferior
   parietal regions, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our results
   uncovered the neuronal basis of reappraisal-driven forgiveness, and
   extend extant data on emotional regulation to the resolution of anger
   and resentment following negative interpersonal events.}},

Title = {{Neural activity in relation to empirically derived personality syndromes
   in depression using a psychodynamic fMRI paradigm}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The heterogeneity between patients with depression cannot be
   captured adequately with existing descriptive systems of diagnosis and
   neurobiological models of depression. Furthermore, considering the
   highly individual nature of depression, the application of general
   stimuli in past research efforts may not capture the essence of the
   disorder. This study aims to identify subtypes of depression by using
   empirically derived personality syndromes, and to explore neural
   correlates of the derived personality syndromes.
   Materials and Methods: In the present exploratory study, an individually
   tailored and psychodynamically based functional magnetic resonance
   imaging paradigm using dysfunctional relationship patterns was presented
   to 20 chronically depressed patients.
   Results from the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure (SWAP-200) were
   analyzed by Q-factor analysis to identify clinically relevant subgroups
   of depression and related brain activation. Results: The principle
   component analysis of SWAP-200 items from all 20 patients lead to a
   two-factor solution: ``Depressive Personality{''} and
   ``Emotional-Hostile-Externalizing Personality.{''} Both factors were
   used in a whole-brain correlational analysis but only the second factor
   yielded significant positive correlations in four regions: a large
   cluster in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the left ventral
   striatum, a small cluster in the left temporal pole, and another small
   cluster in the right middle frontal gyrus.
   Discussion: The degree to which patients with depression score high on
   the factor ``Emotional-Hostile-Externalizing Personality{''} correlated
   with relatively higher activity in three key areas involved in emotion
   processing, evaluation of reward/punishment, negative cognitions,
   depressive pathology, and social knowledge(OFC, ventral striatum,
   temporal pole). Results may contribute to an alternative description of
   neural correlates of depression showing differential brain activation
   dependent on the extent of specific personality syndromes in depression.}},

Title = {{Decoding Humor Experiences from Brain Activity of People Viewing Comedy
   Movies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Humans naturally have a sense of humor. Experiencing humor not only
   encourages social interactions, but also produces positive physiological
   effects on the human body, such as lowering blood pressure. Recent
   neuro-imaging studies have shown evidence for distinct mental state
   changes at work in people experiencing humor. However, the temporal
   characteristics of these changes remain elusive. In this paper, we
   objectively measured humor-related mental states from single-trial
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data obtained while
   subjects viewed comedy TV programs. Measured fMRI data were labeled on
   the basis of the lag before or after the viewer's perception of humor
   (humor onset) determined by the viewer-reported humor experiences during
   the fMRI scans. We trained multiple binary classifiers, or decoders, to
   distinguish between fMRI data obtained at each lag from ones obtained
   during a neutral state in which subjects were not experiencing humor. As
   a result, in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the right
   temporal area, the decoders showed significant classification accuracies
   even at two seconds ahead of the humor onsets. Furthermore, given a time
   series of fMRI data obtained during movie viewing, we found that the
   decoders with significant performance were also able to predict the
   upcoming humor events on a volume-by-volume basis. Taking into account
   the hemodynamic delay, our results suggest that the upcoming humor
   events are encoded in specific brain areas up to about five seconds
   before the awareness of experiencing humor. Our results provide evidence
   that there exists a mental state lasting for a few seconds before actual
   humor perception, as if a viewer is expecting the future humorous
   events.}},

Abstract = {{The auditory system continuously monitors the environment for
   irregularities in an automatic, preattentive fashion. This is presumably
   accomplished by two mechanisms: a sensory mechanism detects a deviant
   sound on the basis of differential refractoriness of neural populations
   sensitive to the standard and deviant sounds, whereas the cognitive
   mechanism reveals deviance by comparing incoming auditory information
   with a template derived from previous input. Using fast event-related
   high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla we show
   that both mechanisms can be mapped to different parts of the auditory
   cortex both at the group level and the single-subject level. The sensory
   mechanism is supported by primary auditory areas in Heschl's gyrus
   whereas the cognitive mechanism is implemented in more anterior
   secondary auditory areas. Both mechanisms are equally engaged by simple
   sine-wave tones and speech-related phonemes indicating that streams of
   speech and non-speech stimuli are processed in a similar fashion. (C)

Abstract = {{Speech comprehension relies on auditory as well as visual information,
   and is enhanced in healthy subjects, when audiovisual (AV) information
   is present. Patients with schizophrenia have been reported to have
   problems regarding this AV integration process, but little is known
   about. which underlying neural processes are altered. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 15 schizophrenia patients
   (SP) and 15 healthy controls (HC) to study functional connectivity of
   Broca's area by means of a beta series correlation method during
   perception of audiovisually presented bisyllabic German nouns, in which
   audio and video either matched or did not match. Broca's area of SP
   showed stronger connectivity with supplementary motor cortex for
   incongruent trials whereas HC connectivity was stronger for congruent
   trials. The right posterior superior temporal sulcus (RpSTS) area showed
   differences in connectivity for congruent and incongruent trials in HC
   in contrast to SP where the connectivity was similar for both
   conditions. These smaller differences in connectivity in SP suggest a
   less adaptive processing of audiovisually congruent and incongruent
   speech. The findings imply that AV integration problems in schizophrenia
   are associated with maladaptive connectivity of Broca's and RpSTS area
   in particular when confronted with incongruent stimuli. Results are
   discussed in light of recent AV speech perception models. (C) 2013 IBRO.

Abstract = {{Complex patterns of image motion (contracting, expanding, rotating, and
   spiraling fields) are important in the coordination of visually guided
   behaviors. Whereas specialized detectors in monkey visual cortex show
   selectivity for particular patterns of complex motion, their
   representation in human visual cortex remains unclear. In the present
   study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to
   investigate the sensitivity of functionally defined regions of human
   visual cortex to parametrically modulated complex motion trajectories,
   coupled with complementary psychophysical testing. A unique stimulus
   design made it possible to disambiguate the neural responses and
   psychophysical sensitivity to complex motions per se from the
   distribution of local motions relative to the fovea, which are known to
   enhance cortical activity when presented radial to fixation. This
   involved presenting several small, separate motion fields in the
   periphery in a manner that distinguished them from global optic flow
   patterns. The patterns were morphed through complex motion space in a
   systematic time-locked fashion when presented in the scanner.
   Anisotropies were observed in the fMRI signal, marked by an enhanced
   response to expanding vs. contracting fields, even in early visual
   cortex. Anisotropies in the psychophysical sensitivity measures followed
   a similar pattern that was correlated with activity in areas hV4, V5/MT,
   and MST. This represents the first systematic examination of complex
   motion perception at both a behavioral and neural level in human
   observers. The characteristic processing anisotropy revealed in both
   data sets can inform models of complex motion processing, particularly
   with respect to computations performed in early visual cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Despite remarkable behavioral gender differences in patients with autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD), and growing evidence for a diminished
   male:female ratio for the putative male disorder ASD, aspects of gender
   are not addressed accordingly in ASD research. Our study aims at filling
   this gap by exploring empathy abilities in a group of 28 patients with
   high-functioning ASD and 28 gender-, age- and education-matched
   non-autistic subjects, for the first time by means of functional
   neuroimaging (fMRI). In an event-related fMRI paradigm, emotional (E)
   and neutral (N) video clips presented actors telling self-related short
   stories. After each clip, participants were asked to indicate their own
   emotion and its intensity as well as the emotion and intensity perceived
   for the actor. Behaviorally, we found significantly less empathic
   responses in the overall ASD group compared with non-autistic subjects,
   and inadequate emotion recognition for the neutral clips in the female
   ASD group compared with healthy women. Neurally, increased activation of
   the bilateral medial frontal gyrus was found in male patients compared
   with female patients, a pattern which was not present in the
   non-autistic group. Additionally, autistic women exhibited decreased
   activation of midbrain and limbic regions compared with non-autistic
   women, whereas there was no significant difference within the male
   group. While we did not find a fundamental empathic deficit in autistic
   patients, our data propose different ways of processing empathy in
   autistic men and women, suggesting stronger impairments in cognitive
   aspects of empathy/theory of mind for men, and alterations of social
   reciprocity for women. Autism Res 2013, 6: 506-521. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Decision-making research has thoroughly investigated how people choose
   from a set of externally provided options. However, in ill-structured
   real-world environments, possible options for action are not defined by
   the situation but have to be generated by the agent. Here, we apply
   behavioral analysis (Study 1) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (Study 2) to investigate option generation and subsequent choice. For
   this purpose, we employ a new experimental task that requires
   participants to generate options for simple real-world scenarios and to
   subsequently decide among the generated options. Correlational analysis
   with a cognitive test battery suggests that retrieval of options from
   long-term memory is a relevant process during option generation. The
   results of the fMRI study demonstrate that option generation in simple
   real-world scenarios recruits the anterior prefrontal cortex.
   Furthermore, we show that choice behavior and its neural correlates
   differ between self-generated and externally provided options.
   Specifically, choice between self-generated options is associated with
   stronger recruitment of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. This
   impact of option generation on subsequent choice underlines the need for
   an expanded model of decision making to accommodate choice between
   self-generated options.}},

Abstract = {{Human social interactions are complex behaviors requiring the concerted
   effort of multiple neural systems to track and monitor the individuals
   around us. Cognitively, adjusting our behavior on the basis of changing
   social cues such as facial expressions relies on working memory and the
   ability to disambiguate, or separate, the representations of overlapping
   stimuli resulting from viewing the same individual with different facial
   expressions. We conducted an fMRI experiment examining the brain regions
   contributing to the encoding, maintenance, and retrieval of overlapping
   identity information during working memory using a delayed
   match-to-sample task. In the overlapping condition, two faces from the
   same individual with different facial expressions were presented at
   sample. In the nonoverlapping condition, the two sample faces were from
   two different individuals with different expressions. fMRI activity was
   assessed by contrasting the overlapping and nonoverlapping conditions at
   sample, delay, and test. The lateral orbitofrontal cortex showed
   increased fMRI signal in the overlapping condition in all three phases
   of the delayed match-to-sample task and increased functional
   connectivity with the hippocampus when encoding overlapping stimuli. The
   hippocampus showed increased fMRI signal at test. These data suggest
   that lateral orbitofrontal cortex helps encode and maintain
   representations of overlapping stimuli in working memory, whereas the
   orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus contribute to the successful
   retrieval of overlapping stimuli. We suggest that the lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex and hippocampus play a role in encoding,
   maintaining, and retrieving social cues, especially when multiple
   interactions with an individual need to be disambiguated in a rapidly
   changing social context in order to make appropriate social responses.}},

Abstract = {{A dysfunction in working memory (WM) is a core cognitive impairment in
   schizophrenia that involves the cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network
   We propose that in addition to other often-referred markers, the signal
   reduction in the network during verbal working memory (VWM) is a stable
   and intrinsic indicator of illness. We presented a Sternberg VWM task to
   46 patients with schizophrenia and 46 healthy controls matched on
   performance accuracy during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Reduced activation was demonstrated in the thalamus, cerebellar
   vermis, pons and the triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)
   in the patient group. We also found a ``failure of deactivation{''} in
   the default mode network (DMN) in patients as represented by a low
   versus high load VWM. In addition, a reduced left lateralization in the
   triangular and opercular parts of the IFG was observed in the patient
   group replicating previous ``failure of lateralization{''} findings in
   schizophrenia. A comparison of long (10 to 19 years) and short (3 to 9
   years) durations of illness (DoIs) demonstrated that the Dol was only
   associated with the activation changes in the middle frontal gyros and
   lateral temporal cortex but not with the IFG-subcortico-cerebellar
   regions observed. These alterations were consistent with the cognitive
   dysmetria described in the cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network in
   schizophrenia. In conclusion, the combination of reduced activation in
   the cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network during VWM in particular,
   reduced deactivation in the DMN and reduced lateralization in the IFG is
   thought to be stable neuroimaging signatures of schizophrenia. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is one of the most devastating of all mental illnesses,
   and has dimensional characteristics that include both positive and
   negative symptoms. One problem reported in schizophrenia patients is
   that they Lend to show deficits in face emotion processing, on which
   negative symptoms are thought to have stronger influence. In this study,
   four event-related potential (ERP) components (P100, N170, N250, and
   P300) and their source activities were analyzed using EEG data acquired
   from 23 schizophrenia patients while they were presented with facial
   emotion picture stimuli. Correlations between positive and negative
   syndrome scale (PANSS) scores and source activations during facial
   emotion processing, were calculated to identify the brain areas affected
   by symptom scores. Our analysis demonstrates that PANSS positive scores
   are negatively correlated with major areas of the left temporal lobule
   for early ERP components (P100, N170) and with the right middle frontal
   lobule for a later component (N250), which indicates that positive
   symptoms affect both early face processing and facial emotion
   processing. On the other hand, PANSS negative scores are negatively
   correlated with several clustered regions, including the left fusiform
   gyrus (at P100), most of which are not overlapped with regions showing
   Correlations with PANSS positive scores. Our results suggest that
   positive and negative symptoms affect independent brain regions during
   facial emotion processing, which may help to explain the heterogeneous
   characteristics of schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: Pediatric bipolar disorder involves poor social functioning,
   but the neural mechanisms underlying these deficits are not well
   understood. Previous neuroimaging studies have found deficits in
   emotional face processing localized to emotional brain regions. However,
   few studies have examined dysfunction in other regions of the face
   processing circuit. This study assessed hypoactivation in key face
   processing regions of the brain in pediatric bipolar disorder. Method:
   Youth with a bipolar spectrum diagnosis (n = 20) were matched to a
   nonbipolar clinical group (n = 20), with similar demographics and
   comorbid diagnoses, and a healthy control group (n = 20). Youth
   participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning
   which employed a task-irrelevant emotion processing design in which
   processing of facial emotions was not germane to task performance.
   Results: Hypoactivation, isolated to the fusiform gyrus, was found when
   viewing animated, emerging facial expressions of happiness, sadness,
   fearfulness, and especially anger in pediatric bipolar participants
   relative to matched clinical and healthy control groups. Conclusions:
   The results of the study imply that differences exist in visual regions
   of the brain's face processing system and are not solely isolated to
   emotional brain regions such as the amygdala. Findings are discussed in
   relation to facial emotion recognition and fusiform gyrus deficits
   previously reported in the autism literature. Behavioral interventions
   targeting attention to facial stimuli might be explored as possible
   treatments for bipolar disorder in youth.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the functional anatomy of
   decision-making during the Iowa Gambling Task in patients with
   Parkinson's disease. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) during a computerized version of IGT to compare 18 PD
   patients on dopaminergic medication in the ON state and 18 healthy
   control subjects. Our analyses focused on outcome evaluation following
   card selection, because we expected this aspect of decision-making to be
   impaired in PD patients. The PD patients exhibited lower activation of
   the left putamen than the control group as a reaction to penalty. Using
   psychophysiological interaction analysis, we identified decreased
   functional connectivity between the right globus pallidus internus and
   the left anterior cingulate gyrus in the PD group. In contrast,
   increased connectivity between these structures was observed after
   penalty in the control group. Our results suggest altered functioning of
   the basal ganglia and their connections with the cortical structures
   involved in the limbic loop (e.g., the limbic fronto-striatal circuit of
   the basal ganglia) during decision-making in PD patients. Differences in
   the response to loss could be associated with insufficient negative
   reinforcement after a loss in PD patients in the ON state in comparison
   to a healthy population.}},

Abstract = {{Complex grammatical structures are mastered late in language
   acquisition. We studied age-effects on performance in object
   topicalization in 48 typically developing German-speaking participants
   (aged 8-30 years) and in five patients (children and adolescents) with
   lesion-induced atypical language representation. Production was tested
   by a sentence repetition task, comprehension by an acting out task.
   Three topicalized conditions with differing disambiguation (agreement,
   case, and case plus agreement) were contrasted with canonical control
   sentences.
   Children's (aged 8-13 years) performance was significantly below that of
   adolescents and adults in all topicalized conditions. All participants
   made most mistakes in the agreement condition. Patients showed
   remarkable difficulties as compared with age-appropriate control groups
   in all topicalization conditions and across age-groups. Despite the
   small sample size, the consistency of these difficulties might hint to
   the importance of an intact typical neural language substrate for
   processing complex grammatical structures even in very early brain
   lesions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When asked to judge the membership of typical (e.g., car) vs. atypical
   (e.g., train) pictures of a category (e. g., vehicle), native English (N
   = 18) and native Chinese speakers (N = 18) showed distinctive patterns
   of brain activity despite showing similar behavioral responses.
   Moreover, these differences were mainly due to the amount and
   pervasiveness of category information linguistically embedded in the
   everyday names of the items in the respective languages, with important
   differences across languages in how pervasive category labels are
   embedded in item-level terms. Nonetheless, the left inferior frontal
   gyrus and the bilateral medial frontal gyrus are the most consistent
   neural correlates of category typicality that persist across languages
   and linguistic cues. These data together suggest that both cross- and
   within-language differences in the explicitness of category information
   have strong effects on the nature of categorization processes performed
   by the brain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{127}},

Pages = {{452-462}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This fMRI study explores how nonlinguistic cues modulate lexical
   activation in the bilingual brain. We examined the influence of face
   race on bilingual language production in a picture-naming paradigm.
   Chinese-English bilinguals were presented with pictures of objects and
   images of faces (Asian or Caucasian). Participants named the picture in
   their first or second language (Chinese or English) in separate blocks.
   Face race and naming language were either congruent (e.g., naming in
   Chinese when seeing an Asian face) or incongruent (e.g., naming in
   English when seeing an Asian face). Our results revealed that face cues
   facilitate naming when the socio-cultural identity of the face is
   congruent with the naming language. The congruence effects are reflected
   as effective integration of lexical and facial cues in key brain regions
   including IFG, MFG, ACC, and caudate. Implications of the findings in
   light of theories of language processing and cultural priming are
   discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Neural processing of intentional biological motion in unaffected
   siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{297-306}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite often showing behaviorally typical levels of social cognitive
   ability, unaffected siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder
   have been found to show similar functional and morphological deficits
   within brain regions associated with social processing. They have also
   been reported to show increased activation to biological motion in these
   same regions, such as the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS),
   relative to both children with autism and control children. It has been
   suggested that this increased activation may represent a compensatory
   reorganization of these regions as a result of the highly heritable
   genetic influence of autism. However, the response patterns of
   unaffected siblings in the domain of action perception are unstudied,
   and the phenomenon of compensatory activation has not yet been
   replicated. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   to determine the neural responses to intentional biological actions in
   22 siblings of children with autism and 22 matched controls. The
   presented actions were either congruent or incongruent with the actor's
   emotional cue. Prior studies reported that typically developing children
   and adults, but not children with autism, show increased activation to
   incongruent actions (relative to congruent), within the pSTS and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We report that unaffected siblings did
   not show a compensatory response, or a preference for incongruent over
   congruent trials, in any brain region. Moreover, interaction analyses
   revealed a sub-region of the pSTS in which control children showed an
   incongruency preference to a significantly greater degree than siblings,
   which suggests a localized deficit in siblings. A sample of children
   with autism also did not show differential activation in the pSTS,
   providing further evidence that it is an area of selective disruption in
   children with autism and siblings. While reduced activation to both
   conditions was unique to the autism sample, lack of differentiation to
   incongruent and congruent intentional actions was common to both
   children with ASD and unaffected siblings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Primary objective: Brain structures and their white matter connections
   that may contribute to emotion processing and may be vulnerable to
   disruption by a traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurring in childhood have
   not been thoroughly explored.
   Research design and methods: The current investigation examines the
   relationship between diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, including
   fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and
   3-month post-injury performance on a task of emotion prosody recognition
   and a control task of phonological discrimination in a group of 91
   children who sustained either a moderate-to-severe TBI (n = 45) or
   orthopaedic injury (OI) (n = 46).
   Main outcomes and results: Brain-behaviour findings within OI
   participants confirmed relationships between several significant white
   matter tracts in emotional prosody performance (i.e. the cingulum
   bundle, genu of the corpus callosum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus
   (ILF) and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF). The cingulum
   and genu were also related to phonological discrimination performance.
   The TBI group demonstrated few strong brain behaviour relationships,
   with significant findings emerging only in the cingulum bundle for
   Emotional Prosody and the genu for Phonological Processing.
   Conclusion: The lack of clear relationships in the TBI group is
   discussed in terms of the likely disruption to cortical networks
   secondary to significant brain injuries.}},

Abstract = {{Winning against an opponent in a competitive video game can be expected
   to be more rewarding than losing, especially when the opponent is a
   fellow human player rather than a computer. We show that winning versus
   losing in a first-person video game activates the brains reward circuit
   and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) differently depending on
   the type of the opponent. Participants played a competitive tank shooter
   game against alleged human and computer opponents while their brain
   activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Brain
   responses to wins and losses were contrasted by fitting an event-related
   model to the hemodynamic data. Stronger activation to winning was
   observed in ventral and dorsal striatum as well as in vmPFC. Activation
   in ventral striatum was associated with participants self-ratings of
   pleasure. During winning, ventral striatum showed stronger functional
   coupling with right insula, and weaker coupling with dorsal striatum,
   sensorimotor pre- and postcentral gyri, and visual association cortices.
   The vmPFC and dorsal striatum responses were stronger to winning when
   the subject was playing against a human rather than a computer. These
   results highlight the importance of social context in the neural
   encoding of reward value.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Maternal care (MC) and dopamine modulate brain activity
   during emotion processing in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), striatum and
   amygdala. Reuptake of dopamine from the synapse is performed by the
   dopamine transporter (DAT), whose abundance is predicted by variation in
   its gene (DAT 3'VNTR; 10 > 9-repeat alleles). Here, we investigated the
   interaction between perceived MC and DAT 3'VNTR genotype on brain
   activity during processing of aversive facial emotional stimuli.
   Methods: Sixty-one healthy subjects were genotyped for DAT 3'VNTR and
   categorized in low and high MC individuals. They underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging while performing a task requiring gender
   discrimination of facial stimuli with angry, fearful or neutral
   expressions.
   Results: An interaction between facial expression, DAT genotype and MC
   was found in left IFG, such that low MC and homozygosity for the
   10-repeat allele are associated with greater activity during processing
   of fearful faces. This greater activity was also inversely correlated
   with a measure of emotion control as scored with the Big Five
   Questionnaire. Moreover, MC and DAT genotype described a double
   dissociation on functional connectivity between IFG and amygdala.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that perceived early parental bonding
   may interact with DAT 3'VNTR genotype in modulating brain activity
   during emotionally relevant inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Brief periods of unconscious thought (UT) have been shown to improve
   decision making compared with making an immediate decision (ID). We
   reveal a neural mechanism for UT in decision making using blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Participants (N = 33) encoded information on a set of consumer products
   (e.g. 48 attributes describing four different cars), and we manipulated
   whether participants (i) consciously thought about this information
   (conscious thought), (ii) completed a difficult 2-back working memory
   task (UT) or (iii) made an immediate decision about the consumer
   products (ID) in a within-subjects blocked design. To differentiate UT
   neural activity from 2-back working memory neural activity, participants
   completed an independent 2-back task and this neural activity was
   subtracted from neural activity occurring during the UT 2-back task.
   Consistent with a neural reactivation account, we found that the same
   regions activated during the encoding of complex decision information
   (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left intermediate visual
   cortex) continued to be activated during a subsequent 2-min UT period.
   Moreover, neural reactivation in these regions was predictive of
   subsequent behavioral decision-making performance after the UT period.
   These results provide initial evidence for post-encoding unconscious
   neural reactivation in facilitating decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Social categorization is known to be an important part of social
   cognition. The categorizations we use, despite their multitude,
   frequently take the form of the general ingroup/outgroup distinction. A
   meta-analysis of 33 fMRI studies, reporting selective activations to
   various social groups, was used to identify common neural structures
   responsible for relational representation of social structure.
   Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analysis revealed areas in
   bilateral amygdala, cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, right TPJ and right
   insula as implementing various aspects of social categorization.
   Activation of amygdala can be associated with modulation of behavioral
   response to subjectively significant stimuli. A more ventral part of
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can be associated with self-referential
   reasoning about ingroup members while a more dorsal part of ACC is
   involved in the regulation of emotions toward outgroup members. Right
   insula can be engaged in the modulation of outgroup avoidance behavior.
   Fusiform gyrus (FG) appears to be directly involved in social
   categorization process via top-down modulation of social perception. Yet
   it is difficult to associate any of the revealed clusters with the
   relational ingroup/outgroup structure.}},

Abstract = {{Humans tend to have a positive self-evaluation (PSE). To what extent
   positive self-perception is interacting with valenced self-related

   decide in two conditions whether presented positive and negative
   personality traits characterized their own selves (self-evaluation) or
   an intimate other (other-evaluation). A lexical condition served as
   control task. In a subsequent unannounced recognition task, trait
   adjectives had to be classified as old or new. Activation during
   positive self- vs positive other-evaluation was found in the medial
   ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal gyri, the parahippocampus and the
   supplementary motor area. Memory increased for positive personality
   traits and traits that had been referred to oneself or the other. In
   contrast to adjectives of the other-evaluation or lexical condition,
   recollection of negative vs positive traits of the self-evaluation
   condition specifically induced increased activation in the hippocampus
   and several prefrontal and temporal areas. Our data imply a specific
   network for PSE (although intimate others are perceived similarly).
   Moreover, memory for traits contradicting PSE resulted in activation
   increases indicating greater cognitive effort and emotional involvement.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperation and betrayal are universal features of social interactions,
   and knowing who to trust is vital in human society. Previous studies
   have identified brain regions engaged by decision making during social
   encounters, but the mechanisms supporting modification of future
   behaviour by utilizing social experience are not well characterized.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that
   cooperation and betrayal during social exchanges elicit specific
   patterns of neural activity associated with future behaviour.
   Unanticipated cooperation leads to greater behavioural adaptation than
   unexpected betrayal, and is signalled by specific neural responses in
   the striatum and midbrain. Neural responses to betrayal and willingness
   to trust novel partners both decrease as the number of individuals
   encountered during repeated social encounters increases. We propose
   that, as social groups increase in size, uncooperative or untrustworthy
   behaviour becomes progressively less surprising, with cooperation
   becoming increasingly important as a stimulus for social learning.
   Effects on reputation of non-trusting decisions may also act to drive
   pro-social behaviour. Our findings characterize the dynamic neural
   processes underlying social adaptation, and suggest that the brain is
   optimized to cooperate with trustworthy partners, rather than avoiding
   those who might betray us.}},

Abstract = {{It is a unique human ability to regulate negative thoughts and feelings.
   Two well-investigated emotion-regulation strategies (ERSs), cognitive
   reappraisal and expressive suppression, are associated with overlapping
   prefrontal neural correlates, but differ temporally during the
   emotion-generation process. Although functional imaging studies have
   mainly investigated these ERS as a reaction to an emotion-inducing
   event, the intention to regulate upcoming negative emotions might
   already be associated with differences in neural activity. Hence,
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was recorded in 42
   participants while they completed an emotion-regulation paradigm. During
   this task, participants were instructed to proactively prepare to use a
   specific ERS knowing that a negative, high-arousing image would appear
   after the preparation period. As expected, the results demonstrated
   prefrontal and parietal activation while participants were suppressing
   or reappraising their emotions (family-wise error (FWE)-corrected). The
   intention to suppress emotions was associated with increased activation
   in the right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral putamen,
   pre-supplementary motor area and right supramarginal gyrus
   (FWE-corrected). This enhanced proactive inhibitory control: (i)
   predicted decreased motoric activity during the actual suppression of
   emotional expressions and (2) trended toward a significant association
   with how successfully participants suppressed their emotions. However,
   neural correlates of preparatory control for cognitive reappraisal were
   not observed, possibly because contextual cues about the upcoming
   emotional stimulus are necessary to proactively start to cognitively
   reinterpret the situation.}},

Abstract = {{Amygdala structural and functional abnormalities have been associated to
   reactive aggression in previous studies. However, the possible linkage
   of these two types of anomalies has not been examined. We hypothesized
   that they would coincide in the same localizations, would be correlated
   in intensity and would be mediated by reactive aggression personality
   traits. Here violent (n = 25) and non-violent (n = 29) men were
   recruited on the basis of their reactive aggression. Callous-unemotional
   (CU) traits were also assessed. Gray matter concentration (gmC) and
   reactivity to fearful and neutral facial expressions were measured in
   dorsal and ventral amygdala partitions. The difference between responses
   to fearful and neutral facial expressions was calculated
   (F/N-difference). Violent individuals exhibited a smaller F/N-difference
   and gmC in the left dorsal amygdala, where a significant coincidence was
   found in a conjunction analysis. Moreover, the left amygdala
   F/N-difference and gmC were correlated to each other, an effect mediated
   by reactive aggression but not by CU. The F/N-difference was caused by
   increased reactivity to neutral faces. This suggests that anatomical
   anomalies within local circuitry (and not only altered input) may
   underlie the amygdala hyper-reactivity to social signals which is
   characteristic of reactive aggression.}},

   objects and scenery (e.g. two red cherries bound together). Supernatural
   believers reported seeing signs of how the situations were going to turn
   out in the pictures more often than skeptics did. Viewing the pictures
   activated the same brain regions among all participants (e.g. the left
   inferior frontal gyrus, IFG). However, the right IFG, previously
   associated with cognitive inhibition, was activated more strongly in
   skeptics than in supernatural believers, and its activation was
   negatively correlated to sign seeing in both participant groups. We
   discuss the implications of these findings for research on the universal

Abstract = {{Facial expressions convey important emotional and social information and
   are frequently applied in investigations of human affective processing.
   Dynamic faces may provide higher ecological validity to examine
   perceptual and cognitive processing of facial expressions. Higher order
   processing of emotional faces was addressed by varying the task and
   virtual face models systematically. Blood oxygenation level-dependent
   activation was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging in
   20 healthy volunteers while viewing and evaluating either emotion or
   gender intensity of dynamic face stimuli. A general linear model
   analysis revealed that high valence activated a network of
   motion-responsive areas, indicating that visual motion areas support
   perceptual coding for the motion-based intensity of facial expressions.
   The comparison of emotion with gender discrimination task revealed
   increased activation of inferior parietal lobule, which highlights the
   involvement of parietal areas in processing of high level features of
   faces. Dynamic emotional stimuli may help to emphasize functions of the
   hypothesized `extended' over the `core' system for face processing.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated cognitive control of social and nonsocial
   information in autism using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and a neurotypical
   control group completed an oddball target detection task where target
   stimuli were either faces or nonsocial objects previously shown to be
   related to circumscribed interests in autism. The ASD group demonstrated
   relatively increased activation to social targets in right insular
   cortex and in left superior frontal gyrus and relatively decreased
   activation to nonsocial targets related to circumscribed interests in
   multiple frontostriatal brain regions. Findings suggest that
   frontostriatal recruitment during cognitive control in ASD is contingent
   on stimulus type, with increased activation for social stimuli and
   decreased activation for nonsocial stimuli related to circumscribed
   interests.}},
