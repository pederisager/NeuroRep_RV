Abstract = {{Objective: In everyday life, parents must respond to and interact with
   children while in different situational contexts. How situational
   contexts influence parents' responses has not been systematically
   studied. Here we investigated mothers' versus nonmothers' neural
   responses to infant vocalizations in different situations with different
   task demands. Design: Using fMRI in 21 women (10 mothers), we explored
   the effects of being distracted by self-oriented (self-referential
   decisions about personality adjectives) versus goal-oriented (syllabic
   counting of personality adjectives) tasks while listening to infant cry
   in comparison with other emotional sounds (infant laughing, adult
   crying) on the activity of two medial nodes of the Default Mode Network
   (DMN): the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC). Results: In the self-oriented task while listening to
   infant cry, both mothers and nulliparas showed (weak) activation of the
   DMN; this response likely reflects a shift of attention from the task to
   the cry. In the goal-oriented task, mothers, not nulliparas, showed
   (weak) activation of the DMN; this result is compatible with
   interference of emotional sounds while attending to a goal-oriented
   task, an activity that deactivates the DMN. Conclusions: Mothers are
   prone to process infant cry and emotional sounds and are less distracted
   from doing so by situational contexts, demonstrating their greater
   sensitivity to emotional sounds such as cry. By contrast, situational
   context influenced brain responses to infant sounds in nulliparas.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence has demonstrated that sleep-related memory consolidation
   declines in ageing. However, little is known about age-related changes
   to sleep-related emotional memory consolidation, especially when
   considering the positivity effect observed in older adults. In the
   present study, we sought to explore whether there is a positive
   emotional bias in sleep-related memory consolidation among healthy older
   adults. Young and older adults were randomly assigned either into a
   sleep or wake condition. All participants encoded positive, negative,
   and neutral stimuli and underwent recognition tests immediately (test
   1), after a 12-hour sleep/wake interval (test 2), and 3 days after test
   2 (test 3). Results showed that age-related differences of sleep
   beneficial effect were modulated by emotion valence. In particular,
   sleep selectively enhanced positive memory in older adults, while in
   young adults sleep beneficial effect was manifested in neutral memory.
   Moreover, the sleep beneficial effect can be maintained at least 3 days
   in both young and older adults. These findings suggest that older adults
   had preserved but positive bias of sleep-related memory consolidation,
   which could be one of the underlying mechanisms for their generally
   better emotional well-being in daily life. These findings highlight the
   dynamic interplay among sleep and emotional memory in older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Previous studies suggested likely mechanisms underlying the
   dysfunction of the default mode network (DMN) in schizophrenia. However,
   altered patterns of the intrinsic activity of the DMN in both deficit
   schizophrenia (DS) and non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS) patients, as well
   as the neurocognitive relationships among them, remain unknown. This
   study explores the resting-state characteristics of the DMN activity in
   both DS and NDS patients, and further investigates correlations with
   neurocognitive features.
   Methods: Demographic, resting-state functional MRI, and neurocognitive
   data were collected in 37 DS and 38 NDS patients, as well as in 38
   matched healthy control subjects (HCs). Independent component analysis
   was conducted to investigate the characteristics of DMN activity and to
   further distinguish between common and specific altered regions. In
   addition, partial correlation analysis was conducted to examine
   associations between the activity of altered regions and neurocognitive
   assessments.
   Results: Overlapping altered brain activity was observed in both DS and
   NDS patients in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the left angular
   gyrus (ANG), and the calcarine sulcus (CAL) region. Furthermore,
   compared to HCs, DS patients showed less activity in the right inferior
   temporal gyrus, the right para-hippocampal gyrus / hippocampus (PHP /
   HIP), and the left precuneus (PCUN), while they showed increased
   activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Notably, NDS patients
   showed less activity in the bilateral middle occipital gyrus.
   Correlation analysis indicated that, in the DS group, both Trail Making
   Test (TMT)-B and spatial processing scores were positively associated
   with the activities of the left PCUN and the right PHP / HIP, while the
   Stroop color scores were negatively associated with PCC activity. In the
   NDS group, the TMT-B scores were associated with activities of the left
   MFG and CAL regions, while the scores of the Wechsler adult intelligence
   scale (Chinese revision) were negatively associated with CAL region
   activity.
   Conclusion: The present study demonstrates convergent and divergent
   altered patterns of the DMN in both DS and NDS patients. Importantly,
   the specific altered regions of the DMN in DS patients may be associated
   with extensive deficient neurocognition, indicating novel insights into
   the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most
   well-known psychiatric disorders, which can be destructive for its
   damage to people's normal cognitive, emotional and social functions.
   Personality refers to the unique and stable character of thinking and
   behavior style of an individual, which has long been thought as a key
   influence factor for MDD. Although some knowledge about the common
   neural basic between MDD and personality traits has been acquired, there
   are few studies exploring dynamic neural mechanism behind them, which
   changes brain connectivity pattern rapidly to adapt to the environment
   over time.
   Methods: In this study, the emerging dynamic functional network
   connectivity (DFNC) method was used in resting-state fMRI data to find
   the differences between healthy group (N=107) and MDD group (N=109) in
   state-based dynamic measures, and the correlations between these
   measures and personality traits (extraversion and neuroticism in Eysenck
   Personality Questionnaire, EPQ) were explored.
   Results: The results showed that MDD was significantly less than the
   health control group in dwell time and fraction time of state 4, which
   was positively correlated with extraversion score and negatively
   correlated with neuroticism score. Further exploration on state 4 showed
   that it had low modularity, hyper-connectedness of sensory-related
   regions and DMN, and weak connections between cortex and subcortical
   areas, which suggested that the absence of this state in MDD might
   represent a decrease in activity and positive emotions.
   Conclusion: We found the dynamic functional connectivity mechanism
   underlying MDD, confirmed our hypothesis that there existed the
   interacted relationship between trait, disease and the brain's dynamic
   characteristic, and suggested some reference for treatment of
   depression.}},

Title = {{fNIRS Responses in Professional Violinists While Playing Duets: Evidence
   for Distinct Leader and Follower Roles at the Brain Level}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Music played in ensembles is a naturalistic model to study joint action
   and leader-follower relationships. Recently, the investigation of the
   brain underpinnings of joint musical actions has gained attention;
   however, the cerebral correlates underlying the roles of leader and
   follower in music performance remain elusive. The present study
   addressed this question by simultaneously measuring the hemodynamic
   correlates of functional neural activity elicited during naturalistic
   violin duet performance using fNIRS. Findings revealed distinct patterns
   of functional brain activation when musicians played the Violin 2
   (follower) than the Violin 1 part (leader) in duets, both compared to
   solo performance. More specifically, results indicated that musicians
   playing the Violin 2 part had greater oxy-Hb activation in
   temporo-parietal (p = 0.02) and somatomotor (p = 0.04) regions during
   the duo condition in relation to the solo. On the other hand, there were
   no significant differences in the activation of these areas between
   duo/solo conditions during the execution of the Violin 1 part (p's >
   0.05). These findings suggest that ensemble cohesion during a musical
   performance may impose particular demands when musicians play the
   follower position, especially in brain areas associated with the
   processing of dynamic social information and motor simulation. This
   study is the first to use fNIRS hyperscanning technology to
   simultaneously measure the brain activity of two musicians during
   naturalistic music ensemble performance, opening new avenues for the
   investigation of brain correlates underlying joint musical actions with
   multiple subjects in a naturalistic environment.}},

Abstract = {{Differentiation between self-produced tactile stimuli and touch by
   others is necessary for social interactions and for a coherent concept
   of ``self.{''} The mechanisms underlying this distinction are unknown.
   Here, we investigated the distinction between self-and other-produced
   light touch in healthy volunteers using three different approaches:
   fMRI, behavioral testing, and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) at
   spinal and cortical levels. Using fMRI, we found self-other
   differentiation in somatosensory and sociocognitive areas. Other-touch
   was related to activation in several areas, including somatosensory
   cortex, insula, superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, striatum,
   amygdala, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex. During self-touch, we
   instead found deactivation in insula, anterior cingulate cortex,
   superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, and prefrontal
   areas. Deactivation extended into brain areas encoding low-level sensory
   representations, including thalamus and brainstem. These findings were
   replicated in a second cohort. During self-touch, the sensorimotor
   cortex was functionally connected to the insula, and the threshold for
   detection of an additional tactile stimulus was elevated. Differential
   encoding of self-vs. other-touch during fMRI correlated with the
   individual self-concept strength. In SEP, cortical amplitudes were
   reduced during self-touch, while latencies at cortical and spinal levels
   were faster for other-touch. We thus demonstrated a robust self-other
   distinction in brain areas related to somatosensory, social cognitive,
   and interoceptive processing. Signs of this distinction were evident at
   the spinal cord. Our results provide a framework for future studies in
   autism, schizophrenia, and emotionally unstable personality disorder,
   conditions where symptoms include social touch avoidance and poor
   self-vs.-other discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) may experience a
   series of emotional and mental problems accompanied by characteristic
   clinical symptoms. Depressive patients often have emotional recognition
   disorders, but the reasons remain unclear. Though a great many
   functional abnormalities have been observed in the brains of depressed
   patients, such abnormalities are not often related to clinical symptoms.
   Currently in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), syndrome
   differentiation for the MDD mainly consists of excess pattern (EP), and
   deficiency pattern (DP). EP and DP emphasize balance-regulation thought
   processes, and are widely used in diagnosis of diseases including
   depression, anxiety, insomnia, and other emotional disorders. We hope
   that syndrome differentiation in TCM can combine clinical symptoms and
   brain function more effectively. The present study investigated altered
   patterns and different association of brain activation in MDD patients
   with EP and DP during a facial emotion discrimination task with fMRI.
   Methods:A total of 45 patients (20 with EP and 25 with DP) and 18 normal
   controls participated in this study. Whole-brain functional scans were
   collected for each subject. Different patterns of brain activation and
   association during the facial emotion discrimination task were analyzed
   statistically.
   Results:Comparing all the MDD patients with the normal controls, there
   were no significant differences for sad vs. neutral condition or for
   happy vs. neutral condition (corrected p > 0.05). One-way ANCOVA showed
   significant differences in the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left
   insula, and the left caudate for sad vs. neutral condition across the
   DP, EP and NC groups (corrected p < 0.05). The whole brain activation
   comparison for sad vs. neutral condition between the EP MDD subtype and
   the DP MDD subtype further verified these differences in the left insula
   and left inferior frontal gyrus, discovering that these regions showed
   increased activation in EP MDD subtype compared with the DP MDD subtype
   (corrected p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in brain
   activation between each MDD subtype and the normal controls.
   Conclusion:Disparities in sad face processing exist between MDD patients
   with different TCM syndrome types, suggesting that TCM syndrome
   differentiation may provide a biological basis for negativity bias in
   depression, and may determine both symptom formation and social
   dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Despite emotion regulation being altered in patients with
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), no studies have investigated its
   relation to multimodal amygdala connectivity. We compared corticolimbic
   functional and structural connectivity between OCD patients and healthy
   controls (HCs), and correlated this with the dispositional use of
   emotion regulation strategies and with OCD severity. OCD patients (n =
   73) and HCs (n = 42) were assessed for suppression and reappraisal
   strategies using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) and for OCD
   severity using the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) connectivity maps were
   generated using subject-specific left amygdala (LA) and right amygdala
   (RA) masks. We identified between-group differences in amygdala
   whole-brain connectivity, and evaluated the moderating effect of ERQ
   strategies. Significant regions and amygdala seeds were used as targets
   in probabilistic tractography analysis. Patients scored higher in
   suppression and lower in reappraisal. We observed higher rs-fMRI
   RA-right postcentral gyrus (PCG) connectivity in HC, and in patients
   this was correlated with symptom severity. Reappraisal scores were
   associated with higher negative LA-left insula connectivity in HC, and
   suppression scores were negatively associated with LA-precuneus and
   angular gyri connectivity in OCD. Structurally, patients showed higher
   mean diffusivity in tracts connecting the amygdala with the other
   targets. RA-PCG connectivity is diminished in patients, while disrupted
   emotion regulation is related to altered amygdala connectivity with the
   insula and posterior brain regions. Our results are the first showing,
   from a multimodal perspective, the association between amygdala
   connectivity and specific emotional processing domains, emphasizing the
   importance of amygdala connectivity in OCD pathophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{Altruism is an evolutionarily conserved neurobehavioral mechanism for
   responding to others' needs, even at a cost to the self. It is thought
   to be rooted in offspring care and is most prominent in kin and close
   relationships, but also extends to others. We investigated the neural
   and genetic (OXTR rs53576 and AVPR1a rs3) correlates of altruism (with
   the Agape scale) in newlywed pair-bonds. Using functional MRI, 18
   participants were scanned (T1) while viewing happy or sad face images of
   the partner; of a stranger; or of a highly familiar, neutral
   acquaintance (HFN). Thirteen returned for another scan 11 months later
   (T2), and the additional control of a neutral expression of the partner
   and stranger was added. At both time points, the right ventral pallidum
   (VP), ventral tegmental area, and caudate showed significant responses
   to Partner (romantic) versus HFN images. At T2, altruism scores, OXTR
   rs53576 G alleles, and AVPR1a rs3 long alleles showed positive
   correlations with activity in the left VP/accumbens, amygdala, and
   septum for both Happy and Sad Partner expressions compared to neutral
   expressions, but not for strangers. However, when the Happy or Sad
   partner was compared to a Happy or Sad stranger, positive correlations
   were limited mainly to the amygdala/entorhinal cortex region. This study
   localized neural correlates of altruism in pair-bonds, including the VP
   and the amygdala. Also, responsivity in the VP showed increases or
   decreases as a function of OXTR and AVPR1a variants. These variations
   may contribute to behavioral heterogeneity and diverse strategies
   observed in complex social behaviors. In conclusion, the neural and
   hormonal basis of altruism in pair-bonds may be phylogenetically
   conserved, yet genetically variable, and promote pair-bond stability and
   enhance survival and cooperation of the species.}},

Abstract = {{Economic games are used to elicit a social, conflictual situation in
   which people have to make decisions weighing self-related and collective
   interests. Combining these games with task-based fMRI has been shown to
   be successful in investigating the neural underpinnings of cooperative
   behaviors. However, it remains elusive to which extent resting-state
   functional connectivity (RSFC) represents an individual's propensity to
   prosocial behaviors in the context of economic games. Here, we
   investigated whether task-free RSFC predicts individual differences in
   the propensity to trust and reciprocate in a one-round trust game (TG)
   employing a prediction-analytics framework. Our results demonstrated
   that individual differences in the propensity to trust and reciprocity
   could be predicted by individual differences in the RSFC. Different
   subnetworks of the default-mode network associated with mentalizing
   exclusively predicted trust and reciprocity. Moreover, reciprocity was
   further predicted by the frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular networks
   associated with cognitive control and saliency, respectively. Our
   results contribute to a better understanding of how complex social
   behaviors are enrooted in large-scale intrinsic brain dynamics, which
   may represent neuromarkers for impairment of prosocial behavior in

   linked to somatosensory as well as socio-affective processing in
   children and adults, were applied to the skin of the right leg during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. We examined infant brain
   responses in two regions-of-interest (ROIs) known to process gentle skin
   stroking - the postcentral gyrus and posterior insular cortex - and
   found significant responses in both ROIs. These results suggest that the
   neonate brain is responsive to gentle skin stroking within the first
   weeks of age, and that regions linked to primary somatosensory as well
   as socio-affective processing are activated. Our findings support the
   notion that social touch may play an important role in early life
   sensory processing. Future research will elucidate the significance of
   these findings for human brain development.}},

Abstract = {{Reflecting on oneself and others in relationships is an ability that is
   central to our social existence. Specifically, considering formative
   autobiographical experiences in relationships may contribute to more
   flexibility in perceiving, as well as in shaping present relationships.
   Reflecting on such experiences mobilizes different social cognitive and
   affective processes. We aim to explore the neural basis of these
   processes. With a newly developed functional magnetic imaging (fMRI)
   task, we investigated brain activation in 35 healthy individuals during
   recall of relationship episodes involving themselves or others. We found
   that recalling formative episodes involving themselves modulated brain
   activity in the right parahippocampus, left precuneus, bilateral
   fusiform gyrus, bilateral insula, and left presupplementary motor area.
   These areas are involved in memory processes, self-generated thought,
   and affective experience. The recall of relationship episodes involving
   others led to similar activation patterns. Our results underscore the
   close link between self-reflection, understanding others, and memory
   processes and emphasize the role of affective dimensions for
   self-relevant experiences. They contribute to a growing body of research
   on neural mechanisms involved in complex social cognitive processes
   decisive for our capacity to navigate our social environment.}},

Abstract = {{Human functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data are acquired
   while participants engage in diverse perceptual, motor, cognitive, and
   emotional tasks. Although data are acquired temporally, they are most
   often treated in a quasi-static manner. Yet, a fuller understanding of
   the mechanisms that support mental functions necessitates the
   characterization of dynamic properties. Here, we describe an approach
   employing a class of recurrent neural networks called reservoir
   computing, and show the feasibility and potential of using it for the
   analysis of temporal properties of brain data. We show that reservoirs
   can be used effectively both for condition classification and for
   characterizing lower-dimensional ``trajectories{''} of temporal data.
   Classification accuracy was approximately 90\% for short clips of
   ``social interactions{''} and around 70\% for clips extracted from movie
   segments. Data representations with 12 or fewer dimensions (from an
   original space with over 300) attained classification accuracy within
   5\% of the full data. We hypothesize that such low-dimensional
   trajectories may provide ``signatures{''} that can be associated with
   tasks and/or mental states. The approach was applied across participants
   (that is, training in one set of participants, and testing in a separate
   group), showing that representations generalized well to unseen
   participants. Taken together, we believe the present approach provides a
   promising framework to characterize dynamic fMRI information during both
   tasks and naturalistic conditions.}},

Title = {{Combining resting state functional MRI with intraoperative cortical
   stimulation to map the mentalizing network}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{628-636}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To infer the face-based mentalizing network from
   resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) using a seed-based correlation
   analysis with regions of interest identified during intraoperative
   cortical electrostimulation.
   Methods: We retrospectively included 23 patients in whom cortical
   electrostimulation induced transient face-based mentalizing impairment
   during `awake' craniotomy for resection of a right-sided diffuse
   low-grade glioma. Positive stimulation sites were recorded and
   transferred to the patients' preoperative normalized MRI, and then used
   as seeds for subsequent seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analyses.
   The analyses, conducted with an uncorrected voxel-level p-value of 0.001
   and a false-discovery-rate cluster-level p-value of 0.05, allowed
   identification of the cortical structures, functionally coupled with the
   mentalizing-related sites.
   Results: Two clusters of responsive stimulations were identified
   intraoperatively - one in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (dlPFC, n = 13) and the other in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG,
   n = 10). A whole group level analysis revealed that stimulation sites
   correlated mainly with voxels located in the pars triangularis of the
   IFG, the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, the
   temporo-parietal junction, the posterior superior temporal sulcus, and
   the posterior inferior temporal/fusiform gyrus. Other analyses, taking
   into consideration the location of the responsive sites (IFG versus
   dlPFC cluster), highlighted only minor differences between both groups.
   Conclusions: The present study successfully demonstrated the involvement
   of a large-scale neural network in the face-based mentalizing that
   strongly matches networks, classically identified using task-based fMRI
   paradigms. We thus validated the combination of rsfMRI and stimulation
   mapping as a powerful approach to identify functional networks in
   brain-damaged patients.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{741-757}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Voxelwise modeling (VM) is a powerful framework to predict single voxel
   responses evoked by a rich set of stimulus features present in complex
   natural stimuli. However, because VM disregards correlations across
   neighboring voxels, its sensitivity in detecting functional selectivity
   can be diminished in the presence of high levels of measurement noise.
   Here, we introduce spatially-informed voxelwise modeling (SPIN-VM) to
   take advantage of response correlations in spatial neighborhoods of
   voxels. To optimally utilize shared information, SPIN-VM performs
   regularization across spatial neighborhoods in addition to model
   features, while still generating single-voxel response predictions. We
   demonstrated the performance of SPIN-VM on a rich dataset from a natural
   vision experiment. Compared to VM, SPIN-VM yields higher prediction
   accuracies and better capture locally congruent information
   representations across cortex. These results suggest that SPIN-VM offers
   improved performance in predicting single-voxel responses and recovering
   coherent information representations.}},

Abstract = {{Failures in emotion regulation, especially as a result of interpersonal
   stress, are implicated as transdiagnostic risk factors for
   psychopathology. This study examines the effects of an experimentally
   timed targeted interpersonal rejection on emotion reactivity and
   regulation in typically developing adolescent girls. Girls (n = 33, ages
   9-16 years, M = 12.47, SD = 2.20) underwent fMRI involving a widely used
   emotion regulation task. The emotion task involves looking at negative
   stimuli and using cognitive reappraisal strategies to decrease reactions
   to negative stimuli. Participants also engaged in a social evaluation
   task, which leads participants to believe a preselected peer was
   watching and evaluating the participant. We subsequently told
   participants they were rejected by this peer and examined emotion
   reactivity and regulation before and after this rejection. Adolescent
   girls evidence greater reactivity via higher self-reported emotional
   intensity and greater amygdala activation to negative stimuli
   immediately after (compared with before) the rejection. Self-reported
   emotional intensity differences before and after rejection were not
   observed during regulation trials. However, on regulation trials, girls
   exhibited increased prefrontal activation in areas supporting emotion
   regulation after compared with before the rejection. This study provides
   evidence that a targeted rejection increases self-report and neural
   markers of emotion reactivity and that girls increase prefrontal
   activation to regulate emotions after a targeted rejection.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep loss is associated with increased obesity risk, as demonstrated by
   correlations between sleep duration and change in body mass index or
   body fat percentage. Whereas previous studies linked this weight gain to
   disturbed endocrine parameters after sleep deprivation or restriction,
   neuroimaging studies revealed upregulated neural processing of food
   rewards after sleep loss in reward-processing areas such as the anterior
   cingulate cortex, ventral striatum, and insula. To address this ongoing
   debate between hormonal versus hedonic factors underlying
   sleep-loss-associated weight gain, we rigorously tested the association
   between sleep deprivation and food cue processing using high-resolution
   fMRI and assessment of hormones. After taking blood samples from 32
   lean, healthy, human male participants, they underwent fMRI while
   performing a neuroeconomic, value-based decision-making task with snack
   food and trinket rewards following a full night of habitual sleep and a
   night of sleep deprivation in a repeated-measures crossover design. We
   found that des-acyl ghrelin concentrations were increased after sleep
   deprivation compared with habitual sleep. Despite similar hunger ratings
   due to fasting in both conditions, participants were willing to spend
   more money on food items only after sleep deprivation. Furthermore, fMRI
   data paralleled this behavioral finding, revealing a
   food-reward-specific upregulation of hypothalamic valuation signals and
   amygdala-hypothalamic coupling after a single night of sleep
   deprivation. Behavioral and fMRI results were not significantly
   correlated with changes in acyl, des-acyl, or total ghrelin
   concentrations. Our results suggest that increased food valuation after
   sleep loss might be due to hedonic rather than hormonal mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Relief from incidental fear evokes exuberant risk taking}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Incidental emotions are defined as feelings that are unrelated to a
   decision task at hand and thereby not normatively relevant for making
   choices. The precise influence and formal theoretical implications of
   incidental emotions regarding financial risk taking are still largely
   unclear. An effect of incidental emotion on decision-making would
   challenge the main extant formal theoretical economic models because
   such models do not allow for an effect of incidental emotions. As
   financial risk taking is pervasive in modern economies, the role of
   incidental emotions is an important issue. The goal of this experimental
   study is threefold. First, we examine the impact of incidental fear on
   the choice between a sure and a risky monetary option. A well-validated
   method of fear induction, using electric shocks, is employed for that
   purpose. Based on emotion studies we hypothesize less risk taking under
   fear and more risk taking when relieved of fear. Our second goal is to
   investigate the relative performance of the main existing formal
   theoretical economic models (based on Expected Utility Theory, Prospect
   Theory, or the Mean-Variance model) in explaining the behavioral data.
   We also investigate how these models can be adjusted to accommodate any
   observed influence of incidental emotion. For that reason, we first
   theoretically model the potential pathways of incidental fear (and the
   relief thereof) via the valuation of the choice option rewards or
   risk-assessment. We then estimate the relevant parameters allowing for
   both additive as well as interactive effects. Our third and final goal
   is to explore the neural basis of any observed influence of incidental
   emotions on decision-making by means of a model-based fMRI analysis,
   using the findings of existing neuroeconomic studies as the basis for
   our hypotheses. Our results indicate that the relief of fear can give a
   substantial boost to financial risk taking (suggestive of exuberance).
   This impact is best captured by Prospect Theory if we allow for an
   increase in participants' valuation of option outcomes when relieved of
   fear. Moreover, this impact is manifested at the neural level by the
   activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a brain area
   widely regarded as being central for valuation.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Human prosocial behavior (PB) emerges in childhood and matures during
   adolescence. Previous task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) studies have reported involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex
   including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in social cognition in
   adolescence. However, neurometabolic and functional connectivity (FC)
   basis of PB in early adolescence remains unclear. Here, we measured GABA
   levels in the ACC and FC in a subsample (aged 10.5-13.4 years) of a
   large-scale population-based cohort with MR spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS)
   and resting-state fMRI. PB was negatively correlated with GABA levels in
   the ACC (N = 221), and positively correlated with right ACC-seeded FC
   with the right precentral gyrus and the bilateral middle and posterior
   cingulate gyrus (N = 187). Furthermore, GABA concentrations and this FC
   were negatively correlated, and the FC mediated the association between
   GABA levels and PB (N = 171). Our results from a minimally biased,
   large-scale sample provide new insights into the neurometabolic and
   neurofunctional correlates of prosocial development during early
   adolescence.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Although self-other behavioral differences in decision making under risk
   have been observed in some contexts, little is known about the neural
   mechanisms underlying such differences. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and the cups task, in which participants choose
   between risky and sure options for themselves and others in gain and

   decisions for themselves than for others in loss situations but were
   equally risk-averse in gain situations. Significantly stronger
   activations were observed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)
   and anterior insula (AI) when making decisions for the self than for
   others in loss situations but not in gain situations. Furthermore, the
   activation in the dmPFC was stronger when people made sure choices for
   others than for themselves in gain situations but not when they made
   risky choices, and was both stronger when people made sure and risky
   choices for themselves than for others in loss situations. These
   findings suggest that gain-loss situation modulates self-other

Title = {{Rested-Baseline Responsivity of the Ventral Striatum Is Associated With
   Caloric and Macronutrient Intake During One Night of Sleep Deprivation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sleep loss contributes to obesity through a variety of
   mechanisms, including neuroendocrine functioning, increased hunger, and
   increased food intake. Additionally, sleep loss alters functional
   activation within brain regions associated with reward and behavioral
   control. However, it remains unknown whether individual differences in
   baseline neural functioning can predict eating behaviors during total
   sleep deprivation (TSD). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that individuals with increased baseline
   responsiveness within reward regions are more vulnerable to TSD-induced
   overeating.
   Methods: N = 45 subjects completed several fMRI scans during a single
   pre-TSD session that included performance on the Multi-Source
   Interference Task (MSIT) and the n-back task. Subjects returned to the
   laboratory for an overnight TSD session, during which they were given ad
   libitum access to 10,900 kcal of food. Leftover food and packaging were
   collected every 6 h (00:00, 06:00, and 12:00) to measure total food
   consumption. Subjects reported sleepiness every hour and performed a
   food rating task every 3 h.
   Results: Functional activation within the ventral striatum during the
   MSIT and n-back positively correlated with total caloric and
   carbohydrate intake during the final 6 h (06:00-12:00) of TSD.
   Activation within the middle and superior temporal gyri during the MSIT
   also correlated with total carbohydrates consumed. Food consumption did
   not correlate with subjective sleepiness, hunger, or food desire.
   Conclusions: Individual differences in neural activity of reward
   processing areas (i.e., nucleus accumbens) prior to sleep deprivation
   are associated with an individual's propensity to overeat during
   subsequent sleep deprivation. This suggests that individual differences
   within reward processing pathways are potential key factors in sleep
   loss related overeating. Sleep loss and obesity are tightly linked. Both
   phenomena have been associated with increased neural activation in
   regions associated with reward, inhibitory control, and disrupted
   dopamine signaling. Elevated baseline reward sensitivity in the ventral
   striatum appears to be further compounded by sleep deprivation induced
   dysfunction in the reward neurocircuitry, increasing the likelihood of
   overeating. Our findings suggest that large individual differences in
   baseline responsiveness of hedonic reward pathways may modulate the
   association between sleep loss and obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive and
   uncontrollable worry about everyday life. Prior neuroimaging studies
   have demonstrated that GAD is associated with disruptions in specific
   brain regions; however, little is known about the global functional
   connectivity maps in adolescents with GAD. Here, first-episode,
   medication-naive, adolescent GAD patients (N = 36) and healthy controls
   (N = 28) (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) and
   completed a package of questionnaires to assess clinical symptoms.
   Functional connectivity strength and seed-based functional connectivity
   were employed to investigate the functional connectivity architecture.
   GAD patients showed reduced functional connectivity strength in right
   supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and right superior parietal gyrus (SPG)
   compared with HCs. Further seed-based functional connectivity analysis
   revealed that GAD patients displayed decreased functional connectivity
   between right SMG and left fusiform gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus,
   parahippocampal gyrus, bilateral precuneus and cuneus, and between right
   SPG and bilateral supplementary motor area and middle cingulate gyrus,
   as well as between the SMG-based network and the SPG-based network.
   Moreover, the disrupted intra-network connectivity (i.e., the SMG-based
   network and the SPG-based network) and inter-network connectivity
   between the SMG-based network and the SPG-based network accounted for
   25.5\% variance of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and
   39.5\% variance of the trait subscale of STAI. Our findings highlight
   the abnormal functional architecture in the SMG-based network and the
   SPG-based network in GAD, providing novel insights into the pathological
   mechanisms of this disorder.}},

Title = {{Large-scale network interactions supporting item-context memory
   formation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Episodic memory is thought to involve functional interactions of
   large-scale brain networks that dynamically reconfigure depending on
   task demands. Although the hippocampus and closely related structures
   have been implicated, little is known regarding how large-scale and
   distributed networks support different memory formation demands. We
   investigated patterns of interactions among distributed networks while
   human individuals formed item-context memories for two stimulus
   categories. Subjects studied object-scene and objectlocation
   associations in different fMRI sessions. Stimulus-responsive brain
   regions were organized based on their fMRI interconnectivity into
   networks and modules using probabilistic module-detection algorithms to
   maximize measurement of individual differences in modular structure.
   Although there was a great deal of consistency in the modular structure
   between object-scene and object-location memory formation, there were
   also significant differences. Interactions among functional modules
   predicted later memory accuracy, explaining substantial portions of
   variability in memory formation success. Increased interactivity of
   modules associated with internal thought and anti-correlation of these
   modules with those related to stimulus-evoked processing robustly
   predicted object-scene memory, whereas decreased interactivity of
   stimulus-evoked processing modules predicted object-location memory.
   Assessment of individual differences in network organization therefore
   allowed identification of distinct patterns of functional interactions
   that robustly predicted memory formation. This highlights large-scale
   brain network interactions for memory formation and indicates that
   although networks are largely robust to task demands, reconfiguration
   nonetheless occurs to support distinct memory formation demands.}},

Title = {{MDMA Increases Cooperation and Recruitment of Social Brain Areas When
   Playing Trustworthy Players in an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Social decision-making is fundamental for successful functioning and can
   be affected in psychiatric illness and by serotoninergic modulation. The
   Prisoner's Dilemma is the archetypal paradigm to model cooperation and
   trust. However, the effect of serotonergic enhancement is poorly
   characterized, and its influence on the effect of variations in opponent
   behavior unknown. To address this, we conducted a study investigating
   how the serotonergic enhancer 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDM A)
   modulates behavior and its neural correlates during an iterated
   Prisoner's Dilemma with both trustworthy and untrustworthy opponents. We
   administered 100 mg M DMA or placebo to 20 male participants in a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. While being scanned,
   participants played repeated rounds with opponents who differed in
   levels of cooperation. On each round, participants chose to compete or
   cooperate and were asked to rate their trust in the other player.
   Cooperation with trustworthy, but not untrustworthy, opponents was
   enhanced following MDMA but not placebo (respectively: odds ratio =
   2.01; 95\% CI, 1.42-2.84, p < 0.001; odds ratio = 1.37; 95\% CI, 0.78
   -2.30, not significant). Specifically, MDMA enhanced recovery from, but
   not the impact of, breaches in cooperation. During trial outcome, MDMA
   increased activation of four clusters incorporating precentral and
   supramarginal gyri, superior temporal cortex, central
   operculum/posterior insula, and supplementary motor area. There was a
   treatment X opponent interaction in right anterior insula and dorsal
   caudate. Trust ratings did not change across treatment sessions. MDMA
   increased cooperative behavior when playing trustworthy opponents.
   Underlying this was a change in brain activity of regions linked to
   social cognition. Our findings highlight the context-specific nature of
   MDMA's effect on social decision-making.}},

Title = {{The Cerebellar Predictions for Social Interactions: Theory of Mind
   Abilities in Patients With Degenerative Cerebellar Atrophy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have focused on the role of the cerebellum in the social
   domain, including in Theory of Mind (TOM). ToM, or the ``mentalizing{''}
   process, is the ability to attribute mental states, such as emotion,
   intentions and beliefs, to others to explain and predict their behavior.
   It is a fundamental aspect of social cognition and crucial for social
   interactions, together with more automatic mechanisms, such as emotion
   contagion. Social cognition requires complex interactions between
   limbic, associative areas and subcortical structures, including the
   cerebellum. It has been hypothesized that the typical cerebellar role in
   adaptive control and predictive coding could also be extended to social
   behavior. The present study aimed to investigate the social cognition
   abilities of patients with degenerative cerebellar atrophy to understand
   whether the cerebellum acts in specific ToM components playing a role as
   predictive structure. To this aim, an ad hoc social cognition battery
   was administered to 27 patients with degenerative cerebellar pathology
   and 27 healthy controls. In addition, 3D T1-weighted and resting-state
   fMRI scans were collected to characterize the structural and functional
   changes in cerebello-cortical loops. The results evidenced that the
   patients were impaired in lower-level processes of immediate perception
   as well as in the more complex conceptual level of mentalization.
   Furthermore, they presented a pattern of GM reduction in cerebellar
   portions that are involved in the social domain such as crus I-II,
   lobule IX and lobule Villa. These areas showed decreased functional
   connectivity with projection cerebral areas involved in specific aspects
   of social cognition. These findings boost the idea that the cerebellar
   modulatory function on the cortical projection areas subtends the social
   cognition process at different levels. Particularly, regarding the
   lower-level processes, the cerebellum may act by implicitly matching the
   external information (i.e., expression of the eyes) with the respective
   internal representation to guarantee an immediate judgment about the
   mental state of others. Otherwise, at a more complex conceptual level,
   the cerebellum seems to be involved in the construction of internal
   models of mental processes during social interactions in which the
   prediction of sequential events plays a role, allowing us to anticipate
   the other person's behavior.}},

Title = {{Altered reward processing following an acute social stressor in
   adolescents}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 4}},
Abstract = {{Altered reward processing is a transdiagnostic factor implicated in a
   wide range of psychiatric disorders. While prior animal and adult
   research has shown that stress contributes to reward dysfunction, less
   is known about how stress impacts reward processing in youth. Towards
   addressing this gap, the present study probed neural activation
   associated with reward processing following an acute stressor. Healthy
   adolescents (n = 40) completed a clinical assessment, and fMRI data were
   acquired while participants completed a monetary guessing task under a
   no-stress condition and then under a stress condition. Based on prior
   literature, analyses focused on a priori defined regions-of-interest,
   specifically the striatum (win trials) and dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex {[}dACC] and insula (loss trials). Two main findings emerged.
   First, reward-related neural activation (i.e., striatum) was blunted in
   the stress relative to the no-stress condition. Second, the stress
   condition also contributed to blunted neural response following reward
   in loss-related regions (i.e., dACC, anterior insula); however, there
   were no changes in loss sensitivity. These results highlight the
   importance of conceptualizing neural vulnerability within the presence
   of stress, as this may clarify risk for mental disorders during a
   critical period of development.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{The role of the frontal lobes in cognition and behavior has long been
   enigmatic. Over the past decade, computational models have provided a
   powerful approach to understanding cognition and decision-making. Here,
   we used a model-based approach to analyze data from a classical task
   used to assess frontal lobe function, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.
   We applied computational modeling and voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping
   in 328 patients with focal lesions, to uncover cognitive processes and
   neural correlates of test scores. Our results reveal that lesions in the
   right prefrontal cortex are associated with elevated perseverative
   errors and reductions in the model parameter of sensitivity to
   punishment. These findings indicate that the capacity to flexibly switch
   between task sets requires the detection of contingency changes, which
   are enabled by a sensitivity to punishment that reduces perseverative
   errors. We demonstrate the power of model-based approaches in
   understanding patterns of deficits on classical neuropsychological
   tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Social life requires people to predict the future: people must
   anticipate others' thoughts, feelings, and actions to interact with them
   successfully. The theory of predictive coding suggests that the social
   brain may meet this need by automatically predicting others' social
   futures. If so, when representing others' current mental state, the
   brain should already start representing their future states. To test
   this hypothesis, we used fMRI to measure female and male human
   participants' neural representations of mental states. Representational
   similarity analysis revealed that neural patterns associated with mental
   states currently under consideration resembled patterns of likely future
   states more so than patterns of unlikely future states. This effect
   manifested in activity across the social brain network and in medial
   prefrontal cortex in particular. Repetition suppression analysis also
   supported the social predictive coding hypothesis: considering mental
   states presented in predictable sequences reduced activity in the
   precuneus relative to unpredictable sequences. In addition to
   demonstrating that the brain makes automatic predictions of others'
   social futures, the results also demonstrate that the brain leverages a
   3D representational space to make these predictions. Proximity between
   mental states on the psychological dimensions of rationality, social
   impact, and valence explained much of the association between
   state-specific neural pattern similarity and state transition
   likelihood. Together, these findings suggest that the way the brain
   represents the social present gives people an automatic glimpse of the
   social future.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has demonstrated that comparing two persons activates
   a frontoparietal network associated with numbers and nonsocial
   magnitudes. However, it is unclear whether this network is also
   recruited by comparisons involving the self. Self-reflection engages
   self-serving motivations (e.g., the maintenance of a positive
   self-image) and is associated with specific brain structures, such as
   the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the anterior insula (AI) and the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Self-other comparisons may thus rely on
   distinct neural activity. To clarify this question, we used fMRI and
   asked female participants to compare their own attractiveness (or the
   attractiveness of a familiar woman) to pictures of unknown women.
   Participants were slower for comparisons with targets whose
   attractiveness was similar to their own (or their familiar other). Yet
   although this behavioral result resembles the distance effect reported
   for nonsocial magnitudes, at the brain level, it was linked to the
   activity of the AI, the ACC and the MPFC. The effect of distance in
   these regions was stronger for self-other than familiar-other
   comparisons. We interpret these results in relation to previous
   literature in social psychology and social neuroscience.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{80-89}},

Abstract = {{Familial stressors, such as weak familial connectedness, are associated
   with the development of maladaptive threat processing, yet little is
   known regarding how weak familial bonds impinge on biological mechanisms
   of threat processing. The present study leveraged multivoxel pattern
   analysis of fMRI data to compare the neural encoding of familial and
   nonfamilial threatening and non-threatening stimuli in adolescents who
   endorsed varying levels of connectedness to their families. Adolescents
   (N = 22, Mage = 14.38 years) reporting lower family connectedness 1 year
   earlier showed elevated sensitivity to familial threat, but not to
   nonfamilial threat in a neural network associated with threat
   processing, comprising left and right amygdala, and right inferior and
   middle temporal gyri. Results suggest that a learning history about
   one's social environment may shape neural mechanisms of threat
   processing by sensitizing them to risk-relevant stimuli. Such findings
   advance our understanding of how familial stressors contribute to
   disordered threat processing in adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying faces is a process central for social interaction and a
   relevant factor in eyewitness theory. False recognition is a critical
   mistake during an eyewitness's identification scenario because it can
   lead to a wrongful conviction. Previous studies have described neural
   areas related to false facial recognition using the standard
   Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, triggering related false
   recognition. Nonetheless, misidentification of faces without trying to
   elicit false memories (unrelated false recognition) in a police lineup
   could involve different cognitive processes, and distinct neural areas.
   To delve into the neural circuitry of unrelated false recognition, we
   evaluated the memory and response confidence of participants while
   watching faces photographs in an fMRI task. Functional activations of
   unrelated false recognition were identified by contrasting the
   activation on this condition vs. the activations related to recognition
   (hits) and correct rejections. The results identified the right
   precentral and cingulate gyri as areas with distinctive activations
   during false recognition events suggesting a conflict resulting in a
   dysfunction during memory retrieval. High confidence suggested that
   about 50\% of misidentifications may be related to an unconscious
   process. These findings add to our understanding of the construction of
   facial memories and its biological basis, and the fallibility of the
   eyewitness testimony.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: We present the results of a case series study of individually
   navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in four
   patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD). Patients and
   methods: Four patients with BPD performed a Go/NoGo task during
   functional MRI (fMRI) designed for observing behavioural inhibition
   neural correlates. The site within the right dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex with the largest difference in BOLD signal between the NoGo and
   Go conditions was assigned as a target for rTMS in each patient. Four
   patients underwent 15 sessions of individually navigated 10-Hz rTMS
   treatment at 110\% of their individual resting motor threshold for 3
   weeks (one session per working day). One session contained 1,500 pulses
   delivered in 15 trains by 10 s, leading to a total of 22,500 pulses
   during the treatment. Results: The treatment was very well tolerated
   without any serious side effects. After the treatment, the patients
   reported that they felt better self-control of their emotions,
   especially anger; that their urges for self-harm and suicidal thoughts
   decreased or disappeared; and that their derealisation/depersonalisation
   episodes disappeared. Patients also showed less depression symptoms
   after the treatment. Conclusion: rTMS with neuronavigation
   individualised by a fMRI Go/NoGo task is a promising tool for reducing
   impulsive behaviour and enhancing emotion regulation in BPD patients.
   Double-blind placebo-controlled studies in larger samples are necessary
   to draw further conclusions about rTMS effectiveness in BPD.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Slowing eating rate appears to be an effective strategy for reducing
   food intake. This feasibility study investigated the effect of eating
   rate on post-meal responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI), plasma gastrointestinal hormone concentrations, appetite
   ratings, memory for recent eating, and snack consumption. Twenty-one
   participants (mean age 23 years with healthy body mass index) were
   randomly assigned to consume a 600 kcal meal at either a ``normal{''} or
   ``slow{''} rate (6 vs. 24 min). Immediately afterwards, participants
   rated meal enjoyment and satisfaction. FMRI was performed 2-h post-meal
   during a memory task about the meal. Appetite, peptide YY, and ghrelin
   were measured at baseline and every 30 min for 3 h. Participants were
   given an ad-libitum snack three hours post-meal. Results were reported
   as effect sizes (Cohen's d) due to the feasibility sample size. The
   normal rate group found the meal more enjoyable (effect size = 0.5) and
   satisfying (effect size = 0.6). Two hours post-meal, the slow rate group
   reported greater fullness (effect size = 0.7) and more accurate portion
   size memory (effect sizes = 0.4), with a linear relationship between
   time taken to make portion size decisions and the BOLD response in
   satiety and reward brain regions. Ghrelin suppression post-meal was
   greater in the slow rate group (effect size = 0.8). Three hours
   post-meal, the slow rate group consumed on average 25\% less energy from
   snacks (effect size = 0.5). These data offer novel insights about
   mechanisms underlying how eating rate affects food intake and have
   implications for the design of effective weight-management
   interventions.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{16-27}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: It has been hypothesised that abnormal functioning of the
   mirror neuron system (MNS) may lead to deficits in imitation and the
   internal representation of movement, potentially contributing to the
   motor impairments associated with developmental coordination disorder
   (DCD).
   Aims: Using fMRI, this study examined brain activation patterns in
   children with and without DCD on a finger adduction/abduction task
   during four MNS activation states: observation; motor imagery;
   execution; and imitation.
   Methods and procedures: Nineteen boys (8.25-12.75 years) participated,
   including 10 children with DCD (<= 16th percentile on MABC-2; no
   ADHD/ASD), and nine typically developing controls (>= 25th percentile on
   MABC-2).
   Outcomes and results: Even though children with DCD displayed deficits
   behaviourally on imitation (Sensory Integration \& Praxis Test Subtests)
   and motor imagery assessments prior to scanning, no differences in MNS
   activation were seen between the DCD and control groups at a
   neurological level, with both groups activating mirror regions
   effectively across conditions. Small clusters of decreased activation
   during imitation were identified in non-mirror regions in the DCD group,
   including the thalamus, caudate, and posterior cingulate regions
   involved in motor planning and attentional processes.
   Conclusions and implications: The results of this study do not provide
   support for the MNS dysfunction theory as a possible causal mechanism
   for DCD. Further research to explore attentional and motor planning
   processes and how they may interact at a network level may enhance our
   understanding of this complex disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The sunk cost effect, an interesting and well-known decision bias, is
   pervasive in real life and has been studied in various disciplines. In
   this study, we modified a task exemplifying the sunk cost effect and
   used it to evaluate this behavior in individuals with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD). The control group exhibited a typical sunk cost effect
   in our task. We found that the sunk cost effect was lower in the ASD
   group than in the control group. The results agree with previous
   evidence of reduced sensitivity to context stimuli in individuals with
   ASD and extend this finding to the context of the sunk cost effect. Our
   findings are useful in addressing the practical implications on their
   socioeconomic behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about how intranasally administered oxytocin reaches the
   brain and modulates social behavior and cognition. Pupil dilation is a
   sensitive index of attentional allocation and effort, and
   inter-individual variability in pupil diameter during performance of
   social-cognitive tasks may provide a better assessment of
   pharmacological effects on the brain than behavioral measures. Here, we
   leverage the close relationship between pupil and neural activity to
   inform our understanding of nose-to-brain oxytocin routes and possible
   dose-response relationships. To this end, we assessed pupil diameter
   data from a previously reported functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study under four treatment conditions-including two different
   doses of intranasal oxytocin using a novel Breath Powered nasal device,
   intravenous (IV) oxytocin, and placebo-and investigated the association
   with amygdala activation in response to emotional stimuli. The study
   used a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover design, with 16
   healthy male adults administering a single-dose of these four
   treatments. A significant main effect of treatment condition on pupil
   diameter was observed. Posthoc tests revealed reduced pupil diameter
   after 8IU intranasal oxytocin compared to placebo, but no significant
   difference between 8IU intranasal oxytocin and either 24IU intranasal
   oxytocin or IV oxytocin treatment conditions. Analysis also showed a
   significant relationship between pupil diameter and right amygdala
   activation after 8IU intranasal oxytocin. Although there was no
   significant difference between 8IU intranasal oxytocin and IV oxytocin
   on right amygdala activity and pupil diameter, the significant
   difference between 8IU intranasal oxytocin and placebo is consistent
   with the hypothesis that oxytocin can travel to the brain via a
   nose-to-brain route.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of
   the brain. It cannot be cured currently, and those suffering from AD
   place a great burden on their caregivers and society. AD is
   characterized by high levels of iron ions in the brain, which catalyze
   radicals that damage the neurons. Knowing that the A beta 42 peptide
   precipitates iron by binding iron ions at amino acid residues D1, E3,
   H11, H13, and H14, we synthesized a 5-repeat (HAYED) sequence peptide.
   By treating iron-stressed SH-SY5Y cells with it and injecting it into
   the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of naturally senescence Kunming mouse,
   which displaying AD-similar symptoms such as learning and memory
   dysfunction, neuron degeneration and high level of iron in brain, we
   found that HAYED (5) decreased the iron and radical levels in the cell
   culture medium and in the CSF. Specially, the synthesized peptide
   prevented cell and brain damage. Furthermore, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests
   demonstrated that the peptide ameliorated brain blood-oxygen metabolism
   and slowed cognitive loss in the experimental senescence mice, and
   clinical and blood tests showed that HAYED (5) was innoxious to the
   kidney, the liver and blood and offset the AD-associated inflammation
   and anemia.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Nonverbal learning disability (N'VLD) is a putative
   neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by spatial processing deficits
   as well as social deficits similar to those characteristic of autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD). Nonetheless. NVLD may be a distinct disorder
   that is differentially associated with the functioning and connectivity
   of the salience (SN) and default mode (DMN) networks that support social
   processing. Thus. we sought to assess and compare connectivity across
   these networks in children with NVLD, ASD, and typically developing
   children. Method: Resting-state fMRI data were examined in 17 children
   with NVLD, 17 children with ASD selected from the Autism Brain Imaging
   Data Exchange (ABIDE), and 40 TD children (20 from ABIDE). Average DMN
   and SN functional connectivity and pairwise region-to-region
   connectivity were compared across groups. Associations with social
   impairment and IQ were assessed. Results: Children with NVI,D showed
   reduced connectivity between SN regions (anterior insula to anterior
   cingulate and to rostral prefrontal cortex (rPFC]), whereas children
   with ASD showed greater connectivity between SN regions (supramarginal
   gyrus to rPFC) relative to the other groups. Both clinical groups showed
   higher levels of parent-reported social problems, which related to
   altered SN connectivity in the NVLD group. No differences were detected
   in overall average connectivity within or between networks. Conclusions:
   The social deficits common across children with NVLD and ASD may derive
   from distinct alterations in connectivity within the SN. Such findings
   represent the first step toward identifying a neurobiological signature
   of NVLD.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the effects of facial physical
   attractiveness on perception and expressing habit of smiling and angry
   expressions. In experiment 1, 20 participants rated 60 photo subjects'
   smiling and angry expressions of uncontrolled physical expression
   configuration. The results showed that for the angry faces, the
   perceived expression intensity and the expression naturalness in the
   attractive group were significantly stronger than those in the
   unattractive group; for the smiling faces, this attractiveness bias was
   not observed. In experiment 2, using artificial expressions made by an
   identical expression template, interestingly, the perceived expression
   intensity and the expression naturalness of the smiling faces in the
   attractive group were stronger than those in the unattractive group,
   while the impression strength of anger between the two groups was
   approximately the same. A comparison of the two observations suggests
   that facial physical attractiveness can enhance the perceived intensity
   of a smiling expression but not an angry expression, and that the
   inconsistencies between the two experiments are due to the difference of
   expressing habits between unattractive and attractive persons. These
   results have implications as regards the effect of facial attractiveness
   on the expressing habits of expression senders and the person's
   development of social skills.}},

   types of MN, including visual inspection, data integration, and data
   fusion. This literature review aimed to provide a brief summary and
   basic information about MN techniques (data fusion approaches in
   particular) and classification approaches. Data fusion approaches are
   generally categorized as asymmetric and symmetric. The present review
   focused exclusively on studies based on symmetric data fusion methods
   (data-driven methods), such as independent component analysis and
   principal component analysis. Machine learning techniques have recently
   been introduced for use in identifying diseases and biomarkers of
   disease. The machine learning technique most widely used by
   neuroscientists is classification-especially support vector machine
   classification. Several studies differentiated patients with psychiatric
   diseases and healthy controls with using combined datasets. The common
   conclusion among these studies is that the prediction of diseases
   increases when combining data via MN techniques; however, there remain a
   few challenges associated with MN, such as sample size. Perhaps in the
   future N-way fusion can be used to combine multiple neuroimaging
   techniques or nonimaging predictors (eg, cognitive ability) to overcome
   the limitations of MN.}},

   fMRI analysis}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Schizophrenia is a predominant product of pathological
   alterations distributed throughout interconnected neural systems.
   Designing new objectively diagnostic methods are burning questions.
   Dynamical functional connectivity (DFCs) methodology based on fMRI data
   is an effective lever to investigate changeability evolution in
   macroscopic neural activity patterns underlying critical aspects of
   cognition and behavior. However, region properties of brain architecture
   have been less investigated by special indexes of dynamical graph in
   general mental disorders.
   Methods: Embracing the network dynamics concept, we introduce topology
   entropy index (TE-scores) which is focused on time-varying aspects of
   FCs, hence develop a new framework for researching the dysfunctional
   roots of schizophrenia in holism significance. In this work, the
   important process is to uncover noticeable regions endowed with
   antagonistic stance in TE-scores of between morbid and normal DFCs of 63
   healthy controls (HCs) and 57 chronic schizophrenia patients (SZs).
   Results: For the whole brain region levels, right olfactory, right
   hippocampus, left parahippocampal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus,
   left amygdala, and left cuneus in SZs are endowed with significantly
   different TE-scores. At brain subsystems level, TE-scores in DMN are
   abnormal in the SZs.
   Comparison with existing method(s): Topology entropy in DFCs is
   introduced to explore the dynamical information organization of diverse
   regions and their abnormal changes in mental illness. Several classical
   graph indexes (such as degree strength, betweenness, centrality) in the
   static brain network measure the region importance of FCs under senses
   of information integration and separation process. Although highly
   related to degree strength by comparing the corresponding values,
   topology entropy further explores the regions' aberrant adaptability of
   functional contact and function switching.
   Conclusion: TE-scores of abnormal regions in SZs are associated to the
   passive apathetic social withdrawal, unusual thought content,
   disturbance of volition, preoccupation, active social avoidance and
   hallucinatory symptoms. Thought the strict contrastive study, it is
   worth stressing that topology entropy is a meaningful biological marker
   to excavating schizophrenic psychopathology.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{48-56}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Child sexual abuse and neglect have been related to an
   increased risk for the development of a wide range of behavioral,
   psychological, and sexual problems and increased rates of suicidal
   behavior. Contrary to the large amount of research focusing on the
   negative mental health consequences of child sexual abuse, very little
   is known about the characteristics of child sexual offenders and the
   neuronal underpinnings contributing to child sexual offending.
   Methods and sample: This study investigates differences in resting state
   functional connectivity (rs-FC) between non-pedophilic child sexual
   offenders (N = 20; CSO-P) and matched healthy controls (N = 20; HC)
   using a seed based approach. The focus of this investigation of rs-FC in
   CSO-P was put on prefrontal and limbic regions highly relevant for
   emotional and behavioral processing.
   Results: Results revealed a significant reduction of rs-FC between the
   right centromedial amygdala and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   in child sexual offenders compared to controls.
   Conclusion \& recommendations: Given that, in the healthy brain, there
   is a strong top-down inhibitory control of prefrontal over limbic
   structures, these results suggest that diminished rs-FC between the
   amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and may foster sexual
   deviance and sexual offending. A profound understanding of these
   concepts should contribute to a better understanding of the occurrence
   of child sexual offending, as well as further development of more
   differentiated and effective interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Food commercials promote snack intake and alter food decision-making,
   yet the influence of exposure to food commercials on subsequent neural
   processing of food cues and intake at a meal is unclear. This study
   tested whether exposing children to food or toy commercials altered
   subsequent brain response to high-and low energy dense food cues and
   influenced laboratory intake at a multi-item, ad libitum meal. Forty-one
   7-9-year-old children (25 healthy weight; 16 with overweight/ obesity)
   completed five visits as part of a within-subjects design where they
   consumed multi-item test-meals under three conditions: no exposure, food
   commercial exposure, and toy commercial exposure. On the fourth and
   fifth visits, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed
   while children viewed low-and high-energy dense food images following
   exposure to either food or toy commercials. Linear mixed models tested
   for differences in meal energy intake by commercial condition. A
   whole-brain analysis was conducted to compare differences in response by
   commercial condition and child weight status. Meal intake did not differ
   by commercial condition (p = 0.40). Relative to toy commercials, food
   commercials reduced brain response to high-energy food stimuli in
   cognitive control regions, including bilateral superior temporal gyri,
   middle temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus. Commercial condition
   {*} weight status interactions were observed in orbitofrontal cortex,
   fusiform gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus. Children with
   overweight/obesity showed increased response in these regions to
   high-energy stimuli following food commercials. Food commercial exposure
   affected children's subsequent processing of food cues by reducing
   engagement of the prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in cognitive
   control. Even though food commercial exposure did not increase intake at
   a meal, the effect of reduced prefrontal cortical engagement on a
   broader range of consumption patterns warrants investigation.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{99}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background-Neuroimaging studies suggest that social distress and
   suicidal vulnerability share common cerebral bases. Moreover, increased
   peripheral inflammatory activity is involved in both social distress and
   suicidal behavior.
   Objective: To evaluate, in suicidal and non-suicidal individuals, the
   association between the activation of specific cerebral regions
   (anterior cingulate, insula and orbitofrontal cortex) during
   experimental social exclusion and the baseline blood levels of the
   pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta
   (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and of the
   anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2).
   Methods: In total, 101 euthymic women were recruited: 42 suicide
   attempters (SA), 40 affective controls (AC), and 19 healthy controls
   (HC). During functional MRI (fMRI), they performed the Cyberball game, a
   validated social exclusion task. Blood levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6,
   TNF-alpha and IL-2 were measured prior to fMRI. The activation of
   insula, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   during the explicit social exclusion (ESE) vs social inclusion (INC)
   conditions of the Cyberball game was analyzed in function of the
   baseline cytokine levels.
   Results: IL-1 beta was negatively associated with right OFC activation
   (p = 0.01) in ESE vs. INC, whereas IL-2 was positively associated with
   activation of the right ACC (p = 0.02), insula (p = 0.002) and OFC (p =
   0.004) in ESE vs. INC. These associations remained significant after
   controlling for group, indicating that they were independent of the
   suicidal status.
   Conclusion: Baseline IL-1 beta and IL-2 blood levels are differentially
   associated with cerebral activation involved in the perception of social
   exclusion, independently of suicidal behavior. Our results may help to
   better understand the role of basal inflammation in social distress and
   its link with mood disorder pathophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral studies suggest that older adults may be less adept than
   younger adults at remembering information contradicting their first
   impressions about others' trustworthiness. To identify the neural bases
   associated with such age-related differences, we measured the brain
   activity of older and younger participants using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging while they processed feedback on whether their initial
   trustworthiness impressions of stimulus persons, whose true
   trustworthiness had been predetermined, were right or wrong. Of special
   interest was the activation in mentalizing- (e.g., medial prefrontal
   cortex) and reward-related brain regions (e.g., striatum), which are
   known to be involved in impression formation and feedback learning,
   respectively. The reduction in the striatal responses to
   impression-contradicting versus impression-confirming feedback was
   greater in older than in younger participants. The activation of some
   mentalizing-related regions (medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus) was
   lower in older than younger participants; however, it was not modulated
   by impression-feedback congruency. The results suggest that age-related
   differences in the striatum engagement may underlie older adults'
   inefficiency in learning impression-incongruent information about
   others' trustworthiness. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies report sex differences in sensitivity to gendered
   stimuli. We assume many of these to reflect differences as to the sex to
   which one feels attracted rather than to biological sex per se.
   Investigating voice perception, a function of high social relevance, we
   show that the behavioural and neural (BOLD) responses to male and female
   voices are mediated by sex and sexual orientation. In heterosexual men
   and women, we found an opposite-sex effect, reflected in higher
   classification accuracy for and a response bias towards voices of the
   other sex, while the effect became apparent as same-sex effect in
   homosexual men and women. Overall, sexual orientation had a greater
   impact in women than in men and homosexual women were closer to men in
   their behavioural responses to female voices. The activation patterns
   were similar for hetero- and homosexual men, both groups showing
   increased activation in response to male compared to female voices in
   regions distributed across the temporo-parietal and insular cortex. In
   contrast, women had increased activation in response to voices of the
   desired sex. It appears that both sex and sexual orientation impact on a
   function as basal as voice perception. Our results underline the need to
   assess sexual orientation in study participants if conclusions on sex
   differences shall be drawn. Many of the reported sex differences in
   behaviour and brain function might be mediated by sexual orientation and

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging measures have been used to forecast complex behaviors,
   including how individuals change decisions about their health in
   response to persuasive communications, but have rarely incorporated
   metrics of brain network dynamics. How do functional dynamics within and
   between brain networks relate to the processes of persuasion and
   behavior change? To address this question, we scanned 45 adult smokers
   by using functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed
   anti-smoking images. Participants reported their smoking behavior and
   intentions to quit smoking before the scan and 1 month later. We focused
   on regions within four atlas-defined networks and examined whether they
   formed consistent network communities during this task (measured as
   allegiance). Smokers who showed reduced allegiance among regions within
   the default mode and fronto-parietal networks also demonstrated larger
   increases in their intentions to quit smoking 1 month later. We further
   examined dynamics of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), as
   activation in this region has been frequently related to behavior
   change. The degree to which vmPFC changed its community assignment over
   time (measured as flexibility) was positively associated with smoking
   reduction. These data highlight the value in considering brain network
   dynamics for understanding message effectiveness and social processes
   more broadly.}},

   responses}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{161-170}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Humans have a striking ability to infer meaning from even the sparsest
   and most abstract forms of narratives. At the same time, flexibility in
   the form of a narrative is matched by inherent ambiguity in its
   interpretation. How does the brain represent subtle, idiosyncratic
   differences in the interpretation of abstract and ambiguous narratives?
   In this fMRI study, subjects were scanned either watching a novel 7-min
   animation depicting a complex narrative through the movement of
   geometric shapes, or listening to a narration of the animation's social
   story. Using an intersubject representational similarity analysis that
   compared interpretation similarity and neural similarity across
   subjects, we found that the more similar two people's interpretations of
   the abstract shapes animation were, the more similar were their neural
   responses in regions of the default mode network (DMN) and
   fronto-parietal network. Moreover, these shared responses were modality
   invariant: the shapes movie and the verbal interpretation of the movie
   elicited shared responses in linguistic areas and a subset of the DMN
   when subjects shared interpretations. Together, these results suggest a
   network of high-level regions that are not only sensitive to subtle
   individual differences in narrative interpretation during naturalistic
   conditions, but also resilient to large differences in the modality of
   the narrative.}},

Title = {{A comparative fMRI meta-analysis of altruistic and strategic decisions
   to give}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{184}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The decision to share resources is fundamental for cohesive societies.
   Humans can be motivated to give for many reasons. Some generosity incurs
   a definite cost, with no extrinsic reward to the act, but instead
   provides intrinsic satisfaction (labelled here as `altruistic' giving).
   Other giving behaviours are done with the prospect of improving one's
   own situation via reciprocity, reputation, or public good (labelled here
   as `strategic' giving). These contexts differ in the source, certainty,
   and timing of rewards as well as the inferences made about others'
   mental states. We executed a combined statistical map and
   coordinate-based fMRI meta-analysis of decisions to give (36 studies,
   1150 participants). Methods included a novel approach for accommodating
   variable signal dropout between studies in meta-analysis. Results reveal
   consistent, cross-paradigm neural correlates of each decision type,
   commonalities, and informative differences. Relative to being selfish,
   altruistic and strategic giving activate overlapping reward networks.
   However, strategic decisions showed greater activity in striatal regions
   than altruistic choices. Altruistic giving, more than strategic,
   activated subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is consistently involved during generous
   decisions and processing across a posterior to anterior axis
   differentiates the altruistic/strategic context. Posterior vmPFC was
   preferentially recruited during altruistic decisions. Regions of the
   `social brain' showed distinct patterns of activity between choice
   types, reflecting the different use of theory of mind in the two
   contexts. We provide the consistent neural correlates of decisions to
   give, and show that many will depend on the source of incentives.}},

Title = {{Increased responses of the reward circuitry to positive task feedback
   following acute stress in healthy controls but not in siblings of
   schizophrenia patients}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{547-554}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Acute stress is known to affect the way we process rewards. For example,
   during, or directly after stress, activity within key brain areas of the
   reward circuitry is reduced when a reward is presented. Generally, the
   effects of stress on the brain are time-dependent, changing neural and
   cognitive processing in the aftermath of stress to aid recovery. Such a
   dynamic response to stress is important for resilience on the longer
   term. However, relatively little is known about reward processing during
   the recovery phase of stress and whether this is changed in individuals
   at increased risk for stress-related psychopathology.
   Healthy male individuals (N = 40) and unaffected siblings of
   schizophrenia patients (N = 40) were randomized to either an acute
   stress task (Trier Social Stress Test) or a no-stress task. Neural
   responses during reward anticipation and reward feedback (monetary gain
   or no gain) were examined 50 min later using an fMRI monetary incentive
   delay task. The ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were
   used as predefined hypothesis-driven regions of interest.
   Neural responses following stress differed between controls and siblings
   during reward feedback (group-stress interaction OFC p = 0.003, ventral
   striatum p = 0.031), showing increased ventral striatum and OFC
   responses following stress in healthy controls only. Exploratory
   analyses revealed that this effect was most pronounced during hit trials
   (compared to when a reward was omitted), and independent of monetary
   value. Stress did not affect subsequent reward processing in siblings of
   schizophrenia patients. We found no significant differences between
   controls and siblings in ventral striatum and OFC responses during
   reward anticipation following stress.
   This study shows that ventral striatum and OFC responses to positive
   task feedback are increased in the aftermath of stress in healthy male
   controls, regardless of monetary value. This indicates a dynamic shift
   from previously reported reduced responses in the striatum and OFC to
   reward feedback directly after stress to increased responses to both
   reward and non-reward feedback during the recovery phase of stress.
   These increased neural responses following stress were absent in
   siblings of schizophrenia patients. Together, these findings indicate
   that stress recovery is affected in this at-risk group, particularly in
   responses to positive feedback following stress.}},

Abstract = {{Social information processing is a critical mechanism underlying
   children's socio-emotional development. Central to this process are
   patterns of activation associated with one of our most salient
   socioemotional cues, the face. In this study, we obtained fMRI
   activation and high-density ERP source data evoked by parallel face
   dot-probe tasks from 9-to-12-year-old children. We then integrated the
   two modalities of data to explore the neural spatial-temporal dynamics
   of children's face processing. Our results showed that the tomography of
   the ERP sources broadly corresponded with the fMRI activation evoked by
   the same facial stimuli. Further, we combined complementary information
   from fMRI and ERP by defining fMRI activation as functional ROIs and
   applying them to the ERP source data. Indices of ERP source activity
   were extracted from these ROIs at three a priori ERP peak latencies
   critical for face processing. We found distinct temporal patterns among
   the three time points across ROIs. The observed spatial-temporal
   profiles converge with a dual-system neural network model for face
   processing: a core system (including the occipito-temporal and parietal
   ROIs) supports the early visual analysis of facial features, and an
   extended system (including the paracentral, limbic, and prefrontal ROIs)
   processes the socioemotional meaning gleaned and relayed by the core
   system. Our results for the first time illustrate the spatial validity
   of high-density source localization of ERP dot-probe data in children.
   By directly combining the two modalities of data, our findings provide a
   novel approach to understanding the spatial-temporal dynamics of face
   processing. This approach can be applied in future research to
   investigate different research questions in various study populations.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between oxytocin and the basal ganglia are central in
   current overarching conceptualizations of its broad modulatory effects
   on behavior. Whereas evidence from animal models emphasizes the critical
   role of the ventral striatum in the behavioral effects of oxytocin,
   region-specific contributions of the basal ganglia have not been
   systematically explored in humans. The present study combined the
   randomized placebo-controlled administration of oxytocin versus placebo
   in healthy men (n = 144) with fMRI-based resting-state functional
   connectivity to determine the modulatory role of oxytocin on the major
   basal ganglia pathways. Oxytocin specifically increased connectivity
   between ventral striatal and pallidal nodes with upstream frontal
   regions, whereas it decreased the strengths of downstream pathways
   between the dorsal striatum and posterior cerebellum. These pathways
   have previously been implicated in salience, reward and behavioral
   flexibility, thus shaping goal-directed behavior. Given the importance
   of aberrant striatal intrinsic organization in autism, addiction and
   schizophrenia the present findings may suggest new mechanistic
   perspectives for the therapeutic potential of oxytocin in these
   disorders.}},

Title = {{Neural connectivity during affect labeling predicts treatment response

Abstract = {{Background: Although psychological treatments for social anxiety
   disorder (SAD) can be highly effective, many individuals do not respond
   to treatment. Identifying factors associated with improved outcomes can
   facilitate individualized treatment choices. We investigated whether
   patterns of neural connectivity predicted treatment responses and
   whether treatment type, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or acceptance
   and commitment therapy (ACT), moderated this effect.
   Methods: Participants with SAD (n=34) underwent fMRI prior to treatment
   and completed implicit and explicit emotion regulation tasks. Neural
   connectivity measures were estimates of amygdala-prefrontal cortex
   connectivity. Treatment responder status was defined using the
   `clinically significant change index' (Loerinc et al., 2015).
   Results: Right amygdala-right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   connectivity during implicit emotion regulation was a significant
   predictor of treatment response (OR=9.01, 95\% CI=1.77, 46.0, p=.008).
   Stronger inverse connectivity was associated with greater likelihood of
   treatment response. There were no significant neural moderators of
   treatment response to CBT versus ACT.
   Limitations: The primary limitation of this work was the small sample
   size which restricted the power to detect significant moderation
   effects, and results should be interpreted as preliminary.
   Conclusions: Amygdala-vlPFC connectivity during affect labeling
   predicted treatment responder status following CBT or ACT for social
   anxiety disorder. This suggests that the functioning of neural circuitry
   supporting emotion regulation capacities may be a `gateway' to receiving
   benefit from psychological treatments. Future work should aim to
   replicate this effect in a larger sample and consider methods for
   enhancing functional connectivity within this circuitry as a potential
   treatment adjunct.}},

Abstract = {{Deficits in theory of mind (ToM) processing have been observed in people
   with bipolar disorder (BD), but the neural basis of these deficits
   remains unclear. Here, we studied the relations between neural
   activation, dysfunctional beliefs and behavioral responses in people

   healthy-control participants (HC) underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a novel ToM task. The
   Dysfunctional Attitudes scale (DAS) and the Brief Hypomanic Attitudes
   and Positive Predictions Inventory (BHAPPI) were used to assess
   dysfunctional beliefs. Significant differences in neural activation were
   observed between HC and BD patients in regions associated with ToM
   processing: medial frontal, cingulate, anterior cingulate and superior
   temporal gyri. Correlations between DAS scores and neural activity in
   medial frontal and cingulate gyri were observed for HC only. Increased
   activation in brain regions associated with ToM processing in patients
   compared to HC provides further evidence of disruption in networks
   controlling social-cognitive processes. Whether this results from
   compensatory responses to maintain appropriate behavior is unknown.}},

Title = {{Neural and Behavioral Correlates of Sacred Values and Vulnerability to
   Violent Extremism}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Violent extremism is often explicitly motivated by commitment to
   abstract ideals such as the nation or divine law-so-called ``sacred{''}
   values that are relatively insensitive to material incentives and define
   our primary reference groups. Moreover, extreme pro-group behavior seems
   to intensify after social exclusion. This fMRI study explores underlying
   neural and behavioral relationships between sacred values, violent
   extremism, and social exclusion. Ethnographic fieldwork and
   psychological surveys were carried out among 535 young men from a
   European Muslim community in neighborhoods in and around Barcelona,
   Spain. Candidates for an fMRI experiment were selected from those who
   expressed willingness to engage in or facilitate, violence associated
   with jihadist causes; 38 of whom agreed to be scanned. In the scanner,
   participants were assessed for their willingness to fight and die for
   in-group sacred values before and after an experimental manipulation
   using Cyberball, a toss ball game known to yield strong feelings of
   social exclusion. Results indicate that neural activity associated with
   sacred value processing in a sample vulnerable to recruitment into
   violent extremism shows marked activity in the left inferior frontal
   gyrus, a region previously associated with sacred values and rule
   retrieval. Participants also behaviorally expressed greater willingness
   to fight and die for sacred versus nonsacred values, consistent with
   previous studies of combatants and noncombatants. The social exclusion
   manipulation specifically affected nonsacred values, increasing their
   similarities with sacred values in terms of heightened left inferior
   frontal activity and greater expressed willingness to fight and die.
   These findings suggest that sacralization of values interacts with
   willingness to engage in extreme behavior in populations vulnerable to
   radicalization. In addition, social exclusion may be a relevant factor
   motivating violent extremism and consolidation of sacred values. If so,
   counteracting social exclusion and sacralization of values should figure
   into policies to prevent radicalization.}},

Abstract = {{The perception of actions underwrites a wide range of socio-cognitive
   functions. Previous neuroimaging and lesion studies identified several
   components of the brain network for visual biological motion (BM)
   processing, but interactions among these components and their
   relationship to behavior remain little understood. Here, using a
   recently developed integrative analysis of structural and effective
   connectivity derived from high angular resolution diffusion imaging
   (HARDI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we assess the
   cerebro-cerebellar network for processing of camouflaged point-light BM.
   Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) informed by probabilistic tractography
   indicates that the right superior temporal sulcus (STS) serves as an
   integrator within the temporal module. However, the STS does not appear
   to be a ``gatekeeper{''} in the functional integration of the
   occipito-temporal and frontal regions: The fusiform gyrus (FFG) and
   middle temporal cortex (MTC) are also connected to the right inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG) and insula, indicating multiple parallel pathways.
   BM-specific loops of effective connectivity are seen between the left
   lateral cerebellar lobule Crus I and right STS, as well as between the
   left Crus I and right insula. The prevalence of a structural pathway
   between the FFG and STS is associated with better BM detection.
   Moreover, a canonical variate analysis shows that the visual sensitivity
   to BM is best predicted by BM-specific effective connectivity from the
   FFG to STS and from the IFG, insula, and STS to the early visual cortex.
   Overall, the study characterizes the architecture of the
   cerebro-cerebellar network for BM processing and offers prospects for
   assessing the social brain.}},

   versus Global Preferences}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The Weak Central Coherence account of autism spectrum disorders posits
   that individuals with ASD utilize a detail-oriented information
   processing bias. While this local bias is helpful in visual search
   tasks, ASD individuals falter in social cognition tasks where coherence
   is advantageous. The present study examined the neural correlates of
   Weak Central Coherence in ASD during visual and social processing.
   Fifteen ASD and sixteen typically developing children/adolescents
   completed a social/visual information processing task in an fMRI
   scanner. The stimuli consisted of human characters, composed of
   geometrical shapes, displaying different emotions. In the locally
   oriented Shape condition, participants indicated whether a given shape
   was present in a figure. In the Emotion condition, participants
   identified the emotion conveyed by the character in the figure at the
   global level. Whole-brain within-and between-group activation and
   seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analyses were conducted in SPM12
   and the CONN toolbox. The ASD group was significantly faster in shape
   identification, but less accurate in emotion identification. The TD
   group showed significantly increased areas of activity over the ASD
   group in the Shape task in regions associated with executive control,
   such as the medial prefrontal cortex and middle frontal gyrus,
   suggesting increased interference from the global/social information.
   During the Emotion condition, the ASD group showed decreased
   connectivity between frontal and posterior regions and between body
   perception and motor networks, suggesting a possible difference in
   mirroring. The findings suggest that social cognitive factors, not
   visual processing biases, underlie the observed behavioral differences.

   idioms, and irony. Effect Size-Signed Differential Mapping software was
   used to calculate the mean for all contrasts as well as for each
   pragmatic form, and make comparisons among all forms. Due to variations
   in pragmatic content configuration such as natural language, stimulus
   modality, and writing systems, these variations were also analyzed with
   subgroups' analyses. The analyses found a highly reproducible bilateral
   frontotemporal and medial prefrontal cortex network for pragmatic
   comprehension. Each pragmatic form showed a specific convergence pattern
   within this bilateral network. Natural language analyses showed that
   frontotemporal regions were recruited by Germanic languages, while only
   left frontal areas were recruited by Romance languages, and right medial
   prefrontal cortex by Japanese. In conclusion, pragmatic language
   comprehension involves classical language areas in bilateral perisylvian
   regions, along with the medial prefrontal cortex, an area involved in
   social cognition. Together, these areas could represent the ``pragmatic
   language network{''}. Nonetheless, when proposing a universal neural
   substrate for all forms of pragmatic language, the diversity among
   studies in terms of pragmatic form, and configuration, must be taken
   into consideration. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Individuals show marked variability in determining to be honest or
   deceptive in daily life. A large number of studies have investigated the
   neural substrates of deception; however, the brain networks contributing
   to the individual differences in deception remain unclear. In this
   study, we sought to address this issue by employing a machine-learning
   approach to predict individuals' deceptive propensity based on the
   topological properties of whole-brain resting-state functional
   connectivity (RSFC). Participants finished the resting-state functional
   MRI (fMRI) data acquisition, and then, one week later, participated as
   proposers in a modified ultimatum game in which they spontaneously chose
   to be honest or deceptive. A linear relevance vector regression (RVR)
   model was trained and validated to examine the relationship between
   topological properties of networks of RSFC and actual deceptive
   behaviors. The machine-learning model sufficiently decoded individual
   differences in deception using three brain networks based on RSFC,
   including the executive controlling network (dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex, middle frontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex), the social and
   mentalizing network (the temporal lobe, temporoparietal junction, and
   inferior parietal lobule), and the reward network (putamen and
   thalamus). These networks have been found to form a signaling cognitive
   framework of deception by coding the mental states of others and the
   reward or values of deception or honesty, and integrating this
   information to make a final decision about being deceptive or honest.
   These findings suggest the potential of using RSFC as a task-independent
   neural trait for predicting deceptive propensity, and shed light on
   using machine-learning approaches in deception detection. (C) 2018 IBRO.

Abstract = {{Emotions are fundamentally temporal processes that dynamically change
   over time. This temporal nature is inherently involved in making
   emotions adaptive by guiding interactions with our environment. Both the
   size of emotional changes across time (i.e., emotional instability) and
   the tendency of emotions to persist across time (i.e., autocorrelation
   of emotional experience, emotional inertia) are key features of a
   person's emotion dynamics, and have been found central to maladaptive
   functioning and psychopathology as well as linked to social functioning.
   However, whether different (neural) mechanisms are underlying these
   dynamics as well as how they are related to the processing of (socio-)
   emotional information is to date widely unknown. Using a combination of
   Experience Sampling methods (ESMs) and fMRI (involving a social feedback
   paradigm), we examine how emotional instability and inertia in everyday
   life are associated with different aspects of the neural response to
   socio-emotional events. The findings indicate that while emotional
   instability is connected to the response of the core salience network
   (SN), emotional inertia is associated to responses in the
   parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (IOFC).
   This is the first study showing that different aspects of the neural
   response to socio-emotional events are associated with different aspects
   of the temporal dynamics of emotion in real life.}},

Abstract = {{How do we represent information without sensory features? How are
   abstract concepts like ``freedom{''}, devoid of external perceptible
   referents, represented in the brain? Here, to address the role of
   sensory information in the neural representation of concepts, we used
   fMRI to investigate how people born blind process concepts whose

   providing a gradient between fully concrete and fully abstract concepts

   concept perceptibility and objecthood: preference for imperceptible
   object concepts was found in dorsal ATL, for abstract (non-object,

   Developmental Dyslexia}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain the reading difficulty
   caused by developmental dyslexia (DD). The current study examined
   visuo-orthographic processing in children with dyslexia to determine
   whether orthographic deficits are explainable based solely on visual
   deficits. To identify orthographic-specific, visual perception-specific,
   and overlapping deficits, we included two tasks (lexical and perceptual)
   in three Chinese subject groups: children with DD, age-matched controls
   (AC), and reading matched controls (RC) using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that the left precuneus showed
   decreased activation across both tasks for the DD group compared to the
   two control groups, thus reflecting visual processing deficits in
   children with DD, which also affects orthographic processing.
   Furthermore, we found that the functional connectivity between left
   middle occipital gyrus (LMOG) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was
   decreased in the DD group compared to AC and RC for only the lexical
   task. This suggests a weaker association between orthography and
   phonology for children with DD. In addition, the children with DD showed
   decreased functional connectivity between the LMOG and right
   parahippocampal gyrus for only the visual perceptual task, thereby
   indicating a weaker association between visual regions for DD during
   visual symbol processing. Taken together, our findings suggest that the
   observed orthographic processing deficit in DD might be driven by both a
   basic visual deficit, and a linguistic deficit.}},

Title = {{Neurobiology of social reward valuation in adults with a history of
   anorexia nervosa}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a disorder characterized by atypical patterns
   of reward valuation (e. g. positive valuation of hunger). Atypical
   reward processing may extend into social domains. If so, such findings
   would be of prognostic significance as impaired social functioning
   predicts worse outcome. We explore neural circuits implicated in social
   reward processing in individuals with a history of AN who are
   weight-restored relative to controls and examine the effects of illness
   course on the experience of social value.
   Method
   20 weight-restored individuals with a history of AN (AN-WR) and 24
   healthy control (HC) participants were assessed using fMRI tasks that
   tapped social reward: smiling faces and full human figures that varied
   in attractiveness and weight.
   Results
   AN-WR differed from HC in attractiveness ratings by weight (negatively
   correlated in ANWR). While there were no significant differences when
   viewing smiling faces, viewing full figures resulted in decreased
   activation in regions implicated in reward valuation (the right caudate)
   for AN-WR and this region was negatively correlated with a sustained
   course of the disorder. Exploratory whole brain analyses revealed
   reduced activation in regions associated with social reward,
   self-referential processing, and cognitive reappraisal (e. g., medial
   prefrontal cortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens) with sustained
   disorder course.
   Discussion
   The rewarding value of full body images decreases with a sustained
   disorder course. This may reflect an extension of atypical reward
   processing documented in AN-WR, perhaps as a function of starvation
   dampening visceral motivational signals; the deployment of cognitive
   strategies that lessen the experience of reward; and/or the nature of
   the stimuli themselves as provocative of eating disorder symptoms (e.
   g., thin bodies). These findings did not extend to smiling face stimuli.
   Advances in technology (e. g., virtual avatars, text messaging) may
   provide novel means to build relationships, including therapeutic
   relationships, to support improved social connections without threats to
   symptom provocation.}},

Abstract = {{Humans engage in social interactions and have a fundamental need and
   motivation to establish and maintain social connections. Neuroimaging
   studies particularly focused on the neural substrates of social
   exclusion in healthy subjects (HC), borderline personality disorder
   (BPD), and major depression (MD). However, there is evidence regarding
   neural alterations also during social inclusion in BPD that we intended
   to elucidate in our study. Considering that patients with BPD often have
   comorbid MD, we investigated patients with BPD, and comorbid MD,
   patients with MD without BPD, and a sample of HC. By investigating these
   two clinical samples within one study design, we attempted to
   disentangle potential confounds arising by psychiatric disorder or
   medication and to relate neural alterations under social inclusion
   specifically to BPD. We investigated 48 females (15 BPD and MD, 16 MD,
   and 17 HC) aged between 18 and 40 years by fMRI (3D, using the
   established cyberball paradigm with social exclusion, inclusion, and
   passive watching conditions. Significant group-by-condition interaction
   effects (p < 0.05, FWE-corrected on cluster level) were observed within
   the dorsolateral (dIPFC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), the
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),
   and the precuneus. Comparisons of estimated neural activations revealed
   that significant interaction effects were related to a relative increase
   in neural activations during social inclusion in BPD. In detail, we
   observed a significant increase in differential (social inclusion vs.
   passive watching) neural activation within the dmPFC and the PCC in BPD
   compared to both, MD and HC. However, significant interaction effects
   within the dIPFC and the TPJ could not specifically be linked to BPD
   considering that they did not differ significantly between the two
   clinical groups in post-hoc comparisons. Our study supports previous
   results on effects of social and inclusion in BPD, and provides further
   evidence regarding disorder specific neural alterations in BPD for brain
   regions associated with self-referential and mentalizing processes
   during social inclusion.}},

Title = {{Deformation-based Morphometry MRI Reveals Brain Structural Modifications
   in Living Mu Opioid Receptor Knockout Mice}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Mu opioid receptor (MOR) activation facilitates reward processing and
   reduces pain, and brain networks underlying these effects are under
   intense investigation. Mice lacking the MOR gene (MOR KO mice) show
   lower drug and social reward, enhanced pain sensitivity and altered
   emotional responses. Our previous neuroimaging analysis using
   Resting-state (Rs) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) showed
   significant alterations of functional connectivity (FC) within
   reward/aversion networks in these mice, in agreement with their
   behavioral deficits. Here we further used a structural MRI approach to
   determine whether volumetric alterations also occur in MOR KO mice. We
   acquired anatomical images using a 7-Tesla MRI scanner and measured
   deformation-based morphometry (DBM) for each voxel in subjects from MOR
   KO and control groups. Our analysis shows marked anatomical differences
   in mutant animals. We observed both local volumetric contraction
   (striatum, nucleus accumbens, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis,
   hippocampus, hypothalamus and periacqueducal gray) and expansion
   (prefrontal cortex, amygdala, habenula, and periacqueducal gray) at
   voxel level. Volumetric modifications occurred mainly in MOR-enriched
   regions and across reward/aversion centers, consistent with our prior FC
   findings. Specifically, several regions with volume differences
   corresponded to components showing highest FC changes in our previous
   Rs-fMRI study, suggesting a possible function-structure relationship in
   MOR KO-related brain differences. In conclusion, both Rs-fMRI and
   volumetric MRI in live MOR KO mice concur to disclose functional and
   structural whole-brain level mechanisms that likely drive MOR-controlled
   behaviors in animals, and may translate to MOR-associated endophenotypes
   or disease in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive reappraisal is associated with major depressive disorder
   (MDD), while spontaneous activity patterns of the default mode network
   (DMN) is implicated in reappraisal and MDD. However, neural mechanisms
   subserving the close association of spontaneous reappraisal and
   depression are unclear. Spontaneous reappraisal, depression and
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were measured from
   105 healthy subjects. We assessed the temporal complexity (Hurst
   exponent), Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional Amplitude of Low
   Frequency Fluctuation (fALFF) profiles of DMN, a network involved in
   both reappraisal and depression. Mediation effects of these standard
   measures on the relationship between reappraisal and depression, and the
   contributions of each DMN subregion, were assessed. Results indicated
   that Hurst exponent (H) of DMN, whether extracted by independent
   component analysis or region of interest, was significantly associated
   with reappraisal scores. An individual with a higher reappraisal score
   has a lower Hurst value of DMN. Mediation analyses suggest that H of DMN
   partially mediates the association between reappraisal and the degree of
   depression, and this mediation effect arises from the contribution of
   medial prefrontal cortex. Neither ReHo nor fALFF showed a similar
   correlation or mediation effect. These findings suggest that temporal
   dynamics of DMN play an important role in emotion regulation and its
   association with depression. H of DMN may serve as a neural marker
   mediating the association between reappraisal and depression.}},

Abstract = {{Does the biased attention toward social threats dwells on or disappears
   in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD)? We investigated the
   neural mechanism of attentional bias in terms of attentional capture and
   holding in SAD. A total of 31 SAD patients and 30 healthy controls
   performed a continuous performance task detecting the orientation of a
   red letter `T' while angry or neutral face distractors appeared or
   disappeared at the center of the screen. Behaviorally, typical
   attentional capture effects were found in response to abruptly appearing
   distractors in both groups. The patient group showed significant
   attentional dwelling effects in response to the angry face distractor
   only. Patients showed increased neural activity in the amygdala,
   insula/inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and temporo-parietal junction (TPJ)
   compared with those of controls for the abruptly appearing angry
   distractor. Patients also maintained increased activities in brain
   regions related to attentional reorienting to distractor, namely the TPJ
   and IFG in line with their behavioral results of attentional holding
   effects. Our results indicate that patients with SAD showed prolonged
   attentional bias to task-irrelevant social threats. The underlying
   mechanism of prolonged attentional bias in SAD was indicated with
   amygdala hyperactivity and continued activity of the bottom-up attention
   network including the TPJ and IFG.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Essential tremor (ET) is the most common movement disorder.
   Drug-resistant ET can benefit from standard stereotactic deep brain
   stimulation or radiofrequency thalamotomy or, alternatively, minimally
   invasive techniques, including stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and
   high-intensity focused ultrasound, at the level of the ventral
   intermediate nucleus (Vim). The aim of the present study was to evaluate
   potential correlations between pretherapeutic interconnectivity (IC), as
   depicted on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and MR signature
   volume at 1 year after Vim SRS for tremor, to be able to potentially
   identify hypo-and hyperresponders based only on pretherapeutic
   neuroimaging data.
   METHODS Seventeen consecutive patients with ET were included, who
   benefitted from left unilateral SRS thalamotomy (SRS-T) between
   September 2014 and August 2015. Standard tremor assessment and rs-fMRI
   were acquired pretherapeutically and 1 year after SRS-T. A healthy
   control group was also included (n = 12). Group-level independent
   component analysis (ICA; only n = 17 for pretherapeutic rs-fMRI) was
   applied. The mean MR signature volume was 0.125 ml (median 0.063 ml,
   range 0.002-0.600 ml). The authors correlated baseline IC with 1-year MR
   signatures within all networks. A 2-sample t-test at the level of each
   component was first performed in two groups: group 1 (n = 8, volume <
   0.063 ml) and group 2 (n = 9, volume >= 0.063 ml). These groups did not
   statistically differ by age, duration of symptoms, baseline ADL score,
   ADL point decrease at 1 year, time to tremor arrest, or baseline tremor
   score on the treated hand (TSTH; p > 0.05). An ANOVA was then performed
   on each component, using individual subject-level maps and continuous
   values of 1-year MR signatures, correlated with pretherapeutic IC.
   RESULTS Using 2-sample t-tests, two networks were found to be
   statistically significant: network 3, including the brain-stem, motor
   cerebellum, bilateral thalamus, and left supplementary motor area (SMA)
   (p(FWE) = 0.004, cluster size = 94), interconnected with the red nucleus
   (MNI -2, -22, -32); and network 9, including the brainstem, posterior
   insula, bilateral thalamus, and left SMA (p(FWE) = 0.002, cluster size =
   106), interconnected with the left SMA (MNI 24, -28, 44). Higher
   pretherapeutic IC was associated with higher MR volumes, in a network
   including the anterior default-mode network and bilateral thalamus
   (ANOVA, p(FWE) = 0.004, cluster size = 73), interconnected with
   cerebellar lobule V (MNI -12, -70, -22). Moreover, in the same network,
   radiological hyporesponders presented with negative IC values.
   CONCLUSIONS These findings have clinical implications for predicting MR
   signature volumes after SRS-T. Here, using pretherapeutic MRI and data
   processing without prior hypothesis, the authors showed that
   pretherapeutic network inter-connectivity strength predicts 1-year MR
   signature volumes following SRS-T.}},

Abstract = {{Angry outbursts during interpersonal provocations may lead to violence
   and prevails in numerous pathological conditions. In the anger-infused
   Ultimatum Game (aiUG), unfair monetary offers accompanied by written
   provocations induce anger. Rejection of such offers relates to
   aggression, whereas acceptance to anger regulation. We previously
   demonstrated the involvement of the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC) in accepting unfair offers and attenuating anger during an aiUG,
   suggestive of its role in anger regulation. Here, we aimed to enhance
   anger regulation by facilitating vmPFC activity during anger induction,
   using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and
   simultaneously with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to validate
   modulation of vmPFC activity. In a cross-over, sham-controlled,
   double-blind study, participants (N = 25) were each scanned twice,
   counterbalancing sham and active tDCS applied during administration of
   the aiUG. Outcome measures included the effect of active versus sham
   stimulation on vmPFC activity, unfair offers' acceptance rates,
   self-reported anger, and aggressive behavior in a subsequent reactive
   aggression paradigm. Results indicate that active stimulation led to
   increased vmPFC activity during the processing of unfair offers,
   increased acceptance rates of these offers, and mitigated the increase
   in self-reported anger following the aiUG. We also noted a decrease in
   subsequent aggressive behavior following active stimulation, but only
   when active stimulation was conducted in the first experimental session.
   Finally, an exploratory finding indicated that participants with a
   stronger habitual tendency to use suppression as an emotion regulation
   strategy, reported less anger following the aiUG in the active compared
   to sham stimulation conditions. Findings support a potential causal link
   between vmPFC functionality and the experience and expression of anger,
   supporting vmPFC's role in anger regulation, and providing a promising
   avenue for reducing angry and aggressive outbursts during interpersonal
   provocations in various psychiatric and medical conditions. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Changes in emotional processing (EP) and in theory of mind (TOM) are
   central across treatment approaches for patients with borderline
   personality disorder (BPD). Although the assessment of EP relies on the
   observation of a patient's self-criticism in a two-chair dialogue, an
   individual's TOM assessments is made based on responses to humorous
   stimuli based on false beliefs. For this pilot study, we assessed eight
   patients with BPD before and after a 3-month-long psychiatric treatment,
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging and behavioral tasks. We
   observed arousal increase within the session of the two-chair dialogue
   (d = 0.36), paralleled by arousal decrease between sessions (d = 0.80).
   We found treatment-associated trends for neural activity reduction in
   brain areas central for EP and TOM. Our exploratory findings using an
   integrative assessment procedure of changes in EP and TOM point toward
   evidence for treatment effects at the brain systems level related to
   behavioral modulation.}},

Title = {{Interaction of Developmental Venous Anomalies with Resting-State
   Functional MRI Measures}},

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2326-2331}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Functional MR imaging of the brain, used for
   both clinical and neuroscientific applications, relies on measuring
   fluctuations in blood oxygenation. Such measurements are susceptible to
   noise of vascular origin. The purpose of this study was to assess
   whether developmental venous anomalies, which are frequently observed
   normal variants, can bias fMRI measures by appearing as true neural
   signal.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Large developmental venous anomalies (1 in each
   of 14 participants) were identified from a large neuroimaging cohort (n
   = 814). Resting-state fMRI data were decomposed using independent
   component analysis, a data-driven technique that creates distinct
   component maps representing aspects of either structured noise or true
   neural activity. We searched all independent components for maps that
   exhibited a spatial distribution of their signals following the
   topography of developmental venous anomalies.
   RESULTS: Of the 14 developmental venous anomalies identified, 10 were
   clearly present in 17 fMRI independent components in total. While 9
   (52.9\%) of these 17 independent components were dominated by venous
   contributions and 2 (11.8\%) by motion artifacts, 2 independent
   components (11.8\%) showed partial neural signal contributions and 5
   independent components (29.4\%) unambiguously exhibited typical neural
   signal patterns.
   CONCLUSIONS: Developmental venous anomalies can strongly resemble neural
   signal as measured by fMRI. They are thus a potential source of bias in
   fMRI analyses, especially when present in the cortex. This could impede
   interpretation of local activity in patients, such as in presurgical
   mapping. In scientific studies with large samples, developmental venous
   anomaly confounds could be mainly addressed using independent component
   analysis-based denoising.}},

Abstract = {{The sunk cost effect is the tendency to continue an investment, or take
   an action, even though it has higher future costs than benefits, if
   costs of time, money, or effort were previously incurred. This type of
   decision bias is pervasive in real life and has been studied in various
   disciplines. Previous studies and clinical observations suggest that
   decision-making under sunk costs is altered in gambling disorder (GD).
   However, the neural mechanisms of decision-making under sunk costs in GD
   remain largely unknown, and so is their association with the clinical
   characteristics of this patient group. Here, by combining functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and the task that demonstrated a clear
   example of the sunk cost effect, we investigated the neural correlates
   during decision-making under sunk costs in GD. We found no significant
   differences in the strength of the sunk cost effect between the GD and
   healthy control (HC) groups. However, the strength of the sunk cost
   effect in patients with GD showed a significant negative correlation
   with abstinence period and a marginally significant positive correlation
   with the duration of illness. We also found a reduction in the neural
   activation in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex during decision-making
   under sunk costs for the GD group compared with the HC group.
   Furthermore, in patients with GD, the levels of activation in this area
   negatively correlated with the duration of illness. These findings have
   important clinical implications. This study will contribute to a better
   understanding of the mechanisms underlying altered decision-making
   abilities in GD. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a viable
   method to study the neural processing underlying cognition in awake
   dogs. Working dogs were presented with pictures of dog and human faces.
   The human faces varied in familiarity (familiar trainers and unfamiliar
   individuals) and emotional valence (negative, neutral, and positive).
   Dog faces were familiar (kennel mates) or unfamiliar. The findings
   revealed adjacent but separate brain areas in the left temporal cortex
   for processing human and dog faces in the dog brain. The human face area
   (HFA) and dog face area (DFA) were both parametrically modulated by
   valence indicating emotion was not the basis for the separation. The HFA
   and DFA were not influenced by familiarity. Using resting state fMRI
   data, functional connectivity networks (connectivity fingerprints) were
   compared and matched across dogs and humans. These network analyses
   found that the HFA mapped onto the human fusiform area and the DFA
   mapped onto the human superior temporal gyrus, both core areas in the
   human face processing system. The findings provide insight into the
   evolution of face processing.}},

   characterized by atypical functional integration of brain regions. The
   vast majority of neuroimaging studies of ASD have focused on older
   children, adolescents, and adults with the disorder. Very little work
   has explored whole-brain functional connectivity of young children with
   ASD. Here, we collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging data from 58 young children (mean age 4.98 years; 29 with ASD;
   29 matched healthy controls {[}HC]). All children were under sedation
   during scanning. A functional ``connectedness{''} method was first used
   to seek for brain regions showing atypical functional connectivity (FC)
   in children with ASD. Then, a recurrent-seek strategy was applied to
   reveal atypical FC circuits in ASD children. FC matrices between
   regions-of-interest (ROIs) were compared between ASD and HC. Finally, a
   support vector regression (SVR) method was used to assess the
   relationship between the FC circuits and ASD symptom severity. Two
   atypical FC circuits comprising 23 ROIs in ASD were revealed: one
   predominantly comprised brain regions involved with social cognition
   showing under-connectivity in ASD; the other predominantly comprised
   sensory-motor and visual brain regions showing overconnectivity in ASD.
   The SVR analysis showed that the two FC circuits were separately related
   to social deficits and restricted behavior scores. These findings
   indicate disrupted FC of neural circuits involved in the social and
   sensorimotor processes in young children with ASD. The finding of the
   atypical FC patterns in young children with ASD underscores the utility
   of studying younger children with the disorder, and highlights nuanced
   patterns of brain connectivity underlying behavior closer to disorder
   onset. (C) 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley

Abstract = {{Humor is a ubiquitous human ability with important implications for both
   social and emotional functioning. Patients with neuropsychiatric
   disorders, such as schizophrenia, experience difficulties in the
   comprehension and appreciation of humor. However, the specific neural
   mechanisms underlying these deficits are unknown. In the current study,
   we sought to elucidate the neural correlates of humor processing in
   patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). Functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) was used in thirty-one patients with
   SSD and a control group, performing a humor processing paradigm. Both
   regional brain activation and parametric modulation of brain responses
   via subjective funniness ratings were collected during the scanning
   procedure. On a neural level, large overlaps in fronto-temporal brain
   activation was found in both groups. However, patients compared to
   healthy control subjects showed attenuated responses in frontal brain
   regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC), superior frontal gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, as well
   as in the striatum (ie. caudate nucleus, putamen). Furthermore,
   parametric modulation of subjective funniness ratings resulted in
   attenuated responses in the mPFC, bilateral insula, and left
   hippocampus. Analysis of functional connectivity revealed alterations in
   mPFC-caudate nucleus coupling in patients with SSD, which might reflect
   impairments in reward-related processing. Notably, alterations in
   mPFC-caudate nucleus coupling in patients were significantly associated
   to subjective funniness ratings. Our results extend previous findings
   demonstrating the relevance of frontal hypoactivation for humor
   processing impairments in patients with SSD and first point towards
   alterations in humor appreciation processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Introspective accuracy (IA) refers to the ability to accurately assess
   one's own skills and capabilities. Recent work provides evidence of IA
   deficits in schizophrenia that are predictive of everyday functioning.
   Thus, IA deficits are an important target to understand mechanistically.
   The current study used fMRI to assess neural activation in 32 healthy
   controls and 31 individuals with schizophrenia as they completed IA and
   control versions of a social cognitive task (i.e., emotion recognition).
   Analyses revealed different areas of IA-specific neural activity between
   groups including activations of rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (rIPFC)
   and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in healthy individuals that were
   absent in patients. Direct group comparisons revealed greater
   IA-specific activation for healthy individuals in right rIPFC, a region
   thought to be critical for successful IA. For healthy individuals only,
   activation in rIPFC was positively correlated with IA ability, but no
   association was observed for patients. Further, among individuals with
   schizophrenia, increased activation of rIPFC during judgments of IA was
   positively correlated with better informant-reported interpersonal
   functioning. These results suggest that reduced specialization of
   IA-related neural activation may contribute to impaired IA in
   schizophrenia and also highlight IA as a potential target for
   remediation programs aimed at improving real-world functioning. (C) 2018

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The ability to perceive the motion of biological objects,
   such as faces, is a critical component of daily function and correlates
   with the ability to successfully navigate social situations (social
   cognition). Deficits in motion perception in schizophrenia were first
   demonstrated about 20 years ago but remain understudied, especially in
   the early, potentially prodromal, stages of the illness. The authors
   examined the neural bases of visual sensory processing impairments,
   including motion, in patients with schizophrenia (N=63) and attenuated
   psychosis (clinical high risk) (N=32) compared with age-matched healthy
   control subjects (N=67).
   Method: Electrophysiological recordings during stimulus and motion
   processing were analyzed using oscillatory (time frequency) approaches
   that differentiated motion-onset-evoked activity from stimulus-onset
   sensory-evoked responses. These were compared with functional MRI (fMRI)
   measures of motion processing.
   Results: Significant deficits in motion processing were observed across
   the two patient groups, and these deficits predicted impairments in both
   face-emotion recognition and cognitive function. In contrast to motion
   processing, sensory-evoked stimulus-onset responses were intact in
   patients with attenuated psychosis, and, further, the relative deficit
   in motion-onset responses compared with stimulus-onset responses
   predicted transition to schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia,
   motion detection deficits mapped to impaired activation in
   motion-sensitive visual cortex during fMRI. Additional visual
   impairments in patients with schizophrenia, not present in patients with
   attenuated psychosis, implicated other visual regions, including the
   middle occipital gyrus and pulvinar thalamic nucleus.
   Conclusions: The study findings emphasize the importance of
   sensory-level visual dysfunction in the etiology of schizophrenia and in
   the personal experience of individuals with the disorder and demonstrate
   that motion-processing deficits may predate illness onset and contribute
   to impaired function even in patients with attenuated psychosis.}},

Abstract = {{To assess whether EGb761 could protect elderly diabetic mice with
   cognitive disorders and explore the role of beclin-1-mediated autophagy
   in these protective effects. Two-month-old male db/db(-/-) mice and
   wild-type C57/BL6 mice were randomly divided into six groups: db/db(-/-)
   control, db/db(-/-) 50 mg, db/db(-/-) 100 mg, wild-type (WT) control, WT
   50 mg, and WT 100 mg. EGb761 (50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg of bodyweight) was
   given by gavage once a day for 1 month from the age of 6 months. Y-maze
   and social choice tests were performed at 8th months. The blood pressure
   was measured. The imaging changes in the brain were measured using
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The expression and distribution of
   beclin-1, LC3, and NF-kappa B were detected using immunohistochemistry
   staining and western blotting. Ultrastructure alterations in the
   hippocampus were observed using transmission electron microscopy.
   Compared with WT mice, the learning ability, memory and overall
   cognitive function of db/db(-/-) mice decreased (P < 0.05), and EGb761
   could significantly improve the learning and memory function of
   db/db(-/-)mice (P < 0.05). EGb761 significantly improved systolic blood
   pressure in db/db(-/-) mice (P < 0.01). In addition, fMRI-bold showed a
   decline in the hippocampus of mice in the db/db(-/-) group compared with
   WT. EGb761 could improve these above changes. Immunohistochemistry
   staining and western blotting confirmed that EGb761 significantly
   increased beclin-1 and reduced LC3II/I levels in the brains of
   db/db(-/-) mice (P < 0.05). NF-kappa B levels were obviously higher in
   the db/db(-/-) group than that in the WT group, and EGb761 significantly
   reduced NF-kappa B levels in db/db(-/-) mice (P < 0.05). There was a
   trend of increased autophagosomes in db/db(-/-) mice, but EGb761 did not
   change obviously the number of autophagosomes. Compared with normal aged
   WT mice, aging db/db(-/-) mice had more common complications of cerebral
   small vessel disease and cognitive dysfunction. EGb761 could
   significantly improve the cognitive function of aging db/db(-/-) mice
   via a mechanism that may involve the regulation of beclin-1, LC3, and
   NF-kappa B.}},

Abstract = {{Social information is particularly relevant for the human species
   because of its direct link to guiding physiological responses and
   behavior. Accordingly, extant functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) data suggest that social content may form a unique stimulus
   dimension. It remains largely unknown, however, how neural activity
   underlying social (versus nonsocial) information processing temporally
   unfolds, and how such social information appraisal may interact with the
   processing of other stimulus characteristics, particularly emotional
   meaning. Here, we presented complex visual scenes differing in both
   social (vs. nonsocial) and emotional relevance (positive, negative,
   neutral) intermixed with scrambled versions of these pictures to N = 24
   healthy young adults. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to intact
   pictures were examined for gaining insight to the dynamics of appraisal
   of both dimensions, implemented within the brain. Our main finding is an
   early interaction between social and emotional relevance due to enhanced
   amplitudes of early ERP components to emotionally positive and neutral
   pictures of social compared to nonsocial content, presumably reflecting
   rapid allocation of attention and counteracting an overall negativity
   bias. Importantly, our ERP data show high similarity with previously
   observed fMRI data using the same stimuli, and source estimations
   located the ERP effects in overlapping occipitotemporal brain areas. Our
   novel data suggest that relevance detection may occur already as early
   as around 100 ms after stimulus onset and may combine relevance checks
   not only examining intrinsic pleasantness/emotional valence but also
   social content as a unique, highly relevant stimulus dimension.}},

Volume = {{1700}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have shown mirror system (MS) activation when
   participants infer internal states e.g. emotions, intentions or beliefs
   (known as `mentalizing') from others' actions. However, the exact role
   of the MS in mentalizing tasks is unknown. Dysfunctional MS activation
   may underlie mentalizing deficits experienced by adults with autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD). This study investigated the timing of MS
   activity when inferring intentions in order to delineate between
   existing models of MS involvement. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) was applied to the primary motor cortex at different
   time points during the observation of hand actions whilst participants
   inferred intentions (mentalizing task) and performed a non-mentalizing
   task. Electromyographic activity in the contralateral hand was used as
   an indirect measure of MS activity. Greater corticospinal activity was
   found during the mentalizing task than the non-mentalizing task, but
   only at the end of observed actions, suggesting late MS involvement in
   processing intentions. Enhanced corticospinal activity was not related
   to autistic traits or behavioural performance suggesting the MS has a
   more automatic role in processing others' intentions, irrespective of
   mentalizing ability. Our results extend current knowledge of MS
   activation when mentalizing, allowing initial delineation between
   different models of MS involvement in mentalizing. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Numerous neuroimaging studies have identified various brain networks
   using task-free analyses. While these networks undoubtedly support
   higher cognition, their precise functional characteristics are rarely
   probed directly. The frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes contain the
   majority of the tertiary association cortex, which are key substrates
   for higher cognition including executive function, language, memory, and
   attention. Accordingly, we established the cognitive signature of a set
   of contrastive brain networks on the main tertiary association cortices,
   identified in two task-independent datasets. Using graph-theory
   analysis, we revealed multiple networks across the frontal, temporal,
   and parietal cortex, derived from structural and functional
   connectivity. The patterns of network activity were then investigated
   using three task-active fMRI datasets to generate the functional
   profiles of the identified networks. We employed representational
   dissimilarity analysis on these functional data to quantify and compare
   the representational characteristics of the networks. Our results
   demonstrated that the topology of the task-independent networks was
   strongly associated with the patterns of network activity in the
   task-active fMRI. Our findings establish a direct relationship between
   the brain networks identified from task-free datasets and higher
   cognitive functions including cognitive control, language, memory,
   visuospatial function, and perception. Not only does this study support
   the widely held view that higher cognitive functions are supported by
   widespread, distributed cortical networks, but also it elucidates a
   methodological approach for formally establishing their relationship.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although sex differences in aggression have been investigated for
   decades, little is known about the underlying neurobiology of this
   phenomenon. To address this gap, the present study implemented a social
   reactive aggression paradigm in 20 women and 22 men, employing a
   modified Taylor Aggression Task (mTAT) to provoke aggressive behavior in
   an fMRI setting. Subjects were provoked by money subtraction from a fake
   opponent and given the opportunity to retaliate likewise. In the absence
   of behavioral differences, male and female subjects showed differential
   brain activation patterns in response to provocation. Men had higher
   left amygdala activation during high provocation. This amygdala
   activation correlated with trait anger scores in men, but not in women.
   Also, men showed a positive association between orbitofrontal cortex,
   rectal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity in the
   provocation contrast and their tendency to respond aggressively, whereas
   women displayed a negative association. As the rectal gyrus and OFC have
   been attributed a crucial role in automatic emotion regulation, this
   finding points toward the assumption that highly aggressive men use
   automatic emotion regulation to a greater extent in response to
   provocation compared to highly aggressive women.}},

Abstract = {{Psychometric intelligence is closely related to working memory capacity.
   Here we aim to determine the associations of neural activation patterns
   during the N-back working memory paradigm with psychometric intelligence
   and working memory performance. We solved the statistical problems of
   previous studies using (1) a large cohort of 1235 young adults and (2)
   robust voxel-by-voxel permutation-based statistics at the whole-brain
   level. Many of the significant correlations were weak, and our findings
   were not consistent with those of previous studies. We observed that
   many of the significant correlations involved brain areas in the
   periphery or boundaries between the task-positive network (TPN) and
   task-negative network (TNN), suggesting that the expansion of the TPN or
   TNN is associated with greater cognitive ability. Lower activity in TPN
   and less task-induced deactivation (TID) in TNN were associated with
   greater cognitive ability. These findings indicate that subjects with
   greater cognitive ability have a lower brain response to task demand,
   consistent with the notion that TID in TNN reflects cognitive demand but
   partly inconsistent with the prevailing neural efficiency theory. One
   exception was the pre-supplementary motor area, which plays a key role
   in cognitive control and sequential processing. In this area,
   intelligent subjects demonstrated greater activity related to working
   memory, suggesting that the pre-supplementary motor area plays a unique
   role in the execution of working memory tasks in intelligent subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Creativity as a psychological phenomenon implies molecular processes, in
   the strict sense of the term, as well as global processes that can
   contemplate social or cultural interaction. The study of creativity,
   from the neurosciences perspective, has yielded findings that range from
   the genetic to the neuroanatomical. However, such findings are likely to
   have incomplete, or even erroneous, understanding if mediation of other
   variables is not considered. The objective of this work is to link
   emotional processing and creative attitude with the psychobiological
   variables associated with creativity. To do this, a review of the
   literature is made in which some approaches to creativity from the
   neurosciences are highlighted. It was considered that they were
   metaanalytic or critical review works, as well as empirical studies,
   which in both cases were indexed in Web of Science and had at least two
   citations per year, except for studies of 2017. As a result of the
   analysis of genetic studies, neurotransmission and others at the level
   of neuroimaging and electroencephalography, possible links to findings
   of work on emotional processing are indicated. The creative attitude, in
   turn, guiding the creative performances, gives a more comprehensive
   sense to such linkage. Finally, the findings of neuroscience are
   discussed in terms of the need to provide more limited frameworks that
   allow better explanations.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are adept at perceiving textures through touch. Previous
   neuroimaging studies have identified a distributed network of brain
   regions involved in the tactile perception of texture. However, it
   remains unclear how nodes in this network contribute to the tactile
   awareness of texture. To examine the hypothesis that such awareness
   involves the interaction of the primary somatosensory cortex with higher
   order cortices, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study utilizing the velvet hand illusion, in which an illusory
   velvet-like surface is perceived between the hands. Healthy participants
   were subjected to a strong illusion, a weak illusion, and tactile
   perception of real velvet. The strong illusion induced greater
   activation in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) than the weak
   illusion, and increases in such activation were positively correlated
   with the strength of the illusion. Furthermore, both actual and illusory
   perception of velvet induced common activation in S1.
   Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed that the
   strength of the illusion modulated the functional connectivity of S1
   with each of the following regions: the parietal operculum, superior
   parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, insula, and cerebellum. The present
   results indicate that S1 is associated with the conscious tactile
   perception of textures, which may be achieved via interactions with
   higher order somatosensory areas.}},

Abstract = {{When people sense that another person tries to control their decisions,
   some people will act against the control, whereas others will not. This
   individual tendency to control-averse behavior can have far-reaching
   consequences, such as engagement in illegal activities or noncompliance
   with medical treatments. Although individual differences in
   control-averse behavior have been well documented in behavioral studies,
   their neurological basis is less well understood. Here, we use a neural
   trait approach to examine whether individual differences in
   control-averse behavior might be linked to stable brain-based
   characteristics. To do so, we analyze the association between intrinsic
   connectivity networks as measured by resting state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging and control-averse behavior in an economic exchange
   game. In this game, subjects make choices that are either free or
   controlled by another person, with real consequences to both interaction
   partners. We find that the individual level of control-averse behavior
   can be positively predicted by intrinsic connectivity within the
   salience network, but not the central executive network or the default
   mode network. Specifically, subjects with a more prominent connectivity
   hub in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex show greater levels of
   control-averse behavior. This finding provides the first evidence that
   the heterogeneity in control-averse behavior might originate in
   systematic differences of the stable functional brain organization.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive control is one of the most important skills in day-to-day
   social and intellectual functioning but we are yet to understand the
   neural basis of the group of behaviors required to carry this out. Here,
   we probed changes over time in the brain network associated with
   cognitive control (the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal
   posterior parietal cortex, and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex)
   using both behavioral assays and functional brain imaging during a
   selective working memory task in 69 healthy participants within the age
   range 18-38 years (mean: 25, SD: +/- 6), assessed twice, 2 years apart.
   We aimed to explore the relationship of changing network activation and
   connectivity with behavioral tasks associated with cognitive control in
   this otherwise neurodevelopmentally stable group. We found that
   increased connectivity between frontoparietal cognitive control network
   regions during the working memory task was associated with improved
   memory and executive functions over the 2-year period and that this
   association was not impacted by age, gender, or baseline performance.
   These results provide evidence that changes in the functional
   organization of the cognitive control brain network occur despite the
   absence of neurodevelopment, aging or targeted cognitive training
   effects, and could modulate cognitive performance in early to
   mid-adulthood. Understanding how and why this change is occurring could
   provide insights into the mechanisms through which cognitive control
   ability is cultivated over time. This could aid in the development of
   interventions in cases where cognitive control is impaired.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals who experience greater stimulation and less sedation from
   alcohol are at increased risk for alcohol-related problems. However,
   little is known regarding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying
   subjective response to alcohol. The current study examined the degree to
   which alcohol-induced brain activation correlates with ratings of
   stimulation and sedation, using a within subjects, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled design. Participants (N = 34 healthy adults with no
   history of alcohol use disorder) completed three sessions: a calibration
   session to determine the duration of infusion needed to bring the breath
   alcohol to 80 mg/dl for each subject, and two counterbalanced fMRI
   sessions with placebo and alcohol administration. During the fMRI
   sessions, participants underwent 50 min scans, which included a 10 min
   baseline period, the IV infusion period needed to bring breath alcohol
   concentration (BrAC) to a peak 80 mg/dl (on the alcohol session),
   followed by a post-peak decline period. Participants rated their
   subjective stimulation and sedation at regular intervals throughout the
   scan. A priori VOI analyses showed that the time course of stimulation
   correlated with BOLD signal in the striatum. The time course of sedation
   did not correlate with BOLD signal in any VOIs. There were no
   correlations in primary visual cortex, which served as a control. These
   findings are the first to show that alcohol effects in the striatum are
   linked to the positive, stimulant-like effects of the drug and advance
   our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying
   individual differences in subjective responses to alcohol, and more
   broadly, risk for alcohol use disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (fMRI-NF) training
   of areas involved in emotion processing can reduce depressive symptoms
   by over 40\% on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). However, it
   remains unclear if this efficacy is specific to feedback from
   emotion-regulating regions. We tested in a single-blind, randomized,
   controlled trial if upregulation of emotion areas (NFE) yields superior
   efficacy compared to upregulation of a control region activated by
   visual scenes (NFS). Forty-three moderately to severely depressed
   medicated patients were randomly assigned to five sessions augmentation
   treatment of either NFE or NFS training. At primary outcome (week 12) no
   significant group mean HDRS difference was found (B = -0.415 {[}95\% CI
   -4.847 to 4.016], p = 0.848) for the 32 completers (16 per group).
   However, across groups depressive symptoms decreased by 43\%, and 38\%
   of patients remitted. These improvements lasted until follow-up (week
   18). Both groups upregulated target regions to a similar extent.
   Further, clinical improvement was correlated with an increase in
   self-efficacy scores. However, the interpretation of clinical
   improvements remains limited due to lack of a sham-control group. We
   thus surveyed effects reported for accepted augmentation therapies in
   depression. Data indicated that our findings exceed expected regression
   to the mean and placebo effects that have been reported for drug trials
   and other sham-controlled high-technology interventions. Taken together,
   we suggest that the experience of successful self-regulation during
   fMRI-NF training may be therapeutic. We conclude that if fMRI-NF is
   effective for depression, self-regulation training of higher visual
   areas may provide an effective alternative.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have shown when perceiving the body movements of other
   people, we automatically imitate the observed actions through our motor
   system. Under certain social contexts, however, automatic imitation is
   not always beneficial, and a complementary action (which appears as a
   reversal imitation action) is instead required. Past research on this
   topic mainly focused on passive complementary actions, which were
   triggered by external actions that are bound by the requirements or
   meanings of social interaction. The present study investigated the
   activation of initiative complementary action in the absence of requests
   for interaction by an agent. Through a motor priming paradigm, it was
   found that complementary actions arose in a dropping action situation,
   wherein an object held by an actor was suddenly dropped as it is moved
   towards the plate. But this was only observed when the actors carried
   out the action using their left hands. This finding suggests that
   initiative complementary action can be performed in situations wherein
   external action does not require to interact with the observer. This
   supports and extends the idea that complementary actions are highly
   responsive to social context.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recognizing who is speaking is a cognitive ability characterized by
   considerable individual differences, which could relate to the
   inter-individual variability observed in voice-elicited BOLD activity.
   Since voice perception is sustained by a complex brain network involving
   temporal voice areas (TVAs) and, even if less consistently,
   extra-temporal regions such as frontal cortices, functional connectivity
   (FC) during an fMRI voice localizer (passive listening of voices vs
   non-voices) has been computed within twelve temporal and frontal
   voice-sensitive regions ({''}voice patches{''}) individually defined for
   each subject (N = 90) to account for inter-individual variability.
   Results revealed that voice patches were positively co-activated during
   voice listening and that they were characterized by different FC pattern
   depending on the location (anterior/posterior) and the hemisphere.
   Importantly, FC between right frontal and temporal voice patches was
   behaviorally relevant: FC significantly increased with voice recognition
   abilities as measured in a voice recognition test performed outside the
   scanner. Hence, this study highlights the importance of frontal regions
   in voice perception and it supports the idea that looking at FC between
   stimulus-specific and higher-order frontal regions can help
   understanding individual differences in processing social stimuli such
   as voices.}},

Title = {{Connectome-based individualized prediction of temperament trait scores}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{366-374}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Temperament consists of multi-dimensional traits that affect various
   domains of human life. Evidence has shown functional connectome-based
   predictive models are powerful predictors of cognitive abilities.
   Putatively, individuals' innate temperament traits may be predictable by
   unique patterns of brain functional connectivity (FC) as well. However,
   quantitative prediction for multiple temperament traits at the
   individual level has not yet been studied. Therefore, we were motivated
   to realize the individualized prediction of four temperament traits
   (novelty seeking {[}NS], harm avoidance {[}HA], reward dependence {[}RD]
   and persistence {[}PS]) using whole-brain FC. Specifically, a
   multivariate prediction framework integrating feature selection and
   sparse regression was applied to resting-state fMRI data from 360
   college students, resulting in 4 connectome-based predictive models that
   enabled prediction of temperament scores for unseen subjects in
   cross-validation. More importantly, predictive models for HA and NS
   could be successfully generalized to two relevant personality traits for
   unseen individuals, i.e., neuroticism and extraversion, in an
   independent dataset. In four temperament trait predictions, brain
   connectivities that show top contributing power commonly concentrated on
   the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala, and
   cingulate gyrus. Finally, across independent datasets and multiple
   traits, we show person's temperament traits can be reliably predicted
   using functional connectivity strength within frontal-subcortical
   circuits, indicating that human social and behavioral performance can be
   characterized by specific brain connectivity profile.}},

   adolescence: A multi-modal approach}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{617-626}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite prior extensive investigations of the interactions between the
   amygdala and prefrontal cortex, few studies have simultaneously
   considered activation and structural connectivity in this circuit,
   particularly as it pertains to adolescent socioemotional development.
   The current multi-modal study delineated the correspondence between
   uncinate fasciculus (UF) connectivity and amygdala habituation in a
   large adolescent sample that was drawn from a population-based sample.
   We then examined the influence of demographic variables (age, gender,
   and pubertal status) on the relation between UF connectivity and
   amygdala habituation. 106 participants (15-17 years) completed DTI and
   an fMRI emotional face processing task. Left UF fractional anisotropy
   was associated with left amygdala habituation to fearful faces,
   suggesting that increased structural connectivity of the UF may
   facilitate amygdala regulation. Pubertal status moderated this
   structure-function relation, such that the association was stronger in
   those who were less mature. Therefore, UF connectivity may be
   particularly important for emotion regulation during early puberty. This
   study is the first to link structural and functional limbic circuitry in
   a large adolescent sample with substantial representation of ethnic
   minority participants, providing a more comprehensive understanding of
   socioemotional development in an understudied population.}},

Abstract = {{Reacting faster to the behaviour of others provides evolutionary
   advantages. Reacting to unpredictable events takes hundreds of
   milliseconds. Understanding where and how the brain represents what
   actions are likely to follow one another is, therefore, important.
   Everyday actions occur in predictable sequences, yet neuroscientists
   focus on how brains respond to unexpected, individual motor acts. Using
   fMRI, we show the brain encodes sequence-related information in the
   motor system. Using EEG, we show visual responses are faster and smaller
   for predictable sequences. We hope this paradigm encourages the field to
   shift its focus from single acts to motor sequences. It sheds light on
   how we adapt to the actions of others and suggests that the motor system
   may implement perceptual predictive coding.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The Social Brain Hypothesis posits a quantitative
   relationship between primate neocortex size and social network size.
   However, the precise social-cognitive mechanisms that drive this
   relationship remain elusive. Social Working Memory (SWM)-the ability to
   actively maintain and manipulate social information-has been proposed as
   a potential mechanism, but, to date, has not been linked to network
   size. Here, we explicitly tested this association.
   Methods In Study 1, 125 participants completed a SWM task and reported
   on their social networks. In Study 2, 25 participants underwent fMRI
   during the SWM task and reported on their social networks.
   Results As predicted, in Study 1, SWM performance was significantly
   associated with social network size and, specifically, Sympathy Group
   size (i.e., the size of one's core friend group). In Study 2, we
   conceptually replicated and extended this effect by showing that neural
   activity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal
   cortex engaged during SWM (vs. non-social working memory) was associated
   with individual variation in Sympathy Group size.
   Conclusions Taken together, these findings provide the first evidence
   that SWM constrains social network size, and suggest that SWM may be one
   social cognitive competency that underlies the Social Brain Hypothesis.
   In addition, whereas prior work investigating the Social Brain
   Hypothesis has largely focused on correlating brain structure size with
   social network size, to our knowledge, this is the first functional
   imaging evidence supporting the Social Brain Hypothesis.}},

   tonically decreased stimulation of striatal dopamine synapses which
   results in decremented propagation of information along the
   corticostriatal-pallido-thalamic (CSPT) spiral. In the present
   investigation, we tested predictions of this formulation by conducting
   concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   C-11-raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) in depressed and
   control (CTL) participants. We scanned 16 depressed and 14 CTL
   participants with simultaneous fMRI and C-11-raclopride PET. We
   estimated raclopride binding potential (BPND), voxel-wise, and compared
   MDD and CTL samples with respect to BPND in the striatum. Using striatal
   regions that showed significant between-group BPND differences as seeds,
   we conducted whole-brain functional connectivity analysis using the fMRI
   data and identified brain regions in each group in which connectivity
   with striatal seed regions scaled linearly with BPND from these regions.
   We observed increased BPND in the ventral striatum, bilaterally, and in
   the right dorsal striatum in the depressed participants. Further, we
   found that as BPND increased in both the left ventral striatum and right
   dorsal striatum in MDD, connectivity with the cortical targets of these
   regions (default-mode network and salience network, respectively)
   decreased. Deficits in stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors in MDD
   could account in part for the failure of transfer of information up the
   CSPT circuit in the pathophysiology of this disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Theory of mind (ToM), the ability to infer one's own and others' mental
   states, is the social cognitive process shown to have the greatest
   impact on functional outcome in schizophrenia. It is not yet known if
   neural abnormalities underlying ToM present early, during the first
   episode of psychosis (FEP). Fourteen FEP participants and twenty-two
   healthy control participants, aged 15-25, were included in analyses. All
   participants had a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scan and completed a
   block-design picture-story attribution-of-intentions ToM fMRI task, and
   completed a battery of behavioral social cognitive measures including a
   ToM task. General linear model analyses were carried out. Post-hoc
   regression analyses were conducted to explore whether aberrant
   ToM-related activation in FEP participants was associated with
   symptomatology and global social and occupational functioning. FEP
   participants, when compared to healthy controls, had significantly less
   activity in the right temporoparietal junction, right orbitofrontal
   cortex and left middle prefrontal/inferior frontal cortex, when making
   social attributions. Aberrant ToM-related activation in the right
   temporoparietal junction was associated with severity of overall
   psychopathology, but not functional outcome. Specific regions of the
   social brain network, associated with ToM, are dysfunctional in young
   people with FEP. Future research should determine whether alteration of
   normal brain functioning in relation to ToM occurs before or during
   illness onset.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundWomen are more susceptible to major depressive disorder (MDD).
   A possible explanation is that women have a trait tendency to engage in
   a ruminative response style. Depending on cognitive model of depression,
   attention bias, memory bias and self-referential bias were closely
   related among depressed patients. Previous studies have explored the
   neural mechanism of the cognitive biases by using amplitude of low
   frequency fluctuations (ALFF) or functional connectivity (FC), and few
   combined these two metrics, especially focusing on female
   patients.MethodsWe assessed 25 female patients diagnosed with MDD and 13
   well matched healthy controls (HCs) using Rs-fMRI. Two metrics ALFF and
   FC based on abnormal ALFF were explored and made
   comparisons.ResultsCompared with HCs, female patients with MDD showed
   that one cluster with significantly decreased ALFF in the left middle
   occipital gyrus(L-MOG). Furtherly we founded depressed female subjects
   showed significantly lower FC between the L-MOG seed and left
   orbitofrontal cortex, and significantly higher FC between the L-MOG seed
   and left medial prefrontal gyrus and left hippocampus.ConclusionsOur
   results showed L-MOG may act as a connection, which involved in the
   processing of cognitive biases of MDD by connected with limbic-cortical
   regions in resting state. These findings may enhance the understanding
   of the neurobiological mechanism in female patients with MDD.}},

Title = {{Differences in Neural Recovery From Acute Stress Between Cortisol
   Responders and Non-responders}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Adaptive recovery from a stressor fosters resilience. So far, however,
   few studies have examined brain functional connectivity in the aftermath
   of stress, with inconsistent results reported. Focusing on the immediate
   recovery from psychosocial stress, the current study compared amygdala
   resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) before and immediately
   after psychosocial stress between cortisol responders and
   non-responders. Differences between groups were expected for amygdala
   RSFC with regions involved in down-regulation of the physiological
   stress response, emotion regulation, and memory consolidation.
   Eighty-six healthy participants (36 males/50 females) underwent a social
   stress paradigm inside the MRI scanner. Before and immediately after
   stress, resting-state (RS) fMRI scans were acquired to determine
   amygdala RSFC. Next, changes in connectivity from pre- to post-stress
   were compared between cortisol responders and non-responders. Responders
   demonstrated a cortisol increase, higher negative affect, and decreased
   heart rate variability (HRV) in response to stress compared to
   non-responders. A significant Sex-by-Responder-by-Time interaction was
   found between the bilateral amygdala and posterior cingulate cortex
   (PCC) and precuneus (p < 0.05, corrected). As males were also more
   likely to show a cortisol increase to the stress task than females,
   follow-up analyses were conducted for both sexes separately. Whereas no
   difference was observed between female responders and non-responders,
   male non-responders showed an increase in FC after stress between the
   bilateral amygdala and the PCC and precuneus (p < 0.05, corrected). The
   increased coupling of the amygdala with the PCC/precuneus, a core
   component of the default mode network (DMN), might indicate an increased
   engagement of the amygdala within the DMN directly after stress in
   non-responders. Although this study was carried out in healthy
   participants, and the results likely reflect normal variations in the
   neural response to stress, understanding the mechanisms that underlie
   these variations could prove beneficial in revealing neural markers that
   promote resilience to stress-related disorders.}},

Title = {{Modulating Effects of Contextual Emotions on the Neural Plasticity
   Induced by Word Learning}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Recently, numerous studies have investigated the neurocognitive
   mechanism of learning words in isolation or in semantic contexts.
   However, emotion as an important influencing factor on novel word
   learning has not been fully considered in the previous studies. In
   addition, the effects of emotion on word learning and the underlying
   neural mechanism have not been systematically investigated. Sixteen
   participants were trained to learn novel concrete or abstract words
   under negative, neutral, and positive contextual emotions over 3 days;
   then, fMRI scanning was done during the testing sessions on day 1 and
   day 3. We compared the brain activations in day 1 and day 3 to
   investigate the role of contextual emotions in learning different types
   of words and the corresponding neural plasticity changes. Behaviorally,
   the performance of the words learned in the negative context was lower
   than those in the neutral and positive contexts, which indicated that
   contextual emotions had a significant impact on novel word learning.
   Correspondingly, the functional plasticity changes of the right angular
   gyrus (AG), bilateral insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   induced by word learning were modulated by the contextual emotions. The
   insula also was sensitive to the concreteness of the learned words. More
   importantly, the functional plasticity changes of the left inferior
   frontal gyrus (left IFG) and left fusiform gyrus (left FG) were
   interactively influenced by the contextual emotions and concreteness,
   suggesting that the contextual emotional information had a discriminable
   effect on different types of words in the neural mechanism level. These
   results demonstrate that emotional information in contexts is inevitably
   involved in word learning. The role of contextual emotions in brain
   plasticity for learning is discussed.}},

Title = {{Neural Basis of Action Observation and Understanding From First- and
   Third-Person Perspectives: An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the intentions of others while observing their actions is
   a fundamental aspect of social behavior. However, the differences in
   neural and functional mechanisms between observing actions from the
   first-person perspective (1PP) and third-person perspective (3PP) are
   poorly understood. The present study had two aims: (1) to delineate the
   neural basis of action observation and understanding from the 1PP and
   3PP; and (2) to identify whether there are different activation patterns
   during action observation and understanding from 1PP and 3PP. We used a
   blocked functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experimental
   design. Twenty-six right-handed participants observed interactions
   between the right hand and a cup from 1PP and 3PP. The results indicated
   that both 1PP and 3PP were associated with similar patterns of
   activation in key areas of the mirror neuron system underlying action
   observation and understanding. Importantly, besides of the core network
   of mirror neuron system, we also found that parts of the basal ganglia
   and limbic system were involved in action observation in both the 1PP
   and 3PP tasks, including the putamen, insula and hippocampus, providing
   a more complete understanding of the neural basis for action observation
   and understanding. Moreover, compared with the 3PP, the 1PP task caused
   more extensive and stronger activation. In contrast, the opposite
   comparison revealed that no regions exhibited significantly more
   activation in the 3PP compared with the 1PP condition. The current
   results have important implications for understanding the role of the
   core network underlying the mirror neuron system, as well as parts of
   the basal ganglia and limbic system, during action observation and
   understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Learning new skills by watching others is important for social and motor
   development throughout the lifespan. Prior research has suggested that
   observational learning shares common substrates with physical practice
   at both cognitive and brain levels. In addition, neuroimaging studies
   have used multivariate analysis techniques to understand neural
   representations in a variety of domains, including vision, audition,
   memory, and action, but few studies have investigated neural plasticity
   in representational space. Therefore, although movement sequences can be
   learned by observing other people's actions, a largely unanswered
   question in neuroscience is how experience shapes the representational
   space of neural systems. Here, across a sample of male and female
   participants, we combined pretraining and posttraining fMRI sessions
   with 6 d of observational practice to determine whether the observation
   of action sequences elicits sequence-specific representations in human
   frontoparietal brain regions and the extent to which these
   representations become more distinct with observational practice. Our
   results showed that observed action sequences are modeled by distinct
   patterns of activity in frontoparietal cortex and that such
   representations largely generalize to very similar, but untrained,
   sequences. These findings advance our understanding of what is modeled
   during observational learning (sequence-specific information), as well
   as how it is modeled (reorganization of frontoparietal cortex is similar
   to that previously shown following physical practice). Therefore, on a
   more fine-grained neural level than demonstrated previously, our
   findings reveal how the representational structure of frontoparietal
   cortex maps visual information onto motor circuits in order to enhance
   motor performance.}},

Title = {{Human chemosignals of disgust facilitate food judgment}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Choosing food is not a trivial decision that people need to make daily,
   which is often subject to social influences. Here, we studied a human
   homolog of social transmission of food preference (STFP) as observed in
   rodents and other animals via chemosignals of body secretions. Human
   social chemosignals (sweat) produced during a disgust or neutral state
   among a group of donors were presented to participants undergoing a
   2-alternative-forced-choice food healthiness judgment task during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Response speed and two key
   signal detection indices-d'(discrimination sensitivity) and beta
   (response bias)-converged to indicate that social chemosignals of
   disgust facilitated food healthiness decisions, in contrast to primary
   disgust elicitors (disgust odors) that impaired the judgment. fMRI
   analyses (disgust vs. neutral sweat) revealed that the fusiform face
   area (FFA), amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were engaged in
   processing social chemosignals of disgust during food judgment.
   Importantly, a double contrast of social signaling across modalities
   (olfactory vs. visual-facial expressions) indicated that the FFA and OFC
   exhibited preferential response to social chemosignals of disgust.
   Together, our findings provide initial evidence for human STFP, where
   social chemosignals are incorporated into food decisions by engaging
   social and emotional areas of the brain.}},

   Social Stimuli in Anorexia Nervosa}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Oxytocin is a neurotransmitter related to both feeding and social
   behavior: anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric illness defined by reduced
   food intake, weight loss, and problems in social perceptions. Oxytocin
   receptor single nucleotide polymorphisms rs2254298 or rs53576 and neural
   responses to social stimuli were evaluated in adult women with or
   recovered from anorexia nervosa using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Carriers of the A allele for OXTR rs2254298 (2 AA and 10 AG)
   showed significantly reduced activation of portions of the posterior
   cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex for social stimuli as well
   as greater negative connectivity between the posterior cingulate and the
   occipital lobe relative to the GG subjects for rs2254298. Differences in
   the other OXTR SNP, rs53576, did not result in detectable neural
   differences in either whole brain or region of interest analyses.
   Development of a mechanistic, biological model of how social behavior is
   impacted by mental illness requires linking genes to functional brain
   activations in disease. This pilot study suggests that in anorexia
   nervosa, differences related to OXTR SNP rs2254298 may alter neural
   responses to social stimuli and disrupt the engagement and disengagement
   of the default mode network.}},

Title = {{Cognitive and Brain Activity Changes After Mnemonic Strategy Training in
   Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment: Evidence From a Randomized
   Controlled Tria}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mnemonic strategy training (MST) has been shown to improve
   cognitive performance in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI),
   however, several questions remain unresolved. The goal of the present
   study was to replicate earlier pilot study findings using a randomized
   controlled design and to evaluate transfer effects and changes in brain
   activation.
   Methods: Thirty patients with a-MCI were randomized into MST or
   education program. At baseline, participants completed clinical and
   neuropsychological assessments as well as structural and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Interventions were administered
   individually and comprised four sessions, over 2 weeks. MST taught
   patients to use a three-step process to learn and recall face-name
   associations. Post-treatment assessment included fMRI, a separate
   face-name association task, neuropsychological tests, and measures of
   metamemory. Behavioral (i.e., non-fMRI) measures were repeated after one
   and 3-months.
   Results: Participants in the MST condition showed greater improvement on
   measures of face-name memory, and increased associative strategy use;
   effects that were accompanied by increased fMRI activation in the left
   anterior temporal lobe. While all participants reported greater
   contentment with their everyday memory following intervention, only the
   MST group reported significant improvements in their memory abilities.
   There was no clear indication of far-transfer effects to other
   neuropsychological tests.
   Conclusion: Results demonstrate that patients with a-MCI not only show
   stimulus specific benefits of MST, but that they appear capable of
   transferring training to at least some other cognitive tasks. MST also
   facilitated the use of brain regions that are involved in face
   processing, episodic and semantic memory, and social cognition, which
   are consonant with the cognitive processes engaged by training.}},

Title = {{Acute alcohol administration dampens central extended amygdala
   reactivity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Alcohol use is common, imposes a staggering burden on public health, and
   often resists treatment. The central extended amygdala (EAc)-including
   the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and the central nucleus of
   the amygdala (Ce)-plays a key role in prominent neuroscientific models
   of alcohol drinking, but the relevance of these regions to acute alcohol
   consumption in humans remains poorly understood. Using a single-blind,
   randomized-groups design, multiband fMRI data were acquired from 49
   social drinkers while they performed a well-established emotional faces
   paradigm after consuming either alcohol or placebo. Relative to placebo,
   alcohol significantly dampened reactivity to emotional faces in the BST.
   To rigorously assess potential regional differences in activation, data
   were extracted from unbiased, anatomically predefined regions of
   interest. Analyses revealed similar levels of dampening in the BST and
   Ce. In short, alcohol transiently reduces reactivity to emotional faces
   and it does so similarly across the two major divisions of the human
   EAc. These observations reinforce the translational relevance of
   addiction models derived from preclinical work in rodents and provide
   new insights into the neural systems most relevant to the consumption of
   alcohol and to the initial development of alcohol abuse in humans.}},

Title = {{Moderating Effects of Harm Avoidance on Resting-State Functional
   Connectivity of the Anterior Insula}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{As an index of behavioral inhibition and an individual's propensity to
   avoid, rather than seek, potentially dangerous situations, harm
   avoidance has been linked to internalizing psychopathology. Altered
   connectivity within intrinsic functional neural networks (i.e., default
   mode {[}DMN], central executive {[}CEN] and salience networks {[}SN])
   has been related to internalizing psychopathology; however, less is
   known about the effects of harm avoidance on functional connectivity
   within and between these networks. Importantly, harm avoidance may be
   distinguishable from trait anxiety and have clinical relevance as a risk
   factor for internalizing psychopathology. A sample of young adults (n =
   99) completed a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) scan and self-report measures of harm avoidance and trait
   anxiety. Whole brain seed-to-voxel and seed-to-network connectivity
   analyses were conducted using anterior insula seeds to examine
   associations between harm avoidance/trait anxiety and connectivity.
   After adjusting for sex and age, there was a significant negative effect
   of harm avoidance on connectivity between the anterior insula and
   clusters in the precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) left
   superior/middle frontal gyrus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
   and bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL)/angular gyrus.
   Seed-to-network analyses indicated a negative effect of harm avoidance
   on connectivity between the right anterior insula and anterior and
   posterior DMN. There were no effects of trait anxiety on functional
   connectivity of the anterior insula. Overall, the results indicate that
   individual differences in harm avoidance relate to disruptions in
   internetwork connectivity that may contribute to deficits in
   appropriately modulating attentional focus.}},

Abstract = {{The successful recovery from affective loss (i.e., bereavement,
   relationship breakup) has been linked to adult attachment style (AAS), a
   personality trait. Up to now, the association between AAS, affective
   loss experiences and brain gray matter volume is unclear. In 192 healthy
   subjects we investigated the association between MRI brain gray matter
   volume, applying voxel based morphometry, AAS (Relationship Scales
   Questionnaire (RSQ), subscales ``avoidance{''} (AV) and ``anxiety{''}
   (ANX)), and number of affective losses within the last 5 years (AL; List
   of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire). In a whole-brain analysis (p
   < 0.05 FWE-corrected) ANX compared to AV was significantly more
   positively associated with brain gray matter volume in the left insula
   and in the pars opercularis of left inferior frontal gyrus. In
   additional region-of-interest (ROI) analyses (p < 0.05 FWE-corrected),
   based on previously reported findings, no significant associations were
   observed. ANX and AV differently correlate with local volumes of the
   left insula and pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus,
   which are implicated in emotion processing, empathy and emotion
   regulation among other functions. Our results support the notion that
   individual attachment styles, which develop in the interplay of genes
   and social environment, differ in their correlation with brain
   structure. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Emotions unfold over time with episodes differing in explosiveness
   (i.e., profiles having a steep vs. a gentle start) and accumulation
   (i.e., profiles increasing over time vs. going back to baseline). In the
   present fMRI study, we wanted to replicate and extend previous findings
   on the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying emotion
   explosiveness and accumulation. Specifically, we aimed to: (a) replicate
   the finding that different neural mechanisms are associated with emotion
   explosiveness and accumulation, (b) replicate the finding that adopting
   a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective decreases emotion
   explosiveness and accumulation at the level of self-report, and (c)
   examine whether adopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed)
   perspective similarly modulates activity in the brain regions associated
   with emotion explosiveness and accumulation. Participants in an fMRI
   scanner were asked to adopt a self-immersed or self-distanced
   perspective while reading and thinking about negative social feedback,
   and to report on felt changes in negative affect during that period
   using an emotion intensity profile tracking approach. We replicated
   previous findings showing that emotion explosiveness and accumulation
   were related to activity in regions involved in self-referential
   processing (such as the medial prefrontal cortex) and sustained visceral
   arousal (such as the posterior insula), respectively. The finding that
   adopting a self-distanced (vs. self-immersed) perspective lowers emotion
   explosiveness and accumulation was also replicated at a self-report
   level. However, perspective taking did not impact activity in the neural
   correlates of emotion explosiveness and accumulation.}},

Title = {{Neural Correlates of Working Memory Maintenance in Advanced Aging:
   Evidence From fMRI}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Working memory (WM)-related brain activity is known to be modulated by
   aging; particularly, older adults demonstrate greater activity than
   young adults. However, it is still unclear whether the activity increase
   in older adults is also observed in advanced aging. The present
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was designed to
   clarify the neural correlates of WM in advanced aging. Further, we set
   out to investigate in the case that adults of advanced age do show
   age-related increase in WM-related activity, what the functional
   significance of this over-recruitment might be. Two groups of older
   adults - ``young-old{''} (61-70 years, n = 17) and ``old-old{''} (77-82
   years, n = 16) - were scanned while performing a visual WM task (the
   n-back task: 0-back and 1-back). WM effects (1-back > 0-back) common to
   both age groups were identified in several regions, including the
   bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the inferior parietal
   cortex, and the insula. Greater WM effects in the old-old than in the
   young-old group were identified in the right caudal DLPFC. These results
   were replicated when we performed a separate analysis between two age
   groups with the same level of WM performance (the young-old vs. a
   ``high-performing{''} subset of the old-old group). There were no
   regions where WM effects were greater in the young-old group than in the
   old-old group. Importantly, the magnitude of the over-recruitment WM
   effects positively correlated with WM performance in the old-old group,
   but not in the young-old group. The present findings suggest that
   cortical over-recruitment occurs in advanced old age, and that increased
   activity may serve a compensatory function in mediating WM performance.}},

Title = {{Item-Wise Interindividual Brain-Behavior Correlation in Task
   Neuroimaging Analysis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Brain-behavior correlations are commonly used to explore the
   associations between the brain and human behavior in cognitive
   neuroscience studies. There are many critics of the correlation
   approach, however. Most problems associated with correlation approaches
   originate in the weak statistical power of traditional correlation
   procedures (i.e., the mean-wise interindividual brain-behavior
   correlation). This paper proposes a new correlation procedure, the
   item-wise interindividual brain-behavior correlation, which enhances
   statistical power via testing the significance of small correlation
   coefficients from trials against zero rather than simply pursuing the
   highest correlation coefficient. The item-wise and mean-wise correlation
   were compared in simulations and an fMRI experiment on mathematical
   problem-solving. Simulations show that the item-wise correlation
   relative to the mean-wise correlation results in higher t-values when
   signal-to-noise ratio is equal to or larger than 6\%. Item-wise
   correlation displayed more voxels with significant brain-behavior
   correlation than did mean-wise correlation. Analyses with item-wise
   (rather than mean-wise) correlation showed significant brainbehavior
   correlation at the threshold of p < 0.05 corrected. Cross validation
   showed that odd- and even-ordered trials have greater stability in terms
   of the item-wise correlation (r = 0.918) than the mean-wise correlation
   (r = 0.686). The simulations and example analyses altogether demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed correlation procedure for task
   neuroimaging studies.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Previous research demonstrates that aversive stimuli can interrupt
   appetitive processing and that brain regions involved with the
   processing of potential rewards, such as the ventral striatum (VS), also
   respond to threatening information. Potential losses can likewise
   activate the VS and, thus, the full extent to which threat can impact
   neural responses during incentive processing remains unclear. Here,
   unpredictable threat of shock was used to induce anxiety while
   participants performed the monetary incentive delay (MID) task during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During anticipation,
   anxiety impacted neural responses within the bilateral VS and
   distributed regions of the occipital cortex. Anxiety enhanced activity
   within the VS to both gain and loss trials. Furthermore, anxiety
   enhanced activity to both gain and loss trials within dorsal areas of
   BA19. However, anxiety only enhanced activity during gain, but not loss
   trials, within ventral areas of BA19. These results suggest that during
   anticipation, induced anxiety enhanced VS activity to incentives
   generally, which might reflect changes in the subjective salience of
   gains and losses. Collectively, these results suggest that the impact of
   induced anxiety on responses to monetary incentives depend on the neural
   region, type of incentive, and stage of processing.}},

Abstract = {{Witnessing exemplary actions triggers admiration, a positive emotion
   that can pertain to concrete skills, or move the onlooker beyond
   physical characteristics to appreciate the abstract, moral implications.
   Participants reacted to narratives depicting skilled or virtuous
   protagonists first during a videotaped interview then during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We analyzed participants' gaze
   aversion (an indicator of disengaging from the immediate environment)
   and cognitive construals (mentions of concrete characteristics vs
   abstract beliefs and values) during the interview, and relations to
   individuals' subsequent neural activations. When participants averted
   their gaze, they were more likely to mention abstract construals, and
   both behaviors were more likely when reacting to virtue. Gaze aversion
   to virtue narratives predicted greater subsequent activation for those
   narratives in dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC), involved in
   visual attention control. The inferior-posterior posteromedial cortices
   (ipPMC), a default mode network hub involved in abstract thought,
   activated only to virtue, and activity level reflected individuals'
   tendency to abstract construals. Critically, dPCC and ipPMC activity
   sequentially mediated the relationship between individuals' gaze and
   abstract construal tendencies. No such relationships existed for
   reactions to skill, despite participants reporting equivalently strong
   positive emotion. In appreciating virtue, dPCC may support individuals
   in transcending the viewable context, facilitating ipPMC activity and
   moral construals.}},

Title = {{Capacity for upregulation of emotional processing in psychopathy: all

Abstract = {{Historically, psychopathic individuals have been described as suffering
   a chronic hyporesponsivity to negatively valent stimuli. However, while
   a wide body of empirical work indicates that the psychopath does not
   manifest normal reactivity to emotional stimuli, it does not similarly
   indicate that they cannot do so. To attempt to differentiate these
   alternatives, the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study evaluated the extent to which offenders with varying PCL-R scores
   could up- (or down-) regulate their neural response to negatively valent
   stimuli. Participants were asked to either watch negatively- and
   neutrally-valent images naturally (passive-processing), or to try to
   increase or decrease their emotional response to the images
   (instructed-processing). During passive processing, high-psychopathy
   offenders showed reduced activity compared to both low- and
   mid-psychopathic offenders through a majority of emotion-relevant
   regions. However, when participants were instructed to try to increase
   their emotional response all groups showing increased activity
   throughout relevant regions, including left insula, orbitofrontal cortex
   and anterior cingulate/medial frontal cortex (ACC/mFC). Comparison of
   participants' subjective emotion ratings indicated that all groups
   showed symmetry between their neural/subjective emotion metrics, and the
   high-psychopathy group may have showed the greatest such symmetry. These
   findings suggest that psychopathic individuals may be capable of
   manifesting emotional reactivity to negatively valent stimuli, at least
   under certain conditions. Relevance for traditional and developing
   models of psychopathy is discussed in turn.}},

Abstract = {{Reward processing is altered in various psychopathologies and has been
   shown to be susceptible to genetic and environmental influences. Here,
   we examined whether maternal care may buffer familial risk for
   psychiatric disorders in terms of reward processing. Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging during a monetary incentive delay task was acquired in
   participants of an epidemiological cohort study followed since birth (N
   = 172, 25 years). Early maternal stimulation was assessed during a
   standardized nursing/playing setting at the age of 3 months. Parental
   psychiatric disorders (familial risk) during childhood and the
   participants' previous psychopathology were assessed by diagnostic
   interview. With high familial risk, higher maternal stimulation was
   related to increasing activation in the caudate head, the supplementary
   motor area, the cingulum and the middle frontal gyrus during reward
   anticipation, with the opposite pattern found in individuals with no
   familial risk. In contrast, higher maternal stimulation was associated
   with decreasing caudate head activity during reward delivery and reduced
   levels of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the
   high-risk group. Decreased caudate head activity during reward
   anticipation and increased activity during delivery were linked to ADHD.
   These findings provide evidence of a long-term association of early
   maternal stimulation on both adult neurobiological systems of reward
   underlying externalizing behavior and ADHD during development.}},

Abstract = {{Backgrounds: More males than females play video games and develop
   problems with gaming. However, little is known regarding how males and
   females who game on the Internet may differ with respect to neural
   responses to gaming cues. Methods: Behavioral and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data were recorded from 40 female and 68 male
   Internet gamers. This study included three components including
   participation in a pre-gaming cue-craving task, 30 min of online gaming
   and a post-gaming cue-elicited-craving task. Group differences were
   examined at pre-gaming, post-gaming and post- vs pre-gaming times.
   Correlations between brain responses and behavioral performance were
   calculated. Results: Gaming-related cues elicited higher cravings in
   male vs female subjects. Prior to gaming, males demonstrated greater
   activations in the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), inferior
   frontal cortex and bilateral declive. Following gaming, male subjects
   demonstrated greater activations in the medial frontal gyrus and
   bilateral middle temporal gyri. In a post-pre comparison, male subjects
   demonstrated greater thalamic activation than did female subjects.
   Conclusions: Short-term gaming elicited in males vs females more
   craving-related activations to gaming cues. These results suggest neural
   mechanisms for why males may be more vulnerable than females in
   developing Internet gaming disorder.}},

Title = {{Neural signatures of inhibitory control in bilingual spoken production}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{50-66}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Bilinguals activate both languages when they intend to speak even one
   language alone (e.g., Kroll, Bobb, \& Wodniekca, 2006). At the same
   time, they are able to select the language they intend to speak and
   switch back and forth between languages rapidly, with few production
   errors. Previous research utilizing behavioral (Linck, Kroll, \&
   Sunderman, 2009) and neuroimaging techniques (ERPs and fMRI; Guo, Liu,
   Misra, \& Kroll, 2011; Misra, Guo, Bobb, \& Kroll, 2012) suggest that
   successful bilingual speech production is enabled by active inhibition
   of the language not in use. Results showing an asymmetric switching cost
   for the L1 compared to the L2 (with a larger cost-reflected in longer
   naming latencies-when switching from the L2 to the L1) have been taken
   as evidence that the L1 (usually the dominant language for bilinguals
   who learned their second language later in life) may need to be
   inhibited when speaking in the L2. However, there is still little
   research on the scope of this inhibitory process. The goal of this
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study is to
   understand how the recruitment of neural areas implicated during
   bilingual language processing are shaped by the scope of language use.
   The results show that bilinguals engage a wide functional control
   network that is hierarchically engaged in local control for single
   lexical items, but extends further to the broader semantic level, and
   finally to the whole language. This functional network is modulated by
   proficiency in the L2. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A set of left frontal, temporal, and parietal brain regions respond
   robustly during language comprehension and production (e.g.. Fedorenko
   E, Hsieh PJ, Nieto-Castafian A, Whitfield-Gabrieli S, Kanwisher N. J
   Neurophysiol 104: 1177-1194, 2010; Menenti L, Gierhan SM. Segaert K.
   Hagoort P. Psychol Sci 22: 1173-1182, 2011). These regions have been
   further shown to be selective for language relative to other cognitive
   processes, including arithmetic, aspects of executive function, and
   music perception (e.g., Fedorenko E, Behr MK, Kanwisher N. Proc Natl
   Acad Sci USA 108: 16428-16433, 2011; Monti MM, Osherson DN. Brain Res
   1428: 33-42. 2012). However, one claim about overlap between language
   and nonlinguistic cognition remains prominent. In particular, some have
   argued that language processing shares computational demands with action
   observation and/or execution (e.g., Rizzolatti G, Arbib MA. Trends
   Neurosci 21: 188-194, 1998; Koechlin E, Jubault T. Neuron 50: 963-974,
   2006; Tettamanti M, Weniger D. Cortex 42: 491-494, 2006). However, the
   evidence for these claims is indirect, based on observing activation for
   language and action tasks within the same broad anatomical areas (e.g.,
   on the lateral surface of the left frontal lobe). To test whether
   language indeed shares machinery with action observation/execution, we
   examined the responses of language brain regions, defined functionally
   in each individual participant (Fedorenko E, Hsieh PJ, Nieto-Castafion
   A, Whitfield-Gabrieli S, Kanwisher N. J Neurophysiol 104: 1177-1194,
   2010) to action observation (experiments 1, 2, and 3a) and action
   imitation (experiment 3b). With the exception of the language region in
   the angular gyrus, all language regions, including those in the inferior
   frontal gyrus (within ``Broca's area{''}), showed little or no response
   during action observation/imitation. These results add to the growing
   body of literature suggesting that high-level language regions are
   highly selective for language processing (see Fedorenko E, Varley R. Ann
   NY Acad Sci 1369: 132-153, 2016 for a review).
   NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Many have argued for overlap in the machinery used to
   interpret language and others' actions, either because action
   observation was a precursor to linguistic communication or because both
   require interpreting hierarchically-structured stimuli. However,
   existing evidence is indirect, relying on group analyses or reverse
   inference. We examined responses to action observation in language
   regions defined functionally in individual participants and found no
   response. Thus language comprehension and action observation recruit
   distinct circuits in the modern brain.}},

Abstract = {{Experiencing and observing social exclusion and inclusion, as well as
   prosocial behavior, are important aspects of social relationships in
   childhood. However, it is currently unknown to what extent these
   processes and their neural correlates differ in heritability. We
   investigated influences of genetics and environment on experiencing
   social exclusion and compensating for social exclusion of others with
   the Prosocial Cyberball Game using fMRI in a twin sample (aged 7-9;
   N=500). Neuroimaging analyses (N=283) revealed that experiencing
   possible self-exclusion resulted in activity in inferior frontal gyrus
   and medial prefrontal cortex, which was influenced by genetics and
   unique environment. Experiencing self-inclusion was associated with
   activity in anterior cingulate cortex, insula and striatum, but this was
   not significantly explained by genetics or shared environment. We found
   that children show prosocial compensating behavior when observing social
   exclusion. Prosocial compensating behavior was associated with activity
   in posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and showed unique environmental
   effects or measurement error at both behavioral and neural level.
   Together, these findings show that in children neural activation for
   experiencing possible self-exclusion and self-inclusion, and for
   displaying prosocial compensating behavior, is accounted for by unique
   environmental factors and measurement error, with a small genetic effect
   on possible self-exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Although the amygdala's role in shaping social behavior is especially
   important during early post-natal development, very little is known of
   amygdala functional development before childhood. To address this gap,
   this study uses resting-state fMRI to examine early amygdalar functional
   network development in a cross-sectional sample of 80 children from
   3-months to 5-years of age. Whole brain functional connectivity with the
   amygdala, and its laterobasal and superficial sub-regions, were largely
   similar to those seen in older children and adults. Functional
   distinctions between sub-region networks were already established. These
   patterns suggest many amygdala functional circuits are intact from
   infancy, especially those that are part of motor, visual, auditory and
   subcortical networks. Developmental changes in connectivity were
   observed between the laterobasal nucleus and bilateral ventral temporal
   and motor cortex as well as between the superficial nuclei and medial
   thalamus, occipital cortex and a different region of motor cortex. These
   results show amygdala-subcortical and sensory-cortex connectivity begins
   refinement prior to childhood, though connectivity changes with
   associative and frontal cortical areas, seen after early childhood, were
   not evident in this age range. These findings represent early steps in
   understanding amygdala network dynamics across infancy through early
   childhood, an important period of emotional and cognitive development.}},

Abstract = {{Peer relationships play an important role in adolescent social
   development. Adolescence is also a sensitive period for reward-related
   processing where Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc) shows peak levels of activity.
   To investigate the role of reward-related neural processes in peer

   17 years old and had their classmates rate their likability and
   dislikability. Using these ratings, we calculated levels of peer
   acceptance (i.e., likability minus dislikability scores). Participants
   played a social gambling paradigm in the scanner where we examined NAcc
   responses to winning for self and winning for best friends. We showed
   that acceptance by peers was related negatively to activation patterns
   in the NAcc when winning money for self. Peer acceptance was not related
   to NAcc activity during vicarious reward processing where participants
   won money for their best friend. These results point in the direction of
   an underlying neural mechanism indicating that peer interactions of
   well-liked adolescents are characterized by a lower focus on benefits
   for self.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We used multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to investigate
   neural selectivity for grasp planning within the left-lateralized
   temporo-parieto-frontal network of areas (praxis representation network,
   PRN) typically associated with tool-related actions, as studied with
   traditional neuroimaging contrasts. Methods: We used data from 20
   participants whose task was to plan functional grasps of tools, with
   either right or left hands. Region of interest and whole-brain
   searchlight analyses were performed to show task-related neural
   patterns. Results: MVPA revealed significant contributions to functional
   grasp planning from the anterior intraparietal sulcus (alPS) and its
   immediate vicinities, supplemented by inputs from posterior subdivisions
   of IPS, and the ventral lateral occipital complex (vLOC). Moreover,
   greater local selectivity was demonstrated in areas near the superior
   parieto-occipital cortex and dorsal premotor cortex, putatively forming
   the dorso-dorsal stream. Conclusions: A contribution from alPS,
   consistent with its role in prospective grasp formation and/or encoding
   of relevant tool properties (e.g., potential graspable parts), is likely
   to accompany the retrieval of manipulation and/or mechanical knowledge
   subserved by the supramarginal gyms for achieving action goals. An
   involvement of vLOC indicates that MVPA is particularly sensitive to
   coding of object properties, their identities and even functions, for a
   support of grip formation. Finally, the engagement of the superior
   parieto-frontal regions as revealed by MVPA is consistent with their
   selectivity for transient features of tools (i.e., variable affordances)
   for anticipatory hand postures. These outcomes support the notion that,
   compared to traditional approaches, MVPA can reveal more fine-grained
   patterns of neural activity.}},

Abstract = {{An estimated 70-90\% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
   have sensory symptoms, which may present as hyper- or hyporesponsivity
   in one or more sensory modalities. These sensitivities correlate with
   social symptoms, activity, and social interaction levels. Interestingly,
   sensory symptoms appear to be most prevalent in late childhood,
   suggesting a developmental component. Although the neural basis of
   sensory sensitivities remains unclear, atypical functional connectivity
   of sensory brain regions has been suggested as a potential mechanism.
   Tactile sensitivities are among the most predictive of social
   functioning, yet no studies to our knowledge have examined somatosensory
   functional connectivity in children and adolescents with ASD, when
   symptoms are typically most prominent. In this study, we used human data
   from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE-I) to assess
   functional connectivity differences of somatosensory regions during
   resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, in youth aged 8-15
   years. After head motion exclusion, our sample included 67 participants
   with ASD and 121 typically developing controls. We additionally examined
   associations between functional connectivity and age, as well as ASD
   symptom severity. Together, these seed-based analyses showed limited
   differences in functional connectivity between groups, either to
   hypothesized target regions or in terms of global connectivity. Our
   findings suggest that hyper- or hyposomatosensory functional
   connectivity at rest is not a population-level feature in ASD. However,
   this does not preclude increased variability of somatosensory networks
   across the ASD population. Furthermore, as sensory sensitivities were
   not specifically assessed in this sample, future studies may be better
   able to identify patterns of functional connectivity, reflecting
   individual differences in sensory symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is an important individual difference
   factor that may contribute to trait-like aggression. Deficient
   engagement of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) during social
   situations may also be a mechanism that links these two constructs. The
   aim of the current study was to test a proposed mediation model whereby
   IU is associated with trait aggression through neural activation of the
   vlPFC during a social exclusion task. A total of 53 adults with a range
   of impulsive-aggressive traits completed validated assessments of IU and
   trait aggression and the Cyberball social exclusion task during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results supported the
   mediation model such that greater levels of IU were associated with
   greater trait aggression through hypoactivation of the vlPFC during
   social exclusion. This study is the first to provide evidence suggesting
   that individuals higher in IU have difficulties engaging regulatory
   neural processes, which in turn may increase the propensity for
   aggression.}},

Abstract = {{Background Understanding the neural basis of moral judgment (MJ) and
   human decision-making has been the subject of numerous studies because
   of their impact on daily life activities and social norms. Here, we
   aimed to investigate the neural process of MJ using functional
   near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a noninvasive, portable, and
   affordable neuroimaging modality. Methods Results and conclusions We
   examined prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation in 33 healthy participants
   engaging in MJ exercises. We hypothesized that participants presented
   with personal (emotionally salient) and impersonal (less emotional)
   dilemmas would exhibit different brain activation observable through
   fNIRS. We also investigated the effects of utilitarian and
   nonutilitarian responses to MJ scenarios on PFC activation. Utilitarian
   responses are those that favor the greatest good while nonutilitarian
   responses favor moral actions. Mixed effect models were applied to model
   the cerebral hemodynamic changes that occurred during MJ dilemmas. Our
   analysis found significant differences in PFC activation during personal
   versus impersonal dilemmas. Specifically, the left dorsolateral PFC was
   highly activated during impersonal MJ when a nonutilitarian decision was
   made. This is consistent with the majority of relevant fMRI studies, and
   demonstrates the feasibility of using fNIRS, with its portable and
   motion tolerant capacities, to investigate the neural basis of MJ
   dilemmas.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Contextual factors can transform how we experience pain,
   particularly if pain is associated with other positive outcomes. Here,
   we test a novel meaning-based intervention. Participants were given the
   opportunity to choose to receive pain on behalf of their romantic
   partners, situating pain experience in a positive, prosocial meaning
   context. We predicted that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a
   key structure for pain regulation and generation of affective meaning,
   would mediate the transformation of pain experience by this prosocial
   interpersonal context.
   Methods We studied fMRI activity and behavioral responses in 29
   heterosexual female participants during (1) a baseline pain challenge
   and (2) a task in which participants decided to accept a self-selected
   number of additional pain trials to reduce pain in their male romantic
   partners (accept-partner-pain condition).
   Results Enduring extra pain for the benefit of the romantic partner
   reduced pain-related unpleasantness (t = -2.54, p = .016) but not
   intensity, and increased positive thoughts (t = 3.60, p = .001) and
   pleasant feelings (t = 5.39, p < .0005). Greater willingness to accept
   the pain of one's partner predicted greater unpleasantness reductions (t
   = 3.94, p = .001) and increases in positive thoughts (r = .457, p =
   .013). The vmPFC showed significant increases (q < .05 FDR-corrected) in
   activation during accept-partner-pain, especially for women with greater
   willingness to relieve their partner's pain (t = 2.63, p = .014).
   Reductions in brain regions processing pain and aversive emotion
   significantly mediated reductions in pain unpleasantness (q < .05
   FDR-corrected).
   Conclusions The vmPFC has a key role in transforming the meaning of
   pain, which is associated with a cascade of positive psychological and
   brain effects, including changes in affective meaning, value, and
   pain-specific neural circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating neuroimaging evidence suggests that abnormal functional
   connectivity of the default mode network (DMN) contributes to the
   social-cognitive deficits of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although
   most previous studies relied on conventional functional connectivity
   methods, which assume that connectivity patterns remain constant over
   time, understanding the temporal dynamics of functional connectivity
   during rest may provide new insights into the dysfunction of the DMN in
   ASD. In this work, dynamic functional connectivity analysis based on
   sliding time window correlation was applied to the resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 28 young children with ASD
   (age range: 3-7 years) and 29 matched typically developing controls (TD
   group). In addition, k-means cluster analysis was performed to identify
   distinct temporal states based on the spatial similarity of each
   functional connectivity pattern. Compared with the TD group, young
   children with ASD showed decreased dynamic functional connectivity
   variance between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the right
   precentral gyrus, which is negatively correlated with social motivation
   and social relating. Cluster analysis revealed significant differences
   in functional connectivity patterns between the ASD and TD groups in
   discrete temporal states. Our findings reveal that atypical dynamic
   interactions between the PCC and sensorimotor cortex are associated with
   social deficits in ASD. Results also highlight the critical role of PCC
   in the social-cognitive deficits of ASD and support the concept that
   understanding the dynamic neural interactions among brain regions can
   provide insights into functional abnormalities in ASD. Autism Research

Abstract = {{Studies of classical musicians have demonstrated that expertise
   modulates neural responses during auditory perception. However, it
   remains unclear whether such expertise-dependent plasticity is modulated
   by the instrument that a musician plays. To examine whether the
   recruitment of sensorimotor regions during music perception is modulated
   by instrument-specific experience, we studied nonclassical
   musicians-beatboxers, who predominantly use their vocal apparatus to
   produce sound, and guitarists, who use their hands. We contrast fMRI
   activity in 20 beatboxers, 20 guitarists, and 20 nonmusicians as they
   listen to novel beatboxing and guitar pieces. All musicians show
   enhanced activity in sensorimotor regions (IFG, IPC, and SMA), but only
   when listening to the musical instrument they can play. Using
   independent component analysis, we find expertise-selective enhancement
   in sensorimotor networks, which are distinct from changes in attentional
   networks. These findings suggest that long-term sensorimotor experience
   facilitates access to the posterodorsal ``how{''} pathway during
   auditory processing.}},

Title = {{Within-and Between-Session Prefrontal Cortex Response to Virtual Reality
   Exposure Therapy for Acrophobia}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Exposure Therapy (ET) has demonstrated its efficacy in the treatment of
   phobias, anxiety and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), however, it
   suffers a high drop-out rate because of too low or too high patient
   engagement in treatment. Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) is
   comparably effective regarding symptom reduction and offers an
   alternative tool to facilitate engagement for avoidant participants.
   Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that both ET and VRET normalize
   brain activity within a fear circuit. However, previous studies have
   employed brain imaging technology which restricts people's movement and
   hides their body, surroundings and therapist from view. This is at odds
   with the way engagement is typically controlled. We used a novel
   combination of neural imaging and VR technology-Functional Near-Infrared
   Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Immersive Projection Technology (IPT), to avoid
   these limitations. Although there are a few studies that have
   investigated the effect of VRET on a brain function after the treatment,
   the present study utilized technologies which promote ecological
   validity to measure brain changes after VRET treatment. Furthermore,
   there are no studies that have measured brain activity within VRET
   session. In this study brain activity within the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   was measured during three consecutive exposure sessions. N = 13
   acrophobic volunteers were asked to walk on a virtual plank with a 6 m
   drop below. Changes in oxygenated (HbO) hemoglobin concentrations in the
   PFC were measured in three blocks using fNIRS. Consistent with previous
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, the analysis
   showed decreased activity in the DLPFC and MPFC during first exposure.
   The activity increased toward normal across three sessions. The study
   demonstrates potential efficacy of a method for measuring within-session
   neural response to virtual stimuli that could be replicated within
   clinics and research institutes, with equipment better suited to an ET
   session and at fraction of the cost, when compared to fMRI. This has
   application in widening access to, and increasing ecological validity
   of, immersive neuroimaging across understanding, diagnosis, assessment
   and treatment of, a range of mental disorders such as phobia, anxiety
   and PTSD or addictions.}},

Abstract = {{Early-life stress (ELS) exposure has long-term consequences for both
   brain structure and function and impacts cognitive and emotional
   behavior. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays an important role in
   anxiety and fear conditioning through its extensive anatomical and
   functional connections, in particular to the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC). However, how ELS affects amygdala function and connectivity in
   developing rats is unknown. We used the naturalistic limited
   bedding/nesting (LB) paradigm to induce chronic stress in the pups
   between postnatal day (PND) 1-10. Male normal bedding (NB, control) or
   LB offspring underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI
   (rs-fMRI) on PND18 and in adulthood (PND74-76). Adult male rats were
   tested for fear conditioning and extinction behavior prior to scanning.
   Seed-based functional connectivity maps were generated based on four BLA
   seeds (left, right, anterior and posterior). At both ages, LB induced
   different effects on anterior and posterior BLA networks, with
   significant reductions in rs-fMRI connectivity between the anterior BLA
   and mPFC in LB compared to NB offspring. BLA connectivity was
   lateralized by preweaning age, with the right hemisphere displaying more
   connectivity changes than the left. Weak negative volumetric
   correlations between the BLA and mPFC were also present, mostly in
   preweaning LB animals. rs-fMRI connectivity and volumetric changes were
   associated with enhanced fear behaviors in adult LB offspring.
   Activation of the LB-exposed neonatal amygdala described previously
   might accelerate the maturation of BLA-mPFC projections and/or modify
   the activity of reciprocal connections between these structures, leading
   to a net reduction in rs-fMRI connectivity and increased fear behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Topographically organised responses to visual and tactile stimulation
   are aligned in the ventral intraparietal cortex. The critical biological
   importance of this region, which is thought to mediate visually guided
   defensive movements of the head and upper body, suggests that these maps
   might be hardwired from birth. Here, we investigated whether visual
   experience is necessary for the creation and positioning of these maps
   by assessing the representation of tactile stimulation in congenitally
   and totally blind participants, who had no visual experience, and late
   and totally blind participants. We used a single-subject approach to the
   analysis to focus on the potential individual differences in the
   functional neuroanatomy that might arise from different causes,
   durations and sensory experiences of visual impairment among
   participants. The overall results did not show any significant
   difference between congenitally and late blind participants; however,
   single-subject trends suggested that visual experience is not necessary
   to develop topographically organised maps in the intraparietal cortex,
   whilst losing vision disrupted topographic maps' integrity and
   organisation. These results discussed in terms of brain plasticity and
   sensitive periods.}},

Title = {{Dysfunctional Social Reinforcement Processing in Disruptive Behavior
   Disorders: An Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{449+}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Prior functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) work has
   revealed that children/adolescents with disruptive behavior disorders
   (DBDs) show dysfunctional reward/non-reward processing of non-social
   reinforcements in the context of instrumental learning tasks. Neural
   responsiveness to social reinforcements during instrumental learning,
   despite the importance of this for socialization, has not yet been
   previously investigated.
   Methods: Twenty-nine healthy children/adolescents and 19
   children/adolescents with DBDs performed the fMRI social/non-social
   reinforcement learning task. Participants responded to random fractal
   image stimuli and received social and non-social rewards/non-rewards
   according to their accuracy.
   Results: Children/adolescents with DBDs showed significantly reduced
   responses within the caudate and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to
   non-social (financial) rewards and social non-rewards (the distress of
   others). Connectivity analyses revealed that children/adolescents with
   DBDs have decreased positive functional connectivity between the ventral
   striatum (VST) and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) seeds and
   the lateral frontal cortex in response to reward relative to non-reward,
   irrespective of its sociality. In addition, they showed decreased
   positive connectivity between the vmPFC seed and the amygdala in
   response to non-reward relative to reward.
   Conclusion: These data indicate compromised reinforcement processing of
   both non-social rewards and social non-rewards in children/adolescents
   with DBDs within core regions for instrumental learning and
   reinforcement-based decision-making (caudate and PCC). In addition,
   children/adolescents with DBDs show dysfunctional interactions between
   the VST, vmPFC, and lateral frontal cortex in response to rewarded
   instrumental actions potentially reflecting disruptions in attention to
   rewarded stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial-temporal data arise frequently in biomedical, environmental,
   political and social science studies. Capturing dynamic changes of
   time-varying correlation structure is scientifically important in
   spatio-temporal data analysis. We approximate the time-varying empirical
   estimator of the spatial correlation matrix by groups of selected basis
   matrices representing substructures of the correlation matrix. After
   projecting the correlation structure matrix onto a space spanned by
   basis matrices, we also incorporate varying-coefficient model selection
   and estimation for signals associated with relevant basis matrices. The
   unique feature of the proposed method is that signals at local regions
   corresponding with time can be identified through the proposed penalized
   objective function. Theoretically, we show model selection consistency
   and the oracle property in detecting local signals for the
   varying-coefficient estimators. The proposed method is illustrated
   through simulation studies and brain fMRI data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Implicit measures of aggressiveness are able to circumvent response
   biases that plague self-reports, but it is unclear how they link to
   neural activation during aggressive interactions and to
   aggression-related endocrine function. Here, we tested whether an
   implicit attentional bias toward antisocial semantic information was
   associated with endogenous testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) levels, as
   well as with aggressive behavior and amygdala reactivity to angry faces
   in a separate competitive paradigm. On Day one, participants (39 healthy
   young women) completed an emotional word Stroop task in which they had
   to indicate the font color of antisocial, prosocial, or neutral words.
   On Day two, we measured subjects' brain activity during a competitive
   reaction time task in which the female opponent displayed angry or
   neutral facial expressions at the start of each trial and provoked
   participants with increasingly strong sound blasts. T and C were
   measured in saliva during a regular weekday as well as before and after
   scanning. We previously showed that aggression was associated with
   enhanced amygdala reactivity to angry faces in this sample. The present
   analyses revealed that subjects were slower to identify the font color
   of antisocial relative to neutral words, and that this attentional bias
   predicted higher aggression. T and C were uncorrelated with Stroop
   scores. Crucially, the relationship between implicit attention to
   antisocial words and aggression was mediated by amygdala reactivity to
   angry faces. Our data indicate that a tendency to dwell on implicit
   hostile cues reflects enhanced responsivity to overt anger displays.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Deficits in neurocognition and social cognition are drivers
   of reduced functioning in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, with
   potentially shared neurobiological underpinnings. Many studies have
   sought to identify brain-based biomarkers of these clinical variables
   using a priori dichotomies (e.g., good vs. poor cognition, deficit vs.
   nondeficit syndrome).
   METHODS: We evaluated a fully data-driven approach to do the same by
   building and validating a brain connectivity-based biomarker of social
   cognitive and neurocognitive performance in a sample using resting-state
   and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (n = 74 healthy
   control participants, n = 114 persons with schizophrenia spectrum
   disorder, 188 total). We used canonical correlation analysis followed by
   clustering to identify a functional connectivity signature of normal and
   poor social cognitive and neurocognitive performance.
   RESULTS: Persons with poor social cognitive and neurocognitive
   performance were differentiated from those with normal performance by
   greater resting-state connectivity in the mirror neuron and mentalizing
   systems. We validated our findings by showing that poor performers also
   scored lower on functional outcome measures not included in the original
   analysis and by demonstrating neuroanatomical differences between the
   normal and poorly performing groups. We used a support vector machine
   classifier to demonstrate that functional connectivity alone is enough
   to distinguish normal and poorly performing participants, and we
   replicated our findings in an independent sample (n = 75).
   CONCLUSIONS: A brief functional magnetic resonance imaging scan may
   ultimately be useful in future studies aimed at characterizing long-term
   illness trajectories and treatments that target specific brain circuitry
   in those with impaired cognition and function}},

Abstract = {{Autobiographical memory retrieval is associated with activity of a
   distributed network that is similar to the default-mode network (DMN)
   identified via activity correlations measured during rest. We tested
   whether activity correlations could be used to identify the

   Global-correlativity analysis identified regions with activity
   correlation differences between autobiographical-retrieval and resting
   states. Increased correlations were identified for retrieval versus
   resting states within a distributed network that included regions
   prototypical for autobiographical memory. This network segregated into
   two subnetworks comprised of regions related to memory versus cognitive
   control, suggesting greater functional segregation during
   autobiographical retrieval than rest. DMN regions were important drivers
   of these effects, with increased correlations between DMN and non-DMN
   regions and segregation of the DMN into distinct subnetworks during
   retrieval. Thus, the autobiographical network can be robustly identified
   via activity correlations and retrieval is associated with network
   functional organization distinct from rest.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The transition from childhood to adolescence is a vulnerable
   period for the development of anxiety symptoms. There is some evidence
   that hormonal changes occurring during adrenarche, an early pubertal
   phase, might play a role in this increased vulnerability. Little is
   known about underlying brain mechanisms. Given the role of the
   amygdala-based fear circuit in anxiety, the current study aimed to
   investigate whether children's adrenarcheal hormone levels were
   associated with functional connectivity of the amygdala while processing
   fearful facial expressions, and how this in turn related to anxiety
   symptoms.
   Method: Participants were 83 children (M age 9.53 years) who completed
   two morning saliva collections to measure levels of
   dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), its sulphate (DHEAS), and testosterone.
   They also completed the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS), and
   viewed fearful and calm facial expressions while undergoing a functional
   MRI scan. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses were performed
   to examine amygdala connectivity and significant clusters were fed into
   a bootstrapping mediation model.
   Results: In boys, mediation analyses showed an indirect positive effect
   of testosterone on anxiety symptoms, which was mediated by
   amygdala-secondary visual cortex connectivity as well as
   amygdala-anterior cingulate connectivity. In girls, DHEAS showed a
   negative indirect association with anxiety symptoms mediated by amygdala
   connectivity to the fusiform face area and insula.
   Conclusion: The results indicate unique roles for adrenarcheal hormones
   in anxiety and suggest that amygdala connectivity may represent an
   important neural mechanism in these associations. Importantly, results
   reveal prominent sex differences in the biological mechanisms associated
   with anxiety in children undergoing adrenarche.}},

Abstract = {{Changes across the span of adolescence in the adolescent reward system
   are thought to increase the tendency to take risks. While developmental
   differences in decision and outcome-related reward processes have been
   studied extensively, existing paradigms have largely neglected to
   measure how different types of decisions modulate reward-related outcome
   processes. We modified an existing decision-making paradigm (the
   Stoplight Task; Chein et al., 2011) to create a flexible laboratory
   measure of decision-making and outcome processing, including the ability
   to assess modulatory effects of safe versus risky decisions on
   reward-related outcome processes: the Yellow Light Game (YLG). We
   administered the YLG in the MRI scanner to 81 adolescents, ages 11-17
   years, recruited from the community. Results showed that nucleus
   accumbens activation was enhanced for (1) risky > safe decisions, (2)
   positive > negative outcomes, and (3) outcomes following safe decisions
   compared to outcomes following risky decisions, regardless of whether
   these outcomes were positive or negative. Outcomes following risky
   decisions (compared to outcomes following safe decisions) were
   associated with enhanced activity in cortical midline structures.
   Furthermore, while there were no developmental differences in
   risk-taking behavior, more pubertally mature adolescents showed enhanced
   nucleus accumbens activation during positive > negative outcomes. These
   findings suggest that outcome processing is modulated by the types of
   decisions made by adolescents and highlight the importance of
   investigating processes involved in safe as well as risky decisions to
   better understand the adolescent tendency to take risks.}},

Title = {{Neural architecture underlying person perception from in-group and
   out-group voices}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{582-597}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In spoken language, verbal cues (what we say) and vocal cues (how we say
   it) contribute to person perception, the process for interpreting
   information and making inferences about other people. When someone has
   an accent, forming impressions from the speaker's voice may be
   influenced by social categorization processes (i.e., activating
   stereotypical traits of members of a perceived `out-group') and by
   processes which differentiate the speaker based on their individual
   attributes (e.g., registering the vocal confidence level of the speaker
   in order to make a trust decision). The neural systems for using vocal
   cues that refer to the speaker's identity and to qualifies of their
   vocal expression to generate inferences about others are not known.
   Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   investigate how speaker categorization influences brain activity as
   Canadian-English listeners judged whether they believe statements
   produced by in-group (native) and out-group (regional, foreign)
   speakers. Each statement was expressed in a confident, doubtful, and
   neutral tone of voice. In-group speakers were perceived as more
   believable than speakers with out-group accents overall, confirming
   social categorization of speakers based on their accent. Superior
   parietal and middle temporal regions were uniquely activated when
   listening to out-group compared to in-group speakers suggesting that
   they may be involved in extracting the attributes of speaker
   believability from the lower-level acoustic variations. Basal ganglia,
   left cuneus and right fusiform gyrus were activated by confident
   expressions produced by out-group speakers. These regions appear to
   participate in abstracting more ambiguous believability attributes from
   accented speakers (where a conflict arises between the tendency to
   disbelieve an out-group speaker and the tendency to believe a confident
   voice). For outgroup speakers, stronger impressions of believability
   selectively modulated activity in the bilateral superior and middle
   temporal regions. Moreover, the right superior temporal gyrus, a region
   that was associated with perceived speaker confidence, was found to be
   functionally connected to the left lingual gyrus and right middle
   temporal gyrus when out-group speakers were judged as more believable.
   These findings suggest that identity-related voice characteristics and
   associated biases may influence underlying neural activities for making
   social attributions about out-group speakers, affecting decisions about
   believability and trust. Specifically, inferences about out-group
   speakers seem to be mediated to a greater extent by stimulus-related
   features (i.e., vocal confidence cues) than for in-group speakers. Our
   approach highlights how the voice can be studied to advance models of
   person perception.}},

Abstract = {{There is an ongoing debate about the involvement of Theory of Mind (ToM)
   processes in Visual Perspective Taking (VPT). In an fMRI study (Schurz
   et al., 2015), we borrowed the positive features from a novel VPT task
   which is widely used in behavioral research - to study previously
   overlooked experimental factors in neuroimaging studies. However, as
   Catmur et al. (2016) rightly argue in a comment on our work, our data do
   not speak strongly to questions discussed in the original behavioral
   studies, in particular the issue of implicit mentalizing. We appreciate
   the clarification of these interpretational limitations of our study,
   but would like to point out the differences between questions emerging
   from behavioral and neuroimaging research on VPT. Different from what
   Catmur et al. (2016) discuss, our study was not intended as a test of
   implicit mentalizing. In fact, the terms ``automatic{''} and ``implicit
   mentalizing{''} were never mentioned in our manuscript. Our study
   addressed a methodological gap between ToM and VPT research, which we
   identified in two previous meta-analyses on the topics (Schurz et al.,
   2013, 2014). With this difference in mind we show that the critical
   points levelled by Catmur et al. (2016) cease to apply.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Socially anxious adolescents report distress during social
   decision-making, wherein their favorable view of peers directly
   conflicts with their expectation to be viewed negatively by peers; a
   phenomenon we refer to as mismatch bias. The present study utilizes a
   novel paradigm with dynamic social stimuli to explore the correlates of
   mismatch biases in anxious and healthy youth. Method: The behavioral and
   neural correlates of mismatch biases were assessed in healthy (N=17) and
   anxious (N=14) youth during functional MRI. Participants completed a
   novel task where they viewed silent videos of unknown peers. After
   viewing each video, participants appraised the social desirability of
   the peer (How much do you think you would like them {[}if you met them])
   or predicted how socially desirable the peer would find them (How much
   do you think they would like you {[}if you met them]). Each
   participant's mismatch bias was calculated as the difference between
   their appraisal of peers and their prediction of peers' appraisal of
   them. Results: We found that anxious youth exhibited mismatch bias: they
   rated unknown peers as more desirable than they predicted peers would
   rate them. This effect was not present in the healthy group. Mismatch
   biases were associated with increased engagement of the ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), a region broadly involved in flexible
   cognitions and behavioral selection. In addition, greater mismatch
   biases and vlPFC activation during mismatch biases were associated with
   more severe anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: The findings highlight the
   importance of understanding mismatch biases to inform treatments that
   target distress elicited by discrepant social appraisals in anxious
   youth.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disorder
   associated with social impairments, communication difficulties, and
   restricted and repetitive behaviors. Yet, there is no confirmed cause
   identified for ASD. Studying the functional connectivity of the brain is
   an emerging technique used in diagnosing and understanding ASD. In this
   study, we obtained the resting state functional MRI data of 283 subjects
   from the National Database of Autism Research (NDAR). An automated
   autism diagnosis system was built using the data from NDAR. The proposed
   system is machine learning based. Power spectral densities (PSDs) of
   time courses corresponding to the spatial activation areas are used as
   input features, feeds them to a stacked autoencoder then builds a
   classifier using probabilistic support vector machines. Over the used
   dataset, around 90\% of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was
   achieved by our machine learning system. Moreover, the system
   generalization ability was checked over two different prevalence values,
   one for the general population and the other for the of high risk
   population, and the system proved to be very generalizable, especially
   among the population of high risk. The proposed system generates a full
   personalized report for each subject, along with identifying the global
   differences between ASD and typically developed (TD) subjects and its
   ability to diagnose autism. It shows the impacted areas and the severity
   of implications. From the clinical aspect, this report is considered
   very valuable as it helps in both predicting and understanding behavior
   of autistic subjects. Moreover, it helps in designing a plan for
   personalized treatment per each individual subject. The proposed work is
   taking a step towards achieving personalized medicine in autism which is
   the ultimate goal of our group's research efforts in this area.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe neural mechanisms underlying body dissatisfaction and
   emotional problems evoked by social comparisons in patients with
   anorexia nervosa (AN) are currently unclear. Here, we elucidate patterns
   of brain activation among recovered patients with AN (recAN) during body
   comparison and weight estimation with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI).MethodsWe used fMRI to examine 12 patients with recAN and
   13 healthy controls while they performed body comparison and weight
   estimation tasks with images of underweight, healthy weight, and
   overweight female bodies. In the body comparison task, participants
   rated their anxiety levels while comparing their own body with the
   presented image. In the weight estimation task, participants estimated
   the weight of the body in the presented image. We used between-group
   region of interest (ROI) analyses of the blood oxygen level dependent
   (BOLD) signal to analyze differences in brain activation patterns
   between the groups. In addition, to investigate activation outside
   predetermined ROIs, we performed an exploratory whole-brain analysis to
   identify group differences.ResultsWe found that, compared to healthy
   controls, patients with recAN exhibited significantly greater activation
   in the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) when comparing their
   own bodies with images of underweight female bodies. In addition, we
   found that, compared with healthy controls, patients with recAN
   exhibited significantly smaller activation in the middle temporal gyrus
   corresponding to the extrastriate body area (EBA) when comparing their
   own bodies, irrespective of weight, during self-other comparisons of
   body shape.ConclusionsOur findings from a group of patients with recAN
   suggest that the pathology of AN may lie in an inability to regulate
   negative affect in response to body images via pgACC activation during
   body comparisons. The findings also suggest that altered body image
   processing in the brain persists even after recovery from AN.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the field of virtual reality (VR) has shown tremendous
   advancements and is utilized in entertainment, scientific research,
   social networks, artistic creation, as well as numerous approaches to
   employ VR for psychotherapy. While the use of VR in psychotherapy has
   been widely discussed, little attention has been given to the potential
   of this new medium for art therapy. Artistic expression in VR is a novel
   medium which offers unique possibilities, extending beyond classical
   expressive art mediums. Creation in VR includes options such as
   three-dimensional painting, an immersive creative experience, dynamic
   scaling, and embodied expression. In this perspective paper, we present
   the potentials and challenges of VR for art therapy and outline basic
   principles for its implementation. We focus on the novel qualities
   offered by this creative medium (the virtual environment, virtual
   materials, and unreal characteristics) and on the core aspects of VR
   (such as presence, immersivity, point of view, and perspective) for the
   practice of art therapy.}},

Title = {{Brain Sensitivity to Exclusion is Associated with Core Network Closure}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Humans are driven to pursue and preserve social relationships, and these
   motivations are reinforced through biological systems. In particular,
   individual differences in the tuning of biological systems that respond
   to social threats may motivate individuals to seek out differently
   structured social environments. Drawing on a sample of adolescent males
   who underwent fMRI brain imaging (n = 74) and contributed Facebook data,
   we examined whether biological responses to a common scenariobeing
   excluded from an activity with peers -was associated with their social
   network structure. We find that neural responses during social exclusion
   in a priori hypothesized ``social pain{''} regions of the brain (dACC,
   AI, subACC) are associated with the density and transitivity of core
   friendship networks. These findings suggest that neural reactivity to
   exclusion may be one factor that underlies network ``safety{''}. More
   broadly, the study shows the potential of linking social cognitive
   tendencies to social structural properties.}},

Volume = {{280}},
Pages = {{56-61}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by exaggerated amygdala
   reactivity in response to symptom provocation, but it is unclear if such
   hyper-reactivity is elicited by disorder-specific challenges only or
   characterizes reactions to aversive stimuli in general. Here, using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging in 14 patients with SAD, as
   compared to 12 healthy controls, we found that amygdala hyper-reactivity
   is confined to disorder-relevant social stimulation. SAD patients
   displayed increased amygdala reactivity to fearful as compared to
   neutral facial pictures, but not in response to generally aversive but
   mainly non-social stimulation when compared to neutral pictorial stimuli
   taken from the International Affective Picture System. The increased
   amygdala reactivity was not mediated by an altered prefrontal inhibition
   among SAD patients as compared to controls, suggesting increased
   bottom-up processes rather than attenuated top-down control. In
   conclusion, the enhanced amygdala reactivity in SAD seems specific to
   socially relevant stimuli rather than aversive stimuli in general.}},

Title = {{Groups and Emotional Arousal Mediate Neural Synchrony and Perceived
   Ritual Efficacy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{We present the first neurophysiological signatures showing distinctive
   effects of group social context and emotional arousal on cultural
   perceptions, such as the efficacy of religious rituals. Using a novel
   protocol, EEG data were simultaneously recorded from ethnic Chinese
   religious believers in group and individual settings as they rated the
   perceived efficacy of low, medium, and high arousal spirit-medium
   rituals presented as video clips. Neural oscillatory patterns were then
   analyzed for these perceptual judgements, categorized as low, medium,
   and high efficacy. The results revealed distinct neural signatures and
   behavioral patterns between the experimental conditions. Arousal levels
   predicted ratings of ritual efficacy. Increased efficacy was marked by
   suppressed alpha and beta power, regardless of group or individual
   setting. In groups, efficacy ratings converged. Individual setting
   showed increased within-participant phase synchronization in alpha and
   beta bands, while group setting enhanced between-participant theta phase
   synchronization. This reflected group participants' orientation toward a
   common perspective and social coordination. These findings suggest that
   co-presence in groups leads to a social-tuning effect supported by
   between-participant theta phase synchrony. Together these neural
   synchrony patterns reveal how collective rituals have both individual
   and communal dimensions. The emotionality of spirit-medium rituals
   drives individual perceptions of efficacy, while co-presence in groups
   signals the significance of an event and socially tunes enhanced
   agreement in perceptual ratings. In other words, mass gatherings may
   foster social cohesion without necessarily requiring group-size scaling
   limitations of direct face-to-face interaction. This could have
   implications for the scaling computability of synchrony in large groups
   as well as for humanistic studies in areas such as symbolic
   interactionism.}},

   Mobile EEG Recording Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The detection of a human face in a visual field and correct reading of
   emotional expression of faces are important elements in everyday social
   interactions, decision making and emotional responses. Although brain
   correlates of face processing have been established in previous fMRI and
   electroencephalography (EEG)/MEG studies, little is known about how the
   brain representation of faces and emotional expressions of faces in
   freely moving humans. The present study aimed to detect brain electrical
   potentials that occur during the viewing of human faces in natural
   settings. 64-channel wireless EEG and eye-tracking data were recorded in
   19 participants while they moved in a mock art gallery and stopped at
   times to evaluate pictures hung on the walls. Positive, negative and
   neutral valence pictures of objects and human faces were displayed. The
   time instants in which pictures first occurred in the visual field were
   identified in eye-tracking data and used to reconstruct the triggers in
   continuous EEG data after synchronizing the time axes of the EEG and
   eye-tracking device. EEG data showed a clear face-related event-related
   potential (ERP) in the latency interval ranging from 165 to 210 ms
   (N170); this component was not seen whilst participants were viewing
   non-living objects. The face ERP component was stronger during viewing
   disgusted compared to neutral faces. Source dipole analysis revealed an
   equivalent current dipole in the right fusiform gyrus (BA37) accounting
   for N170 potential. Our study demonstrates for the first time the
   possibility of recording brain responses to human faces and emotional
   expressions in natural settings. This finding opens new possibilities
   for clinical, developmental, social, forensic, or marketing research in
   which information about face processing is of importance.}},

   imaging (fMRI) study is the first to use ``one-liner{''} humor to
   investigate the neural correlates involved in appreciating humor styles
   that differ in terms of target (self or other) and motivation (benign or
   detrimental). Interestingly, we observed greater activation in response
   to humor that facilitates relationships with others (self-defeating and
   affiliative humor) than to humor that enhances the self (self-enhancing
   and aggressive humor). Self-defeating humor may play an important role
   in Chinese culture in facilitating social relationships at one's own
   expense. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed
   temporal pole (TP)-frontal functional connectivity underlying the
   appreciation of self-directed humor, and temporo-parietal junction
   (TPJ)-frontal connectivity underlying the appreciation of other-directed
   humor. Amygdala-frontal coupling was observed during the appreciation of
   detrimental humor, while nucleus accumbens (NAc)-temporal coupling and
   midbrain-frontal coupling appear to play a role in the affective
   experience of amusement in response to benign humor. This study
   contributes to our understanding of the neural correlates of
   appreciating different humor styles, including humor that facilitates
   social relationships.}},

Title = {{Listening in Naturalistic Scenes: What Can Functional Near-Infrared
   Spectroscopy and Intersubject Correlation Analysis Tell Us About the
   Underlying Brain Activity?}},
Journal = {{TRENDS IN HEARING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{22}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Listening to speech in the noisy conditions of everyday life can be
   effortful, reflecting the increased cognitive workload involved in
   extracting meaning from a degraded acoustic signal. Studying the
   underlying neural processes has the potential to provide mechanistic
   insight into why listening is effortful under certain conditions. In a
   move toward studying listening effort under ecologically relevant
   conditions, we used the silent and flexible neuroimaging technique
   functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine brain activity
   during attentive listening to speech in naturalistic scenes. Thirty
   normally hearing participants listened to a series of narratives
   continuously varying in acoustic difficulty while undergoing fNIRS
   imaging. Participants then listened to another set of closely matched
   narratives and rated perceived effort and intelligibility for each
   scene. As expected, self-reported effort generally increased with
   worsening signal-to-noise ratio. After controlling for better-ear
   signal-to-noise ratio, perceived effort was greater in scenes that
   contained competing speech than in those that did not, potentially
   reflecting an additional cognitive cost of overcoming informational
   masking. We analyzed the fNIRS data using intersubject correlation, a
   data-driven approach suitable for analyzing data collected under
   naturalistic conditions. Significant intersubject correlation was seen
   in the bilateral auditory cortices and in a range of channels across the
   prefrontal cortex. The involvement of prefrontal regions is consistent
   with the notion that higher order cognitive processes are engaged during
   attentive listening to speech in complex real-world conditions. However,
   further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between
   perceived listening effort and activity in these extended cortical
   networks.}},

Title = {{Dissociation between the processing of humorous and monetary rewards in
   the `motivation' and `hedonic' brains}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Humor elicits feelings of amusement and can be thought of as a social
   reward. We identified distinct mesolimbic reward system (MRS) processing
   patterns for monetary and humorous rewards. During both the reward
   anticipation and outcome phases, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were active in response to monetary cues
   and monetary gains, while the amygdala and midbrain showed a
   differential response to humorous rewards, apparently driven by the
   hedonic enjoyment and appreciation of humor consumption.
   Psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI) further demonstrated the
   functional coupling of the amygdala-midbrain circuit in response to
   humorous gains during the reward outcome phase, while neural signaling
   was observed in the NAc-ACC circuit during both the reward anticipation
   and outcome phases in response to monetary rewards. This is consistent
   with a view in which the NAc plays a key role in the `motivation brain',
   and the amygdala in the `hedonic brain'. The findings further suggest
   that the neural mechanisms underlying reward consumption are more
   modality-specific than those underlying reward anticipation. Our study
   contributes to a growing understanding of neural responses to social
   rewards and represent an important first step toward understanding the
   neural processing of humor as one significant type of social reward.}},

Title = {{Functional EEG connectivity during competition}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Social behavior and interactions pervasively shape and
   influence our lives and relationships. Competition, in particular, has
   become a core topic in social neuroscience since it stresses the
   relevance and salience of social comparison processes between the
   inter-agents that are involved in a common task. The majority of
   studies, however, investigated such kind of social interaction via
   one-person individual paradigms, thus not taking into account relevant
   information concerning interdependent participants' behavioral and
   neural responses. In the present study, dyads of volunteers participated
   in a hyperscanning paradigm and competed in a computerized attention
   task while their electrophysiological (EEG) activity and performance
   were monitored and recorded. Behavioral data and inter-brain coupling
   measures based on EEG frequency data were then computed and compared
   across different experimental conditions: a control condition
   (individual task, t0), a first competitive condition (pre-feedback
   condition, t1), and a second competitive condition following a positive
   reinforcing feedback (post-feedback condition, t2).
   Results: Results showed that during competitive tasks participants'
   performance was improved with respect to control condition (reduced
   response times and error rates), with a further specific improvement
   after receiving a reinforcing feedback. Concurrently, we observed a
   reduction of inter-brain functional connectivity (primarily involving
   bilateral prefrontal areas) for slower EEG frequency bands (delta and
   theta). Finally, correlation analyses highlighted a significant
   association between cognitive performance and inter-brain connectivity
   measures.
   Conclusions: The present results may help identifying specific patterns
   of behavioral and inter-brain coupling measures associated to
   competition and processing of social reinforcements.}},

Abstract = {{The salience network is a distributed neural system that maintains
   homeostasis by regulating autonomic nervous system activity and
   social-emotional function. Here we examined how within-network
   connectivity relates to individual differences in human (including males
   and females) baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous activity.
   We measured resting autonomic nervous system physiology in 24 healthy
   controls and 23 patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia
   (bvFTD), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by baseline autonomic
   deficits. Participants also underwent structural and task-free fMRI.
   First, we used voxel-based morphometry to determine whether salience
   network atrophy was associated with lower baseline respiratory sinus
   arrhythmia (a parasympathetic measure) and skin conductance level (a
   sympathetic measure) in bvFTD. Next, we examined whether functional
   connectivity deficits in 21 autonomic-relevant, salience network
   node-pairs related to baseline autonomic dysfunction. Lower baseline
   respiratory sinus arrhythmia was associated with smaller volume in left
   ventral anterior insula (vAI), weaker connectivity between bilateral vAI
   and bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and stronger connectivity
   between bilateral ACC and bilateral hypothalamus/amygdala. Lower
   baseline skin conductance level, in contrast, was associated with
   smaller volume in inferior temporal gyrus, dorsal mid-insula, and
   hypothalamus; weaker connectivity between bilateral ACC and right
   hypothalamus/amygdala; and stronger connectivity between bilateral
   dorsal anterior insula and periaqueductal gray. Our results suggest that
   baseline parasympathetic and sympathetic tone depends on the integrity
   of lateralized salience network hubs (left vAI for parasympathetic and
   right hypothalamus/amygdala for sympathetic) and highly calibrated
   ipsilateral and contralateral network connections. In bvFTD, deficits in
   this system may underlie resting parasympathetic and sympathetic
   disruption.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Cognitive Reappraisal on Reactive Aggression: An fMRI
   Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{A number of empirical researches have shown that reactive aggression,
   which is the behavior that is impulsive, thoughtless, driven by anger,
   and causes harm toward another individual, can lead to a series of
   negative effects. Cognitive reappraisal may have the potential to reduce
   reactive aggression, but evidence for this effect in healthy populations
   is lacking. We randomly assigned participants to a Reappraisal Group (n
   = 19) or Control Group (n = 20) in a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) version of the well-established Taylor Aggression
   Paradigm (TAP). TAP was employed to elicit and measure reactive
   aggression, during which participants were informed that they would play
   a competitive reaction time task against two opponents in turn and the
   winner would punish the loser. The TAP used in this study separates the
   decision-making (during which participants were asked to set a
   punishment level for the opponent) and affective processes (during which
   the punishment was applied or received) that underlie reactive
   aggression. Behavioral data showed that there was no difference between
   the Reappraisal Group and Control Group in the punishment level
   selections (i.e., reactive aggression). However, on the neural level,
   cognitive reappraisal reduced the activation of left insula, right
   cuneus, and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) during the decision phase,
   independently of the level of provocation. In addition, cognitive
   reappraisal reduced the activation of the caudate under the provocative
   condition when making decisions about aggressive behavior. The results
   of the outcome phase showed that, after winning a competition, cognitive
   reappraisal increased the activation of the right orbital middle frontal

Abstract = {{Lesions of primary visual cortex or its primary inputs typically result
   in retinotopically localized scotomas. Here we present an individual
   with unexplained visual field loss and deficits in visual perception in
   the absence of structural damage to the early visual pathway or lesions
   in visual cortex. The subject, monocular from an early age, underwent
   repeated perimetry tests over 8 years demonstrating severe anopia of the
   lower hemifield, and a clockwise progression of the loss through her
   upper left visual field. Her visual impairment was evident in a number
   of standardized tests and psychophysics, especially in tasks assessing
   spatial integration using illusory contours. However, her intellectual
   ability was intact and her performance in some other tasks assessing
   color vision or object detection in scenes was normal. We employed
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroretinography and
   visually evoked potentials. Surprisingly, in contrast to the
   participant's severe anopia, we found no evidence of abnormal function
   of her early visual pathways. Specifically, we performed retinotopic
   mapping using population receptive field (pRF) analysis to map the
   functional organization of visual cortex in the anopic participant and
   three control participants on two occasions three and a half years
   apart. Despite the behavioral visual field loss, her retinotopic maps
   and pRF parameters in visual areas V1-V3 were qualitatively normal.
   Further behavioral experiments confirmed that this discrepancy was not
   trivially explained by the difference between stimuli used for
   retinotopic mapping and perimetry. Structural T1 scans were normal at
   both time points, and volumetric analysis of white and gray matter
   tissue on the segmented T1 volumes did not reveal any abnormalities or
   deterioration over time. Our findings suggest that normal functional
   organization of early visual cortex without evident structural damage to
   the early visual pathway as disclosed by the techniques employed in this
   study does not necessarily guarantee conscious perception across the
   visual field.}},

Abstract = {{Non-human primate neuroimaging is a rapidly growing area of research
   that promises to transform and scale translational and cross-species
   comparative neuroscience. Unfortunately, the technological and
   methodological advances of the past two decades have outpaced the
   accrual of data, which is particularly challenging given the relatively
   few centers that have the necessary facilities and capabilities. The
   PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) addresses this challenge by aggregating
   independently acquired non-human primate magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) datasets and openly sharing them via the International
   Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI). Here, we present the
   rationale, design, and procedures for the PRIME-DE consortium, as well
   as the initial release, consisting of 25 independent data collections
   aggregated across 22 sites (total = 217 non-human primates). We also
   outline the unique pitfalls and challenges that should be considered in
   the analysis of non-human primate MRI datasets, including providing
   automated quality assessment of the contributed datasets.}},

Abstract = {{This study tests an instructional model designed to empower students in
   an early childhood classroom as emerging digital storytellers. Educators
   can use digital storytelling to support students' learning by
   encouraging them to organize and express their ideas and knowledge in an
   individual and meaningful way while developing voice and facility in
   child-computer interactions. This work also helps develop traditional
   communication skills, fosters collaboration, and strengthens emergent
   literacy practices. Students develop enhanced communication skills by
   learning to organize their ideas, ask questions, express opinions, and
   construct narratives as they interact with others and computers in the
   creation of digital stories. The ``Emerging Digital Storytellers{''}
   instructional model focuses on social-emotional development and finding
   student voice through writing and digital content construction in the
   early childhood educational context.}},

   Major Depressive Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Mounting studies have applied resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to study major depressive disorder (MDD) and
   have identified abnormal functional activities. However, how the global
   functional connectivity patterns change in MDD is still unknown. Using
   rs-fMRI, we investigated the alterations of global resting-state
   functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns in MDD using weighted global
   brain connectivity (wGBC) method. First, a whole brain voxel-wise wGBC
   map was calculated for 23 MDD patients and 34 healthy controls.
   Two-sample t-tests were applied to compare the wGBC and RSFC maps and
   the significant level was set at p < 0.05, cluster-level correction with
   voxel-level p < 0.001. MDD patients showed significantly decreased wGBC
   in left temporal pole (TP) and increased wGBC in right parahippocampus
   (PHC). Subsequent RSFC analyses showed decreased functional interaction
   between TP and right posterior superior temporal cortex and increased
   functional interaction between PHC and right inferior frontal gyrus in
   MDD patients. These results revealed the abnormal global FC patterns and
   its corresponding disrupted functional connectivity in MDD. Our findings
   present new evidence for the functional interruption in MDD.}},

Title = {{Role-Specific Brain Activations in Leaders and Followers During Joint
   Action}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Much of social interaction in human life requires that individuals
   perform different roles during joint actions, the most basic distinction
   being that between a leader and a follower. A number of neuroimaging
   studies have examined the brain networks for leading and following, but
   none have examined what effect prior expertise at these roles has on
   brain activations during joint motor tasks. Couple dancers (e.g.,
   dancers of Tango, Salsa, and swing) are an ideal population in which
   examine such effects, since leaders and followers of partnered dances
   have similar overall levels of motor expertise at dancing, but can
   differ strikingly in their role-specific skill sets. To explore
   role-specific expertise effects on brain activations for the first time,
   we recruited nine skilled leaders and nine skilled followers of couple
   dances for a functional magnetic resonance imaging study. We employed a
   two-person scanning arrangement that allowed a more naturalistic
   interaction between two individuals. The dancers interacted physically
   with an experimenter standing next to the bore of the magnet so as to
   permit bimanual partnered movements. Together, they alternated between
   leading and following the joint movements. The results demonstrated that
   the brain activations during the acts of leading and following were
   enhanced by prior expertise at being a leader or follower, and that
   activity in task-specific brain areas tended to be positively correlated
   with the level of expertise at the corresponding role. These findings
   provide preliminary evidence that training at one role of a joint motor
   task can selectively enhance role-related brain activations.}},

Title = {{Is Our Self Related to Personality? A Neuropsychodynamic Model}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{OCT 4}},
Abstract = {{The concept and the assessment of personality have been extensively
   discussed in psychoanalysis and in clinical psychology over the years.
   Nowadays there is large consensus in considering the constructs of the
   self and relatedness as central criterions to assess the personality and
   its disturbances. However, the relation between the psychological
   organization of personality, the construct of the self, and its neuronal
   correlates remain unclear. Based on the recent empirical data on the
   neural correlates of the self (and others), on the importance of early
   relational and attachment experiences, and on the relation with the
   brain's spontaneous/resting state activity (rest-self
   overlap/containment), we propose here a multilayered model of the self
   with: (i) relational alignment; (ii) self-constitution; (iii)
   self-manifestation; and (iv) self-expansion. Importantly, these
   different layers of the self can be characterized by different neuronal
   correlates-this results in different neuronally grounded configurations
   or organizations of personality. These layers correspond to different
   levels of personality organization, such as psychotic (as related to the
   layer of self-constitution), borderline (as related to the layer of
   self-manifestation) and neurotic (as related to the layer of
   self-expansion). Taken together, we provide here for the first time a
   neurobiologically and clinically grounded model of personality
   organization, which carries major psychodynamic and neuroscientific
   implications. The study of the spontaneous activity of the brain,
   intrinsically related to the self (rest-self overlap/containment) and
   the interaction with stimuli (rest-stimulus interaction) may represent a
   further advance in understanding how our default state plays a crucial
   role in navigating through the internal world and the external reality.}},

Title = {{Pain Mirrors: Neural Correlates of Observing Self or Others' Facial
   Expressions of Pain}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Facial expressions of pain are able to elicit empathy and adaptive
   behavioral responses in the observer. An influential theory posits that
   empathy relies on an affective mirror mechanism, according to which
   emotion recognition relies upon the internal simulation of motor and
   interoceptive states triggered by emotional stimuli. We tested this
   hypothesis comparing representations of self or others' expressions of
   pain in nineteen young healthy female volunteers by means of functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized that one's own facial
   expressions are more likely to elicit the internal simulation of
   emotions, being more strictly related to self. Video-clips of the facial
   expressions of each volunteer receiving either painful or non-painful
   mechanical stimulations to their right hand dorsum were recorded and
   used as stimuli in a 2 x 2 (Self/Other; Pain/No-Pain) within-subject
   design. During each trial, a 2 s video clip was presented, displaying
   either the subject's own neutral or painful facial expressions (Self
   No-Pain, SNP; Self Pain, SP), or the expressions of other unfamiliar
   volunteers (Others' No-Pain, ONP; Others' Pain, OP), displaying a
   comparable emotional intensity. Participants were asked to indicate
   whether each video displayed a pain expression. fMRI signals were higher
   while viewing Pain than No-Pain stimuli in a large bilateral array of
   cortical areas including middle and superior temporal, supramarginal,
   superior mesial and inferior frontal (IFG) gyri, anterior insula (AI),
   anterior cingulate (ACC), and anterior mid-cingulate (aMCC) cortex, as
   well as right fusiform gyrus. Bilateral activations were also detected
   in thalamus and basal ganglia. The Self vs. Other contrast showed signal
   changes in ACC and aMCC, IFG, AI, and parietal cortex. A significant
   interaction between Self and Pain {[}(SP vs. SNP) > (OP vs. ONP)] was
   found in a pre-defined region of aMCC known to be also active during
   noxious stimulation. These findings demonstrate that the observation of
   one's own and others' facial expressions share a largely common neural
   network, but self-related stimuli induce generally higher activations.
   In line with our hypothesis, selectively greater activity for self
   pain-related stimuli was found in aMCC, a medial-wail region critical
   for pain perception and recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Nonverbal communication of emotion is essential to human interaction and
   relevant to many clinical applications, yet it is an understudied topic
   in social neuroscience. Drumming is an ancient nonverbal communication
   modality for expression of emotion that has not been previously
   investigated in this context. We investigate the neural response to
   live, natural communication of emotion via drumming using a novel
   dual-brain neuroimaging paradigm. Hemodynamic signals were acquired
   using whole-head functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Dyads of
   36 subjects participated in two conditions, drumming and talking,
   alternating between `sending' (drumming or talking to partner) and
   `receiving' (listening to partner) in response to emotionally salient
   images from the International Affective Picture System. Increased
   frequency and amplitude of drum strikes was behaviorally correlated with
   higher arousal and lower valence measures and neurally correlated with
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ) activation in the listener. Contrast
   comparisons of drumming greater than talking also revealed neural
   activity in right TPJ. Together, findings suggest that emotional content
   communicated by drumming engages right TPJ mechanisms in an emotionally
   and behaviorally sensitive fashion. Drumming may provide novel,
   effective clinical approaches for treating social-emotional
   psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{The current functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI study
   investigated how outcomes achieved by others affect subjective regret
   and subsequent behavior. During the task, participants were asked to
   open a series of boxes consecutively until they decided to stop. Each
   box contained a reward (gold), except for one that contained an adverse
   stimulus (devil), which caused the participants to lose all the gold
   they collected in that trial. Importantly, participants were instructed
   that every trial they encountered would also be played in parallel by
   another player. During the feedback stage, outcomes of both the
   participant and the other player were presented. Behaviorally,
   participants felt less regret and took less risk when objective outcomes
   improved or when their outcomes were better than others. Participants
   tended to take more risk after experiencing regret. At the neural level,
   the ventral striatum (VS) and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex
   (pgACC) showed increased activation as objective outcomes improved.
   Across participants, activation of the VS was positively correlated with
   corresponding behavioral changes. Increased activation of the VS and
   significantly higher functional connectivity with the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) were found when their outcomes were better than
   others. Additionally, the VS-dACC functional connectivity was correlated

Abstract = {{Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often engage in
   dangerous self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) as a maladaptive technique to
   decrease heightened feelings of distress (e.g. negative feelings caused
   by social exclusion). The reward system has recently been proposed as a
   plausible neural substrate, which may influence the interaction between
   social distress and physical pain processing in patients that engage in
   SIBs. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 20 adult BPD
   patients with a history of SIBs and 23 healthy controls (HCs), we found
   a hyper-activation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala when
   painful stimuli were presented to BPD patients (but not HCs) in a state
   of heightened distress, induced via social exclusion. This differential
   NAcc activity was mediated by anxious attachment style, which is a key
   developmental feature of the disorder. Altogether, these results suggest
   a neural mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of SIBs in these
   patients, which is likely reinforced via the reward system.}},

Abstract = {{Infant faces have distinctive features that together are described as
   baby schema, a configuration that facilitates caregiving motivation and
   behavior, and increases the perception of cuteness. In the current
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the
   effect of a within-subjects intranasal oxytocin administration (24 IU)
   and caregiving motivation on neural responses to infant faces of varying
   baby schema in 23 healthy nulliparous women. Overall, infant faces
   elicited activation in several brain regions involved in reward and
   salience processing, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA),
   putamen, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula, and this
   activation was related to self-reported caregiving motivation.
   Critically, whereas we hypothesized enhanced neural caregiving-related
   responses after oxytocin administration, we observed reduced activation
   in the VTA, putamen and amygdala after oxytocin compared to placebo. In
   nulliparous women, oxytocin has been shown to reduce neural responses in
   the same regions in response to social stimuli using other paradigms.
   Oxytocin might affect neural activation toward social stimuli depending
   on elicited arousal and personal characteristics. The current study is
   the first to demonstrate this effect in response to infant faces and
   thereby adds to specify the role of oxytocin in human social information
   processing.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Number = {{140}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We present a protocol designed to measure the neural correlates of
   reward in children. The protocol allows researchers to measure both
   reward anticipation and processing. Its purpose is to create a reward
   task that is appropriate for young children with and without autism
   while controlling reward properties between two conditions: social and
   nonsocial. The current protocol allows for comparisons of brain activity
   between social and nonsocial reward conditions while keeping the reward
   itself identical between conditions. Using this protocol, we found
   evidence that neurotypical children demonstrate enhanced anticipatory
   brain activity during the social condition. Furthermore, we found that
   neurotypical children anticipate social reward more robustly than
   children with autism diagnoses. As the task uses snacks as a reward, it
   is most appropriate for young children. However, the protocol may be
   adapted for use with adolescent or adult populations if snacks are
   replaced by monetary incentives. The protocol is designed to measure
   electrophysiological events (event-related potentials), but it may be
   customized for use with eye-tracking or fMRI.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The neuropeptide oxytocin can extensively modulate human
   social behavior and affective processing, and its effects can be
   interpreted in terms of mediating approach-avoidance motivational
   processes. However, little is known about how oxytocin mediates
   approach-avoidance behavior and particularly the underlying neural
   mechanisms.
   Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, between-subject design, the
   present pharmaco-fMRI study used an approach-avoidance paradigm to
   investigate oxytocin's effects on approach-avoidance behavior and
   associated neural mechanisms.
   Results: Results revealed that oxytocin generally decreased activity in
   the right striatum irrespective of response (approach/avoidance) and
   social context, suggesting an inhibitory effect on motivational
   representation during both appetitive approach and aversive avoidance.
   Importantly, while on the behavioral level oxytocin selectively enhanced
   accuracy when approaching social positive stimuli, on the neural level
   it decreased left ventral and right dorsal anterior insula activity in
   response to social vs nonsocial positive stimuli compared with the
   placebo treatment. The left ventral anterior insula activity was
   negatively correlated with the corresponding accuracy difference scores
   in the oxytocin but not in the placebo group.
   Conclusion: Given the role of the ventral anterior insula in emotional
   processing and the dorsal anterior insula in salience processing, the
   oxytocin-induced suppression of activity in these regions may indicate
   that oxytocin is acting to reduce interference from hyper-activity in
   core regions of the emotional and salience networks when approaching
   salient positive social stimuli and thereby to promote social
   interaction. Thus, oxytocin may be of potential therapeutic benefit for
   psychiatric disorders exhibiting avoidance of social stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Flow is characterized by a high level of intrinsic reward that results
   from a balance between task difficulty and individual ability. The
   Synchronization Theory of Flow offers an explanation for the neural
   basis of this process. It predicts an energetically-optimized,
   brain-network organization between cognitive control and reward regions
   when task difficulty and individual ability are balanced. While initial
   results provide support for structural predictions, the many-to-many
   connectivity and energetic optimality hypotheses remain untested. Our
   study addresses this gap. Subjects played a video game while undergoing
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. We experimentally manipulated
   task difficulty and individual ability. Using graph theoretical
   analyses, we show that the balanced-difficulty condition (compared to
   low- or high-difficulty) was associated with the highest average network
   degree in the fronto-parietal control network (implicated in cognitive
   control) and had the lowest global efficiency value, indicating low
   metabolic cost, and thereby testing Synchronization Theory's core
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Converging evidence indicates that brain abnormalities in
   autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) involve atypical network connectivity.
   Given the central role of social deficits in the ASD phenotype, this
   investigation examined functional connectivity of the amygdala a brain
   structure critically involved in processing of social information in
   children and adolescents with ASDs, as well as age-dependent changes and
   links with clinical symptoms.
   Method: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)
   data from 55 participants with ASDs and 50 typically developing (TD)
   controls, aged 7 to 17 years, were included. Groups were matched for
   age, gender, IQ, and head motion. Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI)
   analysis was applied to examine intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC)
   of the amygdala, including cross-sectional tests of age-related changes.
   Results: Direct between-group comparisons revealed reduced functional
   connectivity between bilateral amygdalae and left inferior occipital
   cortex, accompanied by greater connectivity between right amygdala and
   right sensorimotor cortex in the ASD group. This atypical pattern of
   amygdala connectivity was associated with decreased symptom severity and
   better overall functioning, as specifically seen in an ASD subgroup with
   the most atypical amygdala iFC but the least impaired social
   functioning. Age-related strengthening of amygdala prefrontal
   connectivity, as observed in the TD group, was not detected in children
   with ASDs.
   Conclusion: Findings support aberrant network sculpting in ASDs,
   specifically atypical integration between amygdala and primary
   sensorimotor circuits. Paradoxical links between atypical iFC and
   behavioral measures suggest that abnormal amygdala functional
   connections may be compensatory in some individuals with ASDs.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with obesity are often characterized by alterations in
   reward processing. This may affect how new information is used to update
   stimulus values during reinforcement-based learning. Here, we
   investigated obesity-related changes in non-food reinforcement
   processing, their impact on learning performance as well as the neural
   underpinnings of reinforcement-based learning in obesity. Nineteen
   individuals with obesity (BMI>=30kg/m(2), 10 female) and 23 lean control
   participants (BMI 18.5-24.9kg/m(2), 11 female) performed a probabilistic
   learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in
   which they learned to choose between advantageous and disadvantageous
   choice options in separate monetary gain, loss, and neutral conditions.
   During learning individuals with obesity made a significantly lower
   number of correct choices and accumulated a significantly lower overall
   monetary outcome than lean control participants. FMRI analyses revealed
   aberrant medial prefrontal cortex responses to monetary losses in
   individuals with obesity. There were no significant group differences in
   the regional representation of prediction errors. However, we found
   evidence for increased functional connectivity between the ventral
   striatum and insula in individuals with obesity. The present results
   suggest that obesity is associated with aberrant value representations
   for monetary losses, alterations in functional connectivity during the
   processing of learning outcomes, as well as a decresased
   reinforcement-based learning performance. This may affect how new
   information is incorporated to adjust dysfunctional behavior and could
   be a factor contributing to the maintenance of dysfunctional eating
   behavior in obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Neural responses to visual stimuli are modulated by spatial and temporal
   context. For example, in primary visual cortex (V1), responses to an
   oriented target stimulus will be suppressed when embedded within an
   oriented surround stimulus. This suppression is orientation-specific,
   with the largest suppression observed when stimuli in the neuron's
   classical receptive field and surround are of similar orientation. In
   human psychological experiments, the tilt illusion and tilt aftereffect
   demonstrate an effect of context on perceived orientation of a target
   stimulus. Similar to the neurophysiological data, the strength of these
   effects is modulated by the orientation difference between the target
   stimulus and context. It has been hypothesized that the neural mechanism
   underlying both the tilt illusion and tilt aftereffect involves
   orientation-tuned inhibition in V1. However, to date there is no direct
   evidence linking human perception of these illusions with measurements
   of inhibition from human visual cortex. Here, we measured
   context-induced suppression of neural responses in human visual cortex
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the same
   participants, we also measured magnitudes of their tilt illusion and
   tilt aftereffect. Our data revealed a significant relationship between
   the magnitude of neural suppression in V1 and size of the tilt illusion
   and tilt aftereffect. That is, participants who showed stronger blood
   oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) suppression in V1 also perceived
   stronger shifts in illusory tilt. This agreement between perception and
   neural responses in human V1 suggests a shared inhibitory mechanism that
   mediates both spatial and temporal effects of context in human
   perception.}},

Abstract = {{Working memory (WM) is a central construct in cognitive neuroscience
   because it comprises mechanisms of active information maintenance and
   cognitive control that underpin most complex cognitive behavior.
   Individual variation in WM has been associated with multiple behavioral
   and health features including demographic characteristics, cognitive and
   physical traits and lifestyle choices. In this context, we used sparse
   canonical correlation analyses (sCCAs) to determine the covariation
   between brain imaging metrics of WM-network activation and connectivity
   and nonimaging measures relating to sensorimotor processing, affective
   and nonaffective cognition, mental health and personality, physical
   health and lifestyle choices derived from 823 healthy participants
   derived from the Human Connectome Project. We conducted sCCAs at two
   levels: a global level, testing the overall association between the
   entire imaging and behavioral-health data sets; and a modular level,
   testing associations between subsets of the two data sets. The
   behavioral-health and neuroimaging data sets showed significant
   interdependency. Variables with positive correlation to the neuroimaging
   variate represented higher physical endurance and fluid intelligence as
   well as better function in multiple higher-order cognitive domains.
   Negatively correlated variables represented indicators of suboptimal
   cardiovascular and metabolic control and lifestyle choices such as
   alcohol and nicotine use. These results underscore the importance of
   accounting for behavioral-health factors in neuroimaging studies of WM
   and provide a neuroscience-informed framework for personalized and
   public health interventions to promote and maintain the integrity of the
   WM network.}},

Abstract = {{Preclinical evidence suggests that ghrelin, a peptide synthesized by
   endocrine cells of the stomach and a key component of the gut-brain
   axis, is involved in alcohol seeking as it modulates both central reward
   and stress pathways. However, whether and how ghrelin administration may
   impact alcohol intake in humans is not clear. For, we believe, the first
   time, this was investigated in the present randomized, crossover,
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, human laboratory study. Participants
   were non-treatmentseeking alcohol-dependent heavy-drinking individuals.
   A 10-min loading dose of intravenous ghrelin/placebo (3 mcg kg(-1))
   followed by a continuous ghrelin/placebo infusion (16.9 ng/kg/min) was
   administered. During a progressive-ratio alcohol selfadministration
   experiment, participants could press a button to receive intravenous
   alcohol using the Computerized Alcohol Infusion System. In another
   experiment, brain functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted
   while participants performed a task to gain points for alcohol, food or
   no reward. Results showed that intravenous ghrelin, compared to placebo,
   significantly increased the number of alcohol infusions
   self-administered (percent change: 24.97 +/- 10.65, P = 0.04, Cohen's d
   = 0.74). Participants were also significantly faster to initiate alcohol
   self-administration when they received ghrelin, compared to placebo (P =
   0.03). The relationships between breath alcohol concentration and
   subjective effects of alcohol were also moderated by ghrelin
   administration. Neuroimaging data showed that ghrelin increased the
   alcohol-related signal in the amygdala (P = 0.01) and modulated the
   food-related signal in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (P = 0.01) and
   nucleus accumbens (P = 0.08). These data indicate that ghrelin signaling
   affects alcohol seeking in humans and should be further investigated as
   a promising target for developing novel medications for alcohol use
   disorder.}},

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{Complex cognitive processes, including language, rely on multiple mental
   operations that are carried out by several large-scale functional
   networks in the frontal, temporal, and parietal association cortices of
   the human brain. The central division of cognitive labor is between two
   fronto-parietal bilateral networks: (a) the multiple demand (MD)
   network, which supports executive processes, such as working memory and
   cognitive control, and is engaged by diverse task domains, including
   language, especially when comprehension gets difficult; and (b) the
   default mode network (DMN), which supports introspective processes, such
   as mind wandering, and is active when we are not engaged in processing
   external stimuli. These two networks are strongly dissociated in both
   their functional profiles and their patterns of activity fluctuations
   during naturalistic cognition. Here, we focus on the functional
   relationship between these two networks and a third network: (c) the
   fronto-temporal left-lateralized ``core{''} language network, which is
   selectively recruited by linguistic processing. Is the language network
   distinct and dissociated from both the MD network and the DMN, or is it
   synchronized and integrated with one or both of them? Recent work has
   provided evidence for a dissociation between the language network and
   the MD network. However, the relationship between the language network
   and the DMN is less clear, with some evidence for coordinated activity
   patterns and similar response profiles, perhaps due to the role of both
   in semantic processing. Here we use a novel fMRI approach to examine the
   relationship among the three networks: we measure the strength of
   activations in different language, MD, and DMN regions to functional
   contrasts typically used to identify each network, and then test which
   regions co-vary in their contrast effect sizes across 60 individuals. We
   find that effect sizes correlate strongly within each network (e.g., one
   language region and another language region, or one DMN region and
   another DMN region), but show little or no correlation for region pairs
   across networks (e.g., a language region and a DMN region). Thus, using
   our novel method, we replicate the language/MD network dissociation
   discovered previously with other approaches, and also show that the
   language network is robustly dissociated from the DMN, overall
   suggesting that these three networks contribute to high-level cognition
   in different ways and, perhaps, support distinct computations.
   Inter-individual differences in effect sizes therefore do not simply
   reflect general differences in vascularization or attention, but exhibit
   sensitivity to the functional architecture of the brain. The strength of
   activation in each network can thus be probed separately in studies that
   attempt to link neural variability to behavioral or genetic variability.}},

Abstract = {{Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable
   neurodevelopment disorder. The deficit in working memory is a central
   cognitive impairment in ADHD. The SNAP-25 is a neurotransmitter
   vesicular docking protein whose MnII polymorphism (rs3746544) is located
   in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and known to be linked to ADHD,
   but the underlying mechanism of this polymorphism remains unclear. Using
   a functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping method based on
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of male
   children diagnosed with ADHD, we first investigated the correlation
   between SNAP-25 rs3746544 and FCD hubs. Compared with rs3746544 G-allele
   carriers, TT homozygous, which confers a high risk for ADHD, exhibited
   significantly decreased local and long-range FCD in anterior cingulate
   cortex, and decreased local FCD in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex.
   Moreover, both higher local and long-range FCD could predict better WM
   capacity. The current findings provide new insights into the underlying
   neural mechanisms linking SNAP-25 rs3746544 with the risk for ADHD via
   the endophenotype of brain functional connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to investigate the brain network
   connectivity alterations of intractable unilateral mesial temporal lobe
   epilepsy (MILE) with cognitive dysfunction before and after anterior
   temporal lobectomy (ATL) using resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) study and to further observe the correlation
   between the brain network connectivity with cognitive performance.
   Fourteen patients with unilateral left MTLE before and after ATL were
   compared with thirty healthy controls (HCs) on functional connectivity
   (FC) between resting-state networks (RSNs). The correlation between the
   neuropsychological tests of patients and abnormal FC was further
   investigated. When compared with the HCs, patients before surgery showed
   significantly changed IC between special RSNs. No difference of IC was
   found between each RSN when patients were compared with the HCs after
   surgery. Compared with patients before surgery, patients after surgery
   showed significantly decreased FC between RSNs. Abnormal FC between RSNs
   significantly correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
   scores. Our study suggested that dynamic alterations of RSN after An in
   unilateral MILE may be closely related with seizure generating. However,
   unchanged FC between RSN before and after An may be closely related with
   cognitive performance. The present findings may help us understand the
   feature of brain network alterations in patients with left MTLE who
   became seizure-free following ATL. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Intranasal oxytocin in rhesus monkeys alters brain networks that detect
   social salience and reward}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{10, SI}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In primates, resting state functional neuroimaging (rsfcMRI) has
   identified several large-scale, intrinsic brain networks, including the
   salience network (SN), which is involved in detecting stimulus salience.
   Intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) has been shown to modulate the salience and
   rewarding quality of social stimuli in mammals and numerous studies have
   shown that it can affect the functional connectivity between brain
   regions. Less is known, however, about how these effects unfold over
   time following IN-OT administration. This study used rsfcMRI in
   anesthetized rhesus macaques to track temporal changes in the functional
   connectivity between brain regions involved in the SN, including the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), anterior insula (AI), amygdala (amy),
   and ventral striatum (vstr), lasting 3hr after IN-OT or Placebo (saline)
   administration. We found significant temporal changes in the functional
   connectivity between all regions associated with treatment condition.
   IN-OT increased the functional connectivity between AI\_vstr, ACC\_amy
   (right hemisphere), ACC\_vstr (left hemisphere), and amy\_vstr (right
   hemisphere), but reduced the functional connectivity between ACC\_AI,
   and the AI\_amygdala. These results suggest that IN-OT may dampen
   salience detection in rhesus monkeys, consistent with previous findings
   of reduced social vigilance, while enhancing the connectivity between
   the SN and regions involved in processing reward.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin (OT) modulates social behavior in primates and many other
   vertebrate species. Studies in non-primate animals have demonstrated
   that, in addition to influencing activity within individual brain areas,
   OT influences functional connectivity across networks of areas involved
   in social behavior. Previously, we used fMRI to image brain function in
   human subjects during a dyadic social interaction task following
   administration of either intranasal oxytocin (INOT) or placebo, and
   analyzed the data with a standard general linear model. Here, we conduct
   an extensive re-analysis of these data to explore how OT modulates
   functional connectivity across a neural network that animal studies
   implicate in social behavior. OT induced widespread increases in
   functional connectivity in response to positive social interactions
   among men and widespread decreases in functional connectivity in
   response to negative social interactions among women. Nucleus basalis of
   Meynert, an important regulator of selective attention and motivation
   with a particularly high density of OT receptors, had the largest number
   of OT-modulated connections. Regions known to receive mesolimbic
   dopamine projections such as the nucleus accumbens and lateral septum
   were also hubs for OT effects on functional connectivity. Our results
   suggest that the neural mechanism by which OT influences primate social
   cognition may include changes in patterns of activity across neural
   networks that regulate social behavior in other animals.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol misuse is associated with thalamic dysfunction. The thalamus
   comprises subnuclei that relay and integrate information between
   cortical and subcortical structures. However, it is unclear how the
   subnuclei contribute to thalamic dysfunctions in problem drinking. We
   investigated resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of thalamic
   subregions in 107 nondependent drinkers (57 women), using masks
   delineated by white matter tractography. Thalamus was parceled into
   motor, somatosensory, visual, premotor, frontal association, parietal
   association, and temporal association subregions. Whole-brain linear
   regression, each against Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
   (AUDIT) and positive alcohol expectancy (AE) score with age as a
   covariate, was performed for each seed, for men and women combined, and
   separately. Overall, problem drinking was associated with increased
   thalamic connectivities, whereas AE was associated with a mixed pattern
   of increased and decreased connectivities. Motor, premotor,
   somatosensory, and frontal association thalamic connectivity with
   bilateral caudate head was positively correlated with AUDIT score in men
   and women combined. Connectivity of the right caudate head with frontal
   association and premotor thalamus was also positively correlated with AE
   score in men and women combined. In contrast, motor and premotor
   thalamic connectivity with a number of cortical and subcortical
   structures showed sex differences in the correlation each with AUDIT and
   AE score. In mediation analyses, AE score completely mediated the
   correlation between thalamic caudate connectivity and AUDIT score,
   whereas the model where AE contributed to problem drinking and, in turn,
   altered thalamic caudate connectivity was not supported. To conclude,
   thalamic subregional rsFCs showed both shared and distinct changes and
   sex differences in association with problem drinking and AE. Increased
   thalamic caudate connectivity may contribute to problem drinking via
   enhanced AE. The findings suggest the importance of examining thalamic
   subdivisions and sex in investigating the functional roles of thalamus
   in problem drinking.}},

Abstract = {{Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorders (AUD) are
   two of the most common mental health disorders affecting civilians as
   well as military populations. If left untreated, individuals with
   co-occurring PTSD/AUD are at increased risk for developing other mental
   health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety), physical health problems,
   reduced resiliency and military readiness, and vocational and social
   impairment. Substantia gaps in the treatment of co-occurring PTSD/AUD
   exist and there is a critical need to develop more effective
   pharmacological treatments. The current study addresses this gap in the
   literature by testing the efficacy and safety of doxazosin, a
   long-acting and selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, as compared to
   placebo in reducing PTSD and AUD severity among U.S. military veterans.
   Noradrenergic dysregulation has been implicate in the development and
   maintenance of PTSD and AUD, and pilot studies examining doxazosin in
   PTSD-only or AUD-only samples have shown promise. This is the first
   study, however, to evaluate doxazosin in a comorbid PTSD/AUD sample.
   This paper describes the rationale, design and methodology of a
   randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of doxazosin (16
   mg/day) delivered over 12 weeks among military veterans with current
   PTSD and AUD. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   is applied at pre- and post-treatment to investigate the underlying
   pathophysiology of comorbid PTSD/AUD and identify prognostic indicators
   of treatment outcome. This study is designed to accelerate research on
   co-occurring PTSD/AUD and provide empirical evidence to inform clinical
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Following concussion, adolescents may experience both poor
   inhibitory control and increased depressive symptoms. fMRI research
   suggests that adolescents with major depressive disorder have abnormal
   physiological responses in the frontostriatal pathway, and exhibit
   poorer inhibitory control in the presence of negatively-aroused images.
   The scarcity of information surrounding depression following concussion
   in adolescents makes it difficult to identify patients at risk of
   depression after injury. This is the first study to examine neural
   activity patterns in adolescents with post-concussive depressive
   symptoms.
   Purpose: To explore the effect of depressive symptoms on inhibitory
   control in adolescents with concussion in the presence of emotional
   stimuli using fMRI.
   Methods: Using a prospective cohort design, 30 adolescents diagnosed
   with concussion between 10 and 17 years were recruited. The Children's
   Depression Inventory questionnaire was used to divide participants into
   two groups: average or elevated levels of depressive symptoms.
   Participants completed an Emotional Go/No-Go task involving angry or
   neutral faces in a 3Telsa MRI scanner.
   Results: Eleven participants had elevated depressive symptoms, of which
   72\% were hit in the occipital region of the head at the time of injury.
   fMRI results from the Emotional Go/No-Go task revealed activity patterns
   in the overall sample. Faces activated regions associated with both
   facial and cognitive processing. However, frontal regions that are
   usually associated with inhibitory control were not activated.
   Adolescents with elevated levels of depressive symptoms engaged more
   frontal lobe regions during the task than the average group. They also
   showed a trend towards worse symptoms following MRI scanning.
   Conclusions: Adolescents with elevated depressive symptoms engaged brain
   regions subserving evaluative processing of social interactions. This
   finding provides insight into the role the environment plays in
   contributing to the cognitive demands placed on adolescents recovering
   from concussion.}},

Abstract = {{Cheering for another person is a common experience. Cheering may
   facilitate the cheerer's subjective unity with the cheered-for person,
   potentially involving synchronized activity between the two individuals'
   brains. In the current study, we measured the sensorimotor cortical
   activity of a player and an observer simultaneously during a competitive
   game, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The player performed
   the rock-paper-scissors game against an experimenter while the observer
   either cheered for that player (cheering group) or judged whether the
   player cheated or not (control group). In the cheering group, observers
   reported a significantly stronger sense of unity with the player, and
   exhibited greater sensorimotor activation when observing the player win,
   compared with the control group. The functional connectivity between the
   sensorimotor areas of the player and observer was significantly greater
   in the cheering group, exhibiting a significant correlation with the
   subjective sense of unity between the player and observer. These results
   suggest that cheering enhances the synchronization of the player's and
   the observer's internal states, establishing a sense of unity.}},

Abstract = {{Early deafness results in crossmodal reorganization of the superior
   temporal cortex (STC). Here, we investigated the effect of deafness on
   cognitive processing. Specifically, we studied the reorganization, due
   to deafness and sign language (SL) knowledge, of linguistic and
   nonlinguistic visual working memory (WM). We conducted an fMRI
   experiment in groups that differed in their hearing status and SL
   knowledge: deaf native signers, and hearing native signers, hearing
   nonsigners. Participants performed a 2-back WM task and a control task.
   Stimuli were signs from British Sign Language (BSL) or moving nonsense
   objects in the form of point-light displays. We found characteristic WM
   activations in fronto-parietal regions in all groups. However, deaf
   participants also recruited bilateral posterior STC during the WM task,
   independently of the linguistic content of the stimuli, and showed less
   activation in fronto-parietal regions. Resting-state connectivity
   analysis showed increased connectivity between frontal regions and STC
   in deaf compared to hearing individuals. WM for signs did not elicit
   differential activations, suggesting that SL WM does not rely on
   modality-specific linguistic processing. These findings suggest that WM
   networks are reorganized due to early deafness, and that the
   organization of cognitive networks is shaped by the nature of the
   sensory inputs available during development.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental
   disorders with multiple biological etiologies and highly variable
   symptoms. Using a novel analytical framework that integrates cortex-wide
   MRI markers of vertical (i.e., thickness, tissue contrast) and
   horizontal (i.e., surface area, geodesic distance) cortical
   organization, we could show that a large multicentric cohort of
   individuals with ASD falls into 3 distinctive anatomical subtypes
   (ASD-I: cortical thickening, increased surface area, tissue blurring;
   ASD-II: cortical thinning, decreased distance; ASD-III: increased
   distance). Bootstrap analysis indicated a high consistency of these
   biotypes across thousands of simulations, while analysis of behavioral
   phenotypes and resting-state fMRI showed differential symptom load
   (i.e., Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule; ADOS) and instrinsic
   connectivity anomalies in communication and social-cognition networks.
   Notably, subtyping improved supervised learning approaches predicting
   ADOS score in single subjects, with significantly increased performance
   compared to a subtype-blind approach. The existence of different
   subtypes may reconcile previous results so far not converging on a
   consistent pattern of anatomical anomalies in autism, and possibly
   relate the presence of diverging corticogenic and maturational
   anomalies. The high accuracy for symptom severity prediction indicates
   benefits of MRI biotyping for personalized diagnostics and may guide the
   development of targeted therapeutic strategies.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundRecent research suggests that posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD) is associated with altered amygdala and hippocampal resting-state
   functional connectivity (rsFC). However, less research has examined
   whether Prolonged Exposure (PE), a first line exposure-based treatment
   for PTSD, has the potential to alter resting state neural networks.
   MethodsA total of 24 patients with PTSD and 26 matched trauma-exposed
   healthy controls (TEHCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline. PTSD patients were scanned a
   second time after completing 10-session PE in which patients narrated a
   detailed trauma account (imaginal exposure) and confronted trauma
   reminders (in vivo exposure) to extinguish trauma-related fear
   responses. TEHC were scanned again following a 10-week waiting period.
   Seed regions of interest (ROIs) included centromedial amygdala (CMA),
   basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the hippocampus.
   ResultsPost- versus pretreatment comparisons indicated increased rsFC of
   the BLA and CMA with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and
   hippocampus-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) among patients with PTSD,
   but not among TEHC participants.
   ConclusionsEnhanced amygdala and hippocampus rsFC with prefrontal
   cortical regions following PE could underlie improved capacity for
   inhibition and re-evaluation of threat, and heightened memory encoding
   and retrieval ability, respectively. These findings encourage further
   investigation of this circuitry as a therapeutic target in PTSD.}},

   Persian-English bilinguals: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND LANGUAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{185}},
Pages = {{9-18}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The Persian language can be considered to have a relatively more complex
   and combinatorial morpho-syntax than languages like Chinese and English.
   For example, the Persian verbal system is largely constituted of light
   verb constructions, in which light verbs are combined with specific
   items coming from other grammatical classes to generate entirely new
   verbal entities. This study was designed to examine the mediating effect
   of language inherent properties related to morpho-syntax on activation
   of the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), a brain area involved in
   morpho-syntactic processing. To this end, 20 late Persian-English
   bilinguals were required to covertly generate verbs and nouns from
   object and action pictures, within a cued grammatical context.
   Consistent with predictions, the results of an ROI analysis revealed an
   interaction between task and language in BA 44 of the LIFG and its right
   homologue, with greater activation of this region during the production
   of Persian compared to English verbs. In contrast, there was greater
   activation of the BA 44 during the production of English compared to
   Persian nouns, consistent with the more effortful processing of their
   less proficient second language (English). The findings suggest that
   language-specific properties such as morpho-syntactic complexity can
   modulate the recruitment of Broca's area, over and above the more
   well-documented effects of language proficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies showed that multiple sclerosis (MS) patients might
   experience communicative deficits, specifically in pragmatics (i.e., the
   ability to integrate the context-dependent aspects of language). A
   crucial region for pragmatics is the temporo-parietal junction, in
   particular the so-called Geschwind's area (GA), which is involved in
   high-level language processes, including the comprehension of
   narratives, metaphor, and irony. We evaluated the relationship between
   pragmatic abilities, measured through the Assessment of Pragmatic
   Abilities and Cognitive Substrates (APACS) test, and the functional
   connectivity (FC) of the bilateral GAs, assessed through a seed-based
   analysis of Resting-State fMRI in patients with MS. A positive
   correlation was observed between APACS scores and the FC for both the
   right and the left GA and the paracingulate cortex. Our findings suggest
   that the brain FC for social communication involves connections
   extending over both hemispheres, including right and left GAs and right
   and left paracingulate cortex, possibly impaired in patients with MS.
   This study offers preliminary evidence for future researches enrolling
   also a control sample to explore the involvement of GA in pragmatics in
   neurological disorders as well as in healthy conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Biomarkers of inflammation, including inflammatory cytokines and the
   acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP), are reliably increased in
   a subset of patients with depression, anxiety disorders and
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Administration of innate immune
   stimuli to laboratory subjects and the associated release of
   inflammatory cytokines has been shown to affect brain regions involved
   in fear, anxiety and emotional processing such as the amygdala. However,
   the role of inflammation in altered circuitry involving amygdala and
   other brain regions and its subsequent contribution to symptom severity
   in depression, anxiety disorders and PTSD is only beginning to be
   explored. Herein, medically-stable, currently urnnedicated outpatients
   with a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 48)
   underwent resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) to determine whether
   altered connectivity between the amygdala and whole brain was observed
   in a subset of patients with high inflammation and symptoms of anxiety.
   Whole-brain, voxel-wise functional connectivity analysis of the right
   and left amygdala as a function of inflammation (plasma CRP
   concentrations) revealed that increased CRP predicted decreased
   functional connectivity between right amygdala and left ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (corrected p < 0.05). Amygdala-vmPFC
   connectivity was, in turn, negatively correlated with symptoms of
   anxiety (r = 0.33, df = 46, p = 0.022). In exploratory analyses,
   relationships between low amygdala-vmPFC connectivity and high anxiety
   were only observed in patients with a secondary diagnosis of an anxiety
   disorder or PTSD (r = 0.54 to 0.87, p < 0.05). More work is needed to
   understand the role of inflammation and its effects on amygdala-vmPFC
   circuitry and symptoms of anxiety in MDD patients with co morbid anxiety
   disorders or PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{The TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2 gene-cluster has been implicated in adult smoking.
   Here, we investigated the contribution of individual genes in the
   TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2 cluster in smoking and their association with
   smoking-associated reward processing in adolescence. A meta-analysis of
   TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2 variants and self-reported smoking behaviours was
   performed in four European adolescent cohorts (N = 14,084). The minor
   G-allele of rs2236709, mapping TTC12, was associated with self-reported
   smoking (p = 5.0 x 10(-4)) and higher plasma cotinine levels (p = 7.0 x
   10(-5)). This risk allele was linked to an increased ventral-striatal
   blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response during reward anticipation
   (n = 1,263) and with higher DRD2 gene expression in the striatum (p =
   0.013), but not with TTC12 or ANKK gene expression. These data suggest a
   role for the TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2 gene-cluster in adolescent smoking
   behaviours, provide evidence for the involvement of DRD2 in the early
   stages of addiction and support the notion that genetically-driven
   inter-individual differences in dopaminergic transmission mediate reward
   sensitivity and risk to smoking. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Stress has been proposed to affect cognitive control capacities,
   including working memory (WM) maintenance. This effect may depend on
   variability in stress reactivity and past subjective stress. However, as
   most studies employed between-subjects designs, evidence for
   within-subject stress effects remains scarce. To understand the role of
   infra-individual stress effects on WM, we adopted a within-subject
   design to study how acute stress, variability in stress reactivity, and
   past subjective stress influence behavioral and neural WM mechanisms.
   Thirty-four healthy males performed a WM task during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) in a control versus acute stress condition
   following the Trier Social Stress Test, a validated psychosocial
   stressor method. We tested for stress effects on WM performance and
   related neural activation by associating them with individual acute
   stress responsivity and past subjective stress experience using
   retrospective self-report questionnaires. We found no evidence of an
   effect of acute stress or related stress-reactivity on intra-individual
   WM performance. However, past subjective stress negatively influenced
   acute stress-induced changes to WM. On the neural level, acute stress
   reduced WM-related activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (dlPFC). The observed negative influence of inter-individual variability
   in past subjective stress experience on changes in WM performance,
   suggests that past subjective stress might induce vulnerability for
   impairing effects of acute stress on cognitive functioning. Because
   acute stress reduced WM-related dlPFC activation while WM performance
   remained unaffected, acute stress might boost neural processing
   efficiency in this group of high performing healthy individuals. Our
   study suggests that measures of past subjective stress should be
   considered when studying and interpreting the effects of acute stress on
   cognition.}},

   Growth trajectories of the cerebellar vermis, hemispheres and white
   matter were estimated using piecewise linear regression from 1,656
   youth; of whom 63\% had longitudinal data, totaling 2,914 scans. Four
   cohorts participated, all contained childhood data (age 4-12years); two
   had adolescent data (12-25years). Growth parameters were combined using
   random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Diagnostic differences in growth
   were confined to the corpus medullare (cerebellar white matter). Here,
   the ADHD group showed slower growth in early childhood compared to the
   typically developing group (left corpus medullare z = 2.49, p = .01;
   right z = 2.03, p = .04). This reversed in late childhood, with faster
   growth in ADHD in the left corpus medullare (z = 2.06, p = .04).
   Findings held when gender, intelligence, comorbidity, and
   psychostimulant medication were considered. Discussion: Across four
   independent cohorts, containing predominately longitudinal data, we
   found diagnostic differences in the growth of cerebellar white matter.
   In ADHD, slower white matter growth in early childhood was followed by
   faster growth in late childhood. The findings are consistent with the
   concept of ADHD as a disorder of the brain's structural connections,
   formed partly by developing cortico-cerebellar white matter tracts.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Bipolar disorder is associated with impairments in social
   cognition including the recognition of happy faces. This is accompanied
   by imbalanced cortico-limbic response to emotional faces. We found that
   EPO improved the recognition of happy faces in patients with bipolar
   disorder. This randomized, controlled, longitudinal fMRI study explores
   the neuronal underpinnings of this effect.
   Method: Forty-four patients with bipolar disorder in full or partial
   remission were randomized to eight weekly erythropoietin (EPO; 40 000
   IU) or saline (NaCl 0.9\%) infusions in a double-blind, parallel-group
   design. Participants underwent whole-brain fMRI at 3T, mood ratings and
   blood tests at baseline and week 14. During fMRI, participants viewed
   happy and fearful faces and performed a gender discrimination task.
   Results: Thirty-four patients had complete pre- and post-treatment fMRI
   data (EPO: N = 18, saline: N = 16). Erythropoietin vs. saline increased
   right superior frontal response to happy vs. fearful faces. This
   correlated with improved happiness recognition in the EPO group.
   Erythropoietin also enhanced gender discrimination accuracy for happy
   faces. These effects were not influenced by medication, mood, red blood
   cells or blood pressure.
   Conclusions: Together with previous findings, the present observation
   suggests that increased dorsal prefrontal attention control is a common
   mechanism of EPO-associated improvements across several cognitive
   domains.}},

Abstract = {{Developing a mechanistic insight into the specific brain processes that
   underpin improvement in negative symptoms can help us design novel
   chemical and physical treatments against these unrelenting symptoms. The
   aim of the present study is to explore the longitudinal changes in the
   brain's regional functional efficiency that accompany improvement in
   negative symptoms seen in first-episode patients with schizophrenia when
   treated with antipsychotic for 1year. Forty-seven first-episode patients
   with schizophrenia were scanned at a drug-naive baseline state and
   followed up for 1year to identify negative symptom responders (Rn) and
   non-responders (NRn). Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations
   (fALFF) and Granger analysis of effective connectivity (EC) were used to
   examine the different patterns of regional function and connectivity
   between Rn and NRn during the 1year follow-up. Increase of fALFF in the
   left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and increase of EC from the left STG
   to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was found in Rn compared
   to NRn. We further validated that the identified changes in fALFF/EC of
   STG occur specifically in relation to negative symptoms only (i.e., not
   pseudo-specific in relation to positive, extrapyramidal or depressive
   symptoms), and occur irrespective of arbitrary clinical categorization
   of treatment response. An increase in fALFF in the precuneus and the
   inferior parietal lobule, and a decrease in EC from the left STG to the
   occipital cortex, were also found at the 1year follow-up irrespective of
   improvement in negative symptoms. Interventions that improve the
   functional efficiency of left STG and its prefrontal connectivity may
   show efficacy in alleviating negative symptoms in first-episode
   schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Facial and vocal expressions are essential modalities mediating the
   perception of emotion and social communication. Nonetheless, currently
   little is known about how emotion perception and its neural substrates
   differ across facial expression and vocal prosody. To clarify this
   issue, functional MRI scans were acquired in Study 1, in which
   participants were asked to discriminate the valence of emotional
   expression (angry, happy or neutral) from facial, vocal, or bimodal
   stimuli. In Study 2, we used an affective priming task (unimodal
   materials as primers and bimodal materials as target) and participants
   were asked to rate the intensity, valence, and arousal of the targets.
   Study 1 showed higher accuracy and shorter response latencies in the
   facial than in the vocal modality for a happy expression. Whole-brain
   analysis showed enhanced activation during facial compared to vocal
   emotions in the inferior temporal-occipital regions. Region of interest
   analysis showed a higher percentage signal change for facial than for
   vocal anger in the superior temporal sulcus. Study 2 showed that facial
   relative to vocal priming of anger had a greater influence on perceived
   emotion for bimodal targets, irrespective of the target valence. These
   findings suggest that facial expression is associated with enhanced
   emotion perception compared to equivalent vocal prosodies.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Stigmatization in society carries a high risk for
   development of psychopathology. Transgender persons are at particularly
   high risk for such stigmatization and social rejection by others.
   However, the neural correlates of ostracism in this group have not been
   captured.
   Method. Twenty transgender men (TM, female-to-male) and 19 transgender
   women (TW, male-to-female) already living in their gender identity and
   20 cisgender men (CM) and 20 cisgender women (CW) completed a cyberball
   task assessing both exclusion and re-inclusion during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Results. During psychosocial stress between-group differences were found
   in the dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Patterns were consistent with sex assigned
   at birth, i.e. CW showed greater activation in dorsal ACC and IFG
   relative to CM and TW. During re-inclusion, transgender persons showed
   greater ventral ACC activity relative to CW, possibly indicating
   persistent feelings of exclusion. Functional connectivity analyses
   supported these findings but showed a particularly altered functional
   connectivity between ACC and lateral prefrontal cortex in TM, which may
   suggest reduced emotional regulation to the ostracism experience in this
   group. Depressive symptoms or hormonal levels were not associated with
   these findings.
   Conclusion. The results bear implications for the role of social
   exclusion in development of mental health problems in socially
   marginalized groups.}},

Abstract = {{In the research field of anxiety, previous studies generally focus on
   emotional responses following threat. A recent model of anxiety proposes
   that altered anticipation prior to uncertain threat is related with the
   development of anxiety. Behavioral findings have built the relationship
   between anxiety and distinct anticipatory processes including attention,
   estimation of threat, and emotional responses. However, few studies have
   characterized the brain organization underlying anticipation of
   uncertain threat and its role in anxiety. In the present study, we used
   an emotional anticipation paradigm with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to examine the aforementioned topics by employing brain
   activation and general psychophysiological interactions (gPPI) analysis.
   In the activation analysis, we found that high trait anxious individuals
   showed significantly increased activation in the thalamus, middle
   temporal gyrus (MTG), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), as well
   as decreased activation in the precuneus, during anticipation of
   uncertain threat compared to the certain condition. In the gPPI
   analysis, the key regions including the amygdala, dmPFC, and precuneus
   showed altered connections with distributed brain areas including the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (dlPFC), inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), insula, para-hippocampus gyrus
   (PHA), thalamus, and MTG involved in anticipation of uncertain threat in
   anxious individuals. Taken together, our findings indicate that during
   the anticipation of uncertain threat, anxious individuals showed altered
   activations and functional connectivity in widely distributed brain
   areas, which may be critical for abnormal perception, estimation, and
   emotion reactions during the anticipation of uncertain threat.}},

Abstract = {{Social cognition develops in the context of reciprocal social
   interaction. However, most neuroimaging studies of mentalizing have used
   noninteractive tasks that may fail to capture important aspects of
   real-world mentalizing. In adults, social-interactive context modulates
   activity in regions linked to social cognition and reward, but few
   interactive studies have been done with children. The current fMRI study
   examines children aged 8-12 using a novel paradigm in which children
   believed they were interacting online with a peer. We compared mental
   and non-mental state reasoning about a live partner (Peer) versus a
   story character (Character), testing the effects of mentalizing and
   social interaction in a 2 x 2 design. Mental versus Non-Mental reasoning
   engaged regions identified in prior mentalizing studies, including the
   temporoparietal junction, superior temporal sulcus, and dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex. Moreover, peer interaction, even in conditions
   without explicit mentalizing demands, activated many of the same
   mentalizing regions. Peer interaction also activated areas outside the
   traditional mentalizing network, including the reward system. Our
   results demonstrate that social interaction engages multiple neural
   systems during middle childhood and contribute further evidence that
   social-interactive paradigms are needed to fully capture how the brain
   supports social processing in the real world.}},

Abstract = {{Fundamental theories of human cognition have long posited that the
   short-term maintenance of actions is supported by one of the ``core
   knowledge{''} systems of human visual cognition, yet its neural
   substrates are still not well understood. In particular, it is unclear
   whether the visual short-term memory (VSTM) of actions has distinct
   neural substrates or, as proposed by the spatio-object architecture of
   VSTM, shares them with VSTM of objects and spatial locations. In two
   experiments, we tested these two competing hypotheses by directly
   contrasting the neural substrates for VSTM of actions with those for
   objects and locations. Our results showed that the bilateral middle
   temporal cortex (MT) was specifically involved in VSTM of actions
   because its activation and its functional connectivity with the
   frontal-parietal network (FPN) were only modulated by the memory load of
   actions, but not by that of objects/agents or locations. Moreover, the
   brain regions involved in the maintenance of spatial location
   information (i.e., superior parietal lobule, SPL) was also recruited
   during the maintenance of actions, consistent with the temporal-spatial
   nature of actions. Meanwhile, the frontoparietal network (FPN) was
   commonly involved in all types of VSTM and showed flexible functional
   connectivity with the domain-specific regions, depending on the current
   working memory tasks. Together, our results provide clear evidence for a
   distinct neural system for maintaining actions in VSTM, which supports
   the core knowledge system theory and the domain-specific and
   domain-general architectures of VSTM.}},

Abstract = {{In social interactions, we rely on nonverbal cues like gaze direction to
   understand the behavior of others. How we react to these cues is
   affected by whether they are believed to originate from an entity with a
   mind, capable of having internal states (i.e., mind perception). While
   prior work has established a set of neural regions linked to
   social-cognitive processes like mind perception, the degree to which
   activation within this network relates to performance in subsequent
   social-cognitive tasks remains unclear. In the current study,
   participants performed a mind perception task (i.e., judging the
   likelihood that faces, varying in physical human-likeness, have internal
   states) while event-related fMRI was collected. Afterwards, participants
   performed a social attention task outside the scanner, during which they
   were cued by the gaze of the same faces that they previously judged
   within the mind perception task. Parametric analyses of the fMRI data
   revealed that activity within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was
   related to both mind ratings inside the scanner and gaze-cueing
   performance outside the scanner. In addition, other social brain regions
   were related to gaze-cueing performance, including frontal areas like
   the left insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and inferior frontal
   gyrus, as well as temporal areas like the left temporo-parietal junction
   and bilateral temporal gyri. The findings suggest that functions
   subserved by the vmPFC are relevant to both mind perception and social
   attention, implicating a role of vmPFC in the top-down modulation of
   low-level social-cognitive processes.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive control is a framework for understanding the
   neuropsychological processes that underlie the successful completion of
   everyday tasks. Only recently has research in this area investigated
   motivational contributions to control allocation. An important gap in
   our understanding is the way in which intrinsic rewards associated with
   a task motivate the sustained allocation of control. To address this
   issue, we draw on flow theory, which predicts that a balance between
   task difficulty and individual ability results in the highest levels of
   intrinsic reward. In three behavioral and one functional magnetic
   resonance imaging studies, we used a naturalistic and open-source video
   game stimulus to show that changes in the balance between task
   difficulty and an individual's ability to perform the task resulted in
   different levels of intrinsic reward, which is associated with different
   brain states. Specifically, psychophysiological interaction analyses
   show that high levels of intrinsic reward associated with a balance
   between task difficulty and individual ability are associated with
   increased functional connectivity between key structures within
   cognitive control and reward networks. By comparison, a mismatch between
   task difficulty and individual ability is associated with lower levels
   of intrinsic reward and corresponds to increased activity within the
   default mode network. These results suggest that intrinsic reward
   motivates cognitive control allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Language production and cognitive control are complex processes that
   involve distinct yet interacting brain networks. However, the extent to
   which these processes interact and their neural bases have not been
   thoroughly examined. Here, we investigated the neural and behavioral
   bases of language production and cognitive control via a phonological
   go/no-go picture-naming task. Naming difficulty and cognitive control
   demands (i.e., conflict monitoring and response inhibition) were
   manipulated by varying the proportion of naming trials (go trials) and
   inhibition trials (no-go trials) across task runs. The results
   demonstrated that as task demands increased, participants' behavioral
   performance declined (i.e., longer reaction times on naming trials, more
   commission errors on inhibition trials) whereas brain activation
   generally increased. Increased activation was found not only within the
   language network but also in domain-general control regions.
   Additionally, right superior and inferior frontal and left supramarginal
   gyri were sensitive to increased task difficulty during both language
   production and response inhibition. We also found both positive and
   negative brain-behavior correlations. Most notably, increased activation
   in sensorimotor regions, such as precentral and postcentral gyri, was
   associated with better behavioral performance, in both successful
   picture naming and successful inhibition. Moreover, comparing the
   strength of correlations across conditions indicated that the
   brain-behavior correlations in sensorimotor regions that were associated
   with improved performance became stronger as task demands increased.
   Overall, our results suggest that cognitive control demands affect
   language production, and that successfully coping with increases in task
   difficulty relies on both language-specific and domain-general cognitive
   control regions.}},

   health outcomes, as well as stress resilience. The purpose of the
   current study was to identify potential neural substrate mechanisms
   underlying individual differences in aesthetic engagement and reported
   proneness to aesthetic chill.
   Methods: Data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) 1200 Subjects
   Release were utilized. Resting-state fMRI connectivity was extracted for
   361 regions in the brain including cortical, subcortical and cerebellar
   regions for each participant, using participant-specific segmentation
   and parcellation of subcortical gray matter nuclei and a network-based
   statistics analytical approach. The Aesthetic Interests subcluster of
   the Openness to Experience scale (NEO-Five Factor Inventory; NEO-FFI)
   was used to characterize individual differences in aesthetic engagement
   and chill.
   Results: Participants reporting higher aesthetic engagement,
   particularly proneness to aesthetic chill responses, exhibited
   significantly higher connectivity between the default network and
   sensory and motor cortices, higher connectivity between the ventral
   default and salience networks, and decreased connectivity between the
   cerebellum and somatomotor cortex.
   Conclusions: Current findings suggest that greater integration of the
   default mode network, involving processing of internal narrative, with
   neural representations of sensory perception and salience detection may
   be a mechanism underlying individual differences in aesthetic
   engagement. Thus, these individual differences may reflect general
   integration of environmental perception with internal emotional
   experience, which in turn may facilitate comfort with novelty,
   self-regulation, and positive adaptation to potentially stressful
   experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Current theories of pre-attentive deviant detection postulate that
   before the Superior Temporal Cortex (STC) detects a change, the Inferior
   Frontal Cortex (IFC) engages in stimulus analysis, which is particularly
   critical for ambiguous deviations (e.g., deviant preceded by a short
   train of standards). These theories rest on the assumption that IFC and
   STC are functionally connected, which has only been supported by
   correlational brain imaging studies. We examined this functional
   connectivity assumption by applying Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
   (TMS) to disrupt IFC function, while measuring the later STC mismatch
   response with the event-related optical signal (EROS). EROS can localize
   brain activity in both spatial and temporal dimensions via measurement
   of optical property changes associated with neuronal activity, and is
   inert to the electromagnetic interference produced by TMS. Specifically,
   the STC mismatch response at 120-180 ms elicited by a deviant preceded
   by a short standard train when IFC TMS was applied at 80 ms was compared
   with the STC mismatch responses in temporal control (TMS with 200 ms
   delay), spatial control (sham TMS at vertex), auditory control (TMS
   pulse noise only), and cognitive control (deviant preceded by a long
   standard train) conditions. The STC mismatch response to deviants
   preceded by the short train was abolished by TMS of the IFC at 80 ms,
   while the STC responses remained intact in all other control conditions.
   These results confirm the involvement of the IFC in the STC mismatch
   response and support a functional connection between IFC and STC.}},

Abstract = {{According to existing neuroimaging studies of social cognition,
   individuals use knowledge about themselves to infer the mental states of
   others and to mentalize in a different way when the other is perceived
   to be similar versus dissimilar to oneself. In this study, we examined
   whether adolescent boys make mental state inferences for their online
   game characters and whether adolescents who were diagnosed as addicted
   to the internet game perceived their personal game character to be
   similar to themselves. Twelve internet-addicted adolescents and fifteen
   adolescents without addiction reported whether short phrases described
   themselves, a well-known historical person, or their own game character
   while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Different patterns of activity emerged for adolescents with internet
   game addiction compared to healthy adolescents when they were thinking
   about themselves, another person, and their game characters.
   Specifically, when addicted adolescents were thinking about their own
   game characters, more global and significant medial prefrontal (MPFC)
   and anterior cingulate (ACC) activations were observed, than even when
   compared to thinking about themselves. The ACC activation was correlated
   with the symptom severity. The activation patterns demonstrated that
   addicted adolescents were most attached to their game characters and
   equated their game characters to human.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to identify the neuroanatomical substrates and white

   the association between gray matter and structural connectivity. A total
   of 36 children including patients with ASD and healthy controls between

   structural MRI and functional MRI were performed and analyzed using
   voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics. The
   relationship between gray matter volume and structural connectivity was
   generated using Pearson correlation analysis. Voxel-based morphometry
   analysis showed significantly reduced areas of gray matter in the left
   cerebellum. Tract-based spatial statistics analysis showed white matter
   abnormalities in several distinct clusters within the right inferior
   frontal gyrus (opercular part), the left inferior parietal lobule, and
   the right mentary motor area. Neither ASD nor healthy controls showed a
   significant correlation between gray matter volume and white matter
   integrity. Our study confirmed the presence of several structural and
   regional abnormalities in ASD children. These findings suggest that
   there are significant differences in some brain regions in children with
   autism relative to healthy children, but no association between them.}},

Volume = {{373}},

Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Individual people differ in their ability to reason, solve problems,
   think abstractly, plan and learn. A reliable measure of this general
   ability, also known as intelligence, can be derived from scores across a
   diverse set of cognitive tasks. There is great interest in understanding
   the neural underpinnings of individual differences in intelligence,
   because it is the single best predictor of long-term life success. The
   most replicated neural correlate of human intelligence to date is total
   brain volume; however, this coarse morphometric correlate says little
   about function. Here, we ask whether measurements of the activity of the
   resting brain (resting-state fMRI) might also carry information about
   intelligence. We used the final release of the Young Adult Human
   Connectome Project (N = 884 subjects after exclusions), providing a full
   hour of resting-state fMRI per subject; controlled for gender, age and
   brain volume; and derived a reliable estimate of general intelligence
   from scores on multiple cognitive tasks. Using a cross-validated
   predictive framework, we predicted 20\% of the variance in general
   intelligence in the sampled population from their resting-state
   connectivity matrices. Interestingly, no single anatomical structure or
   network was responsible or necessary for this prediction, which instead
   relied on redundant information distributed across the brain.
   This article is part of the theme issue `Causes and consequences of
   individual differences in cognitive abilities'.}},

Title = {{Oxytocin Facilitates Empathic- and Self-embarrassment Ratings by
   Attenuating Amygdala and Anterior Insula Responses}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin has been reported to enhance
   emotional empathy in association with reduced amygdala activation,
   although to date studies have not investigated empathy for individuals
   expressing self-conscious, moral emotions which engage mentalizing as
   well as emotion processing networks. In the current randomized,
   double-blind placebo controlled functional MRI experiment in 70 male and
   female subjects we have therefore investigated the effects of intranasal
   oxytocin (40 IU) on behavioral and neural responses to embarrassment
   experienced by others or by self. Results showed that oxytocin
   significantly increased ratings of both empathic and self-embarrassment
   and concomitantly decreased skin conductance response, activation in the
   right amygdala and insula but not in the medial prefrontal cortex. The
   amygdala effects of oxytocin were associated with the magnitude of the
   skin conductance response and trait anxiety scores. Overall our results
   demonstrate that oxytocin increases ratings of self- and other
   embarrassment and that this is associated with reduced physiological
   arousal and activity in neural circuits involved in emotional arousal.
   The neural effects of oxytocin were more pronounced stronger in
   individuals with high trait anxiety suggesting that it may particularly
   reduce their anxiety in embarrassing situations.}},

Title = {{Human VMPFC encodes early signatures of confidence in perceptual
   decisions}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{Choice confidence, an individual's internal estimate of judgment
   accuracy, plays a critical role in adaptive behaviour, yet its neural
   representations during decision formation remain underexplored. Here, we
   recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI while participants performed a direction
   discrimination task and rated their confidence on each trial. Using
   multivariate single-trial discriminant analysis of the EEG, we
   identified a stimulus-independent component encoding confidence, which
   appeared prior to subjects' explicit choice and confidence report, and
   was consistent with a confidence measure predicted by an
   accumulation-to-bound model of decision-making. Importantly,
   trial-to-trial variability in this electrophysiologically-derived
   confidence signal was uniquely associated with fMRI responses in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a region not typically
   associated with confidence for perceptual decisions. Furthermore,
   activity in the VMPFC was functionally coupled with regions of the

Title = {{Brain responses to different types of salience in antipsychotic naive
   first episode psychosis: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{Abnormal salience processing has been suggested to contribute to the
   formation of positive psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and related
   conditions. Previous research utilising reward learning or anticipation
   paradigms has demonstrated cortical and subcortical abnormalities in
   people with psychosis, specifically in the prefrontal cortex, the
   dopaminergic midbrain and the striatum. In these paradigms, reward
   prediction errors attribute motivational salience to stimuli. However,
   little is known about possible abnormalities across different forms of
   salience processing in psychosis patients, and whether any such
   abnormalities involve the dopaminergic midbrain. The aim of our study
   was, therefore, to investigate possible alterations in psychosis in
   neural activity in response to various forms of salience: novelty,
   negative emotion, targetness (task-driven salience) and
   rareness/deviance. We studied 14 antipsychotic naive participants with
   first episode psychosis, and 37 healthy volunteers. During fMRI
   scanning, participants performed a visual oddball task containing these
   four forms of salience. Psychosis patients showed abnormally reduced
   signalling in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SNA/TA) for
   novelty, negative emotional salience and targetness; reduced striatal
   and occipital (lingual gyrus) signalling to novelty and negative
   emotional salience, reduced signalling in the amygdala, anterior
   cingulate cortex and parahippocamal gyrus to negative emotional
   salience, and reduced cerebellar signalling to novelty and negative
   emotional salience. Our results indicate alterations of several forms of
   salience processing in patients with psychosis in the midbrain SNA/TA,
   with additional subcortical and cortical regions also showing
   alterations in salience signalling, the exact pattern of alterations
   depending on the form of salience in question.}},

   Resting State}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{The current study aims to explore the functional changes of the amygdala
   in patients with euthymic Bipolar Disorder (BD) using resting state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI). Twenty-one euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and 28
   healthy controls participated in this study. Two of the euthymic
   patients with BD and three of the healthy controls were excluded due to
   excessive head motion. We found that patients with euthymia (38.79 +/-
   12.03) show higher fALFF (fractional Amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuation) value of the amygdala (t = 2.076, P = 0.044), and lower
   functional connectivity between the amygdala and supplementary motor
   area (p < 0.01, GRF corrected) than healthy controls (33.40 +/- 8.21).
   However, euthymic patients did not show a differential activity in ReHo
   (Regional Homogeneity) and gray matter of the amygdala region as
   compared to healthy controls. Thus, despite the absence of clinical
   symptoms in euthymic patients with BD, the amygdala functional activity
   and its connectivity to other brain regions remain altered. Further
   investigation of negative emotions and social functioning in euthymic
   patients with BD are needed and can help pave the way for a better
   understanding of BD psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{The placebo response is universally observed in clinical trials of pain
   treatments, yet the individual characteristics rendering a patient a
   `placebo responder' remain unclear. Here, in chronic back pain patients,
   we demonstrate using MRI and fMRI that the response to placebo
   `analgesic' pills depends on brain structure and function. Subcortical
   limbic volume asymmetry, sensorimotor cortical thickness, and functional
   coupling of prefrontal regions, anterior cingulate, and periaqueductal
   gray were predictive of response. These neural traits were present
   before exposure to the pill and most remained stable across treatment
   and washout periods. Further, psychological traits, including
   interoceptive awareness and openness, were also predictive of the
   magnitude of response. These results shed light on psychological,
   neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological principles determining placebo
   response in RCTs in chronic pain patients, and they suggest that the
   long-term beneficial effects of placebo, as observed in clinical
   settings, are partially predictable.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Awe differs from common positive emotions, triggered by vast stimuli,
   and characterized by a need for accommodation (NFA). Although studies
   have revealed the downstream effects of awe experience, little is known
   about the neural basis of dispositional awe. In the current study, we
   determined the neural correlation of dispositional awe by using
   voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in 42 young healthy adults, as measured by
   the Dispositional Positive Emotion Scale (DPES). Results revealed that
   the dispositional awe score was negatively associated with the regional
   gray matter volume (rGMV) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
   middle/posterior cingulate cortex (MCC/PCC) and middle temporal gyrus
   (MTG). These results suggest that individual differences in
   dispositional awe involve multiple brain regions related to attention,
   conscious self-regulation, cognitive control and social emotion. This
   study is the first to provide evidence for the structural neural basis
   of individual differences in dispositional awe.}},

Title = {{Increased inflammation and brain glutamate define a subtype of
   depression with decreased regional homogeneity, impaired network
   integrity, and anhedonia}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Combined increases in peripheral inflammation and brain glutamate may
   identify a subtype of depression with distinct neuroimaging signatures.
   Two contrasting subgroups of depressed subjects-with and without
   combined elevations in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and basal ganglia
   glutamate (high and low CRP-Glu, respectively) were identified by
   hierarchical clustering using plasma CRP (indexing peripheral
   inflammation) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-based
   measurement of left basal ganglia glutamate. High CRP-Glu group status
   was associated with greater severity of anhedonia and cognitive and
   motor slowing. Local-and network-level measures of functional integrity
   were determined using brain oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)-oscillatory
   activity and graph theory. Greater decreases in concordance of
   oscillatory activity between neighboring voxels (Regional Homogeneity
   `ReHo', p < 0.01) within the MRS volume-of-interest was associated with
   the High CRP-Glu subgroup. Using brain-wide, CRP-Glu ReHo contrast maps,
   a covariance network of 41 regions-of-interest (ROIs) with similar ReHo
   decreases was identified in the High CRP-Glu group and was located to
   brain structures previously implicated in depression. The 41-ROI network
   was further decomposed into four subnetworks. ReHo decreases within
   Subnetwork4-comprised of reward processing regions -was associated with
   anhedonia. Subnetwork4 ReHo also predicted decreased network integrity,
   which mediated the link between local ReHo and anhedonia in the Low but
   not High CRP-Glu group. These findings suggest that decreased ReHo and
   related disruptions in network integrity may reflect toxic effects of
   inflammation-induced increases in extrasynaptic glutamate signaling.
   Moreover, local BOLD oscillatory activity as reflected in ReHo might be
   a useful measure of target-engagement in the brain for treatment of
   inflammation-induced behaviors.}},

Title = {{Neuroimaging Metrics of Drug and Food Processing in Cocaine-Dependence,
   as a Function of Psychopathic Traits and Substance Use Severity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies suggest that psychopathic traits commonly present as
   comorbid with substance use disorders. Moreover, neuroimaging and
   psychometric findings suggest that psychopathic traits may predispose
   individuals to a sensitized reward response to drugs. Given that
   substance use disorders are characterized by a neurocognitive bias
   toward drug-reward relative to non-drug reward, it is possible that
   heightened psychopathic characteristics may further predispose to this
   processing bias. To evaluate this possibility, we assessed psychopathic
   traits (measured using the PCL-R; Hare, 2003) in 105
   probationers/parolees and evaluated the relationship between PCL-R
   scores, lifetime duration of drug use, and biases in neural response to
   drug-compared to food-related videos. Psychopathic traits (potentially
   driven by interpersonal/affective traits) were positively correlated
   with drug > food reactivity within the right insula and left amygdala.
   In addition, psychopathic traits modulated the relationship between drug
   use and drug > food reactivity within the left dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex, right insula, and left caudate nucleus. Specifically, lifetime
   duration of drug use correlated positively with drug > food reactivity
   in participants with lower levels of psychopathic traits and correlated
   negatively with drug > food reactivity in individuals with higher levels
   of psychopathic traits. These results help reconcile prior studies on
   psychopathy and drug-stimulus processing and provide neurocognitive
   support for the notion that psychopathic traits serve as an underlying
   risk factor for substance use disorders. These results suggest that
   different treatment regimens for substance abuse for individuals with
   higher or lower levels of psychopathy may be beneficial and suggest that
   reduction of neurocognitive biases to drug-related stimuli may offer
   useful targets for future treatment protocols.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{This meta-analysis (k = 48, N = 2196) examined the effect of
   transcranial direct current brain stimulation (tDCS) applied to the
   prefrontal cortex on a variety of social behaviors, including
   aggression, overeating, impulsivity, bias, honesty, and risk-taking.
   tDCS showed an overall significant effect on reducing undesirable
   behaviors, with an average effect size of d = -0.20. tDCS was most
   effective at reducing risk-taking behavior, bias, and overeating. tDCS
   did not affect aggression, impulsivity, or dishonesty. We examined
   moderators such as brain region of interest, online vs offline
   stimulation, within- vs between-subjects designs, dose, and duration,
   but none showed significant interactions. We also tested for potential
   publication bias using two different tools, which indicated signs of
   publication bias in the literature. After correcting for potential
   publication bias, the effect of tDCS was still significant, but the size
   was reduced (d = -0.10). These findings suggest the presence of tDCS
   studies with null findings outside of the published literature. Taken
   together, these results suggest that although tDCS can reduce
   undesirable behaviors, researchers should consider the types of
   behaviors they measure and use strategies to ensure sufficient power to
   detect a possible effect of tDCS on social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Neural mechanisms that mediate dynamic social interactions remain
   understudied despite their evolutionary significance. The interactive
   brain hypothesis proposes that interactive social cues are processed by
   dedicated brain substrates and provides a general theoretical framework
   for investigating the underlying neural mechanisms of social
   interaction. We test the specific case of this hypothesis proposing that
   canonical language areas are upregulated and dynamically coupled across
   brains during social interactions based on talking and listening.
   Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was employed to acquire
   simultaneous deoxyhemoglobin (deOxyHb) signals of the brain on partners
   who alternated between speaking and listening while doing an Object
   Naming \& Description task with and without interaction in a natural
   setting. Comparison of interactive and non-interactive conditions
   confirmed an increase in neural activity associated with Wernicke's area
   including the superior temporal gyrus (STG) during interaction (P =
   0.04). However, the hypothesis was not supported for Broca's area.
   Cross-brain coherence determined by wavelet analyses of signals
   originating from the STG and the subcentral area was greater during
   interaction than non-interaction (P < 0.01). In support of the
   interactive brain hypothesis these findings suggest a dynamically
   coupled cross-brain neural mechanism dedicated to pathways that share
   interpersonal information.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a developmental period associated with increased
   health-risk behaviors and unique sensitivity to the input from the
   social context, paralleled by major changes in the developing brain.
   Peer presence increases adolescent risk taking, associated with greater
   reward-related activity, while parental presence decreases risk taking,
   associated with decreased reward-related activity and increased
   cognitive control. Yet the effects specific to peers and parents are
   still unknown. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study compared within-person peer and parent influences on risky
   decision-making during adolescence (ages 12-15 years; N = 56).
   Participants completed the Yellow Light Game (YLG), a computerized
   driving task, during which they could make safe or risky decisions, in
   the presence of a peer and their parent. Behavioral findings revealed no
   effects of social context on risk taking. At the neural level, a
   collection of affective, social and cognitive regions {[}ventral
   striatum (VS), temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)] was more active during decision-making with
   peers than parents. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses
   showed greater coupling between affective, social and cognitive control
   regions (VS-insula, VS-TPJ) during decision-making with parents than
   peers. These findings highlight the complex nature of social influence
   processes in peer and parent contexts, and contribute to our
   understanding of the opportunities and vulnerabilities associated with
   adolescent social sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{The continuous balancing of the risks and benefits of exploiting known
   options or exploring new opportunities is essential to human life. We
   forage for new opportunities when they are deemed to be more attractive
   than the available option, but this decision to forage also entails
   costs. People differ in their propensity to exploit or forage, and both
   the social circumstances and our individual value orientations are
   likely influences. Here, participants made foraging decisions for
   themselves and for a charity of their choice in two paradigms: one that
   features two distinct modes of decision-making (foraging vs classical
   economic decision-making) and one which is more directly related to the
   classical animal foraging and ethology literature. Across both
   paradigms, individuals who possessed a stronger self-focused value
   orientation obtained more rewards when they were allowed to forage for
   themselves rather than the charity. Neuroimaging during the tasks
   revealed that this effect was associated with activity in the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in that more self-focused individuals
   showed lower activity in dACC for the self-condition relative to the
   other condition. This evidence reveals a dynamic interplay between
   foraging outcomes and the higher-order value system of individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Sibling relationships have been linked to adolescent externalizing
   behaviors, but the neurobiological factors that underlie this
   association have not been identified. This study investigated sibling
   closeness and birth order as a predictor of adolescent externalizing
   behavior via differences in neural processes during safe
   decision-making. A total of 77 adolescents (range = 12-15 years, M-age =
   13.45 years, 40 females) completed a computerized driving task during a
   functional MRI scan. Results showed that adolescents' perceptions of
   sibling closeness were associated with greater neural activation in the
   anterior insula, ventral striatum and left ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex when making safe decisions, suggesting that the quality of
   sibling relationships modulates adolescent neurocognition even without
   being present. Furthermore, moderated mediation analyses revealed that
   higher sibling closeness was associated with lower externalizing
   behavior via left anterior insula activation during safe
   decision-making, but only for adolescents without older siblings (i.e.
   eldest children) compared to adolescents who had multiple older
   siblings. Importantly, these findings persisted above and beyond
   parental and peer closeness and sibling characteristics (i.e. sex,
   relatedness, birth order), highlighting the significant influence of
   sibling relationships on adolescent externalizing behavior through the

   characteristic, is influenced by different types of social support (i.e.
   emotional and instrumental support) through the brain activity
   associated with loneliness. To explore these questions, data of
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) of 92
   healthy participants were analyzed. We identified loneliness-related
   brain regions by correlating participants' loneliness scores with
   amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of R-fMRI data. We then
   conducted mediation analyses to test whether the negative relation
   between each type of social support and loneliness was explained via the
   neural activity in the loneliness-related brain regions. The results
   showed that loneliness was positively related to the mean ALFF value
   within right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). In addition, the negative
   relation between emotional support and loneliness was explained by a
   decrease in the spontaneous neural activity within right ITG but this
   pattern was not observed for instrumental support. These results suggest
   the importance of social information processing on trait loneliness and
   highlight the need to differentiate the functions of different types of
   social support on mental health from a neural perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To reduce rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
   unwanted pregnancy among adolescents, it is critical to investigate
   brain connectivity that may underlie adolescents' sexual health
   decision-making in the context of intercourse. This study explored
   relationships between adolescent condom use frequency and the brain's
   resting-state functional connectivity, to identify differential patterns
   of social-affective processing among sexually active youth. Methods In
   this study, N = 143 sexually active adolescents (68.5\% male, M-age =
   16.2 years, SD = 1.06) completed magnetic resonance imaging and reported
   past 3-month frequency of condom use. Resting-state connectivity, seeded
   on a social region of the brain, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), was
   assessed to determine its correspondence with protected sex (condom
   use). Results Condom use was associated with positive connectivity
   between the left TPJ and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). This
   relationship was observed in adolescent males only; no connectivity
   differences were observed with adolescent females. Conclusions This
   study reflects functional synchrony between nodes of the ``social
   brain,{''} including the TPJ, and a region of planfulness and control,
   the IFG. The relationship between these regions suggests that
   adolescents who have more coordinated systems of communication between
   these critical components of the brain are more likely to be successful
   in planning and engaging in safer sexual decision-making; for young
   males, this differentiated more frequent from less frequent condom use.
   In turn, interventions designed to reduce STIs/human immunodeficiency
   virus may benefit from targeting social-planfulness dimensions to help
   youth implement safer sex behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Neural substrates of loss of control (LOC) eating are
   undercharacterized. We aimed to model intermittent access to food to
   elicit disinhibited eating in youth undergoing neuroimaging, given
   evidence that restricted food access may increase subsequent food intake
   via enhancing reward value of food and diminishing eating-related
   self-control. Methods Participants were 18 preadolescents (aged 9-12
   years) who were overweight/obese with recent LOC eating (OW-LOC; n = 6);
   overweight/obese with no history of LOC eating (OW-CON; n = 5); or
   non-overweight with no history of LOC eating (NW-CON; n = 7).
   Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a
   simulated food restriction paradigm in which they were alternately given
   restricted or unrestricted access to milkshake solutions. Results There
   were no significant main effects of restricted versus unrestricted
   access to milkshake flavors. Group main effects revealed increased
   activation for OW-LOC relative to OW-CON in areas related to attentional
   processes (right middle frontal gyrus), inhibitory control/attentional
   shifts (right and left cuneus), and emotion regulation (left cingulate
   gyrus); and for OW-LOC relative to NW-CON in areas related to response
   inhibition (right inferior frontal gyrus). Significant block type x
   group interaction effects were found for the right middle frontal gyrus,
   left cingulate gyrus, and left cuneus, but these appeared to be
   accounted for primarily by group. Discussion There were clear group
   differences in neural activity in brain regions related to
   self-regulation during a food restriction paradigm. Elevations in these
   regions among OW-LOC relative to OW-CON and NW-CON, respectively, may
   suggest that youth with LOC eating expended more cognitive effort to
   regulate ingestive behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this fMRI study were two-fold. The first objective of the
   study was to verify whether the findings associated with a previous fMRI
   study could be replicated in which a novel event-related experimental
   design was developed which rendered it possible to investigate the brain
   basis of creative conceptual expansion. The ability to widen the
   boundaries of conceptual structures is integral to creative idea
   generation, which makes conceptual expansion a core component of
   creative cognition. Creative conceptual expansion led to the engagement
   of brain regions that are known to be involved in the access, storage
   and relational integration of conceptual knowledge in the original
   study. These included the anterior inferior frontal gyrus, the temporal
   poles and the lateral frontal pole. These findings in relation to the
   brain basis of creative conceptual expansion were replicated in the
   current study. The second objective of this study was to evaluate the
   brain basis of individual differences in creative conceptual expansion.
   The high creative group relative to the low creative group was shown to
   exhibit greater activity in regions of the semantic cognition network as
   well as the salience network during creative conceptual expansion. The
   findings are discussed from the point of view of classical hypotheses
   about information processing biases that explain individual differences
   in creativity including flat associative hierarchies, defocused
   attention and cognitive disinhibition.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The study of resting-state functional brain networks is a powerful tool
   to understand the neurological bases of a variety of disorders such as
   Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this work, we have studied the
   differences in functional brain connectivity between a group of 74 ASD
   subjects and a group of 82 typical-development (TD) subjects using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We have used a network
   approach whereby the brain is divided into discrete regions or nodes
   that interact with each other through connections or edges. Functional
   brain networks were estimated using the Pearson's correlation
   coefficient and compared by means of the Network-Based Statistic (NBS)
   method. The obtained results reveal a combination of both
   overconnectivity and underconnectivity, with the presence of networks in
   which the connectivity levels differ significantly between ASD and TD
   groups. The alterations mainly affect the temporal and frontal lobe, as
   well as the limbic system, especially those regions related with social
   interaction and emotion management functions. These results are
   concordant with the clinical profile of the disorder and can contribute
   to the elucidation of its neurological basis, encouraging the
   development of new clinical approaches.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Adolescence is a time of ongoing neural maturation and
   cognitive development, especially regarding executive functions. In the
   current study, age-related differences in the neural correlates of
   different executive functions were tracked by comparing three age groups
   consisting of adolescents and young adults.
   Methods: Brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) from 167 human participants (13- to 14-year-old middle
   adolescents, 16- to 17-year-old late adolescents and 20-to 24-year-old
   young adults; 80 female, 87 male) while they performed attention and
   working memory tasks. The tasks were designed to tap into four putative
   sub-processes of executive function: division of attention, inhibition
   of distractors, working memory, and attention switching.
   Results: Behaviorally, our results demonstrated superior task
   performance in older participants across all task types. When brain
   activity was examined, young adult participants demonstrated a greater
   degree of overlap between brain regions recruited by the different
   executive tasks than adolescent participants. Similarly, functional
   connectivity between frontoparietal cortical regions was less task
   specific in the young adult participants than in adolescent
   participants.
   Conclusions: Together, these results demonstrate that the similarity
   between different executive processes in terms of both neural
   recruitment and functional connectivity increases with age from middle
   adolescence to early adulthood, possibly contributing to age-related
   behavioral improvements in executive functioning. These developmental
   changes in brain recruitment may reflect a more homogenous morphological
   organization between process-specific neural networks, increased
   reliance on a more domain-general network involved in executive
   processing, or developmental changes in cognitive strategy.}},

   measures are calculated between ASD and TD in each group. Furthermore,
   two-factor analysis of variance test is used to study the effect of age,
   disease, and their interaction on the network measures and the network
   edges. Furthermore, the differences in connection strength between TD
   and ASD subjects are assessed using network-based statistics. The
   results showed that ASD exhibits increased functional integration at the
   expense of decreased functional segregation. In ASD adolescents, there
   is a significant decrease in modularity suggesting a less robust modular
   organization, and an increase in participation coefficient suggesting
   more random integration and widely distributed connection edges.
   Furthermore, there is significant hypoconnectivity observed in the
   adolescent group especially in the default mode network, while the
   children group shows both hyper- and hypoconnectivity. This study lends
   support to a model of global atypical connections and further identifies
   functional networks and areas that are independently affected by age,
   disease, and their interaction.}},

Abstract = {{When we buy a product of a brand, we trust the brand to provide good
   quality and reliability. Therefore, trust plays a major role in consumer
   behavior. It is unclear, however, how trust in brands is processed in
   the brain and whether it is processed differently from interpersonal
   trust. In this study, we used fMRI to investigate the neural correlates
   of interpersonal and brand trust by comparing the brain activation
   patterns during explicit trustworthiness judgments of faces and brands.
   Our results showed that while there were several brain areas known to be
   linked to trustworthiness evaluations, such as the amygdalae, more
   active in trustworthiness judgments when compared to a control task
   (familiarity judgment) for faces, no such difference was found for
   brands. Complementary ROI analysis revealed that the activation of both
   amygdalae was strongest for faces in the trustworthiness judgments. The
   direct comparison of the brain activation patterns during the
   trustworthiness evaluations between faces and brands in this analysis
   showed that trustworthiness judgments of faces activated the
   orbitofrontal cortex, another region that was previously linked to
   interpersonal trust, more strongly than trustworthiness judgments of
   brands. Further, trustworthiness ratings of faces, but not brands,
   correlated with activation in the orbitofrontal cortex. Our results
   indicate that the amygdalae, as well as the orbitofrontal cortex, play a
   prominent role in interpersonal trust (faces), but not in trust for
   brands. It is possible that this difference is due to brands being
   processed as cultural objects rather than as having human-like
   personality characteristics.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Large volumes of spatio-temporal data are increasingly collected and
   studied in diverse domains, including climate science, social sciences,
   neuroscience, epidemiology, transportation, mobile health, and Earth
   sciences. Spatio-temporal data differ from relational data for which
   computational approaches are developed in the data-mining community for
   multiple decades in that both spatial and temporal attributes are
   available in addition to the actual measurements/attributes. The
   presence of these attributes introduces additional challenges that needs
   to be dealt with. Approaches for mining spatio-temporal data have been
   studied for over a decade in the data-mining community. In this article,
   we present a broad survey of this relatively young field of
   spatio-temporal data mining. We discuss different types of
   spatio-temporal data and the relevant data-mining questions that arise
   in the context of analyzing each of these datasets. Based on the nature
   of the data-mining problem studied, we classify literature on
   spatio-temporal data mining into six major categories: clustering,
   predictive learning, change detection, frequent pattern mining, anomaly
   detection, and relationship mining. We discuss the various forms of
   spatio-temporal data-mining problems in each of these categories.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the enormous growth of e-commerce, consumers still come against
   risk-related barriers while carrying out online purchases. Specialists
   of e-commerce have therefore explored the facets of online risk
   perception with the aim of identifying which has the greatest impact.
   There is, nonetheless, no consensus as to the facets of risk perception
   or their relative importance. This is the first study resorting to
   neurological tools that examines the differences between the three most
   widespread facets of risk (financial, privacy, and performance) in a
   low-involvement purchase environment. Contrary to behavioral findings,
   brain data from neurological analyses identify differences between the
   three facets of risk. Financial risk conveys the lowest subconscious
   aversion and negative values. Subconscious privacy risk, in turn,
   confers ambivalence and uncertainty while performance risk elicits the
   highest levels of disappointment and distrust. Implications from the
   current findings, if taken into account by retailers, can greatly
   improve web contents and purchase processes, and bolster sales.}},

Abstract = {{Conduct disorder (CD), a common psychiatric disorder in children and
   adolescents, is characterized by encroaching upon other rights and
   violations of age-appropriate social expectations repeatedly and
   persistently. Individuals with CD often have high aggressiveness and low
   inhibitory capacity. The monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has long been
   associated with aggression. Effects of MAOA genotype on inhibitory
   control have been examined in general population. Several studies had
   revealed reduced activation in prefrontal areas, especially theanterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), in low-expression MAOA (MAOA-L) allele carriers
   compared to high-expression MAOA (MAOA-H) allele carriers. However,
   little is known about its genetic risk influences on inhibitory
   processes in clinical samples. In this study, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) was administered to a sample of adolescent boys
   with CD during the performance of a GoStop task, 29 of whom carrying
   MAOA-L allele and 24 carrying MAOA-H allele. Relative to MAOA-H
   carriers, MAOA-L carriers in CD showed more pronounced deactivation in
   the precuneus, supplementary motor area (SMA) and dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC). Deactivation within the default mode network
   (DMN) and inhibitory-related areas in MAOA-L carriers may be related to
   compensation for low sensitivity to inhibition and/or an atypical
   allocation of cognitive resources. The results suggested a possible
   neural mechanism through which MAOA affects inhibitory processes in a
   clinical sample.}},

Abstract = {{A significant neural challenge in speech perception includes extracting
   discrete phonetic categories from continuous and multidimensional
   signals despite varying task demands and surface-acoustic variability.
   While neural representations of speech categories have been previously
   identified in frontal and posterior temporal-parietal regions, the task
   dependency and dimensional specificity of these neural representations
   are still unclear. Here, we asked native Mandarin participants to listen
   to speech syllables carrying 4 distinct lexical tone categories across
   passive listening, repetition, and categorization tasks while they
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used
   searchlight classification and representational similarity analysis
   (RSA) to identify the dimensional structure underlying neural
   representation across tasks and surface-acoustic properties. Searchlight
   classification analyses revealed significant ``cross-task{''} lexical
   tone decoding within the bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) and
   left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL). RSA revealed that the LIPL and
   LSTG, in contrast to the RSTG, relate to 2 critical dimensions (pitch
   height, pitch direction) underlying tone perception. Outside this core
   representational network, we found greater activation in the inferior
   frontal and parietal regions for stimuli that are more perceptually
   similar during tone categorization. Our findings reveal the specific
   characteristics of fronto-tempo-parietal regions that support speech
   representation and categorization processing.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to identify distinct behavioral profiles in a
   population-based sample of 654 4-year-old children and characterize
   their relationships with brain functional networks using resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Young children showed 7
   behavioral profiles, including a super healthy behavioral profile with
   the lowest scores across all Child Behavior CheckList (CBCL) subscales
   (G1) and other 6 behavioral profiles, respectively with pronounced
   withdrawal (G2), somatic complaints (G3), anxiety and withdrawal (G4),
   somatic complaints and withdrawal (G5), the mixture of emotion,
   withdrawal, and aggression (G6), and attention (G7) problems. Compared
   with children in G1, children with withdrawal shared abnormal functional
   connectivities among the sensorimotor networks. Children in emotionally
   relevant problems shared the common pattern among the attentional and
   frontal networks. Nevertheless, children in sole withdrawal problems
   showed a unique pattern of connectivity alterations among the
   sensorimotor, cerebellar, and salience networks. Children with somatic
   complaints showed abnormal functional connectivities between the
   attentional and subcortical networks, and between the language and
   posterior default mode networks. This study provides novel evidence on
   the existence of behavioral heterogeneity in early childhood and its
   associations with specific functional networks that are clinically
   relevant phenotypes for mental illness and are apparent from early
   childhood.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol-associated stimuli capture attention, yet drinkers differ in the
   precise stimuli that become paired with intoxication.
   Extending our prior work to examine the influence of alcoholism risk
   factors, we paired abstract visual stimuli with intravenous alcohol
   delivered covertly and examined brain responses to these
   Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli in fMRI when subjects were not
   intoxicated.
   Sixty healthy drinkers performed task-irrelevant alcohol conditioning
   that presented geometric shapes as conditioned stimuli. Shapes were
   paired with a rapidly rising alcohol limb (conditioned stimulus; CS+)
   using intravenous alcohol infusion targeting a final peak breath alcohol
   concentration of 0.045 g/dL or saline (CS-) infusion at matched rates.
   On day 2, subjects performed monetary delay discounting outside the
   scanner to assess delay tolerance and then underwent event-related fMRI
   while performing the same task with CS+, CS-, and an irrelevant symbol.
   CS+ elicited stronger activation than CS- in frontoparietal
   executive/attention and orbitofrontal reward-associated networks. Risk
   factors including family history, recent drinking, sex, and age of
   drinking onset did not relate to the {[}CS+ > CS-] activation.
   Delay-tolerant choice and {[}CS+ > CS-] activation in right inferior
   parietal cortex were positively related.
   Networks governing executive attention and reward showed enhanced
   responses to stimuli experimentally paired with intoxication, with the
   right parietal cortex implicated in both alcohol cue pairing and
   intertemporal choice. While different from our previous study results in
   14 men, we believe this paradigm in a large sample of male and female
   drinkers offers novel insights into Pavlovian processes less affected by
   idiosyncratic drug associations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: One of the social concepts is self-regulation; the ability
   to regulate and control our thoughts, emotions and behaviors. With
   developments in neuroscience, the neural understanding of
   self-regulation has been increased. Weight management is a typical kind
   of self-regulation which leads to behavioral changes. Also in recent
   years, investigators have used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   (fMRI) technique for assessing effects of different stimuli such as food
   on brain responses. The aim of the current study is to localize
   self-regulation areas in response to palatable food using a Bayesian
   Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach.
   Methods: A new proposed Bayesian approach was applied for assessing
   functional response to palatable food stimuli in a block design of fMRI
   data with 370 scans of one healthy woman. Regions of Interest (ROIs)
   including the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex, the inferior
   frontal gyrus and the mid-ventrolateral frontal cortex were
   investigated. In this Bayesian approach, Stochastic Partial Differential
   Equation (SPDE) prior was considered for spatial dependency and AR(1)
   process was used for temporal correlation via pre-weighting residuals.
   Finally, inferences were conducted using fast Integrated Nested Laplace
   Approximation (INLA) approximation.
   Results: The results of the present study revealed that palatable food
   as compared to non-food images elicit stronger activation in brain
   self-regulation areas including the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal
   cortex, the inferior frontal gyrus and the mid-ventrolateral frontal
   cortex.
   Conclusion: Self-regulation areas of brain of people who are concerned
   about their weight, will be activated in confrontation with palatable
   foods.}},

Abstract = {{Crying is the principal means by which newborn infants shape parental
   behavior to meet their needs. While this mechanism can be highly
   effective, infant crying can also be an aversive stimulus that leads to
   parental frustration and even abuse. Fathers have recently become more
   involved in direct caregiving activities in modern, developed nations,
   and fathers are more likely than mothers to physically abuse infants. In
   this study, we attempt to explain variation in the neural response to
   infant crying among human fathers, with the hope of identifying factors
   that are associated with a more or less sensitive response. We imaged
   brain function in 39 first-time fathers of newborn infants as they
   listened to both their own and a standardized unknown infant cry
   stimulus, as well as auditory control stimuli, and evaluated whether
   these neural responses were correlated with measured characteristics of
   fathers and infants that were hypothesized to modulate these responses.
   Fathers also provided subjective ratings of each cry stimulus on
   multiple dimensions. Fathers showed widespread activation to both own
   and unknown infant cries in neural systems involved in empathy and
   approach motivation. There was no significant difference in the neural
   response to the own vs. unknown infant cry, and many fathers were unable
   to distinguish between the two cries. Comparison of these results with
   previous studies in mothers revealed a high degree of similarity between
   first-time fathers and first-time mothers in the pattern of neural
   activation to newborn infant cries. Further comparisons suggested that
   younger infant age was associated with stronger paternal neural
   responses, perhaps due to hormonal or novelty effects. In our sample,
   older fathers found infant cries less aversive and had an attenuated
   response to infant crying in both the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (dACC) and the anterior insula, suggesting that compared with younger
   fathers, older fathers may be better able to avoid the distress
   associated with empathic over-arousal in response to infant cries. A
   principal components analysis revealed that fathers with more negative
   emotional reactions to the unknown infant cry showed decreased
   activation in the thalamus and caudate nucleus, regions expected to
   promote positive parental behaviors, as well as increased activation in
   the hypothalamus and dorsal ACC, again suggesting that empathic over
   arousal might result in negative emotional reactions to infant crying.
   In sum, our findings suggest that infant age, paternal age and paternal
   emotional reactions to infant crying all modulate the neural response of
   fathers to infant crying. By identifying neural correlates of variation
   in paternal subjective reactions to infant crying, these findings help
   lay the groundwork for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions
   designed to increase paternal sensitivity and compassion.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder.
   Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive
   neuroimaging method acquired in absence of task.
   OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to correlate pretherapeutic ventrolateral
   thalamus functional connectivity (FC) with clinical results 1 year after
   stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy (SRS-T) for drug-resistant ET.
   Data from 12 healthy control individuals were additionally included.
   METHODS: Resting state was acquired for 17 consecutive (right-handed)
   patients, before and 1 year after left unilateral SRS-T. Standard tremor
   scores were evaluated pretherapeutically and 1 year after SRS-T. Tremor
   network was investigated using region of interest, left ventrolateral
   ventral (VLV) cluster, obtained from pretherapeutic diffusion magnetic
   resonance imaging. Seed-based FC was obtained as correlations between
   the time courses of the VLV and that of every other voxel. The
   seed-connectivity maps were obtained pretherapeutically and correlated
   across all patients with clinical outcome 1 year after SRST. One-year
   magnetic resonance signature volume was always located inside VLV and
   did not correlate with reported seed-FC measures (P > 0.05).
   RESULTS: We report statistically significant correlations between
   pretherapeutic VLV FC with clinical outcome for 1) right visual
   association area (Brodmann area, BA19) predicting 1 year activities of
   daily living decrease (P-unc = 0.02); 2) left fusiform gyrus (BA37)
   predicting 1 year head tremor score improvement (P-unc = 0.04); and 3)
   posterior cingulate (left BA23, P-uncor = 0.009), lateral temporal
   cortex (right BA21, P-unc = 0.02) predicting time to tremor arrest.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that pretherapeutic resting-state
   seed-FC of left VLV predicts tremor arrest after SRS-T for ET. Visual
   areas are identified as the main regions in this correlation.}},

Journal = {{APPETITE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{The reward surfeit model of overeating suggests that heightened brain
   response to rewards contributes to overeating and subsequent weight
   gain. However, previous studies have not tested whether brain response
   to reward is associated with food intake, particularly during childhood,
   a period of dynamic development in reward and inhibitory control
   neurocircuitry. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) with 7-11 year-old children (n = 59; healthy weight, n = 31;
   overweight, n = 28; 54\% female) while they played a modified
   card-guessing paradigm to examine blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
   response to anticipating and winning rewards (food, money, neutral).
   Food intake was assessed at three separate meals that measured different
   facets of eating behavior: 1) typical consumption (baseline), 2)
   overindulgence (palatable buffet), and 3) eating in the absence of
   hunger (EAH). A priori regions of interest included regions implicated
   in both reward processing and inhibitory control. Multiple stepwise
   regressions were conducted to examine the relationship between intake
   and BOLD response to rewards. Corrected results showed that a greater
   BOLD response in the medial prefrontal cortex for anticipating food
   compared to money positively correlated with how much children ate at
   the baseline and palatable buffet meals. BOLD response in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for winning food compared to money was
   positively correlated with intake at the palatable buffet meal and EAH.
   All aforementioned relationships were independent of child weight
   status. Findings support the reward surfeit model by showing that
   increased brain response to food compared to money rewards positively
   correlates with laboratory measures of food intake in children.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence shows that task-deactivations are functionally relevant
   for cognitive performance. Indeed, higher cognitive engagement has been
   associated with higher suppression of activity in task-deactivated brain
   regions - usually ascribed to the Default Mode Network (DMN). Moreover,
   a negative correlation between these regions and areas actively engaged
   by the task is associated with better performance. DMN regions show
   positive modulation during autobiographical, social, and emotional
   tasks. However, it is not clear how processing of emotional stimuli
   affects the interplay between the DMN and executive brain regions. We
   studied this interplay in an fMRI experiment using emotional negative
   stimuli as distractors. Activity modulations induced by the emotional
   interference of negative stimuli were found in frontal, parietal, and
   visual areas, and were associated with modulations of functional
   connectivity between these task-activated areas and DMN regions. A worse
   performance was predicted both by lower activity in the superior
   parietal cortex and higher connectivity between visual areas and frontal
   DMN regions. Connectivity between right inferior frontal gyrus and
   several DMN regions in the left hemisphere was related to the behavioral
   performance. This relation was weaker in the negative than in the
   neutral condition, likely suggesting less functional inhibitions of DMN
   regions during emotional processing. These results show that both
   executive and DMN regions are crucial for the emotional interference
   process and suggest that DMN connections are related to the interplay
   between externally-directed and internally-focused processes. Among DMN
   regions, superior frontal gyrus may be a key node in regulating the
   interference triggered by emotional stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Narcissism is one of the most fundamental personality traits in which
   individuals in general population exhibit a large heterogeneity. Despite
   a surge of interest in examining behavioral characteristics of
   narcissism in the past decades, the neurobiological substrates
   underlying narcissism remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed this
   issue by applying a machine learning approach to decode trait narcissism
   from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC).
   Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data were acquired for a large
   sample comprising 155 healthy adults, each of whom was assessed for
   trait narcissism. Using a linear prediction model, we examined the
   relationship between whole-brain RSFC and trait narcissism. We
   demonstrated that the machine-learning model was able to decode
   individual trait narcissism from RSFC across multiple neural systems,
   including functional connectivity between and within limbic and
   prefrontal systems as well as their connectivity with other networks.
   Key nodes that contributed to the prediction model included the
   amygdala, prefrontal and anterior cingulate regions that have been
   linked to trait narcissism. These findings remained robust using
   different validation procedures. Our findings thus demonstrate that RSFC
   among multiple neural systems predicts trait narcissism at the
   individual level.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundEthnic minority individuals have an increased risk of
   developing a psychotic disorder, particularly if they live in areas of
   ethnic segregation, or low own group ethnic density. The neurobiological
   mechanisms underlying this ethnic minority associated risk are unknown.
   We used functional MRI to investigate neural responses to faces of
   different ethnicity, in individuals of black ethnicity, and a control
   group of white British ethnicity individuals.MethodsIn total 20
   individuals of black ethnicity, and 22 individuals of white British
   ethnicity underwent a 3T MRI scan while viewing faces of black and white
   ethnicity. Own group ethnic density was calculated from the 2011 census.
   Neighbourhood segregation was quantified using the Index of
   Dissimilarity method.ResultsAt the within-group level, both groups
   showed greater right amygdala activation to outgroup faces. Between
   groups, the black ethnicity group showed greater right amygdala
   activation to white faces, compared to the white ethnicity group. Within
   the black ethnicity group, individuals living in areas of lower own
   group ethnic density showed greater right amygdala reactivity to white
   faces (r = -0.61, p = 0.01).ConclusionsThis is the first time an
   increased amygdala response to white faces has been demonstrated in
   individuals of black ethnicity. In the black ethnicity group,
   correlations were observed between amygdala response and neighbourhood
   variables associated with increased psychosis risk. These results may
   have relevance for our understanding of the increased rates of paranoia
   and psychotic disorders in ethnic minority individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
   characterized by social communication impairments and repetitive
   behaviors or restricted interests. Impaired pragmatic language
   comprehension is a universal feature in individuals with ASD. However,
   the underlying neural basis of pragmatic language is poorly understood.
   In the present study, we examined neural activation patterns associated
   with impaired pragmatic language comprehension in ASD, compared to
   typically developing children (TDC).
   Materials and Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
   applied to 15 children with ASD and 18 TDC using the Korean pragmatic
   language task.
   Results: Children with ASD were less accurate than TDC at comprehending
   idioms, particularly when they were required to interpret idioms with
   mismatched images (mismatched condition). Children with ASD also showed
   different patterns of neural activity than TDC in all three conditions
   (neutral, matched, and mismatched). Specifically, children with ASD
   showed decreased activation in the right inferior frontal gyros (JFG)
   (Brodmann area 47) in the mismatched condition, compared with TDC (IFG;
   t(31)=3.17, p<0.001).
   Conclusion: These results suggest that children with ASD face
   difficulties in comprehending pragmatic expressions and apply different
   pragmatic language processes at the neural level.}},

Abstract = {{Mirror neurons are generally described as a neural substrate hosting
   shared representations of actions, by simulating or `mirroring' the
   actions of others onto the observer's own motor system. Since single
   neuron recordings are rarely feasible in humans, it has been argued that
   cross-modal multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA) of non-invasive fMRI
   data is a suitable technique to investigate common coding of observed
   and executed actions, allowing researchers to infer the presence of
   mirror neurons in the human brain. In an effort to close the gap between
   monkey electrophysiology and human fMRI data with respect to the mirror
   neuron system, here we tested this proposal for the first time in the
   monkey. Rhesus monkeys either performed reach-and-grasp or
   reach-and-touch motor acts with their right hand in the dark or observed
   videos of human actors performing similar motor acts. Unimodal decoding
   showed that both executed or observed motor acts could be decoded from
   numerous brain regions. Specific portions of rostral parietal, premotor
   and motor cortices, previously shown to house mirror neurons, in
   addition to somatosensory regions, yielded significant asymmetric
   action-specific cross-modal decoding. These results validate the use of
   cross-modal multi-variate fMRI analyses to probe the representations of
   own and others' actions in the primate brain and support the proposed
   mapping of others' actions onto the observer's own motor cortices.}},

Abstract = {{For human olfactory functional MRI studies, the primary olfactory cortex
   (POC) suffers severe magnetic susceptibility artifacts, which adversely
   influences the detectability and reproducibility of the olfactory fMRI
   data and its clinical applications. The goal of this work is to assess
   the impacts of the image artifacts on the detectability and
   reproducibility of the olfactory activation in the POC. The severity of
   artifacts in the POC were classified into three levels using a
   Subjective Artifact score (SA\_score). The mean temporal signal-to-noise
   ratio (tSNR) of the fMRI data acquired by a given MRI sequence and
   olfactory activation (beta value) in POC were evaluated and compared to
   the concurrent activations in the primary visual cortex (Brodmann area
   17, BA17) by an odor-visual association paradigm using ninety-nine
   normal human subjects. Our study revealed that the mean tSNR in POC was
   above the threshold for reliable detection of the functional activation
   signal, and, consequently, the mean olfactory activations in the POC
   were not significantly different from those in BA17. The reproducibility
   of the activation in the POC was assessed by a random half-split
   stimulation of a test-retest experiment. The overlap of the activation
   maps for all the trials (n = 1000) in the POC were not statistically
   different from that observed in BA17. These results show that the
   detectability and reproducibility of olfactory activation in the
   presence of susceptibility artifacts in the POC was at similar level of
   that in the visual cortex.}},

Title = {{Tracking emotions in the brain - Revisiting the Empathic Accuracy Task}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {{677-686}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Many empathy tasks lack ecological validity due to their use of
   simplistic stimuli and static analytical approaches. Empathic accuracy
   tasks overcome these limitations by using autobiographical emotional
   video clips. Usually, a single measure of empathic accuracy is computed
   by correlating the participants' continuous ratings of the narrator's
   emotional state with the narrator's own ratings.
   In this study, we validated a modified empathic accuracy task. A
   valence-independent rating of the narrator's emotional intensity was
   added to provide comparability between videos portraying different
   primary emotions and to explore changes in neural activity related to
   variations in emotional intensity over time. We also added a new neutral
   control condition to investigate general emotional processing. In the
   scanner, 34 healthy participants watched 6 video clips of people talking
   about an autobiographical event (2 sad, 2 happy and 2 neutral clips)
   while continuously rating the narrator's emotional intensity.
   Fluctuation in perceived emotional intensity correlated with activity in
   brain regions previously implicated in cognitive empathy (bilateral
   superior temporal sulcus, temporoparietal junction, and temporal pole)
   and affective empathy (right anterior insula and inferior frontal
   gyrus). When emotional video clips were compared to neutral video clips,
   we observed higher activity in similar brain regions. Empathic accuracy,
   on the other hand, was only positively related to activation in regions
   that have been implicated in cognitive empathy.
   Our modified empathic accuracy task provides a new method for studying
   the underlying components and dynamic processes involved in empathy.
   While the task elicited both cognitive and affective empathy, successful
   tracking of others' emotions relied predominantly on the cognitive
   components of empathy. The fMRI data analysis techniques developed here
   may prove valuable in characterising the neural basis of empathic
   difficulties observed across a range of psychiatric conditions.}},

   fluctuation of resting-state brain activity predicts creative insight}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Creative insight has attracted much attention across cultures. Although
   previous studies have explored the neural correlates of creative insight
   by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), little is known about
   intrinsic resting-state brain activity associated with creative insight.
   In the present study, we used amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation
   (ALFF) as an index in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to identify brain
   regions involved in individual differences in creative insight, which
   was measured by the response time of creative Chinese character chunk
   decomposition. Our results showed that ALFF in the superior frontal
   gyrus (SFG) positively predicted creative insight, while ALFF in the
   middle cingulate cortex/insula cortex (MCC/IC), superior temporal
   gyrus/angular gyrus (STG/AG), anterior cingulate cortex/caudate nucleus
   (ACC/CN), and culmen/declive (CU/DC) negatively predicted creative
   insight. Moreover, these findings indicate that spontaneous brain
   activity in multiple regions related to breaking mental sets, solutions
   exploring, evaluation of novel solutions, forming task-related
   associations, and emotion experience contributes to creative insight. In
   conclusion, the present study provides new evidence to further
   understand the cognitive processing and neural correlates of creative
   insight.}},

Abstract = {{Children with an extremely inhibited, anxious temperament (AT) are at
   increased risk for anxiety disorders and depression. Using a rhesus
   monkey model of early-life AT, we previously demonstrated that
   metabolism in the central extended amygdala (EAc), including the central
   nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
   (BST), is associated with trait-like variation in AT. Here, we use fMRI
   to examine relationships between Ce-BST functional connectivity and AT
   in a large multigenerational family pedigree of rhesus monkeys (n = 170
   females and 208 males). Results demonstrate that Ce-BST functional
   connectivity is heritable, accounts for a significant but modest portion
   of the variance in AT, and is coheritable with AT. Interestingly, Ce-BST
   functional connectivity and AT-related BST metabolism were not
   correlated and accounted for non-overlapping variance in AT. Exploratory
   analyses suggest that Ce-BST functional connectivity is associated with
   metabolism in the hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray. Together, these
   results suggest the importance of coordinated function within the EAc
   for determining individual differences in AT and metabolism in brain
   regions associated with its behavioral and neuroendocrine components.}},

   perspective-taking: Model-based behavioral and fMRI experiments}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{Risky decision making for others is ubiquitous in our societies. Whereas
   financial decision making for oneself induces strong concern about the
   worst outcome (maximin concern) as well as the expected value,
   behavioral and neural characteristics of decision making for others are
   less well understood. We conducted behavioral and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to examine the neurocognitive
   underpinnings of risky decisions for an anonymous other, using decisions
   for self as a benchmark. We show that, although the maximin concern
   affected both types of decisions equally strongly, decision making for
   others recruited a more risk-neutral computational mechanism than
   decision making for self. Specifically, participants exhibited more
   balanced information search when choosing a risky option for others.
   Activity of right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ, associated with
   cognitive perspective taking) was parametrically modulated by options'
   expected values in decisions for others, and by the minimum amounts in
   decisions for self. Furthermore, individual differences in self-reported
   empathic concern modified these attentional and neural processes.
   Overall, these results indicate that the typical maximin concern is
   attenuated in a risk-neutral direction in decisions for others as
   compared to self. We conjecture that, given others' diverse preferences,
   deciding as a neutral party may cognitively recruit such
   risk-neutrality.}},

Title = {{The Experience of Beauty of Chinese Poetry and Its Neural Substrates}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Chinese poetry has a long history and high esthetic value. People who
   engage esthetically with Chinese poetry would feel the sense of beauty
   naturally. However, there is little information regarding what happens
   in the brain when an individual appreciates Chinese poetry, and how the
   brain processes the subject's appreciation of beauty. Herein, we used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural
   substrates of experiencing beauty by appreciating Chinese poetry. The
   participants in our study were 28 college students and the stimuli
   consisted of 25 Chinese poetry and 25 prose selections. Based on an
   event-related paradigm, the findings of this study suggested that
   different areas scattered in both the left and right cerebral
   hemispheres are activated when an individual appreciates Chinese poetry.
   Compared to reading prose, appreciating Chinese poetry heightens the
   activation of the left inferior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the
   bilateral insula, the left fusiform, the left supplementary motor area
   (SMA), and the left precentral gyrus. In these areas, the left inferior
   OFC and the bilateral insula are considered closely related to
   experiencing beauty of Chinese poetry, which have been demonstrated that
   it is an important neural basis of esthetic beauty when using other
   types of materials. The findings of this study shed new light on the
   complex but ordinary processes of experiencing beauty when appreciating
   Chinese poetry and show that some key processes underlying the feeling
   of esthetic beauty are shared across different esthetic domains.}},

   from faces in face perception or theory-of-mind networks}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{The human face cues a wealth of social information, but the neural
   mechanisms that underpin social attributions from faces are not well
   known. In the current fMRI experiment, we used repetition suppression to
   test the hypothesis that populations of neurons in face perception and
   theory-of-mind neural networks would show sensitivity to faces that cue
   distinct trait judgments. Although faces were accurately discriminated
   based on associated traits, our results showed no evidence that face or
   theory-of-mind networks showed repetition suppression for face traits.
   Thus, we do not provide evidence for population coding models of face
   perception that include sensitivity to high and low trait features. Due
   to aspects of the experimental design, which bolstered statistical power
   and sensitivity, we have reasonable confidence that we could detect
   effects of a moderate size, should they exist. The null findings
   reported here, therefore, add value to models of neural organisation in
   social perception by showing instances where effects are absent or
   small. To test the generalisability of our findings, future work should
   test different types of trait judgment and different types of facial
   stimuli, in order to further probe the neurobiological bases of

Abstract = {{Social interactions arise from patterns of communicative signs, whose
   perception and interpretation require a multitude of cognitive
   functions. The semiotic framework of Peirce's Universal Categories (UCs)
   laid ground for a novel cognitive-semiotic typology of social
   interactions. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 16
   volunteers watched a movie narrative encompassing verbal and non-verbal
   social interactions. Three types of non-verbal interactions were coded
   ({''}unresolved,{''} ``non-habitual,{''} and ``habitual{''}) based on a
   typology reflecting Peirce's UCs. As expected, the auditory cortex
   responded to verbal interactions, but non-verbal interactions modulated
   temporal areas as well. Conceivably, when speech was lacking, ambiguous
   visual information (unresolved interactions) primed auditory processing
   in contrast to learned behavioral patterns (habitual interactions). The
   latter recruited a parahippocampaloccipital network supporting
   conceptual processing and associative memory retrieval. Requesting
   semiotic contextualization, non-habitual interactions activated
   visuo-spatial and contextual rule-learning areas such as the
   temporo-parietal junction and right lateral prefrontal cortex. In
   summary, the cognitive-semiotic typology reflected distinct sensory and
   association networks underlying the interpretation of observed
   non-verbal social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The neural basis of dilemmas involving decisions with profound affective
   impact, such as in romantic life, remains to be understood. The ``Battle
   of the Sexes{''} is a paradigm from Game Theory that can be used to
   experimentally address such dilemmas. A form of in-group love, tribal
   love in football fans, provides the opportunity to study strong
   affective dilemmas when tribal and romantic love compete for hedonic
   decision-making. Here, we used for the first time a ``Battle of the
   Sexes{''} dilemma using fMRI. We investigated, in 44 male football fans,
   the neural correlates of cooperative behaviour under conflicting choices
   in the context of romantic versus tribal love. We identified a critical
   functional segregation of prefrontal regions in affective
   decision-making. The orbitofronta I cortex signalled emotional appraisal
   of the dilemma. The medial anterolateral and the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortices reflected reciprocal cooperation instead of selfish engagement
   in football-related activities. The lateral portion of anterolateral
   prefrontal cortex was recruited during ultimate deliberation. In sum,
   emotional appraisal and rational choice reflected a contiguous
   functional parcellation in anterolateral prefrontal cortex: appraisal
   (medial) vs. choice (lateral region).}},

Abstract = {{Humans can integrate social contextual information into decision-making
   processes to adjust their responses toward inequity. This context
   dependency emerges when individuals receive more (i.e., advantageous
   inequity) or less (i.e., disadvantageous inequity) than others. However,
   it is not clear whether context-dependent processing of advantageous and
   disadvantageous inequity involves differential neurocognitive
   mechanisms. Here, we used fMRI to address this question by combining an
   interactive game that modulates social contexts (e.g., interpersonal
   guilt) with computational models that enable us to characterize
   individual weights on inequity aversion. In each round, the participant
   played a dot estimation task with an anonymous coplayer. The coplayer
   would receive pain stimulation with 50\% probability when either of them
   responded incorrectly. At the end of each round, the participant
   completed a variant of dictator game, which determined payoffs for
   him/herself and the coplayer. Computational modeling demonstrated the
   context dependency of inequity aversion: when causing pain to the
   coplayer (i.e., guilt context), participants cared more about the
   advantageous inequity and became more tolerant of the disadvantageous
   inequity, compared with other conditions. Consistently, neuroimaging
   results suggested the two types of inequity were associated with
   differential neurocognitive substrates. While the context-dependent
   processing of advantageous inequity was associated with social-and
   mentalizing-related processes, involving left anterior insula, right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, the
   context-dependent processing of disadvantageous inequity was primarily
   associated with emotion- and conflict-related processes, involving left
   posterior insula, right amygdala, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.
   These results extend our understanding of decision-making processes
   related to inequity aversion.}},

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have examined associations between peripheral DNA
   methylation patterns of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) promoter
   and symptoms of depression and anxiety. The SLC6A4 promoter methylation
   has also been associated with frontal-limbic brain responses to negative
   stimuli. However, it is unclear how much of this association is
   confounded by DNA sequence variations. We utilized a monozygotic-twin
   within-pair discordance design, to test whether DNA methylation at
   specific CpG sites in the SLC6A4 promoter of peripheral cells is
   associated with greater frontal-limbic brain responses to negative
   stimuli (sadness and fear), independently of DNA sequence effects. In
   total 48 pairs of healthy 15-year-old monozygotic twins from the Quebec
   Newborn Twin Study, followed regularly since birth, underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging while conducting an emotion-processing task.
   The SLC6A4 promoter methylation level was assessed in saliva samples
   using pyrosequencing. Relative to the co-twins with lower SLC6A4
   promoter methylation levels, twins with higher peripheral SLC6A4
   methylation levels showed greater orbitofrontal cortical (OFC) activity
   and left amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left
   amygdala-right OFC connectivity in response to sadness as well as
   greater ACC-left amygdala and ACC-left insula connectivity in response
   to fearful stimuli. By utilising a monozygotic-twin design, we provided
   evidence that associations between peripheral SLC6A4 promoter
   methylation and frontal-limbic brain responses to negative stimuli are,
   in part, independent of DNA sequence variations. Although causality
   cannot be determined here, SLC6A4 promoter methylation may be one of the
   mechanisms underlying how environmental factors influence the serotonin
   system, potentially affecting emotional processing through
   frontal-limbic areas.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cognitive training has been focused on the interventions of
   amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in recent years, with poor
   understanding.
   Material/Methods: The study participants with aMCI were screened in a
   previous intervention trial. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) was adopted to investigate effects of single-domain cognitive
   training (SDCT) and multi-domain cognitive training (MDCT) on aMCI and
   to explore potential mechanisms.
   Results: There were significant differences in the grey matter volume of
   the middle frontal gyrus, superior parietal inferior temporal gyrus,
   fusiform gyrus, and ventral V3 between the MDCT/SDCT group and the
   control group (P0.05). Regional homogeneity (ReHo) increased
   significantly in the right and left inferior frontal gyrus as well as in
   the left and right precentral gyrus after intervention in the MDCT group
   and the SDCT group. ReHo increased significantly in the right and left
   lingual gyrus of the MDCT group and the control group. ReHo reduced
   significantly in the right middle temporal gyrus of the MDCT group but
   increased significantly in the left middle temporal gyrus in the SDCT
   group and the control group. The voxel of grey matter in the precuneus
   was positively related to the language scores on RBANS (Repeatable
   Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status), and amygdala,
   fusiform gyrus, and hippocampus also had a positive relationship with
   delayed memory scores in RBANS of the MDCT group. In the MDCT group, the
   attention and reasoning scores were also positively related to the ReHo
   of middle temporal gyrus.
   Conclusions: Both MDCT and SDCT may improve the aMCI at brain functional
   and structural levels; however, the MDCT group exhibited higher ReHo
   values in middle temporal gyrus and superior occipital gyrus. Also, it
   was confirmed that MDCT leads to better results than SDCT, showing a

Abstract = {{As people form social groups, they benefit from being able to detect
   socially valuable community members-individuals who act prosocially,
   support others, and form strong relationships. Multidisciplinary
   evidence demonstrates that people indeed track others' social value, but
   the mechanisms through which such detection occurs remain unclear. Here,
   we combine social network and neuroimaging analyses to examine this
   process. We mapped social networks in two freshman dormitories (n = 97),
   identifying how often individuals were nominated as socially valuable
   (i.e., sources of friendship, empathy, and support) by their peers.
   Next, we scanned a subset of dorm members ({''}perceivers{''}; n = 50)
   as they passively viewed photos of their dormmates ({''}targets{''}).
   Perceiver brain activity in regions associated with mentalizing and
   value computation differentiated between highly valued targets and other
   community members but did not differentiate between targets with middle
   versus low levels of social value. Cross-validation analysis revealed
   that brain activity from novel perceivers could be used to accurately
   predict whether targets viewed by those perceivers were high in social
   value or not. These results held even after controlling for perceivers'
   own ratings of closeness to targets, and even though perceivers were not
   directed to focus on targets' social value. Overall, these findings
   demonstrate that individuals spontaneously monitor people identified as
   sources of strong connection in the broader community.}},

   increased hippocampal neuroplasticity that are reversed by stress}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Abnormal hippocampal neural plasticity has been implicated in
   behavioural abnormalities and complex neuropsychiatric conditions,
   including bipolar disorder (BD). However, the determinants of this
   neural alteration remain unknown. This work tests the hypothesis that
   the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is a key determinant of
   hippocampal neuroplasticity, and its absence leads to maladaptive
   behaviour relevant for BD. Depletion of brain 5-HT in Tph2 mutant mice
   resulted in reduced behavioural despair, reduced anxiety, marked
   aggression and lower habituation in novel environments, reminiscent of
   bipolar-associated manic behaviour. Treatment with valproate produced a
   substantial improvement of the mania-like behavioural phenotypes
   displayed by Tph2 mutants. Brain-wide fMRI mapping in mutants revealed
   functional hippocampal hyperactivity in which we also observed
   dramatically increased neuroplasticity. Importantly, remarkable
   correspondence between the transcriptomic profile of the Tph2 mutant
   hippocampus and neurons from bipolar disorder patients was observed.
   Chronic stress reversed the emotional phenotype and the hippocampal
   transcriptional landscape of Tph2 mutants. These changes were associated
   with inappropriate activation of transcriptional adaptive response to
   stress as assessed by gene set enrichment analyses in the hippocampus of
   Tph2 mutant mice. These findings delineate 5-HT as a critical
   determinant in BD associated maladaptive emotional responses and
   aberrant hippocampal neuroplasticity, and support the use of Tph2-/-
   mice as a new research tool for mechanistic and therapeutic research in
   bipolar disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) play a key role in conceptual
   knowledge representation. The hub-and-spoke theory suggests that the
   contribution of the ATLs to semantic representation is (a) transmodal,
   i.e. integrating information from multiple sensorimotor and verbal
   modalities, and (b) pan-categorical, representing concepts from all
   categories. Another literature, however, suggests that this region's
   responses are modality-and category-selective; prominent examples
   include category selectivity for socially relevant concepts and face
   recognition. The predictions of each approach have never been directly
   compared. We used data from three studies to compare category-selective
   responses within the ATLs. Study 1 compared ATL responses to famous
   people versus another conceptual category (landmarks) from visual versus
   auditory inputs. Study 2 compared ATL responses to famous people from
   pictorial and written word inputs. Study 3 compared ATL responses to a
   different kind of socially relevant stimuli, namely abstract
   non-person-related words, in order to ascertain whether ATL subregions
   are engaged for social concepts more generally or only for
   person-related knowledge. Across all three studies a dominant bilateral
   ventral ATL cluster responded to all categories in all modalities.
   Anterior to this `pan-category' transmodal region, a second cluster
   responded more weakly overall yet selectively for people, but did so
   equally for spoken names and faces (Study 1). A third region in the
   anterior superior temporal gyrus responded selectively to abstract
   socially relevant words (Study 3), but did not respond to concrete
   socially relevant words (i.e. written names; Study 2). These findings
   can be accommodated by the graded hub-and-spoke model of concept
   representation. On this view, the ventral ATL is the centre point of a
   bilateral ATL hub, which contributes to conceptual representation
   through transmodal distillation of information arising from multiple
   modality-specific association cortices. Partial specialization occurs
   across the graded ATL hub as a consequence of gradedly differential
   connectivity across the region.

   development, use and representation in the brain'.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with schizophrenia (SCH) often demonstrate impairment in
   social-cognitive functions as well as disturbances in large-scale
   network connectivity. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is a
   core region of the default mode network, with projections to limbic
   structures. It plays an important role in social and emotional
   decision-making. We investigated whether resting-state functional
   connectivity (FC) relates to the cognitive and affective domains of
   theory of mind (ToM). Twenty-three SCH patients and 19 healthy controls
   (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   scanning. vmPFC seed connectivity was correlated with behavioral
   measures assessing ToM domains. SCH performed less well than HCs in both
   ToM task domains. An analysis of the resting-state FC revealed that SCH
   had reduced connectivity from the vmPFC to the subcallosal cortex, right
   amygdala, and right hippocampus as a function of behavioral scores in
   both ToM domains. Within-group analyses indicated that in HCs, the
   performance in ToM was positively associated with frontoamygdalar
   resting-state connectivity, whereas in SCH, the performance in ToM was
   negatively associated with the frontosubcallosal connectivity.
   Differences in the pattern of the resting-state frontolimbic
   connectivity and its associations with performance in ToM tasks between
   the two study groups might represent a different setup for processing
   social information in patients with SCH.}},

Title = {{Not on my team: Medial prefrontal cortex responses to ingroup fusion and
   unfair monetary divisions}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: People are highly attuned to fairness, with people willingly
   suffering personal costs to prevent others benefitting from unfair acts.
   Are fairness judgments influenced by group alignments? A new theory
   posits that we favor ingroups and denigrate members of rival outgroups
   when our personal identity is fused to a group. Although the mPFC has
   been separately implicated in group membership and fairness processing,
   it is unclear whether group alignments affect medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) activity in response to fairness. Here, we examine the
   contribution of different regions of the mPFC to processing from ingroup
   and outgroup members and test whether its response differs depending on
   how fused we are to an ingroup.
   Methods: Subjects performed rounds of the Ultimatum Game, being offered
   fair or unfair divisions of money from supporters of the same soccer
   team (ingroup), the fiercest rival (outgroup) or neutral individuals
   whilst undergoing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).
   Results: Strikingly, people willingly suffered personal costs to prevent
   outgroup members benefitting from both unfair and fair offers. Activity
   across dorsal and ventral (VMPFC) portions of the mPFC reflected an
   interaction between fairness and group membership. VMPFC activity in
   particular was consistent with it coding one's fusion to a group, with

Abstract = {{Adolescence has been characterized as a developmental period of
   heightened reward seeking and attenuated aversive processing. However,
   it remains unclear how the neural bases of distinct outcome valuation
   processes shift during this stage of the lifespan. A total of 74
   participants ranging in age from 13 to 20 years completed a
   value-modulated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task in
   which participants earn low and high magnitude monetary outcomes to test
   whether gain and loss magnitude tracking-the neural representation of
   relative value in context-change differentially over this age span.
   Results revealed that gain and loss magnitude tracking follow asymmetric
   developmental trajectories. Gain magnitude tracking is elevated in the
   striatum during early adolescence and then decreases with age. By
   contrast, loss magnitude tracking in the anterior insula follows a
   quadratic pattern, undergoing a temporary attenuation during mid-late
   adolescence. A typical comparison of gain vs loss outcomes (collapsing
   over magnitude effects) showed robust activity across a suite of brain
   regions sensitive to value based on prior work including the ventral
   striatum, but they exhibited no changes with age. These findings suggest
   that value coding subprocesses follow divergent developmental paths
   across adolescence, which may contribute to normative shifts in
   adolescent motivated behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals stably vary in their responses to rewards, but researchers
   have not yet determined whether sensitivity to rewarding outcomes
   translates across social and non-social contexts or whether different
   forms of reward sensitivity relate to distinct behavioral tendencies. We
   tested for responsiveness to different types of rewards by assessing
   individuals' neural sensitivity to personal vs. vicarious monetary
   reward outcomes and explored how responses to each related to
   prosociality and well-being. Forty-six participants underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning while winning money for
   themselves and observing a friend and stranger win money. All types of
   reward outcomes engaged the ventral striatum, but neural sensitivity to
   rewards for the self and for others were uncorrelated across
   individuals. Further, while sensitivity to rewards for the self or a
   close friend correlated with individuals' psychological well-being, only
   sensitivity to a friend's rewards correlated with individuals'
   prosociality. These findings highlight the value of independently
   assessing responsiveness to different types of reward and illuminate
   affective mechanisms that may promote prosocial behavior and well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Subjective well-being (SWB) reflects the cognitive and emotional
   evaluations of an individual's life and plays an important role in
   individual's success in health, work and social relationships. Although
   previous studies have revealed the spontaneous brain activity underlying
   SWB, little is known about the relationship between brain network
   interactions and SWB. The present study investigated the static and
   dynamic functional connectivity among large-scale brain networks during
   resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in relation
   to SWB in two large independent datasets. The results showed that SWB is
   negatively correlated with static functional connectivity between the
   salience network (SN) and the anterior default mode network (DMN).
   Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis found that SWB
   is negatively correlated with the fraction of time that participants
   spent in a brain state characterized by weak cross-network connectivity
   (between the DMN, SN and frontal-parietal network {[}FPN]) and strong
   within-network connectivity (within the DMN and within the FPN). This
   connectivity profile may account for the good mental adaptability and
   flexible information communication of people with high levels of SWB.
   The dFNC results were well replicated with different analysis parameters
   and further validated in an independent sample. Taken together, these
   findings reveal that the dynamic interaction between networks involved
   in self-reflection, emotional regulation and cognitive control underlies
   SWB.}},

Abstract = {{Depression is associated with negative attention and attribution biases
   and maladaptive emotion responsivity and regulation, which adversely
   impact self-evaluations and interpersonal relationships. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural
   substrates of these impairments. We compared neural activity recruited
   by 126 clinically depressed and healthy adolescents (ages 11-17 years)
   during social exclusion (Exclusion > Inclusion) using Cyberball. Results
   revealed significant interaction effects within left anterior insula
   (AI)/inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus. Insula
   hyperresponsivity was associated with peer exclusion for depressed
   adolescents but peer inclusion for healthy adolescents. In additional,
   healthy adolescents recruited greater lateral temporal activity during
   peer exclusion. Complementary effect size analyses within independent
   parcellations offered converging evidence, as well as highlighted
   medium-to-large effects within subgenual/ventral anterior cingulate
   cortex and lateral prefrontal, lateral temporal and lateral parietal
   regions implicated in emotion regulation. Depressogenic neural patterns
   were associated with negative self-perceptions and negative information
   processing biases. These findings suggest a neural mechanism underlying
   cognitive biases in depression, as reflected by emotional
   hyperresponsivity and maladaptive regulation/reappraisal of negative
   social evaluative information. This study lends further support for
   salience and central executive network dysfunction underlying social
   threat processing, and in particular, highlights the anterior insula as
   a key region of disturbance in adolescent depression.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we use separate eye-tracking measurements and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neuronal and behavioral
   response to painted portraits with direct versus averted gaze. We
   further explored modulatory effects of several painting characteristics
   (premodern vs modern period, influence of style and pictorial context).
   In the fMRI experiment, we show that the direct versus averted gaze
   elicited increased activation in lingual and inferior occipital and the
   fusiform face area, as well as in several areas involved in attentional
   and social cognitive processes, especially the theory of mind: angular
   gyrus/temporo-parietal junction, inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex. The additional eye-tracking experiment showed that
   participants spent more time viewing the portrait's eyes and mouth when
   the portrait's gaze was directed towards the observer. These results
   suggest that static and, in some cases, highly stylized depictions of
   human beings in artistic portraits elicit brain activation commensurate
   with the experience of being observed by a watchful intelligent being.
   They thus involve observers in implicit inferences of the painted
   subject's mental states and emotions. We further confirm the substantial
   influence of representational medium on brain activity.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have consistently indicated that semantic
   processing involves a brain network consisting of multimodal cortical
   regions distributed in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes.
   However, little is known about how semantic information is organized and
   processed within the network. Some recent studies have indicated that
   sensorymotor semantic information modulates the activation of this
   network. Other studies have indicated that this network responds more to
   social semantic information than to other information. Using fMRI, we
   collectively investigated the brain activations evoked by social and
   sensory-motor semantic information by manipulating the sociality and
   imageability of verbs in a word comprehension task. We detected 2
   subgroups of brain regions within the network showing sociality and
   imageability effects, respectively. The 2 subgroups of regions are
   distinct but overlap in bilateral angular gyri and adjacent middle
   temporal gyri. A follow-up analysis of resting-state functional
   connectivity showed that dissociation of the 2 subgroups of regions is
   partially associated with their intrinsic functional connectivity
   differences. Additionally, an interaction effect of sociality and
   imageability was observed in the left anterior temporal lobe. Our
   findings indicate that the multimodal cortical semantic network has fine

Abstract = {{Feeling emotionally close to others during social interactions is a
   ubiquitous and meaningful experience that can elicit positive affect.
   The present study integrates functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to investigate whether
   neural response to social reward (1) is related to the experience of
   emotional closeness and (2) moderates the association between emotional
   closeness and positive affect during and following social interactions.
   In this study, 34 typically developing adolescents (ages 14-18 years)
   completed a social-reward fMRI task, a monetary-reward fMRI task, and a
   2-week EMA protocol regarding their social and affective experiences.
   Adolescents with greater right posterior superior temporal
   sulcus/temporoparietal junction (pSTS/TPJ) response to social reward
   reported greater mean momentary emotional closeness. Neural response to
   social reward in the right pSTS/TPJ moderated how strongly momentary
   emotional closeness was associated with both concurrent positive affect
   and future peak happiness, but in different ways. Although emotional
   closeness had a significant positive association with concurrent
   positive affect among adolescents at both high and low right pSTS/TPJ
   response based on a follow-up simple slopes test, this association was
   stronger for adolescents with low right pSTS/TPJ response. In contrast,
   emotional closeness had a significant positive association with future
   peak happiness among adolescents with high right pSTS/TPJ response, but
   not among those with low right pSTS/TPJ response. These findings
   demonstrate the importance of neural response to social reward in key
   social processing regions for everyday experiences of emotional
   closeness and positive affect in the context of social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a fast-developing
   non-invasive functional brain imaging technology widely used in
   cognitive neuroscience, clinical research and neural engineering.
   However, it is a challenge to effectively remove the global
   physiological noise in the fNIRS signal. The global physiological noise
   in fNIRS arises from multiple physiological origins in both superficial
   tissues and the brain. It has complex temporal, spatial and frequency
   characteristics, casting significant influence on the results. In the
   present study, we developed a novel wavelet-based method for fNIRS
   global physiological noise removal. The method is data-driven and does
   not rely on any additional hardware or subjective noise component
   selection procedure. It consists of two steps. Firstly, we use wavelet
   transform coherence to automatically detect the time-frequency points
   contaminated by the global physiological noise. Secondly, we decompose
   the fNIRS signal by using the wavelet transform, and then suppress the
   wavelet energy of the contaminated time-frequency points. Finally, we
   transform the signal back to a time series. We validated the method by
   using simulation and real data at both task- and resting-state. The
   results showed that our method can effectively remove the global
   physiological noise from the fNIRS signal and improve the spatial
   specificity of the task activation and the resting-state functional
   connectivity pattern. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America under the

Abstract = {{The emotional aspect of autobiographical memories (AMs) is associated
   with self-related processing, which plays an important role in mental
   health. However, the emotional consistency dimension of AMs and its
   neural underpinnings remain largely unexplored. Twenty-five healthy
   participants were involved in this study. Participants were first asked
   to recall important AMs and assess the emotional ratings of each AM.
   Four weeks later, they were asked to retrieve the details of both
   positive and negative AMs during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) scanning. Behavioral results showed that the emotional valence of
   negative memories changed more strongly than positive memories over time
   (i.e., lower consistency). fMRI data showed that the activation level of
   the precuneus was positively correlated with self-rating valence
   consistency in the positive AM condition. Additionally, the precuneus
   connected to a key region of the self-referential network, the medial
   prefrontal cortex, in both the positive and negative AM conditions.
   Finally, the precuneus showed stronger connections with the inferior
   parietal lobule when comparing the positive with the negative AM
   conditions. Our results suggest that the precuneus is a key area of
   emotional consistency in positive AMs; this brain area may be involved
   in the maintenance of a positive self-image by strengthening positive
   AMs.}},

Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is widely regarded as an intermediate
   stage between typical aging and dementia, with nearly 50\% of patients
   with amnestic MCI (aMCI) converting to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) within
   30 months of follow-up (Fischer et al., 2007). The growing literature
   using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging reveals both
   increased and decreased connectivity in individuals with MCI and
   connectivity loss between the anterior and posterior components of the
   default mode network (DMN) throughout the course of the disease
   progression (Hillary et al., 2015; Sheline \& Raichle, 2013; Tijms et
   al., 2013). In this paper, we use dynamic connectivity modeling and
   graph theory to identify unique brain ``states,{''} or temporal patterns
   of connectivity across distributed networks, to distinguish individuals
   with aMCI from healthy older adults (HOAs). We enrolled 44 individuals
   diagnosed with aMCI and 33 HOAs of comparable age and education. Our
   results indicated that individuals with aMCI spent significantly more
   time in one state in particular, whereas neural network analysis in the
   HOA sample revealed approximately equivalent representation across four
   distinct states. Among individuals with aMCI, spending a higher
   proportion of time in the dominant state relative to a state where
   participants exhibited high cost (a measure combining connectivity and
   distance), predicted better language performance and less perseveration.
   This is the first report to examine neural network dynamics in
   individuals with aMCI.}},

Abstract = {{Unconcealable stigmas negatively affect how people visually represent
   faces. The current work extends these findings to arbitrary labels
   implying that targets are stigmatized (e.g., depressed). Faces labeled
   as depressed elicited more negative (i.e., sad and angry) visual
   representations (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2) than healthy faces. These
   representations were unaffected by paired neutral or negative behaviors
   unrelated to depression (Study 1a). Less stigmatizing labels (e.g.,
   having migraines) did not consistently yield more negative
   representations (Studies 1b and 2) versus healthy-labeled faces,
   suggesting a stigma-related negativity bias in visual representations.
   Arbitrary stigma labels also elicited increased brain activity
   associated with visual processing (Study 3) that was exacerbated by
   negative versus neutral paired behaviors. These findings suggest that,
   despite similar behavioral responses, available behavioral cues may
   impact mechanisms underlying the visual processing of stigmatized
   targets. Together, these findings evince that arbitrary stigma labels
   fundamentally change how faces are visually processed and represented.}},

Abstract = {{Research using the Stop Signal Task employing an adaptive algorithm to
   accommodate individual differences often report inferior performance on
   the task in individuals with ADHD, OCD, and substance use disorders
   compared to non-clinical controls. Furthermore, individuals with
   deficits in inhibitory control tend to show reduced neural activity in
   key inhibitory regions during successful stopping. However, the adaptive
   algorithm systematically introduces performance-related differences in
   objective task difficulty that may influence the estimation of
   individual differences in stop-related neural activity. This report
   examines the effect that these algorithm-related differences have on the
   measurement of neural activity during the stop signal task. We compared
   two groups of subjects (n = 210) who differed in inhibitory ability
   using both a standard fMRI analysis and an analysis that resampled
   trials to remove the objective task difficulty confound. The results
   show that objective task difficulty influences the magnitude of
   between-group differences and that controlling for difficulty attenuates
   stop-related activity differences between superior and poor inhibitors.
   Specifically, group differences in the right inferior frontal gyrus,
   right middle occipital gyrus, and left inferior frontal gyrus are
   diminished when differences in objective task difficulty are controlled
   for. Also, when objective task difficulty effects are exaggerated, group
   differences in stop related activity emerge in other regions of the
   stopping network. The implications of these effects for how we interpret
   individual differences in activity levels are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Stress is a major risk factor for almost all psychiatric disorders,
   however, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain largely
   elusive. In healthy individuals, a successful stress response involves
   an adequate neuronal adaptation to a changing environment. This adaptive
   response may be dysfunctional in vulnerable individuals, potentially
   contributing to the development of psychopathology. In the current
   study, we investigated brain responses to emotional stimuli following
   stress in healthy controls and at-risk individuals. An fMRI study was
   conducted in healthy male controls (N = 39) and unaffected healthy male
   siblings of schizophrenia patients (N = 39) who are at increased risk
   for the development of a broad range of psychiatric disorders. Brain
   responses to pictures from the International Affective Picture System
   (IAPS) were measured 33 min after exposure to stress induced by the
   validated trier social stress test (TSST) or a control condition.
   Stress-induced levels of cortisol, alpha-amylase, and subjective stress
   were comparable in both groups. Yet, stress differentially affected
   brain responses of schizophrenia siblings versus controls. Specifically,
   control subjects, but not schizophrenia siblings, showed reduced brain
   activity in key nodes of the default mode network (PCC/precuneus and
   mPFC) and salience network (anterior insula) as well as the STG, MTG,
   MCC, vlPFC, precentral gyrus, and cerebellar vermis in response to all
   pictures following stress. These results indicate that even in the
   absence of a psychiatric disorder, at-risk individuals display abnormal
   functional activation following stress, which in turn may increase their
   vulnerability and risk for adverse outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Conduct disorder (CD) causes high financial and social costs, not only
   in affected families but across society, with only moderately effective
   treatments so far. There is consensus that CD is likely caused by the
   convergence of many different factors, including genetic and adverse
   environmental factors. There is ample evidence of gene-environment
   interactions in the etiology of CD on a behavioral level regarding
   genetically sensitive designs and candidate gene-driven approaches, most
   prominently and consistently represented by MAOA. However, conclusive
   indications of causal GxE patterns are largely lacking. Inconsistent
   findings, lack of replication and methodological limitations remain a
   major challenge. Likewise, research addressing the identification of
   affected brain pathways which reflect plausible biological mechanisms
   underlying GxE is still very sparse. Future research will have to take
   multilevel approaches into account, which combine genetic,
   environmental, epigenetic, personality, neural and hormone perspectives.
   A better understanding of relevant GxE patterns in the etiology of CD
   might enable researchers to design customized treatment options (e.g.
   biofeedback interventions) for specific subgroups of patients. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Individual self-esteem is dominated more by agency than by communion.
   However, prior research has mainly focused on one's agentic/communal
   self-evaluation, while little is known about how one endorses others'
   agentic/communal evaluation of the self. The present study investigated
   the associations between trait self-esteem and fundamental dimensions of
   social cognition, i.e. agency vs. communion, during both self-evaluation
   and endorsement of others' evaluation of oneself. We also investigated
   the neural mechanisms underlying the relationship between trait
   self-esteem and agentic self-evaluation. Behavioral results revealed
   that self-esteem was positively correlated with the agentic ratings from
   self-evaluation and endorsement of others' evaluation of the self, and
   that the agentic self-evaluation was a significant full mediator between
   self-esteem and endorsement of others' agentic evaluation. Whole-brain
   regression analysis revealed that self-esteem was negatively correlated
   with right dorsolateral prefrontal and bilateral thalamic response to
   agentic self-evaluation. A possible interpretation is that low
   self-esteem people both hold a more self-critical attitude about the
   self and have less certainty or clarity of their self-concepts than high
   self-esteem people do. These findings have important implication for
   understanding the neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying
   self-esteem's effect on one's agentic self-evaluations. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Analysis of task-based fMRI data is conventionally carried out using a
   hypothesis-driven approach, where blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD)
   time courses are correlated with a hypothesized temporal structure. In
   some experimental designs, this temporal structure can be difficult to
   define. In other cases, experimenters may wish to take a more
   exploratory, data-driven approach to detecting task-driven BOLD
   activity. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency and power of an
   inter-subject synchronization approach for exploratory analysis of
   task-based fMRI data. Combining the tools of instantaneous phase
   synchronization and independent component analysis, we characterize
   whole-brain task-driven responses in terms of group-wise similarity in
   temporal signal dynamics of brain networks. We applied this framework to
   fMRI data collected during performance of a simple motor task and a
   social cognitive task. Analyses using an inter-subject phase
   synchronization approach revealed a large number of brain networks that
   dynamically synchronized to various features of the task, often not
   predicted by the hypothesized temporal structure of the task. We suggest
   that this methodological framework, along with readily available tools
   in the fMRI community, provides a powerful exploratory, data-driven
   approach for analysis of task-driven BOLD activity.}},

Title = {{Empathic Neural Responses Predict Group Allegiance}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Watching another person in pain activates brain areas involved in the
   sensation of our own pain. Importantly, this neural mirroring is not
   constant; rather, it is modulated by our beliefs about their intentions,
   circumstances, and group allegiances. We investigated if the neural
   empathic response is modulated by minimally-differentiating information
   (e.g., a simple text label indicating another's religious belief), and
   if neural activity changes predict ingroups and outgroups across
   independent paradigms. We found that the empathic response was larger
   when participants viewed a painful event occurring to a hand labeled
   with their own religion (ingroup) than to a hand labeled with a
   different religion (outgroup). Counterintuitively, the magnitude of this
   bias correlated positively with the magnitude of participants'
   self-reported empathy. A multivariate classifier, using mean activity in
   empathy-related brain regions as features, discriminated ingroup from
   outgroup with 72\% accuracy; the classifier's confidence correlated with
   belief certainty. This classifier generalized successfully to validation
   experiments in which the ingroup condition was based on an arbitrary
   group assignment. Empathy networks thus allow for the classification of
   long-held, newly-modified and arbitrarily-formed ingroups and outgroups.
   This is the first report of a single machine learning model on neural
   activation that generalizes to multiple representations of ingroup and
   outgroup. The current findings may prove useful as an objective
   diagnostic tool to measure the magnitude of one's group affiliations,
   and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce ingroup biases.}},

Title = {{Distinction Between Variability-Based Modulation and Mean-Based
   Activation Revealed by BOLD-fMRI and Eyes-Open/Eyes-Closed Contrast}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Recent BOLD-fMRI studies have revealed spatial distinction between
   variability- and mean-based between-condition differences, suggesting
   that BOLD variability could offer complementary and even orthogonal
   views of brain function with traditional activation. However, these
   findings were mainly observed in block-designed fMRI studies. As block
   design may not be appreciate for characterizing the low-frequency
   dynamics of BOLD signal, the evidences suggesting the distinction
   between BOLD variability and mean are less convincing. Based on the high
   reproducibility of signal variability modulation between continuous
   eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) states, here we employed EO/EC
   paradigm and BOLD-fMRI to compare variability- and mean-based EO/EC
   differences while the subjects were in light. The comparisons were made
   both on block-designed and continuous EO/EC data. Our results
   demonstrated that the spatial patterns of variability- and mean-based
   EO/EC differences were largely distinct with each other, both for
   block-designed and continuous data. For continuous data, increases of
   BOLD variability were found in secondary visual cortex and decreases
   were mainly in primary auditory cortex, primary sensorimotor cortex and
   medial nuclei of thalamus, whereas no significant mean-based differences
   were observed. For the block-designed data, the pattern of increased
   variability resembled that of continuous data and the negative regions
   were restricted to medial thalamus and a few clusters in auditory and
   sensorimotor networks, whereas activation regions were mainly located in
   primary visual cortex and lateral nuclei of thalamus. Furthermore, with
   the expanding window analyses we found variability results of continuous
   data exhibited a rather slower dynamical process than typically
   considered for task activation, suggesting block design is less optimal
   than continuous design in characterizing BOLD variability. In sum, we
   provided more solid evidences that variability-based modulation could
   represent orthogonal views of brain function with traditional mean-based
   activation.}},

Abstract = {{The human eye can provide powerful insights into the emotions and
   intentions of others; however, how pupillary changes influence
   observers' behavior remains largely unknown. The present
   fMRI-pupillometry study revealed that when the pupils of interacting
   partners synchronously dilate, trust is promoted, which suggests that
   pupil mimicry affiliates people. Here we provide evidence that pupil
   mimicry modulates trust decisions through the activation of the
   theory-of-mind network (precuneus, temporo-parietal junction, superior
   temporal sulcus, and medial prefrontal cortex). This network was
   recruited during pupil-dilation mimicry compared with interactions
   without mimicry or compared with pupil-constriction mimicry.
   Furthermore, the level of theory-of-mind engagement was proportional to
   individual's susceptibility to pupil-dilation mimicry. These data reveal
   a fundamental mechanism by which an individual's pupils trigger
   neurophysiological responses within an observer: when interacting
   partners synchronously dilate their pupils, humans come to feel
   reflections of the inner states of others, which fosters trust
   formation.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{People differ greatly in their financial risk taking behaviour. This
   heterogeneity has been associated with differences in brain activity,
   but only in laboratory settings using constrained behaviours. However,
   it is important to understand how these measures transfer to real life
   conditions, because the willingness to invest in riskier assets has a
   direct and considerable effect on long-term wealth accumulation. In a
   large fMRI study of 157 working age men (39.0 +/- 6.4 SD years), we
   first show that activity in the anterior insula during the assessment of
   risky vs. safe choices in an investing task is associated with
   self-reported real-life active stock trading. We then show that this
   association remains intact when we control for financial constraints,
   education, the understanding of financial matters, and cognitive
   abilities. Finally, we use comprehensive measures of preferences and
   beliefs about risk taking to show that these two channels mediate the
   association between brain activation in the anterior insula and
   real-life active stock trading.}},

Abstract = {{All primates communicate. To dissect the neural circuits of social
   communication, we used fMRI to map non- human primate brain regions for
   social perception, second- person (interactive) social cognition, and
   orofacial movement generation. Face perception, second- person
   cognition, and face motor networks were largely non- overlapping and
   acted as distinct functional units rather than an integrated
   feedforward- processing pipeline. Whereas secondperson context
   selectively engaged a region of medial prefrontal cortex, production of
   orofacial movements recruited distributed subcortical and cortical areas
   in medial and lateral frontal and insular cortex. These areas exhibited
   some specialization, but not dissociation, of function along the
   mediolateral axis. Production of lipsmack movements recruited areas
   including putative homologs of Broca's area. These findings provide a
   new view of the neural architecture for social communication and suggest
   expressive orofacial movements generated by lateral premotor cortex as a
   putative evolutionary precursor to human speech.}},

Abstract = {{Brain systems underlying human memory function have been classically
   investigated studying patients with selective memory impairments. The
   discovery of rare individuals who have highly superior autobiographical
   memory (HSAM) provides, instead, an opportunity to investigate the brain
   systems underlying enhanced memory. Here, we carried out an fMRI
   investigation of a group of subjects identified as having HSAM. During
   fMRI scanning, eight subjects with HSAM and 21 control subjects were
   asked to retrieve autobiographical memories (AMs) as well as non-AMs
   (e.g., examples of animals). Subjects were instructed to signal the
   ``access{''} to an AM by a key press and to continue ``reliving{''} it
   immediately after. Compared with controls, individuals with HSAM
   provided a richer AM recollection and were faster in accessing AMs. The
   access to AMs was associated with enhanced prefrontal/hippocampal
   functional connectivity. AM access also induced increased activity in
   the left temporoparietal junction and enhanced functional coupling with
   sensory cortices in subjects with HSAM compared with controls. In
   contrast, subjects with HSAM did not differ from controls in functional
   activity during the reliving phase. These findings, based on fMRI
   assessment, provide evidence of interaction of brain systems engaged in
   memory retrieval and suggest that enhanced activity of these systems is
   selectively involved in enabling more efficient access to past
   experiences in HSAM.}},

Title = {{Emotion Regulation Using Virtual Environments and Real-Time fMRI
   Neurofeedback}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{Neurofeedback (NFB) enables the voluntary regulation of brain activity,
   with promising applications to enhance and recover emotion and cognitive
   processes, and their underlying neurobiology. It remains unclear whether
   NFB can be used to aid and sustain complex emotions, with ecological
   validity implications. We provide a technical proof of concept of a
   novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) NFB
   procedure. Using rtfMRI-NFB, we enabled participants to voluntarily
   enhance their own neural activity while they experienced complex
   emotions. The rtfMRI-NFB software (FRIEND Engine) was adapted to provide
   a virtual environment as brain computer interface (BCI) and musical
   excerpts to induce two emotions (tenderness and anguish), aided by
   participants' preferred personalized strategies to maximize the
   intensity of these emotions. Eight participants from two experimental
   sites performed rtfMRI-NFB on two consecutive days in a counterbalanced
   design. On one day, rtfMRI-NFB was delivered to participants using a
   region of interest (ROI) method, while on the other day using a support
   vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our multimodal VR/NFB approach was
   technically feasible and robust as a method for real-time measurement of
   the neural correlates of complex emotional states and their voluntary
   modulation. Guided by the color changes of the virtual environment BCI
   during rtfMRI-NFB, participants successfully increased in real time, the
   activity of the septohypothalamic area and the amygdala during the ROI
   based rtfMRI-NFB, and successfully evoked distributed patterns of brain
   activity classified as tenderness and anguish during SVM-based
   rtfMRI-NFB. Offline fMRI analyses confirmed that during tenderness
   rtfMRI-NFB conditions, participants recruited the septo-hypothalamic
   area and other regions ascribed to social affiliative emotions (medial
   frontal / temporal pole and precuneus). During anguish rtfMRI-NFB
   conditions, participants recruited the amygdala and other dorsolateral
   prefrontal and additional regions associated with negative affect. These
   findings were robust and were demonstrable at the individual subject
   level, and were reflected in self-reported emotion intensity during
   rtfMRI-NFB, being observed with both ROI and SVM methods and across the
   two sites. Our multimodal VR/rtfMRI-NFB protocol provides an engaging
   tool for brain-based interventions to enhance emotional states in
   healthy subjects and may find applications in clinical conditions
   associated with anxiety, stress and impaired empathy among others.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Dyadic interactions often involve a dynamic process of mutual
   reciprocity; to steer a series of exchanges towards a desired outcome,
   both interactants must adapt their own behaviour according to that of
   their interaction partner. Understanding the brain processes behind such
   bidirectional reciprocity is therefore central to social neuroscience,
   but this requires measurement of both individuals' brains during
   real-world exchanges. We achieved this by performing functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) on pairs of male individuals simultaneously
   while they interacted in a modified iterated Ultimatum Game (iUG). In
   this modification, both players could express their intent and maximise
   their own monetary gain by reciprocating their partner's behaviour -
   they could promote generosity through cooperation and/or discourage
   unfair play with retaliation. By developing a novel model of reciprocity
   adapted from behavioural economics, we then show that each player's
   choices can be predicted accurately by estimating expected utility (EU)
   not only in terms of immediate payoff, but also as a reaction to their
   opponent's prior behaviour. Finally, for the first time we reveal that
   brain signals implicated in social decision making are modulated by
   these estimates of EU, and become correlated more strongly between
   interacting players who reciprocate one another.}},

Title = {{Altered Long- and Short-Range Functional Connectivity Density in Healthy
   Subjects After Sleep Deprivations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the brain functional organization induced by
   sleep deprivation (SD) using functional connectivity density (FCD)
   analysis.
   Methods: Twenty healthy subjects (12 female, 8 male; mean age, 20.6 +/-
   1.9 years) participated a 24 h sleep deprivation (SD) design. All
   subjects underwent the MRI scan and attention network test twice, once
   during rested wakefulness (RW) status, and the other was after 24 h
   acute SD. FCD was divided into the shortFCD and longFCD. Receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the
   discriminating ability of those FCD differences in brain areas during
   the SD status from the RW status, while Pearson correlations was used to
   evaluate the relationships between those differences and behavioral
   performances.
   Results: Subjects at SD status exhibited lower accuracy rate and longer
   reaction time relative to RW status. Compared with RW, SD had a
   significant decreased shortFCD in the left cerebellum posterior lobe,
   right cerebellum anterior lobe, and right orbitofrontal cortex, and
   increased shortFCD in the left occipital gyrus, bilateral thalamus,
   right paracentral lobule, bilateral precentral gyrus, and bilateral
   postcentral gyrus. Compared with RW, SD had a significant increased
   longFCD in the right precentral gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, and
   right visuospatial network, and decreased longFCD in the default mode
   network. The area under the curve values of those specific FCD
   differences in brain areas were (mean +/- std, 0.933 +/- 0.035; 0.863
   similar to 0.977). Further ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the FCD
   differences in those brain areas alone discriminated the SD status from
   the RW status with high degree of sensitivities (89.19 +/- 6\%; 81.3
   similar to 100\%) and specificities (89.15 +/- 6.87\%; 75 similar to
   100\%). Reaction time showed a negative correlation with the right
   orbitofrontal cortex (r = -0.48, p = 0.032), and accuracy rate
   demonstrated a positive correlation with the right default mode network
   (r = 0.573, p = 0.008).
   Conclusions: The longFCD and shortFCD analysis might be potential
   indicator biomarkers to locate the underlying altered intrinsic brain
   functional organization disturbed by SD. SD sustains the cognitive
   performance by the decreased high-order cognition related areas and the
   arousal and sensorimotor related areas.}},

Title = {{Differential recruitment of theory of mind brain network across three
   tasks: An independent component analysis}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{347}},
Pages = {{385-393}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Social neuroscience research has focused on an identified network of
   brain regions primarily associated with processing Theory of Mind (ToM).
   However, ToM is a broad cognitive process, which encompasses several
   sub-processes, such as mental state detection and intentional
   attribution, and the connectivity of brain regions underlying the
   broader ToM network in response to paradigms assessing these
   sub-processes requires further characterization. Standard fMRI analyses
   which focus only on brain activity cannot capture information about ToM
   processing at a network level. An alternative method, independent
   component analysis (ICA), is a data-driven technique used to isolate
   intrinsic connectivity networks, and this approach provides insight into
   network-level regional recruitment. In this fMRI study, three
   complementary, but distinct ToM tasks assessing mental state detection
   (e.g. RMIE: Reading the Mind in the Eyes; RMIV Reading the Mind in the
   Voice) and intentional attribution (Causality task) were each analyzed
   using ICA in order to separately characterize the recruitment and
   functional connectivity of core nodes in the ToM network in response to
   the sub-processes of ToM. Based on visual comparison of the derived
   networks for each task, the spatiotemporal network patterns were similar
   between the RMIE and RMIV tasks, which elicited mentalizmg about the
   mental states of others, and these networks differed from the network
   derived for the Causality task, which elicited mentalizing about
   goal-directed actions. The medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and
   right inferior frontal gyrus were seen in the components with the
   highest correlation with the task condition for each of the tasks
   highlighting the role of these regions in general ToM processing. Using
   a data-driven approach, the current study captured the differences in
   task related brain response to ToM in three distinct ToM paradigms. The
   findings of this study further elucidate the neural mechanisms
   associated with mental state detection and causal attribution, which
   represent possible sub-processes of the complex construct of ToM
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: To explore the domain-general risk factor of early-life
   social stress in mental illness, rearing rodents in persistent
   postweaning social isolation has been established as a widely used
   animal model with translational relevance for neurodevelopmental
   psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Although changes in
   resting-state brain connectivity are a transdiagnostic key finding in
   neurodevelopmental diseases, a characterization of imaging correlates
   elicited by early-life social stress is lacking.
   METHODS: We performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging of postweaning social isolation rats (N = 23) 9 weeks after
   isolation. Addressing well-established transdiagnostic connectivity
   changes of psychiatric disorders, we focused on altered frontal and
   posterior connectivity using a seed-based approach. Then, we examined
   changes in regional network architecture and global topology using graph
   theoretical analysis.
   RESULTS: Seed-based analyses demonstrated reduced functional
   connectivity in frontal brain regions and increased functional
   connectivity in posterior brain regions of postweaning social isolation
   rats. Graph analyses revealed a shift of the regional architecture,
   characterized by loss of dominance of frontal regions and emergence of
   nonfrontal regions, correlating to our behavioral results, and a reduced
   modularity in isolation-reared rats.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our result of functional connectivity alterations in the
   frontal brain supports previous investigations postulating social neural
   circuits, including prefrontal brain regions, as key pathways for risk
   for mental disorders arising through social stressors. We extend this
   knowledge by demonstrating more widespread changes of brain network
   organization elicited by early-life social stress, namely a shift of
   hubness and dysmodularity. Our results highly resemble core alterations
   in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia,
   autism, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in humans.}},

Title = {{Correlation of neural activity with behavioral kinematics reveals

   active tactile sensing}},

Abstract = {{Many real-world decisions rely on active sensing, a dynamic process for
   directing our sensors (e.g. eyes or fingers) across a stimulus to
   maximize information gain. Though ecologically pervasive, limited work
   has focused on identifying neural correlates of the active sensing
   process. In tactile perception, we often make decisions about an
   object/surface by actively exploring its shape/texture. Here we
   investigate the neural correlates of active tactile decision-making by
   simultaneously measuring electroencephalography (EEG) and finger
   kinematics while subjects interrogated a haptic surface to make
   perceptual judgments. Since sensorimotor behavior underlies decision
   formation in active sensing tasks, we hypothesized that the neural
   correlates of decision-related processes would be detectable by relating
   active sensing to neural activity. Novel brain-behavior correlation
   analysis revealed that three distinct EEG components, localizing to
   right-lateralized occipital cortex (LOC), middle frontal gyrus (MFG),
   and supplementary motor area (SMA), respectively, were coupled with
   active sensing as their activity significantly correlated with finger
   kinematics. To probe the functional role of these components, we fit
   their single-trialcouplings to decision-making performance using a
   hierarchical-drift-diffusion-model (HDDM), revealing that the LOC
   modulated the encoding of the tactile stimulus whereas the MFG predicted
   the rate of information integration towards a choice. Interestingly, the
   MFG disappeared from components uncovered from control subjects
   performing active sensing but not required to make perceptual decisions.
   By uncovering the neural correlates of distinct stimulus encoding and
   evidence accumulation processes, this study delineated, for the first
   time, the functional role of cortical areas in active tactile
   decision-making.}},

Title = {{Contribution of the Lateral Prefrontal Cortex to Cognitive-Postural
   Multitasking}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{There is evidence for cortical contribution to the regulation of human
   postural control. Interference from concurrently performed cognitive
   tasks supports this notion, and the lateral prefrontal cortex (IPFC) has
   been suggested to play a prominent role in the processing of purely
   cognitive as well as cognitive-postural dual tasks. The degree of
   cognitive-motor interference varies greatly between individuals, but it
   is unresolved whether individual differences in the recruitment of
   specific lPFC regions during cognitive dual tasking are associated with
   individual differences in cognitive-motor interference. Here, we
   investigated inter-individual variability in a cognitive-postural
   multitasking situation in healthy young adults (n = 29) in order to
   relate these to inter-individual variability in IPFC recruitment during
   cognitive multitasking. For this purpose, a oneback working memory task
   was performed either as single task or as dual task in order to vary
   cognitive load. Participants performed these cognitive single and dual
   tasks either during upright stance on a balance pad that was placed on
   top of a force plate or during fMRI measurement with little to no
   postural demands. We hypothesized dual one-back task performance to be
   associated with IPFC recruitment when compared to single one-back task
   performance. In addition, we expected individual variability in IPFC
   recruitment to be associated with postural performance costs during
   concurrent dual one-back performance. As expected, behavioral
   performance costs in postural sway during dual-one back performance
   largely varied between individuals and so did IPFC recruitment during
   dual one-back performance. Most importantly, individuals who recruited
   the right mid-IPFC to a larger degree during dual one-back performance
   also showed greater postural sway as measured by larger performance
   costs in total center of pressure displacements. This effect was
   selective to the high-load dual one-back task and suggests a crucial
   role of the right lPFC in allocating resources during cognitivemotor
   interference. Our study provides further insight into the mechanisms
   underlying cognitive-motor multitasking and its impairments.}},

   Response to Violence: Implications for Public Health and Policy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{While social and behavioral effects of violence in the media have been
   studied extensively, much less is known about how sports affect
   perceptions of violence. The current study examined neurofunctional
   differences between fans and non-fans of North American football (a
   contact sport) while viewing violent imagery. Participants viewed images
   of violence in both football and non-football settings while
   high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were
   acquired from their brains. Neurological activation was compared between
   these violence types and between groups. Fans of football show
   diminished activation in brain regions involved in pain perception and
   empathy such as the anterior cingulate cortex, fusiform gyrus, insula,
   and temporal pole when viewing violence in the context of football
   compared to more broadly violent images. Non-fans of football showed no
   such effect for the types of violent imagery and had higher activation
   levels than fans of football for the specified brain regions. These
   differences show that fans of football may perceive violence differently
   when it is in the context of football. These fan attitudes have
   potential policy implications for addressing the issue of concussions in
   North American football.}},

Abstract = {{Written language is a human invention that our brains did not evolve
   for. Yet, most research has focused on finding a single theory of
   reading, identifying the common set of cognitive and neural processes
   shared across individuals, neglecting individual differences.In
   contrast, we investigated variation in single word reading. Using a
   novel statistical method for analyzing heterogeneity in multi-subject
   task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we clustered
   readers based on their brain's response to written stimuli. Separate
   behavioral testing and neuroimaging analysis shows that these clusters
   differed in the role of the sublexical pathway in processing written
   language, but not in reading skill. Taken together, these results
   suggest that individuals vary in the cognitive and neural mechanisms
   involved in word reading. In general, neurocognitive theories need to
   account not only for what tends to be true of the population, but also
   the types of variation that exist, even within a neurotypical
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Drug related cue-induced reactivity plays a significant role in

   of Dorsolateral striatum-Sensorimotor system (DLS-SM) has been suggested

   using behavior. The current study used fMRI to investigate the
   reactivity of heroin abstinent individuals to different types of cues,
   to clarify the characteristics of the cues that induce the activation of
   the sensorimotor area. Forty heroin-dependent abstinent individuals and
   29 healthy subjects were recruited to perform the heroin cue-reactivity
   task during fMRI. The participants' subjective craving and physical
   signs were evaluated before and after scanning. Whole-brain analysis
   showed that compared to drug use tool and drug cues, cues related to
   drug use action were more likely to activate posterior central gyrus,
   para-hippocampus, supra marginal gyrus, superior parietal lobule (SPL)
   and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). These areas are involved in motor
   preparation and output, indicating that the sensorimotor area is also an
   important neural basis of craving and automatic drug using behavior, and
   may mediate craving and drug seeking behavior. Our findings thus suggest
   that cues related to drug using action may induce automatic drug seeking
   behavior more than cues related only to the drug itself.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Individuals with eating disorders are theorized to have basic
   impairments in affective appraisal and social-emotional processing that
   contribute to pathogenesis of the disease. We aimed to determine if
   facial electromyography could be used to discriminate between happy and
   disgust emotions during simultaneous acquisition of an fMRI BOLD
   sequence in efforts to establish a novel tool for investigating
   emotion-driven hypotheses about eating pathology. In line with standards
   for rigor and reproducibility, we provide detailed protocols and code to
   support each step of this project.
   Method: Sixteen adolescents with low-weight eating disorders viewed
   emotional faces (Happy or Disgust) and were asked to mimic their facial
   expression during simultaneous BOLD and EMG (Corrugator supercilli,
   Lavator lavii, Zygomaticus major) acquisition. Trials were repeated with
   the scanner off and again with scanner on (i.e., fatigue).
   Results: The Levator and Zygomaticus activation patterns discriminated
   disgust and happy faces successfully. The pattern held between scanner
   on and off conditions, but muscle activation attenuated in the Fatigue
   condition, especially for the Zygomaticus.
   Discussion: Simultaneous fMRI-EMG is a new tool capable of
   discriminating specific emotions based on muscle activation patterns and
   can be leveraged to answer emotion-driven hypotheses about clinical
   populations characterized by difficulty labeling or processing emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Interoception refers to the processing of homeostatic bodily signals.
   Research demonstrates that interoceptive markers can be modulated via
   exteroceptive stimuli and suggests that the emotional content of this
   information may produce distinct interoceptive outcomes. Here, we
   explored the impact of differently valenced exteroceptive information on
   the processing of interoceptive signals. Participants completed a
   repetition-suppression paradigm viewing repeating or alternating faces.
   In experiment 1, faces wore either angry or pained expressions to
   explore the interoceptive response to different types of negative
   stimuli in the observer. In experiment 2, expressions were happy or sad
   to compare interoceptive processing of positive and negative
   information. We measured the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) and visual
   evoked potentials (VEPs) as a respective marker of intero- and
   exteroceptive processing. We observed increased HEP amplitude to
   repeated sad and pained faces coupled with reduced HEP and VEP amplitude
   to repeated angry faces. No effects were observed for positive faces.

Abstract = {{Facial expressions offer an ecologically valid model for examining
   individual differences in affective decision-making. They convey an
   emotional signal from a social agent and provide important predictive
   information about one's environment (presence of potential rewards or
   threats). Although some expressions provide clear predictive information
   (angry, happy), others (surprised) are ambiguous in that they predict
   both positive and negative outcomes. Thus, surprised faces can delineate
   an individual's valence bias, or the tendency to interpret ambiguity as
   positive or negative. Our initial negativity hypothesis suggests that
   the initial response to ambiguity is negative, and that positivity
   relies on emotion regulation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing
   brain activity during explicit emotion regulation (reappraisal) and
   while freely viewing facial expressions, and measuring the relationship
   between brain activity and valence bias. Brain regions recruited during
   reappraisal showed greater activity for surprise in individuals with an
   increasingly positive valence bias. Additionally, we linked amygdala
   activity with an initial negativity, revealing a pattern similarity in
   individuals with negative bias between viewing surprised faces and
   maintaining negativity. Finally, these individuals failed to show normal
   habituation to clear negativity. These results support the initial
   negativity hypothesis, and are consistent with emotion research in both
   children and adult populations.}},

Abstract = {{Psychological resilience reflects the capacity to bounce back from
   stress, which plays an important role in health and well-being. However,
   less is known about the neural substrate for psychological resilience
   and the underlying mechanism for how psychological resilience enhances
   subjective well-being in the healthy brain. To investigate these issues,
   we employed fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF)
   measured with resting-state fMRI in 100 young healthy adults. The
   correlation analysis found that higher psychological resilience was
   related to lower fALFF in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which is
   involved in reward-related processing and emotion regulation.
   Furthermore, the mediation analysis indicated that psychological
   resilience acted as a full mediator of the association between the fALFF
   in left OFC and subjective well-being indicators (i.e. life satisfaction
   and hedonic balance). Importantly, these results remained significant
   after controlling for the effect of gray matter volume and regional
   homogeneity in the region. Overall, the present study provides the
   further evidence for functional neural substrates of psychological
   resilience and reveals a potential mechanism that psychological
   resilience mediates the effect of spontaneous brain activity on
   subjective well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Previous behavioral and neuroimaging work indicates that individuals who
   are externally motivated to respond without racial prejudice tend not to
   spontaneously regulate their prejudice and prefer to focus on nonracial
   attributes when evaluating others. This fMRI multivariate analysis used
   partial least squares analysis to examine the distributed neural
   processing of race and a relevant but ostensibly nonracial attribute
   (i.e., socioeconomic status) as a function of the perceiver's external
   motivation. Sixty-one white male participants (Homo sapiens) privately
   formed impressions of black and white male faces ascribed with high or
   low status. Across all conditions, greater external motivation was
   associated with reduced coactivation of brain regions believed to
   support emotion regulation (rostral anterior cingulate cortex),
   introspection (middle cingulate), and social cognition (temporal pole,
   medial prefrontal cortex). The reduced involvement of this network
   irrespective of target race and status suggests that external motivation
   is related to the participant's overall approach to impression formation
   in an interracial context. The findings highlight the importance of
   examining network coactivation in understanding the role of external
   motivation in impression formation, among other interracial social
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy and prosocial behaviors toward peers promote successful social
   development and creation of significant long-term relationships, but
   surprisingly little is known about the maturation of these skills during
   the period of adolescence. As the majority of studies have used
   questionnaires or pain observation paradigms, it remains unknown whether
   the empathic response of adolescents differs from that of adults in a
   paradigm that is closer to everyday life. In the current study, fMRI was
   used to examine the neural correlates of social exclusion observation
   and subsequent prosocial behavior in 20 adolescents (aged 12-17 years)
   and 20 adults (aged 22-30 years) while playing a ball-tossing game with
   what they believed to be real individuals. Observing someone being
   excluded compared to observing equal inclusion of all players elicited a
   significantly higher activation of the IFG (pars triangularis) in adults
   compared to adolescents. When given the opportunity to directly help the
   excluded player during the game, adolescents showed significantly less
   prosocial behavior than adults, which was underpinned by a significantly
   lower activity in the right temporoparietal junction, medial/dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex and fusiform face area. These findings might indicate
   that adolescents have a lower propensity to take the victim's
   perspective and share his or her distress when witnessing social
   exclusion, which leads to a lower altruistic motivation to help. The
   factors that could generate what can be interpreted as a downward
   modulation of empathy during adolescence are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Our goal was to assess the effects of long-term mental training in
   socio-affective skills on structural brain networks. We studied a group
   of long-term meditation practitioners (LTMs) who have focused on
   cultivating socio-affective skills using loving-kindness and compassion
   meditation for an average of 40k h, comparing these to meditation-naive
   controls. To maximize homogeneity of prior practice, LTMs were included
   only if they had undergone extensive full-time meditation retreats in
   the same center. MRI-based cortical thickness analysis revealed
   increased thickness in the LTM cohort relative to meditation-native
   controls in fronto-insular cortices. To identify functional networks
   relevant for the generation of socio-affective states, structural
   imaging analysis were complemented by fMRI analysis in LTMs, showing
   amplitude increases during a loving-kindness meditation session relative
   to non-meditative rest in multiple prefrontal and insular regions
   bilaterally. Importantly, functional findings partially overlapped with
   regions of cortical thickness increases in the left ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, suggesting that these regions may
   play a central role in the generation of emotional states relevant for
   the meditative practice. Our multi-modal MRI approach revealed
   structural changes in LTMs who have cultivated loving-kindness and
   compassion for a significant period of their life in functional networks
   activated by these practices. These preliminary cross-sectional findings
   motivate future longitudinal work studying brain plasticity following
   the regular practice of skills aiming at enhancing human altruism and

Abstract = {{Witnessing others' plights can be funny for observers, but may also

   misfortune) and fremdscham (i.e. empathically sharing the embarrassment
   about another's misfortune). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   we examined a total of N = 34 participants while they observed social
   integrity threats of a misfortunate other and either reported on their
   schadenfreude or fremdscham. In this between-subject design, we found
   that despite a broad overlap in brain regions involved in social
   cognition, the left anterior insula (AI) was activated less if observers
   were asked to focus on their schadenfreude. Further, the nucleus
   accumben's activity exclusively covaried with the intensity of the
   schadenfreude experience and had a higher functional connectivity with
   the left AI in the context of schadenfreude than during fremdscham. With
   the present findings, we demonstrate that the valence and intensity of
   interpersonal emotions strongly depend on the experimental context and
   that empathy and reward circuits are involved in shaping the subjective
   experience.}},

Abstract = {{Mimicry has been suggested to function as a ``social glue{''}, a key
   mechanism that helps to build social rapport. It leads to increased
   feeling of closeness toward the mimicker as well as greater liking,
   suggesting close bidirectional links with reward. In recent work using
   eye-gaze tracking, we have demonstrated that the reward value of being
   mimicked, measured using a preferential looking paradigm, is directly
   proportional to trait empathy (Neufeld and Chakrabarti, 2016). In the
   current manuscript, we investigated the reward value of the act of
   mimicking, using a simple task manipulation that involved allowing or
   inhibiting spontaneous facial mimicry in response to dynamic expressions
   of positive emotion. We found greater reward-related neural activity in
   response to the condition where mimicry was allowed compared to that
   where mimicry was inhibited. The magnitude of this link from mimicry to
   reward response was positively correlated to trait empathy.}},

Abstract = {{People's sensitivity to first-hand pain is affected by their ongoing
   emotions, with positive states (joy, amusement) exerting analgesic-like
   effects, and negative states (sadness, fear) often enhancing the
   subjective experience. It is however less clear how empathetic responses
   to others' pain are affected by one's own emotional state. Following
   embodied accounts that posit a shared representational code between self
   and others' states, it is plausible that pain empathy might be
   influenced by emotions in the same way as first-hand pain.
   Alternatively, other theories in psychology suggest that social
   resources (including empathetic reactions) might be enhanced by positive
   states, but inhibited by negative states, as only in the former case,
   one's mindset is sufficiently broad to take into consideration others'
   needs. To disambiguate between these opposing predictions, we conducted
   two experiments in which volunteers observed positive, neutral, or
   negative video clips, and subsequently either received painful thermal
   stimuli on their own body (first-hand pain), or observed images of
   wounded hands (others' pain). We measured subjective pain ratings as
   well as physiological responses and brain activity using fMRI. We found
   that, contrary to the case of first-hand pain, others' pain produced
   weaker galvanic responses and lower neural activity in anterior insula
   and middle cingulate cortex following negative (relative to neutral and
   positive) videos. Such inhibition was partially counteracted by personal
   empathy traits, as individuals with higher scores retained greater
   sensitivity to others' pain after negative emotion induction, in both
   behavioral and neural responses in medial prefrontal cortex.
   Furthermore, multivoxel pattern analysis confirmed similar neural
   representation for first-hand and others' pain in anterior insula, with
   representation similarity increasing the more the video preceding the
   observation of others' suffering was positive. These findings speak
   against the idea that emotion induction affects first-hand and others'
   pain in an isomorphic way, but rather supports the idea that contrary to
   negative emotions, positive emotions favors a broader access to social
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{Social exclusion has been shown to influence sensitivity to physical

   be seeking out the company of a close other. Based on this prediction,
   we hypothesized that the presence of an attachment figure versus a

   and thus stronger reports of physical pain. Healthy participants
   reported their pain sensitivity before receiving exclusion or inclusion
   feedback in an online chat. Participants were then randomly assigned to
   have access to their attachment figure or a stranger and had pain
   sensitivity measured again. As predicted, excluded participants who had
   access to their attachment figure evidenced heightened pain sensitivity
   (lower pain threshold and tolerance), whereas those who sat with a
   stranger evidenced some degree of a decrease in pain sensitivity (higher
   pain tolerance). These data may shed light on the impact social ties can
   have during painful situations.}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been found to be associated with
   alterations in resting state (RS) functional connectivity, including
   areas forming the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN).
   However, insufficient control for confounding genetic and environmental
   influences and other methodological issues limit the generalizability of
   previous findings. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that ASD might be
   marked by early hyper-connectivity followed by later hypo-connectivity.
   To date, only a few studies have explicitly tested age-related
   influences on RS connectivity alterations in ASD. Using a within-twin
   pair design (N = 150 twins; 8-23 years), we examined altered RS
   connectivity between core regions of the DMN and SN in relation to
   autistic trait severity and age in a sample of monozygotic (MZ) and
   dizygotic (DZ) twins showing typical development, ASD or other
   neurodevelopmental conditions. Connectivity between core regions of the
   SN was stronger in twins with higher autistic traits compared to their
   co-twins. This effect was significant both in the total sample and in MZ
   twins alone, highlighting the effect of non-shared environmental factors
   on the link between SN-connectivity and autistic traits. While this link
   was strongest in children, we did not identify differences between age
   groups for the SN. In contrast, connectivity between core hubs of the
   DMN was negatively correlated with autistic traits in adolescents and
   showed a similar trend in adults but not in children. The results
   support hypotheses of age-dependent altered RS connectivity in ASD,
   making altered SN and DMN connectivity promising candidate biomarkers
   for ASD.}},

Abstract = {{While Western cultures are more focused on individualization and

   unknown is how gene by culture interactions influence the degree to
   which individuals acquire culture, and the neurocircuitry underlying how
   social cues are processed. We sought to examine the interaction between
   DRD4 polymorphism and culture in the neural processing of social
   emotional cues. 19 Asian-born East Asian (AA) and 20 European American
   (EA) participants performed a shifted attention emotion appraisal
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task, which probes implicit
   emotional processing and regulation in response to social emotional
   cues. Half of the participants in each group were DRD4 2- or 7-repeat
   allele (2R/7R) carriers. AA participants showed larger left and right
   amygdala, and left hippocampal activation during implicit processing of
   fearful faces. There was a gene by culture interaction in the left
   insula during implicit processing of facial cues, while activation in EA
   DRD4 2R/7R carriers was larger than EA non-carriers and AA carriers. Our
   findings suggest that emotional facial cues are more salient to AA
   participants and elicit a larger amygdala reaction. Gene by culture
   interaction finding in insula suggests that DRD4 2R/7R carriers in each
   culture are more prone to adopting their cultural norm.}},

Abstract = {{Working memory-based cognitive remediation therapy (CT) for psychosis
   has recently been associated with broad improvements in performance on
   untrained tasks measuring working memory, episodic memory and IQ, and
   changes in associated brain regions. However, it is unclear whether
   these improvements transfer to the domain of social cognition and neural
   activity related to performance on social cognitive tasks. We examined
   performance on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (Eyes test) in a
   large sample of participants with psychosis who underwent working
   memory-based CT (N=43) compared to a control group of participants with
   psychosis (N=35). In a subset of this sample, we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine changes in neural activity
   during a facial emotion recognition task in participants who underwent
   CT (N=15) compared to a control group (N=15). No significant effects of
   CT were observed on Eyes test performance or on neural activity during
   facial emotion recognition, either at p<0.05 family-wise error or at a
   p<0.001 uncorrected threshold, within a priori social cognitive regions
   of interest. This study suggests that working memory-based CT does not
   significantly impact an aspect of social cognition which was measured
   behaviourally and neurally. It provides further evidence that deficits
   in the ability to decode mental state from facial expressions are
   dissociable from working memory deficits, and suggests that future CT
   programmes should target social cognition in addition to working memory
   for the purposes of further enhancing social function.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating data suggest attentional control capability varies across
   psychiatric diagnostic boundaries. The Attentional Control Scale (ACS)
   assesses self-reported trait attentional control (TAC) and tracks the
   anterior attention system. Greater TAC is associated with less negative
   affect, however, its mechanisms in anxiety and depression are poorly
   understood. Therefore, we examined whether individual differences in TAC
   modulated top-down mechanisms in a clinical sample. During fMRI, 104
   patients with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and/or major
   depression and 34 healthy participants completed a validated attentional
   control paradigm comprising strings of letters superimposed on
   threatening and neutral face distractors. In the low perceptual load
   condition, a target letter was in a string of identical letters. In the
   high load condition, a target letter was in a mixed letter string.
   Whole-brain regression results for low load revealed more activation to
   threat (vs. neutral) distractors in the pregenual anterior cingulate
   cortex was predicted by better TAC (i.e., higher ACS scores). For high
   load, regression results showed less activation to threat (vs. neutral)
   distractors in the inferior frontal gyms was predicted by better TAC. An
   exploratory whole-brain ANOVA revealed a main effect of group in the
   superior temporal gyms and a main effect of perceptual load in parietal,
   frontal, and limbic regions. No other effects were detected and
   activation derived from significant ANOVA results did not correlate with
   ACS scores. In conclusion, regression findings suggest individual
   differences in brain-behavioral ACS-related activity in frontal
   structures may be useful in identifying phenotypes in internalizing
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Decoding the neural signatures of emotions expressed through sound}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Effective social functioning relies in part on the ability to identify
   emotions from auditory stimuli and respond appropriately. Previous
   studies have uncovered brain regions engaged by the affective
   information conveyed by sound. But some of the acoustical properties of
   sounds that express certain emotions vary remarkably with the instrument
   used to produce them, for example the human voice or a violin. Do these
   brain regions respond in the same way to different emotions regardless
   of the sound source? To address this question, we had participants (N
   -38, 20 females) listen to brief audio excerpts produced by the violin,
   clarinet, and human voice, each conveying one of three target
   emotions-happiness, sadness, and fear-while brain activity was measured
   with fMRI. We used multivoxel pattern analysis to test whether
   emotion-specific neural responses to the voice could predict
   emotion-specific neural responses to musical instruments and vice-versa.
   A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed that patterns of activity
   within the primary and secondary auditory cortex, posterior insula, and
   parietal operculum were predictive of the affective content of sound
   both within and across instruments. Furthermore, classification accuracy
   within the anterior insula was correlated with behavioral measures of
   empathy. The findings suggest that these brain regions carry
   emotion-specific patterns that generalize across sounds with different
   acoustical properties. Also, individuals with greater empathic ability
   have more distinct neural patterns related to perceiving emotions. These
   results extend previous knowledge regarding how the human brain extracts
   emotional meaning from auditory stimuli and enables us to understand and
   connect with others effectively.}},

Title = {{Oxytocin attenuates trust as a subset of more general reinforcement
   learning, with altered reward circuit functional connectivity in males}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{35-43}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Oxytocin (OT) is an endogenous neuropeptide that, while originally
   thought to promote trust, has more recently been found to be
   context-dependent. Here we extend experimental paradigms previously
   restricted to de novo decision-to-trust, to a more realistic environment
   in which social relationships evolve in response to iterative feedback
   over twenty interactions. In a randomized, double blind,
   placebo-controlled within-subject/crossover experiment of human adult
   males, we investigated the effects of a single dose of intranasal OT (40
   IU) on Bayesian expectation updating and reinforcement learning within a
   social context, with associated brain circuit dynamics. Subjects
   participated in a neuroeconomic task (Iterative Trust Game) designed to
   probe iterative social learning while their brains were scanned using
   ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. We modeled each subject's behavior using
   Bayesian updating of belief-states ({''}willingness to trust{''}) as
   well as canonical measures of reinforcement learning (learning rate,
   inverse temperature). Behavioral trajectories were then used as
   regressors within fMRI activation and connectivity analyses to identify
   corresponding brain network functionality affected by OT. Behaviorally,
   OT reduced feedback learning, without bias with respect to positive
   versus negative reward. Neurobiologically, reduced learning under OT was
   associated with muted communication between three key nodes within the
   reward circuit: the orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, and lateral (limbic)
   habenula. Our data suggest that OT, rather than inspiring feelings of
   generosity, instead attenuates the brain's encoding of prediction error
   and therefore its ability to modulate pre-existing beliefs. This effect
   may underlie OT's putative role in promoting what has typically been
   reported as `unjustified trust' in the face of information that suggests
   likely betrayal, while also resolving apparent contradictions with
   regard to OT's context-dependent behavioral effects.}},

Title = {{Exposure to attachment narratives dynamically modulates cortical arousal
   during the resting state in the listener}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Affective stimulation entails changes in brain network
   patterns at rest, but it is unknown whether exogenous emotional
   stimulation has a prolonged effect on the temporal dynamics of
   endogenous cortical arousal. We therefore investigated differences in
   cortical arousal in the listener following stimulation with different
   attachment-related narratives.
   Methods: Resting-state EEG was recorded from sixteen healthy subjects
   for ten minutes each with eyes closed: first at baseline and then after
   passively listening to three affective narratives from strangers about
   their early childhood experiences (proto-typical for
   insecure-dismissing, insecure-preoccupied, and secure attachment). Using
   the VIGALL 2.1 algorithm, low or high vigilance stages in consecutive
   EEG segments were classified, and their dynamic profile was analyzed.
   Questionnaires assessed the listeners' emotional response to the content
   of the narrative.
   Results: As a general effect of preceding affective stimulation,
   vigilance following the stimulation was significantly elevated compared
   to baseline rest, and carryover effects in dynamic vigilance profiles
   were observed. A difference between narrative conditions was revealed
   for the insecure-dismissing condition, in which the decrease in duration
   of high vigilance stages was fastest compared to the other two
   conditions. The behavioral data supported the observation that
   especially the insecure narratives induced a tendency in the listener to
   affectively disengage from the narrative content.
   Discussion: This study revealed carryover effects in endogenous cortical
   arousal evoked by preceding affective stimulation and provides evidence
   for attachment-Specific dynamic alterations of brain states and
   individual differences in emotional reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{Impairment of face perception in schizophrenia is a core aspect of
   social cognitive dysfunction. This impairment is particularly marked in
   threatening face processing. Identifying reliable neural correlates of
   the impairment of threatening face processing is crucial for targeting
   more effective treatments. However, neuroimaging studies have not yet
   obtained robust conclusions. Through comprehensive literature search,
   twenty-one whole brain datasets were included in this meta-analysis.
   Using seed-based d-Mapping, in this voxel-based meta-analysis, we aimed
   to: 1) establish the most consistent brain dysfunctions related to
   threating face processing in schizophrenia; 2) address task-type
   heterogeneity in this impairment; 3) explore the effect of potential
   demographic or clinical moderator variables on this impairment. Main
   meta-analysis indicated that patients with chronic schizophrenia
   demonstrated attenuated activations in limbic emotional system along
   with compensatory over-activation in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
   during threatening faces processing. Sub-task analyses revealed
   under-activations in right amygdala and left fusiformgyrus in both
   implicit and explicit tasks. The remaining clusters were found to be
   differently involved in different types of tasks. Moreover,
   meta-regression analyses showed brain abnormalities in schizophrenia
   were partly modulated by age, gender, medication and severity of
   symptoms. Our results highlighted breakdowns in limbic-MPFC circuit in
   schizophrenia, suggesting general inability to coordinate and
   contextualize salient threat stimuli. These findings provide potential
   targets for neurotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions for
   schizophrenia. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Middle childhood marks an important phase for developing and maintaining
   social relations. At the same time, this phase is marked by a gap in our
   knowledge of the genetic and environmental influences on brain responses
   to social feedback and their relation to behavioral aggression. In a
   large developmental twin sample (509 7- to 9-year-olds), the
   heritability and neural underpinnings of behavioral aggression following
   social evaluation were investigated, using the Social Network Aggression
   Task (SNAT). Participants viewed pictures of peers that gave positive,
   neutral, or negative feedback to the participant's profile. Next,
   participants could blast a loud noise toward the peer as an index of
   aggression. Genetic modeling revealed that aggression following negative
   feedback was influenced by both genetics and environmental (shared as
   well as unique environment). On a neural level (n=385), the anterior
   insula and anterior cingulate cortex gyrus (ACCg) responded to both
   positive and negative feedback, suggesting they signal for social
   salience cues. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG) were specifically activated during negative feedback,
   whereas positive feedback resulted in increased activation in caudate,
   supplementary motor cortex (SMA), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC). Decreased SMA and DLPFC activation during negative feedback was
   associated with more aggressive behavior after negative feedback.
   Moreover, genetic modeling showed that 13\%-14\% of the variance in
   dorsolateral PFC activity was explained by genetics. Our results suggest
   that the processing of social feedback is partly explained by genetic
   factors, whereas shared environmental influences play a role in
   behavioral aggression following feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Learning occurs when an outcome differs from expectations, generating a
   reward prediction error signal (RPE). The RPE signal has been
   hypothesized to simultaneously embody the valence of an outcome (better
   or worse than expected) and its surprise (how far from expectations).
   Nonetheless, growing evidence suggests that separate representations of
   the two RPE components exist in the human brain. Meta-analyses provide
   an opportunity to test this hypothesis and directly probe the extent to
   which the valence and surprise of the error signal are encoded in
   separate or overlapping networks. We carried out several meta-analyses
   on a large set of fMRI studies investigating the neural basis of RPE,
   locked at decision outcome. We identified two valence learning systems
   by pooling studies searching for differential neural activity in
   response to categorical positive-versus-negative outcomes. The first
   valence network (negative>positive) involved areas regulating alertness
   and switching behaviours such as the midcingulate cortex, the thalamus
   and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex whereas the second valence
   network (positive>negative) encompassed regions of the human reward
   circuitry such as the ventral striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex. We also found evidence of a largely distinct surprise-encoding
   network including the anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and
   dorsal striatum. Together with recent animal and electrophysiological
   evidence this meta-analysis points to a sequential and distributed
   encoding of different components of the RPE signal, with potentially
   distinct functional roles.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying someone else's noncooperative intentions can prevent
   exploitation in social interactions. Hence, the inference of another
   person's mental state might be most pronounced in order to improve
   social decision-making. Here, we tested the hypothesis that brain
   regions associated with Theory of Mind (ToM), particularly the right
   temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ), show higher neural responses when
   interacting with a selfish person and that the rTPJ-activity as well as
   cooperative tendencies will change over time. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a modified prisoner's dilemma game
   in which 20 participants interacted with three fictive playing partners
   who behaved according to stable strategies either competitively,
   cooperatively or randomly during seven interaction blocks. The rTPJ and
   the posterior-medial prefrontal cortex showed higher activity during the
   interaction with a competitive compared with a cooperative playing
   partner. Only the rTPJ showed a high response during an early
   interaction phase, which preceded participants increase in defective
   decisions. Enhanced functional connectivity between the rTPJ and the
   left hippocampus suggests that social cognition and learning processes
   co-occur when behavioral adaptation seems beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{People often anticipate certain benefits when making dishonest
   decisions. In this article, we aim to dissociate the neural-cognitive
   processes of (1) dishonest decisions that focus on overall benefits of
   being dishonest (regardless of whether the benefits are self-serving or
   prosocial) from (2) those that distinguish between self-serving and
   prosocial benefits. Thirty-one participants had the opportunity to
   maximize their monetary benefits by voluntarily making dishonest
   decisions while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   In each trial, the monetary benefit of being dishonest was either
   self-serving or prosocial. Behaviorally, we found dissociable patterns
   of dishonest decisions: some participants were dishonest for overall
   benefits, while others were primarily dishonest for self-serving
   (compared with prosocial) benefits. When provided an opportunity to be
   dishonest for either self-serving or prosocial benefits, participants
   with a stronger overall tendency to be dishonest had stronger vmPFC
   activity, as well as stronger functional connectivity between the vmPFC
   and dlPFC. Furthermore, vmPFC activity was associated with decisions to
   be dishonest both when the benefits of being dishonest were self-serving
   and prosocial. Conversely, high self-serving-biased participants had
   stronger striatum activity and stronger functional connectivity between
   the striatum and middle-mPFC when they had a chance to be dishonest for
   self-serving (compared with prosocial) benefits. Altogether, we showed
   that activity in (and functional connectivity between) regions in the
   valuation (e.g., vmPFC and Str) and executive control (e.g., dlPFC and
   mmPFC) systems play a key role in registering the social-related goal of
   dishonest decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent behavioral work demonstrates that many people view low-status
   groups as less ``evolved and civilized{''} than high-status groups. Are
   these people using blatant expressions of dehumanization simply to
   express strong dislike toward other groups? Or is blatant dehumanization
   a process distinct from other negative assessments? We tested these
   competing hypotheses using functional neuroimaging. Participants judged
   10 groups (e.g., Europeans, Muslims, rats) on four scales: blatant
   dehumanization, dislike, dissimilarity and perceived within-group
   homogeneity. Consistent with expectations, neural responses when making
   ratings of dehumanization diverged from those when judging the same
   targets on the other related dimensions. Specifically, we found regions
   in the left inferior parietal cortex (IPC) and left inferior frontal
   cortex (IFC) that were selectively parametrically modulated by
   dehumanization ratings. The pattern of responses in the left IFC was
   also consistent with animalistic dehumanization: high responses to
   low-status human groups and animals, and lower responses to high-status
   human groups. By contrast, a region in the posterior cingulate cortex
   was parametrically sensitive specifically to liking. We therefore
   demonstrate a double dissociation between brain activity associated with
   judgments of blatant dehumanization and judgments of dislike.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Borderline personality disorder is the prototypical disorder
   of emotion reactivity and dysregulation, yet there remains limited
   understanding of its neurocognitive correlates. Two mechanisms that may
   underlie anomalous reactivity in response to negative stimuli among
   patients with borderline personality disorder are impairment in
   habituation and exaggerated sensitization of activity in the neural
   salience network, including the amygdala, anterior insula, and dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex. The authors aimed to reveal the most
   plausible mechanism by examining the effect of repeated exposure to
   emotional images both within and across study sessions.
   Method: A total of 75 participants (patients with borderline personality
   disorder, N=26; patients with avoidant personality disorder included as
   a psychopathological control group, N=25; and healthy control subjects,
   N=24) were included in the study analyses. All participants viewed five
   presentations of the same set of negative and neutral images at each of
   two sessions, separated by approximately 3 days, while functional MRI
   data were acquired. Salience network activity, as measured by
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in anatomically defined regions of
   interest across the salience network, was compared across the three
   groups for each presentation at each of the two study sessions.
   Self-reported negative affect was measured for each trial.
   Results: Salience network activity showed a main effect of
   within-session habituation across all groups and sessions. However, a
   group-by-session interaction was present, such that only patients with
   borderline personality disorder showed increased salience network
   activity in response to the images reencountered at the second session,
   and this increased salience network sensitization predicted greater
   sensitization in self-reported negative affect.
   Conclusions: These results elucidate the neural mechanisms by which
   patients with borderline personality disorder appraise negative social
   situations as exaggeratedly salient and suggest potential neurocognitive
   intervention targets.}},

Abstract = {{The temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) has been associated with various
   cognitive and social functions, and is critical for attentional
   reorienting. Attention affects early visual processing. Neuroimaging
   studies dealing with such processes have thus far concentrated on
   striate and extrastriate areas. Here, we investigated whether attention
   orienting or reorienting modulate activity in visually driven TPJ
   subregions. For each observer we identified 3 visually responsive
   subregions within TPJ: 2 bilateral (vTPJ(ant) and vTPJ(post)) and 1
   right lateralized (vTPJ(cent)). Cortical activity in these subregions
   was measured using fMRI while observers performed a 2-alternative
   forced-choice orientation discrimination task. Covert spatial endogenous
   (voluntary) or exogenous (involuntary) attention was manipulated using
   either a central or a peripheral cue with task, stimuli and observers
   constant. Both endogenous and exogenous attention increased activity for
   invalidly cued trials in right vTPJ(post); only endogenous attention
   increased activity for invalidly cued trials in left vTPJ(post) and in
   right vTPJ(cent); and neither type of attention modulated either right
   or left vTPJ(ant). These results demonstrate that vTPJ(post) and
   vTPJ(cent) mediate the reorientation of covert attention to task
   relevant stimuli, thus playing a critical role in visual attention.
   These findings reveal a differential reorienting cortical response after
   observers' attention has been oriented to a given location voluntarily
   or involuntarily.}},

Abstract = {{In the mature mammalian brain, the primary somatosensory and motor
   cortices are known to be spatially organized such that neural activity
   relating to specific body parts can be somatopically mapped onto an
   anatomical ``homunculus{''}. This organization creates an internal body
   representation which is fundamental for precise motor control, spatial
   awareness and social interaction. Although it is unknown when this
   organization develops in humans, animal studies suggest that it may
   emerge even before the time of normal birth. We therefore characterized
   the somatotopic organization of the primary sensorimotor cortices using
   functional MRI and a set of custom-made robotic tools in 35 healthy
   preterm infants aged from 31 + 6 to 36 + 3 weeks postmenstrual age.
   Functional responses induced by somatosensory stimulation of the wrists,
   ankles, and mouth had a distinct spatial organization as seen in the
   characteristic mature homunculus map. In comparison to the ankle,
   activation related to wrist stimulation was significantly larger and
   more commonly involved additional areas including the supplementary
   motor area and ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. These results are in
   keeping with early intrinsic determination of a somatotopic map within
   the primary sensorimotor cortices. This may explain why acquired brain
   injury in this region during the preterm period cannot be compensated
   for by cortical reorganization and therefore can lead to long-lasting
   motor and sensory impairment.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, driven by scientific and clinical concerns, there has
   been an increased interest in the analysis of functional brain networks.
   The goal of these analyses is to better understand how brain regions
   interact, how this depends upon experimental conditions and behavioral
   measures and how anomalies (disease) can be recognized. In this paper,
   we provide, first, a brief review of some of the main existing methods
   of functional brain network analysis. But rather than compare them, as a
   traditional review would do, instead, we draw attention to their
   significant limitations and blind spots. Then, second, relevant experts,
   sketch a number of emerging methods, which can break through these
   limitations. In particular we discuss five such methods. The first two,
   stochastic block models and exponential random graph models, provide an
   inferential basis for network analysis lacking in the exploratory graph
   analysis methods. The other three addresses: network comparison via
   persistent homology, time-varying connectivity that distinguishes sample
   fluctuations from neural fluctuations, and network system identification
   that draws inferential strength from temporal autocorrelation.}},

Abstract = {{With advanced age, older adults show functional deterioration in sleep.
   Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain
   stimulation, modulates individuals' behavioral performance in various
   cognitive domains. However, the modulation effect and neural mechanisms
   of tDCS on sleep, especially for the elderly population are not clear.
   Here, we aimed to investigate whether high-definition transcranial
   direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) could modulate community-dwelling
   older adults' subjective sleep and whether these potential improvements
   are associated with the large-scale brain activity alterations recorded
   by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-one older adults were
   randomly allocated to the HD-tDCS group and the control group. HD-tDCS
   was applied for 25 min at 1.5 mA per day for two weeks. The anode
   electrode was placed over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
   surrounded by 4 cathodes at 7 cm radius. All participants completed
   sleep neuropsychological assessments and fMRI scans individually before
   and after intervention. Behaviorally, we observed a HD-tDCS-induced
   enhancement of older adults' sleep duration. On the aspect of the
   corresponding neural alterations, we observed that HD-tDCS decreased the
   functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and
   subcortical network. More importantly, the decoupling connectivity of
   the DMN-subcortical network was correlated with the improvements of
   subjective sleep in the HD-tDCS group. Our findings add novel behavioral
   and neural evidences about tDCS-induced sleep improvement in
   community-dwelling older adults. With further development, tDCS may be
   used as an alternative treatment for sleep disorders and alleviate the
   dysfunction of brain networks induced by aging.}},

   in children exposed to early life stress}},
Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Children who experience severe early life stress show persistent
   deficits in many aspects of cognitive and social adaptation. Early
   stress might be associated with these broad changes in functioning
   because it impairs general learning mechanisms. To explore this
   possibility, we examined whether individuals who experienced abusive
   caregiving in childhood had difficulties with instrumental learning
   and/or cognitive flexibility as adolescents. Fifty-three 14-17-year-old
   adolescents (31 exposed to high levels of childhood stress, 22 control)
   completed an fMRI task that required them to first learn associations in
   the environment and then update those pairings. Adolescents with
   histories of early life stress eventually learned to pair stimuli with
   both positive and negative outcomes, but did so more slowly than their
   peers. Furthermore, these stress-exposed adolescents showed markedly
   impaired cognitive flexibility; they were less able than their peers to
   update those pairings when the contingencies changed. These learning
   problems were reflected in abnormal activity in learning- and
   attention-related brain circuitry. Both altered patterns of learning and
   neural activation were associated with the severity of lifetime stress
   that the adolescents had experienced. Taken together, the results of
   this experiment suggest that basic learning processes are impaired in
   adolescents exposed to early life stress. These general learning
   mechanisms may help explain the emergence of social problems observed in
   these individuals.}},

Title = {{What's parenting got to do with it: emotional autonomy and brain and
   behavioral responses to emotional conflict in children and adolescents}},
Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Healthy parenting may be protective against the development of emotional
   psychopathology, particularly for children reared in stressful
   environments. Little is known, however, about the brain and behavioral
   mechanisms underlying this association, particularly during childhood
   and adolescence, when emotional disorders frequently emerge. Here, we
   demonstrate that psychological control, a parenting strategy known to
   limit socioemotional development in children, is associated with altered
   brain and behavioral responses to emotional conflict in 27 at-risk
   (urban, lower income) youth, ages 9-16. In particular, youth reporting
   higher parental psychological control demonstrated lower activity in the
   left anterior insula, a brain area involved in emotion conflict
   processing, and submitted faster but less accurate behavioral
   responsespossibly reflecting an avoidant pattern. Effects were not
   replicated for parental care, and did not generalize to an analogous
   nonemotional conflict task. We also find evidence that behavioral
   responses to emotional conflict bridge the previously reported link
   between parental overcontrol and anxiety in children. Effects of
   psychological control may reflect a parenting style that limits
   opportunities to practice self-regulation when faced with emotionally
   charged situations. Results support the notion that parenting strategies
   that facilitate appropriate amounts of socioemotional competence and
   autonomy in children may be protective against social and emotional
   difficulties.}},

Abstract = {{Internet gaming is a legitimate leisure activity worldwide; however,
   there are emerging concerns that vast numbers of gamers are becoming
   addicted. In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) classified
   Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) as a condition warranting more clinical
   research ahead of formalizing it as a mental disorder. Proposed as a
   behavioral addiction, IGD shares many similarities in both physical and
   psychosocial manifestations with substance use disorder, including
   cerebral changes on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Among
   the gaming population, compared to females, adolescent and adult males
   demonstrate far more addictive internet gaming use in terms of screen
   hours, craving, and negative impacts on health, which have, in isolated
   incidents, also caused death. The current article draws findings from a
   scoping review of literature related to IGD as a means to raising
   awareness about an emergent men's health issue. Included are three
   themes: (a) unveiling the nature, impacts and symptoms of IGD; (b)
   conceptualizing IGD through neuroscience; and (c) treatment approaches
   to IGD. Afforded by these themes is an overview and synthesis of the
   existing literature regarding IGD as a means of providing direction for
   much needed research on gaming addiction and orientating primary care
   providers (PCPs) to the specificities of IGD in men's health. The
   findings are applied to a discussion of the connections between IGD and
   masculinity and the importance of recognizing how behaviors such as
   social isolation and game immersion can be maladaptive coping strategies
   for males.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated neural correlates of children's attachment
   security using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Fifty-one boys'
   attachment styles (age mean = 9.5 years, SD = 0.61) were assessed with
   the Separation Anxiety Test (SAT). We created an fMRI version of the SAT
   to activate children's attachment system in fMRI environment and
   contrasted two conditions in which children were instructed to infer the
   specific feeling of the boy in the picture or to identify objects or
   physical activities. In the final fMRI analysis (N = 21), attachment
   security could be detected at the neural level corresponding to the
   behavioural differences in the attachment interview. Securely attached
   children showed greater activation in the frontal, limbic and basal
   ganglia area which included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
   amygdala, cingulate cortex and striatum, compared to other children who
   had lower quality of attachment. These regions have a key role in
   socio-emotional information processing and also represent a brain
   network related to approach and avoidance motivation in humans.
   Especially the striatum, strongly linked to reward processing
   underpinning social approach and avoidance motivation, showed the
   largest effects in these differences and also positively correlated with
   emotional openness scores in SAT. This suggests that the quality of
   attachment configures the approach and avoidance motivational system in
   our brain mediated by the striatum.}},

Abstract = {{Drug cues, or conditioned responses to stimuli paired with drugs, are
   widely believed to promote drug use. The acquisition of these
   conditioned responses has been well characterized in laboratory animals:
   neutral stimuli paired with drugs elicit conditioned responses
   resembling the motivational and incentive properties of the drug itself.
   However, few studies have examined acquisition of conditioning, or the
   nature of the conditioned response, in humans. In this study, we used
   fMRI to examine neural responses to stimuli that had been paired with
   methamphetamine or placebo in healthy young adults. Participants first
   underwent four conditioning sessions in which visual-auditory stimuli
   were paired with either methamphetamine (20 mg, oral) or placebo. Then
   on a drug-free test day, the stimuli were presented during an fMRI scan
   to assess neural responses to the stimuli. We hypothesized that the
   stimuli would elicit drug-like brain activity, especially in regions
   related to reward. Instead, we found that the methamphetamine-paired
   stimuli, compared to placebo-paired stimuli, produced greater activation
   in regions related to visual and auditory processing, consistent with
   the drug's unconditioned effects on sensory processing. This is the
   first study to demonstrate conditioned neural responses to drug-paired
   stimuli after just two pairings of methamphetamine in healthy adults.
   The study also illustrates that conditioned responses may develop to
   unexpected components of the drug's effects.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},

Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{56-64}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Social exclusion is a complex phenomenon, with wide-ranging immediate
   and delayed effects on well-being, hormone levels, brain activation and
   motivational behavior. Building upon previous work, the current fMRI
   study investigated affective, endocrine and neural responses to social
   exclusion in a more naturalistic Cyberball task in 40 males and 40
   females. As expected, social exclusion elicited well-documented
   affective and neural responses, i.e., increased anger and distress, as
   well as increased exclusion-related activation of the anterior insula,
   the posterior-medial frontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex.
   Cortisol and testosterone decreased over the course of the experiment,
   whereas progesterone showed no changes. Hormone levels were not
   correlated with subjective affect, but they were related to
   exclusion-induced neural responses. Exclusion-related activation in
   frontal areas was associated with decreases in cortisol and increases in
   testosterone until recovery. Given that results were largely independent
   of sex, the current findings have important implications regarding
   between-sex vs. within-sex variations and the conceptualization of state
   vs. trait neuroendocrine functions in social neuroscience.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Responding adaptively to one's social environment is a key
   factor predicting the course of major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Socially rejecting events can exacerbate, whereas socially accepting
   events can ameliorate depressive symptoms. The neural responses to
   rejection and acceptance in MDD are relatively unexplored.
   Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure
   neural responses to romantic rejection and acceptance in women diagnosed
   with current MDD (n = 19) and a matched group of healthy controls (HCs)
   (n = 19). During fMRI, participants received rejecting, accepting, and
   neutral feedback from self-selected potential romantic partners.
   Results: In women with MDD but not HCs, rejection significantly
   increased activity in the right anterior insula relative to neutral
   feedback. Greater activation during rejection was found in the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex in MDD compared to HCs. Women with MDD
   reported stronger emotional responses than HCs to both rejection and
   acceptance. In addition, left and right nucleus accumbens (NAcc)
   activity mediated the relationship between trait reward responsiveness
   and increased ratings of feeling ``happy and accepted{''} following
   acceptance in HCs, but not the MDD group.
   Discussion: Women with MDD were behaviorally and neurally
   hyperresponsive to rejection. Although both groups were behaviorally
   responsive to acceptance, in MDD this was dissociated from NAcc
   activity. These findings highlight abnormal behavioral and neural
   responses to social cues in MDD, with implications for disease prognosis
   and the development of novel and sensitive biomarkers for MDD focused on
   neural pathways for social-affective processing.
   Limitations: Conclusions may be limited to depressed women in a romantic
   context.}},

Title = {{Disrupted functional connectivity patterns of the insula subregions in
   drug-free major depressive disorder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{234}},
Pages = {{297-304}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by
   impairments in emotional and cognitive functions. Emerging studies have
   shown that cognition and emotion interact by reaching identical brain
   regions, and the insula is one such region with functional and
   structural heterogeneity. Although previous literatures have shown the
   role of insula in MDD, it remains unclear whether the insular subregions
   show differential change patterns in MDD.
   Methods: Using the resting-state fMRI data in a group of 23 drug-free
   MDD patients and 34 healthy controls (HCs), we investigated whether the
   abnormal connectivity patterns of insular sub-regions or any behavioural
   correlates can be detected in MDD. Further hierarchical cluster analysis
   was used to identify the functional connectivity-clustering patterns of
   insular sub-regions.
   Results: Compared with HCs, the MDD exhibited higher connectivities
   between dorsal agranular insula and inferior parietal lobule and between
   ventral dysgranular and granular insula and thalamus/habehula, and lower
   connectivity of hypergranular insula to subgenual anterior cingulate
   cortex. Moreover, the three subregions with significant group
   differences were in three separate functional systems along
   anterior-to-posteior gradient. The anterior and middle insula showed
   positive correlation with depressive severity, while the posterior
   insular was to the contrary.
   Limitations: The small and unbalanced sample size, only included
   moderate and severe depression and the possible inter-individual
   differences may limit the interpretability.
   Conclusions: These findings provided evidences for the MDD-related
   effects in functional connectivity patterns of insular subregions, and
   revealed that the subregions might be involved in different neural
   circuits associated with the contrary impacts on the depressive
   symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{The brain is often able to learn complex structures of the environment
   using a very limited amount of evidence, which is crucial for
   model-based planning and sequential prediction. However, little is known
   about the neurocomputational mechanisms of deterministic sequential
   prediction, as prior work has primarily focused on stochastic transition
   structures. Here we find that human subjects' beliefs about a sequence
   of states, captured by reaction times, are well explained by a Bayesian
   pattern-learning model that tracks beliefs about both the current state
   and the underlying structure of the environment, taking into account
   prior beliefs about possible patterns in the sequence. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, we find distinct neural signatures of
   uncertainty computations on both levels. These results support the
   hypothesis that structure learning in the brain employs Bayesian
   inference.}},

Abstract = {{Investing mental effort is costly, and the investment has to be matched
   by a reward to make a person engage in task performance. However, the
   neural structures underlying the continued management of mental effort
   are not known. Previous work has identified left-lateralized structures,
   most prominently the left anterior Insular Cortex (aIC) as regions
   implied in posthoc evaluation and also anticipation of mental effort
   investment. We present a study aimed at identifying neural structures
   that are sensitive to changes in both task load and fatigue-induced
   state load. Sixteen healthy participants performed an n-back task before
   and after a fatigue-inducing day in a helicopter simulator or a free
   day. Subjective mental effort ratings showed an interaction of the
   effects of both task and state load changes, with a reduced effect of
   task load during the fatigued state. Testing for the same interaction
   effect in a whole-brain functional MRI data, we found a left-lateralized
   group of clusters in aIC, the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal
   striatum and frontal eye field and M1. We discuss the possible role of
   these areas and also the relevance of our findings in the light of the
   proposed opportunity cost model of mental effort.}},

Title = {{Investigating the association of ventral and dorsal striatal dysfunction
   during reward anticipation with negative symptoms in patients with
   schizophrenia and healthy individuals}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Negative symptoms are a core feature of schizophrenia and also found in
   healthy individuals in subclinical forms. According to the current
   literature the two negative symptom domains, apathy and diminished
   expression may have different underlying neural mechanisms. Previous
   observations suggest that striatal dysfunction is associated with apathy
   in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether apathy is specifically
   related to ventral or dorsal striatal alterations. Here, we investigated
   striatal dysfunction during reward anticipation in patients with
   schizophrenia and a non-clinical population, to determine whether it is
   associated with apathy.
   Methods
   Chronic schizophrenia patients (n = 16) and healthy controls (n = 23)
   underwent an event-related functional MRI, while performing a variant of
   the Monetary Incentive Delay Task. The two negative symptom domains were
   assessed in both groups using the Brief Negative Symptoms Scale.
   Results
   In schizophrenia patients, we saw a strong negative correlation between
   apathy and ventral and dorsal striatal activation during reward
   anticipation. In contrast, there was no correlation with diminished
   expression. In healthy controls, apathy was not correlated with ventral
   or dorsal striatal activation during reward anticipation.
   Conclusion
   This study replicates our previous findings of a correlation between
   ventral striatal activity and apathy but not diminished expression in
   chronic schizophrenia patients. The association between apathy and
   reduced dorsal striatal activity during reward anticipation suggests
   that impaired action-outcome selection is involved in the
   pathophysiology of motivational deficits in schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Epigenetic regulation of the oxytocin receptor is associated with neural
   response during selective social attention}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Aberrant attentional biases to social stimuli have been implicated in a
   number of disorders including autism and social anxiety disorder.
   Oxytocin, a naturally-occurring mammalian hormone and neuromodulator
   involved in regulating social behavior, has been proposed to impact
   basic biological systems that facilitate the detection of and
   orientation to social information. Here, we investigate a role for
   naturally-occurring variability in the endogenous oxytocinergic system
   in regulating neural response during attention to social information.
   Participants performed a selective social attention task while
   undergoing fMRI, provided a blood sample for epigenetic analysis, and
   completed self-report measures of social functioning. We find that a
   functional epigenetic modification to the oxytocin receptor, OXTR
   methylation, is associated with increased neural response within and
   decreased functional coupling between regions of the salience and
   attentional control networks during selective social attention. We also
   show that subclinical variability in autistic and social anxiety traits
   moderates this epigenetic regulation of neural response. These data
   offer a mechanistic explanation to a growing literature associating
   social behavior and disorder with epigenetic modification to OXTR by
   suggesting that OXTR methylation reflects a decrease in the extent to
   which social information automatically captures attention. We highlight
   the importance that treatment efficacy be considered in relation to
   individual differences in molecular makeup, and that future studies
   aimed at uncovering biomarkers of disorder carefully consider
   measurement at both the biological and phenotypic level.}},

Title = {{Cooperative and Competitive Contextual Effects on Social Cognitive and
   Empathic Neural Responses}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{We aimed to differentiate the neural responses to cooperative and
   competitive contexts, which are the two of the most important social
   contexts in human society. Healthy male college students were asked to
   complete a Tetris-like task requiring mental rotation skills under
   individual, cooperative, and competitive contexts in an fMRI scanner.
   While the participants completed the task, pictures of others
   experiencing pain evoking emotional empathy randomly appeared to capture
   contextual effects on empathic neural responses. Behavioral results
   indicated that, in the presence of cooperation, participants solved the
   tasks more accurately and quickly than what they did when in the
   presence of competition. The fMRI results revealed activations in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dIPFC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   (dmPFC) related to executive functions and theory of mind when
   participants performed the task under both cooperative and competitive
   contexts, whereas no activation of such areas was observed in the
   individual context. Cooperation condition exhibited stronger neural
   responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dmPFC than
   competition condition. Competition condition, however, showed marginal
   neural responses in the cerebellum and anterior insular cortex (AIC).
   The two social contexts involved stronger empathic neural responses to
   other's pain than the individual context, but no substantial differences
   between cooperation and competition were present. Regions of interest
   analyses revealed that individual's trait empathy modulated the neural
   activity in the state empathy network, the AIC, and the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) depending on the social context. These results
   suggest that cooperation improves task performance and activates neural
   responses associated with reward and mentalizing. Furthermore, the
   interaction between trait- and state-empathy was explored by correlation
   analyses between individual's trait empathy score and changing empathic
   brain activations along with the exposure to the cooperative and
   competitive social contexts.}},

   Multi-Problem Young Adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Multi-problem young adults (18-27 years) present with a plethora of
   problems, including varying degrees of psychopathic traits. The amygdala
   and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) have been implicated in moral
   dysfunction in psychopathy in adolescents and adults, but no studies
   have been performed in populations in the transitional period to
   adulthood. We tested in multi-problem young adults the hypothesis that
   psychopathic traits are related to amygdala and vmPFC activity during
   moral evaluation. Additionally, we explored the relation between
   psychopathic traits and other regions consistently implicated in moral
   evaluation. Our final sample consisted of 100 multi-problem young adults
   and 22 healthy controls. During fMRI scanning, participants judged
   whether pictures showed a moral violation on a 1-4 scale. Whole brain
   analysis revealed neural correlates of moral evaluation consistent with
   the literature. Region of interest analyses revealed positive
   associations between the affective callous-unemotional dimension of
   psychopathy and activation in the left vmPFC, left superior temporal
   gyrus, and left cingulate. Our results are consistent with altered vmPFC
   function during moral evaluation in psychopathy, but we did not find
   evidence for amygdala involvement. Our findings indicate the affective
   callous-unemotional trait of psychopathy may be related to widespread
   altered activation patterns during moral evaluation in multi-problem
   young adults.}},

Title = {{Diminished neural network dynamics after moderate and severe traumatic
   brain injury}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 8}},
Abstract = {{Over the past decade there has been increasing enthusiasm in the
   cognitive neurosciences around using network science to understand the
   system-level changes associated with brain disorders. A growing
   literature has used whole-brain fMRI analysis to examine changes in the
   brain's subnetworks following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Much of
   network modeling in this literature has focused on static network
   mapping, which provides a window into gross inter-nodal relationships,
   but is insensitive to more subtle fluctuations in network dynamics,
   which may be an important predictor of neural network plasticity. In
   this study, we examine the dynamic connectivity with focus on
   state-level connectivity (state) and evaluate the reliability of dynamic
   network states over the course of two runs of intermittent task and
   resting data. The goal was to examine the dynamic properties of neural
   networks engaged periodically with task stimulation in order to
   determine: 1) the reliability of inter-nodal and network-level
   characteristics over time and 2) the transitions between distinct
   network states after traumatic brain injury. To do so, we enrolled 23
   individuals with moderate and severe TBI at least 1-year post injury and
   19 age-and education-matched healthy adults using functional MRI
   methods, dynamic connectivity modeling, and graph theory. The results
   reveal several distinct network ``states{''} that were reliably evident
   when comparing runs; the overall frequency of dynamic network states are
   highly reproducible (r-values>0.8) for both samples. Analysis of
   movement between states resulted in fewer state transitions in the TBI
   sample and, in a few cases, brain injury resulted in the appearance of
   states not exhibited by the healthy control (HC) sample. Overall, the
   findings presented here demonstrate the reliability of observable
   dynamic mental states during periods of on-task performance and support
   emerging evidence that brain injury may result in diminished network
   dynamics.}},

   time-invariance are not reported. This study evaluates whether DMN
   dysconnectivity in remitted depression (rMDD) is reliable over time and
   symptom-independent, and explores convergent relationships with
   cognitive features of depression. A longitudinal study was conducted
   with 82 young adults free of psychotropic medications (47 rMDD, 35
   healthy controls) who completed clinical structured interviews,
   neuropsychological assessments, and 2 resting-state fMRI scans across 2
   study sites. Functional connectivity analyses from bilateral posterior
   cingulate and anterior hippocampal formation seeds in DMN were conducted
   at both time points within a repeated-measures analysis of variance to
   compare groups and evaluate reliability of group-level connectivity
   findings. Eleven hyper-(from posterior cingulate) and 6 hypo-(from
   hippocampal formation) connectivity clusters in rMDD were obtained with
   moderate to adequate reliability in all but one cluster (ICC's range =
   0.50 to 0.76 for 16 of 17). The significant clusters were reduced with a
   principle component analysis (5 components obtained) to explore these
   connectivity components, and were then correlated with cognitive
   features (rumination, cognitive control, learning and memory, and
   explicit emotion identification). At the exploratory level, for
   convergent validity, components consisting of posterior cingulate with
   cognitive control network hyperconnectivity in rMDD were related to
   cognitive control (inverse) and rumination (positive). Components
   consisting of anterior hippocampal formation with social emotional
   network and DMN hypoconnectivity were related to memory (inverse) and
   happy emotion identification (positive). Thus, time-invariant DMN
   connectivity differences exist early in the lifespan course of
   depression and are reliable. The nuanced results suggest a ventral
   within-network hypoconnectivity associated with poor memory and a dorsal
   cross-network hyperconnectivity linked to poorer cognitive control and
   elevated rumination. Study of early course remitted depression with
   attention to reliability and symptom independence could lead to more
   readily translatable clinical assessment tools for biomarkers.}},

Abstract = {{Mother-child relationships change considerably in adolescence, but it is
   not yet understood how mothers experience vicarious rewards for their
   adolescent children. In the current study, we investigated neural
   responses of twenty mothers winning and losing money for their best
   friend and for their adolescent child in a gambling task. During the
   task, functional neuroimaging data were acquired. We examined the
   activation patterns when playing for or winning for self, adolescent
   children and friends in four a-priori selected ROls (nucleus accumbens,
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and temporo-parietal junction).
   Behaviorally, mothers indicated that they experienced most enjoyment
   when they gained money for their children and that their children
   deserved to win more, relative to friends and self. At the neural level,
   nucleus accumbens activity was stronger when winning versus losing. This
   pattern was not only found when playing for self, but also for friends
   and children, possibly reflecting the rewarding value of vicarious
   prosocial gains. In addition, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus,
   and temporo-parietal junction were more active when receiving outcomes
   for children and friends compared to self, possibly reflecting increased
   recruitment of mentalizing processes. Interestingly, activity in this
   network was stronger for mothers who indicated that their children and
   friends deserved to win more. These findings provide initial evidence
   that vicarious rewards for one's children are processed similarly as
   rewards for self, and that activation in social brain regions are
   related to social closeness.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroscience research shows a growing interest in the application of
   Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) in analysis and decoding of the brain
   activity of human subjects. Given the correlation that is observed
   between the Blood Oxygen Dependent Level (BOLD) responses that are
   exhibited by the time series data of functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (fMRI) and the hemoglobin oxy/deoxy-genation that is captured by
   NIRS, linear models play a central role in these applications. This, in
   turn, results in adaptation of the feature extraction strategies that
   are well-suited for discretization of data that exhibit a high degree of
   linearity, namely, slope and the mean as well as their combination, to
   summarize the informational contents of the NIRS time series. In this
   article, we demonstrate that these features are inefficient in capturing
   the variational information of NIRS data, limiting the reliability and
   the adequacy of the conclusion on their results. Alternatively, we
   propose the linear estimate of differential entropy of these time series
   as a natural representation of such information We provide evidence for
   our claim through comparative analysis of the application of these
   features on NIRS data pertinent to several working memory tasks as well

Abstract = {{Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder (DD) typically manifests as a
   disruption of body self-awareness. Interoception (namely, cognitive
   processing of body signals) has been extensively considered as a key
   processing for body self-awareness. Against this background, this study
   aimed to investigate whether there are systematic differences in
   interoception between a patient with DD and controls that might explain
   the disembodiment symptoms of this disease. To assess interoception, we
   utilized a heartbeat detection task and measures of functional
   connectivity derived from fMRI networks in
   interoceptive/exteroceptivo/mind-wandering states. Additionally, we
   evaluated empathic abilities to test the association between
   interoception and emotional experience. The patient evinced impaired
   performance in the heartbeat detection task, alongside lower global
   brain connectivity only in the interoceptive state. He also presented a
   particular pattern of impairments in affective empathy. To our
   knowledge, this is the first experimental study on the relationship
   between interoception and DD combining behavioral and neurobiological
   measures. Our results suggest that altered neural mechanisms and
   cognitive processes regarding body signaling might be engaged in DD
   phenomenology. Moreover, our study contributes experimental data to the
   comprehension of brain-body interactions and the emergence of
   self-awareness and emotional feelings.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Although chronic irritability in childhood is prevalent,
   impairing, and predictive of later maladjustment, its pathophysiology is
   largely unknown. Deficits in reward processing are hypothesized to play
   a role in irritability. The current study aimed to identify how the
   developmental timing of irritability during preschool- and school-age
   relates to reward-related brain function during school-age.
   Method: Children's irritability was assessed during the preschool period
   (wave 1; ages 3.0-5.9 years) and 3 years later (wave 2; ages 5.9-9.6
   years) using a clinical interview. At wave 2, children (N = 46; 28
   female and 18 male) performed a monetary incentive delay task in which
   they received rewards, if they successfully hit a target, or no reward
   regardless of performance, during functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: Children with more versus less severe preschool irritability,
   controlling for concurrent irritability, exhibited altered
   reward-related connectivity: right amygdala with insula and inferior
   parietal lobe as well as left ventral striatum with lingual gyrus,
   postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobe, and culmen. Children with
   more versus less severe concurrent irritability, controlling for
   preschool irritability, exhibited a similar pattern of altered
   connectivity between left and right amygdalae and superior frontal gyrus
   and between left ventral striatum and precuneus and culmen. Neural
   differences associated with irritability were most evident between
   reward and no-reward conditions when participants missed the target.
   Conclusion: Preschool-age irritability and concurrent irritability were
   uniquely associated with aberrant patterns of reward-related
   connectivity, highlighting the importance of developmental timing of
   irritability for brain function.}},

Abstract = {{From longitudinal biomedical studies to social networks, graphs have
   emerged as essential objects for describing evolving interactions
   between agents in complex systems. In such studies, after
   pre-processing, the data are encoded by a set of graphs, each
   representing a system's state at a different point in time or space. The
   analysis of the system's dynamics depends on the selection of the
   appropriate analytical tools. In particular, after specifying properties
   characterizing similarities between states, a critical step lies in the
   choice of a distance between graphs capable of reflecting such
   similarities.
   While the literature offers a number of distances to choose from, their
   properties have been little investigated and no guidelines regarding the
   choice of such a distance have yet been provided. In particular, most
   graph distances consider that the nodes are exchangeable-ignoring node
   ``identities.{''} Alignment of the graphs according to identified nodes
   enables us to enhance these distances' sensitivity to perturbations in
   the network and detect important changes in graph dynamics. Thus the
   selection of an adequate metric is a decisive-yet delicate-practical
   matter.
   In the spirit of Goldenberg et al.' s seminal 2009 review {[}Found.
   Trends Mach. Learn. 2 (2010) 129-233], this article provides an overview
   of commonly-used graph distances and an explicit characterization of the
   structural changes that they are best able to capture. We show how these
   choices affect real-life situations, and we use these distances to
   analyze both a longitudinal microbiome dataset and a brain fMRI study.
   One contribution of the present study is a coordinated suite of data
   analytic techniques, displays and statistical tests using
   ``metagraphs{''}: a graph of graphs based on a chosen metric.
   Permutation tests can uncover the effects of covariates on the graphs'
   variability. Furthermore, synthetic examples provide intuition as to the
   qualities and drawbacks of the different distances. Above all, we
   provide some guidance on choosing one distance over another in different
   contexts. Finally, we extend the scope of our analyses from temporal to
   spatial dynamics and apply these different distances to a network
   created from worldwide recipes.}},

Journal = {{HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2317-2328}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Morphological complexity is a highly debated issue in visual word
   recognition. Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that speakers are
   sensitive to degrees of morphological complexity. Two-step derived
   complex words (bridging through bridge(N) > bridge(V) > bridging) led to
   more enhanced activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus than their
   1-step derived counterparts (running through run(V) > running). However,
   it remains unclear whether sensitivity to degrees of morphological
   complexity extends to pseudowords. If this were the case, it would
   indicate that abstract knowledge of morphological structure is
   independent of lexicality. We addressed this question by investigating
   the processing of two sets of pseudowords in German. Both sets contained
   morphologically viable two-step derived pseudowords differing in the
   number of derivational steps required to access an existing lexical
   representation and therefore the degree of structural analysis expected
   during processing. Using a 2 x 2 factorial design, we found lexicality
   effects to be distinct from processing signatures relating to structural
   analysis in pseudowords. Semantically-driven processes such as lexical
   search showed a more frontal distribution while combinatorial processes
   related to structural analysis engaged more parietal parts of the
   network. Specifically, more complex pseudowords showed increased
   activation in parietal regions (right superior parietal lobe and left
   precuneus) relative to pseudowords that required less structural
   analysis to arrive at an existing lexical representation. As the two
   sets were matched on cohort size and surface form, these results
   highlight the role of internal levels of morphological structure even in
   forms that do not possess a lexical representation.}},

Abstract = {{While an extensive literature in decision neuroscience has elucidated
   the neurobiological foundations of decision making, prior research has
   focused primarily on group-level effects in a sample population. Due to
   the presence of inherent differences between individuals' cognitive
   abilities, it is also important to examine the neural correlates of
   decision making that explain interindividual variability in cognitive
   performance. This study therefore investigated how individual
   differences in decision making competence, as measured by the Adult
   Decision Making Competence (A-DMC) battery, are related to functional
   brain connectivity patterns derived from resting-state fMRI data in a
   sample of 304 healthy participants. We examined connectome-wide
   associations, identifying regions within frontal, parietal, temporal,
   and occipital cortex that demonstrated significant associations with
   decision making competence. We then assessed whether the functional
   interactions between brain regions sensitive to decision making
   competence and seven intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) were
   predictive of specific facets of decision making assessed by subtests of
   the A-DMC battery. Our findings suggest that individual differences in
   specific facets of decision making competence are mediated by ICNs that
   support executive, social, and perceptual processes, and motivate an
   integrative framework for understanding the neural basis of individual
   differences in decision making competence.}},

Abstract = {{Does the real or imagined presence of friends invariantly drive
   consumers to engage in disinhibited behavior, and give in to the ``urge
   to splurge{''} in the face of consumption temptations? Or might there be
   situations in which being with friends or even merely thinking of
   friends or the friendships we have with them can actually improve
   self-control?
   In five studies, using a unique combination of controlled experiments
   examining overt consumer behavior and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), we propose and show that the extent to which consumers
   identify a goal conflict between giving in to buying temptations on the
   one hand and the perceived consequences for maintaining satisfactory
   relationships with close friends on the other is a critical mediator of
   whether friendship reminders decrease or increase self-control. We
   further show that such a goal conflict is most likely for consumers with
   a chronic, compulsive tendency for uncontrolled, disinhibited
   acquisition and consumption-for consumers classified as compulsive
   buyers. For their non-compulsive counterparts, in contrast, acts of
   acquisition and consumption, even incidental disinhibited ones, are
   perceived to be less problematic in light of their friendships and hence
   do not induce a goal conflict to the same extent. Our findings provide
   insights into social influences on self-control and identify the concept
   of friendship reminders as a way to reduce a common type of
   dysfunctional consumer behavior. In addition to enhancing consumer
   well-being, reducing compulsive buying will substantially reduce
   handling costs for organizations. Hence, the findings are of academic,
   societal and managerial relevance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{People tend to pay the generosity they receive from a person forward to
   someone else even if they have no chance to reciprocate directly. This
   phenomenon, known as paying-it-forward (PIF) reciprocity, crucially
   contributes to the maintenance of a cooperative human society by passing
   kindness among strangers and has been widely studied in evolutionary
   biology. To further examine its neural implementation and underlying
   computations, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging together
   with computational modeling. In a modified PIF paradigm, participants
   first received a monetary split (i.e. greedy, equal or generous) from
   either a human partner or a computer. They then chose between two
   options involving additional amounts of money to be allocated between
   themselves and an uninvolved person. Behaviorally, people forward the
   previously received greed/generosity towards a third person. The social
   impact of previous treatments is integrated into computational signals
   in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right temporoparietal
   junction during subsequent decision making. Our findings provide
   insights to understand the proximal origin of PIF reciprocity.}},

Abstract = {{Rejection by parents is an important aspect of child maltreatment.
   Altered neural responses to social rejection have been observed in
   maltreated individuals. The current study is the first to examine the
   impact of experienced and perpetrated abuse and neglect on neural
   responses to social exclusion by strangers versus family using a
   multigenerational family design, including 144 participants. The role of
   neural reactivity to social exclusion in the intergenerational
   transmission of maltreatment was also examined. Exclusion by strangers
   was especially associated with increased activation in the left insula,
   while exclusion by a family member was mainly associated with increased
   activation in the ACC. Neural reactivity to social exclusion by
   strangers in the insula, ACC and dmPFC, was associated with experienced
   maltreatment but not with perpetrated maltreatment. In abusive parents,
   altered neural reactivity during exclusion was found in other brain
   areas, indicating different neural correlates of experienced and
   perpetrated maltreatment. Hence, no mechanisms could be identified that
   are involved in the transmission of maltreatment. Hypersensitivity to
   social rejection by strangers in neglected individuals underscores the
   importance to distinguish between effects of abuse and neglect and
   suggests that the impact of experiencing rejection and maltreatment by
   your own parents extends beyond the family context.}},

Abstract = {{Activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during persuasive messages
   predicts future message-consistent behavior change, but there are
   significant limitations to the types of persuasion processes that can be
   invoked inside an MRI scanner. For instance, real world persuasion often
   involves multiple people in conversation. Functional near infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS) allows us to move out of the scanner and into more
   ecologically valid contexts. As a first step, the current study used
   fNIRS to replicate an existing fMRI persuasion paradigm (i.e. the
   sunscreen paradigm) to determine if mPFC shows similar predictive value
   with this technology. Consistent with prior fMRI work, activity in mPFC
   was significantly associated with message-consistent behavior change,
   above and beyond self-reported intentions. There was also a difference
   in this association between previous users and non-users of sunscreen.
   Activity differences based on messages characteristics were not
   observed. Finally, activity in a region of right dorsolateral PFC
   (dlPFC), which has been observed with counterarguing against persuasive
   messages, correlated negatively with future behavior. The current
   results suggest it is reasonable to use fNIRS to examine persuasion
   paradigms that go beyond what is possible in the MRI scanner

Abstract = {{Social rejection is a distressing and painful event that many people
   must cope with on a frequent basis. Mindfulness-defined here as a mental
   state of receptive attentiveness to internal and external stimuli as
   they arise, moment-to-moment-may buffer such social distress. However,
   little research indicates whether mindful individuals adaptively
   regulate the distress of rejection-or the neural mechanisms underlying
   this potential capacity. To fill these gaps in the literature,
   participants reported their trait mindfulness and then completed a
   social rejection paradigm (Cyberball) while undergoing functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Approximately 1 hour after the rejection
   incident, participants reported their level of distress during rejection
   (i.e. social distress). Mindfulness was associated with less distress
   during rejection. This relation was mediated by lower activation in the
   left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the rejection incident, a
   brain region reliably associated with the inhibition of negative affect.
   Mindfulness was also correlated with less functional connectivity
   between the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral
   amygdala and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, which play a critical
   role in the generation of social distress. Mindfulness may relate to
   effective coping with rejection by not over-activating top-down
   regulatory mechanisms, potentially resulting in more effective
   long-termemotion-regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) report difficulties
   extracting meaningful information from dynamic and complex social cues,
   like facial expressions. The nature and mechanisms of these difficulties
   remain unclear. Here we tested whether that difficulty can be traced to
   the pattern of activity in ``social brain{''} regions, when viewing
   dynamic facial expressions. In two studies, adult participants (male and
   female) watched brief videos of a range of positive and negative facial
   expressions, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (Study 1: ASD n = 16, control n = 21; Study 2: ASD n = 22, control n =
   30). Patterns of hemodynamic activity differentiated among facial
   emotional expressions in left and right superior temporal sulcus,
   fusiform gyrus, and parts of medial prefrontal cortex. In both control
   participants and high-functioning individuals with ASD, we observed (i)
   similar responses to emotional valence that generalized across facial
   expressions and animated social events; (ii) similar flexibility of
   responses to emotional valence, when manipulating the task-relevance of
   perceived emotions; and (iii) similar responses to a range of emotions
   within valence. Altogether, the data indicate that there was little or
   no group difference in cortical responses to isolated dynamic emotional
   facial expressions, as measured with fMRI. Difficulties with real-world
   social communication and social interaction in ASD may instead reflect
   differences in initiating and maintaining contingent interactions, or in
   integrating social information over time or context. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Title = {{Dynamic semantic cognition: Characterising coherent and controlled

   chronometric transcranial magnetic stimulation}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{329-349}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Distinct neural processes are thought to support the retrieval of
   semantic information that is (i) coherent with strongly-encoded aspects
   of knowledge, and (ii) non-dominant yet relevant for the current task or
   context. While the brain regions that support readily coherent and more
   controlled patterns of semantic retrieval are relatively well
   characterised, the temporal dynamics of these processes are not
   well-understood. This study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
   dual-pulse chronometric transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTMS) in two
   separate experiments to examine temporal dynamics during the retrieval
   of strong and weak associations. MEG results revealed a dissociation
   within left temporal cortex: anterior temporal lobe (ATL) showed greater
   oscillatory response for strong than weak associations, while posterior
   middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) showed the reverse pattern. Left inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG), a site associated with semantic control and
   retrieval, showed both patterns at different time points. In the cTMS
   experiment, stimulation of ATL at similar to 150 msec disrupted the
   efficient retrieval of strong associations, indicating a necessary role
   for ATL in coherent conceptual activations. Stimulation of pMTG at the
   onset of the second word disrupted the retrieval of weak associations,
   suggesting this site may maintain information about semantic context
   from the first word, allowing efficient engagement of semantic control.
   Together these studies provide converging evidence for a functional
   dissociation within the temporal lobe, across both tasks and time. (C)

   imaging to mechanistically significant components of neural processing.
   We discuss how a combination of innovative probe design, advanced

   fMRI an increasingly successful approach for spatiotemporally resolved
   studies of diverse neural phenomena, perhaps eventually in people.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The genetic and environmental influences on prefrontal
   function in childhood are underinvestigated due to the difficulty of
   measuring prefrontal function in young subjects, for which near-infrared
   spectroscopy (NIRS) is a suitable functional neuroimaging technique that
   facilitates the easy and noninvasive measurement of blood oxygenation in
   the superficial cerebral cortices.
   Method: Using a two-channel NIRS arrangement, we measured changes in
   bilateral prefrontal blood oxygenation during a category version of the
   verbal fluency task (VFT) in 27 monozygotic twin pairs and 12 same-sex
   dizygotic twin pairs ages 5-17 years. We also assessed the participant's
   full-scale intelligence quotient (FIQ) and retrieved parental
   socioeconomic status (SES). Classical structured equation modeling was
   used to estimate the heritability.
   Results: The heritability of VFT-related brain activation was estimated
   to be 44\% and 37\% in the right and left prefrontal regions,
   respectively. We also identified a significant genetic contribution
   (74\%) to FIQ, but did not to VFT task performance. Parental SES was not
   correlated with FIQ, task performance, or task-related prefrontal
   activation.
   Conclusions: This finding provides further evidence that variance in
   prefrontal function has a genetic component since childhood and
   highlights brain function, as measured by NIRS, as a promising candidate
   for endophenotyping neurodevelopmental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive deficits, especially in the domains of social cognition and
   executive function including verbal fluency, are common in amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. There is yet sparse understanding of
   pathogenesis of the underlying, possibly adaptive, cortical patterns. To
   address this issue, 65 patients with ALS and 33 age-, gender- and
   education-matched healthy controls were tested on cognitive and
   behavioral deficits with the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS
   Screen (ECAS). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   cortical activity during social cognition and executive function tasks
   (theory of mind, verbal fluency, alternation) adapted from the ECAS was
   determined in a 3 Tesla scanner. Compared to healthy controls, ALS
   patients performed worse in the ECAS overall (p < 0.001) and in all of
   its subdomains (p < 0.02), except memory. Imaging revealed altered
   cortical activation during all tasks, with patients consistently showing
   a hyperactivation in relevant brain areas compared to healthy controls.
   Additionally, cognitively high performing ALS patients consistently
   exhibited more activation in frontal brain areas than low performing
   patients and behaviorally unimpaired patients presented with more
   neuronal activity in orbitofrontal areas than behaviorally impaired
   patients. In conclusion, hyperactivation in fMRI cognitive tasks seems
   to represent an early adaptive process to overcome neuronal cell loss in
   relevant brain areas. The hereby presented cortical pattern change might
   suggest that, once this loss passes a critical threshold and no cortical
   buffering is possible, clinical representation of cognitive and
   behavioral impairment evolves. Future studies might shed light on the
   pattern of cortical pattern change in the course of ALS.}},

Abstract = {{The search for effective treatment facilitating recovery from concussive
   injury, as well as reducing risk for recurrent concussion is an ongoing
   challenge. This study aimed to determine: a) feasibility of selective
   brain cooling to facilitate clinical symptoms resolution, and b)
   biological functions of the brain within athletes in acute phase of
   sports-related concussion. Selective brain cooling for 30 minutes using
   WElkins sideline cooling system was administered to student-athletes
   suffering concussive injury (n=12; tested within 5 +/- 3 days) and those
   without history of concussion (n=12). fMRI and ASL sequences were
   obtained before and immediately after cooling to better understanding
   the mechanism by which cooling affects neurovascular coupling. Concussed
   subjects self-reported temporary relief from physical symptoms after
   cooling. There were no differences in the number or strength of
   functional connections within Default Mode Network (DMN) between groups
   prior to cooling. However, we observed a reduction in the strength and
   number of connections of the DMN with other ROIs in both groups after
   cooling. Unexpectedly, we observed a significant increase in cerebral
   blood flow (CBF) assessed by ASL after selective cooling in the
   concussed subjects compared to the normal controls. We suggest that
   compromised neurovascular coupling in acute phase of injury may be
   temporarily restored by cooling to match CBF with surges in the
   metabolic demands of the brain. Upon further validation, selective brain
   cooling could be a potential clinical tool in the minimization of
   symptoms and pathological changes after concussion.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium ions are ubiquitous signalling molecules in all multicellular
   organisms, where they mediate diverse aspects of intracellular and
   extracellular communication over widely varying temporal and spatial
   scales(1). Though techniques to map calcium-related activity at a high
   resolution by optical means are well established, there is currently no
   reliable method to measure calcium dynamics over large volumes in intact
   tissue(2). Here, we address this need by introducing a family of
   magnetic calcium-responsive nanoparticles (MaCaReNas) that can be
   detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MaCaReNas respond within
   seconds to {[}Ca2+] changes in the 0.1-1.0 mM range, suitable for
   monitoring extracellular calcium signalling processes in the brain. We
   show that the probes permit the repeated detection of brain activation
   in response to diverse stimuli in vivo. MaCaReNas thus provide a tool
   for calcium-activity mapping in deep tissue and offer a precedent for
   the development of further nanoparticle-based sensors for dynamic
   molecular imaging with MRI.}},

Title = {{Load matters: neural correlates of verbal working memory in children
   with autism spectrum disorder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive
   neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by diminished social
   reciprocity and communication skills and the presence of stereotyped and
   restricted behaviours. Executive functioning deficits, such as working
   memory, are associated with core ASD symptoms. Working memory allows for
   temporary storage and manipulation of information and relies heavily on
   frontal-parietal networks of the brain. There are few reports on the
   neural correlates of working memory in youth with ASD. The current study
   identified the neural systems underlying verbal working memory capacity
   in youth with and without ASD using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI).
   Methods: Fifty-seven youth, 27 with ASD and 30 sex-and age-matched
   typically developing (TD) controls (916 years), completed a one-back
   letter matching task (LMT) with four levels of difficulty (i.e.
   cognitive load) while fMRI data were recorded. Linear trend analyses
   were conducted to examine brain regions that were recruited as a
   function of increasing cognitive load.
   Results: We found similar behavioural performance on the LMT in terms of
   reaction times, but in the two higher load conditions, the ASD youth had
   lower accuracy than the TD group. Neural patterns of activations
   differed significantly between TD and ASD groups. In TD youth, areas
   classically used for working memory, including the lateral and medial
   frontal, as well as superior parietal brain regions, increased in
   activation with increasing task difficulty, while areas related to the
   default mode network (DMN) showed decreasing activation (i.e.,
   deactivation). The youth with ASD did not appear to use this opposing
   cognitive processing system; they showed little recruitment of frontal
   and parietal regions across the load but did show similar modulation of
   the DMN.
   Conclusions: In a working memory task, where the load was manipulated
   without changing executive demands, TD youth showed increasing
   recruitment with increasing load of the classic fronto-parietal brain
   areas and decreasing involvement in default mode regions. In contrast,
   although they modulated the default mode network, youth with ASD did not
   show the modulation of increasing brain activation with increasing load,
   suggesting that they may be unable to manage increasing verbal
   information. Impaired verbal working memory in ASD would interfere with
   the youths' success academically and socially. Thus, determining the
   nature of atypical neural processing could help establish or monitor
   working memory interventions for ASD.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{200-215}},

Abstract = {{Several neurological patient populations, including traumatic brain
   injury (TBI), appear to produce an abnormally utilitarian' pattern of
   judgements to moral dilemmas; they tend to make judgements that maximize
   the welfare of the majority, rather than deontological judgements based
   on the following of moral rules (e.g., do not harm others). However,
   this patient research has always used extreme dilemmas with highly
   valued moral rules (e.g., do not kill). Data from healthy participants,
   however, suggest that when a wider range of dilemmas are employed,
   involving less valued moral rules (e.g., do not lie), moral judgements
   demonstrate sensitivity to the psychological intuitiveness of the
   judgements, rather than their deontological or utilitarian content
   (Kahane etal., Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, 7, 2011,
   393). We sought the moral judgements of 30 TBI participants and 30
   controls on moral dilemmas where content (utilitarian/deontological) and
   intuition (intuitive/counter-intuitive) were measured concurrently.
   Overall TBI participants made utilitarian judgements in equal
   proportions to controls; disproportionately favouring utilitarian
   judgements only when they were counter-intuitive, and deontological
   judgements only when they were counter-intuitive. These results speak
   against the view that TBI causes a specific utilitarian bias, suggesting
   instead that moral intuition is broadly disrupted following TBI.}},

Title = {{The Fusiform Face Area Plays a Greater Role in Holistic Processing for
   Own-Race Faces Than Other-Race Faces}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Own-race faces are recognized more effectively than other-race faces.
   This phenomenon is referred to as other-race effect (ORE). Existing
   behavioral evidence suggests that one of the possible causes of ORE is
   that own-race faces are processed more holistically than other-race
   faces. However, little is known about whether such differences in
   processing also produce distinctive neural responses in the cortical
   face processing network. To bridge this gap, the present study used fMRI
   methodology and the composite face paradigm to examine the response
   patterns of the traditional face-preferential cortical areas (i.e., the
   bilateral fusiform face areas {[}FFA] and the bilateral occipital face
   areas {[}OFA]) elicited by own-race faces and other-race faces. We found
   that the right FFA exhibited a neural composite face effect only for
   own-race faces but not for other-race faces, even with the absence of
   the race-related difference in behavior composite face effect. These
   findings suggest that the right FFA plays a greater role in holistic
   processing of individual own-race faces than other-race faces. They also
   suggest that the neural composite effect observed in the right FFA is
   not the exact neural counterpart of the behavioral face composite
   effect. The findings of the present study revealed that, along the
   pathway of the bottom-up face processing, own-race faces and other-race
   faces presented the holistic processing difference as early as when they
   were processed in the right FFA.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a period characterised by increases in risk-taking. This
   behaviour has been associated with an imbalance in the integration of
   the networks involved in cognitive control and motivational processes.
   We examined whether the influence of emotional cues on cognitive control
   differs between adolescents who show high or low levels of risk-taking
   behaviour. Participants who scored especially high or low on a risky
   decision task were subsequently administered an emotional go/no-go fMRI
   task comprising angry, happy and calm faces. Both groups showed
   decreased cognitive control when confronted with appetitive and aversive
   emotional cues. Activation in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) increased
   in line with the cognitive control demands of the task. Though the risk
   taking groups did not differ in their behavioural performance,
   functional connectivity analyses revealed the dorsal striatum plays a
   more central role in the processing of cognitive control in high than
   low risk-takers. Overall, these findings suggest that variance in
   fronto-striatal circuitry may underlie individual differences in
   risk-taking behaviour.}},

Title = {{Functional Dissociation of the Posterior and Anterior Insula in Moral
   Disgust}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{The insula is thought to be involved in disgust. However, the roles of
   the posterior insula (PI) and anterior insula (AI) in moral disgust have
   not been clearly dissociated in previous studies. In this functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study, the participants evaluated the degree
   of disgust using sentences related to mild moral violations with
   different types of behavioral agents (mother and stranger). The
   activation of the PI in response to the stranger agent was significantly
   higher than that in response to the mother agent. In contrast, the
   activation of the AI in response to the mother agent was significantly
   higher than that in response to the stranger agent. These data suggest a
   clear functional dissociation between the PI and AI in which the PI is
   more involved in the primary level of moral disgust than is the AI, and
   the AI is more involved in the secondary level of moral disgust than is
   the PI. Our results provide key evidence for understanding the principle
   of embodied cognition and particularly demonstrate that high-level moral
   disgust is built on more basic disgust via a mental construction
   approach through a process of embodied schemata.}},

Title = {{Severity of anxiety moderates the association between neural circuits

Journal = {{COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE \& BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging research has suggested that activity in the amygdala,
   center of the socioemotional network, and functional connectivity
   between the amygdala and cortical regions are associated with caregiving
   behaviors in postpartum mothers. Anxiety is common in the early
   postpartum period, with severity ranging from healthy maternal
   preoccupation to clinical disorder. However, little is known about the
   influence of anxiety on the neural correlates of early caregiving. We
   examined these relationships in a community cohort of 75 postpartum
   women (ages 18-22; predominantly low-SES, minority race) who listened to
   infant cry sounds while undergoing an fMRI assessment. Maternal
   self-reported symptoms of anxiety were mostly within the subclinical
   range. Positive and negative caregiving behaviors during filmed
   face-to-face mother-infant interactions were coded by independent
   observers. The results from whole-brain analyses showed that anxiety
   severity moderated the brain-maternal behavior relationships.
   Specifically, our results showed that the higher a mother's anxiety, the
   stronger the association between positive caregiving (i.e., maternal
   warmth and involvement) and amygdala-right posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (amygdala-RpSTS) functional connectivity. These results remained
   significant when we controlled for symptoms of depression and contextual
   variables. These findings suggest that functional connectivity between
   the amygdala and a social perception region (RpSTS) plays a particularly
   important role for anxious mothers in facilitating their positive
   parenting. These findings extend our understanding of the specific
   neural circuits that support positive maternal caregiving in the context
   of maternal anxiety, and they may help inform the future design of
   personalized and effective interventions.}},

Title = {{Predicting brain tumor regrowth in relation to motor areas by functional
   brain mapping}},
Journal = {{NEURO-ONCOLOGY PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{82-95}},

Abstract = {{Background: Due to frequent recurrences, high-grade gliomas still confer
   a poor prognosis. Several regrowth prediction models have been
   developed, but most of these models are based on cellular models or
   dynamic mathematical calculations, thus limiting direct clinical use.
   The present study aims to evaluate whether navigated transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (nTMS) or functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) may be used to predict the direction of tumor regrowth.
   Methods: Sixty consecutive patients with high-grade gliomas were
   enrolled prospectively and analyzed in a case-control design after tumor
   recurrence. All patients underwent serial MRI after surgery and suffered
   from recurrent tumors during a mean follow-up of 13.2 +/- 14.9 months.
   Tumor regrowth speed and direction were measured in relation to motor
   areas defined by nTMS, nTMS-based tractography, and fMRI. Depending on
   initial resection, patients were separated into three groups (group 1:
   without residual tumor, group 2: residual tumor away from motor areas,
   and group 3: residual tumor facing motor areas).
   Results: Sixty-nine percent of patients in group 1, 64.3\% in group 2,
   and 66.7\% in group 3 showed tumor recurrence towards motor eloquence on
   contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences (P = .9527). Average growth
   towards motor areas on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences was 0.6
   +/- 1.5 (group 1), 0.6 +/- 2.4 (group 2), and 2.3 +/- 5.5 (group 3)
   mm/month (P = .0492).
   Conclusion: This study suggests a new strategy to predict tumor regrowth
   patterns in high-grade glioma patients. Our approach could be directly
   applied in the clinical setting, thus having clinical impact on both
   surgical treatment and radiotherapy planning.}},

Abstract = {{People often make approachability decisions based on perceived facial
   trustworthiness. However, it remains unclear how people learn

   neural underpinning of approach behavior and tested two important
   hypotheses: whether the amygdala adapts to different trustworthiness
   ranges and whether the amygdala is modulated by task instructions and
   evaluative goals. We showed that participants adapted to the stimulus
   range of perceived trustworthiness when making approach decisions and
   that these decisions were further modulated by the social context. The
   right amygdala showed both linear response and quadratic response to
   trustworthiness level, as observed in prior studies. Notably, the
   amygdala's response to trustworthiness was not modulated by stimulus
   range or social context, a possible neural dynamic adaptation. Together,
   our data have revealed a robust behavioral adaptation to different
   trustworthiness ranges as well as a neural substrate underlying approach
   behavior based on perceived facial trustworthiness.}},

Abstract = {{Large portions promote intake of energy dense foods (Le., the portion
   size effect-PSE), but the neurobiological drivers of this effect are not
   known. We tested the association between blood oxygen level dependent
   (BOLD) brain response to food images varied by portion size (PS) and
   energy density (ED) and children's intake at test-meals of high- and
   low-ED foods served at varying portions. Children (N = 47; age 7-10
   years) participated in a within-subjects, crossover study consisting of
   4 meals of increasing PS of high- and low-ED foods and 1 fMRI to
   evaluate food images at 2 levels of PS (Large, Small) and 2 levels of ED
   (High, Low). Contrast values between PS conditions (e.g., Large PS -
   Small PS) were calculated from BOLD signal in brain regions implicated
   in cognitive control and reward and input as covariates in mixed models
   to determine if they moderated the PSE curve. Results showed a
   significant effect of PS on intake. Responses to Large relative to Small
   PS in brain regions implicated in salience (e.g., ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex) were positively associated
   with the linear slope (i.e., increase in intake from baseline) of the
   PSE curve, but negatively associated with the quadratic coefficient for
   the total meal. Responses to Large PS High ED relative to Small PS High
   ED cues in regions associated with cognitive control (e.g., dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex) were negatively associated with the linear slope of
   the PSE curve for high-ED foods. Brain responses to PS cues were
   associated with individual differences in children's susceptibility to
   overeating from large portions. Responses in food salience regions
   positively associated with PSE susceptibility while activation in
   control regions negatively associated with PSE susceptibility. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia (SZ) patients exhibit deficits in emotion regulation that
   affect their daily functioning. There is evidence that the prefrontal
   cortex plays an important role in emotion regulation. However, it
   remains unclear how this brain region is involved in emotion regulation
   deficits in SZ, and how such deficits impact performance on cognitively
   demanding tasks.
   We examined how happy and fearful emotional distractors impact
   performance on working memory (WM) tasks of varying difficulty (0-back,
   2-back), and brain activity using fMRI. Participants were 20 patients
   with SZ and 20 healthy controls (HC) matched on age, sex, race, and IQ.
   A significant 3-way interaction showed that SZ patients had lower
   performance compared to HC when exposed to fearful and happy
   distractors, but only during the 2-back task. Second-level fMRI
   between-group analysis revealed that compared to SZ patients, HC showed
   significantly greater increase in brain activity with WM load in the
   left IFG (BA 45) when exposed to fearful distractors. Less brain
   activity in this region was also associated with reduction in SZ
   patients' performance during higher WM load and the presence of fearful
   distractors.
   SZ patients had difficulty in performing a WM task when regulating
   emotions, and they failed to show the emotion-specific modulation of the
   left IFG observed in HC. These results suggest that SZ patients have
   difficulty with emotion regulation demands during effortful cognitive
   tasks. This also provides us with potential insight on how emotion
   regulation could be rehabilitated in SZ using cognitive training.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in cognitive and affective neuroscience come largely from
   within-subjects comparisons, in which the functional significance of
   neural activity is determined by contrasting two or more experimental
   conditions. Clinical and social neuroscience studies have attempted to
   leverage between-subject variability in such condition differences to
   better understand psychopathology and other individual differences.
   Shifting from within-to between-subjects comparisons requires that
   measures have adequate internal consistency to function as individual
   difference variables. This is particularly relevant for difference
   scores-which have lower reliability. The field has assumed reasonable
   internal consistency of neural measures based on consistent findings
   across studies (i.e., if a within-subject difference in neural activity
   is robust, then it must be reliable). Using one of the most common fMRI
   paradigms in the clinical neuroscience literature (i.e., a face- and
   shape-matching task), in a large sample of adolescents (N = 139) we
   replicate a robust finding: amygdala activation is greater for faces
   than shapes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the internal consistency of
   the amygdala in face and shape blocks was excellent (Spearman-Brown
   corrected reliability {[}SB]> .94). However, the internal consistency of
   the activation difference between faces and shapes was nearly zero (SB =
   -.06). This reflected the fact that the amygdala response to faces and
   shapes was highly correlated (r = .97) across individuals. Increased
   neural activation to faces versus shapes could not possibly function as
   an individual difference measure in these data-illustrating how neural
   activation can be robust within subjects, but unreliable as an
   individual difference measure. Strong and reproducible condition
   differences in neural activity are not necessarily well-suited for
   individual differences research- and neuroimaging studies should always
   report the internal consistency of, and correlations between,
   activations used in individual differences research.}},

Title = {{Consistency and similarity of MEG- and fMRI-signal time courses during
   movie viewing}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{173}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Movie viewing allows human perception and cognition to be studied in
   complex, real-life-like situations in a brain-imaging laboratory.
   Previous studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   with magneto-and electroencephalography (MEG and EEG) have demonstrated
   consistent temporal dynamics of brain activity across movie viewers.
   However, little is known about the similarities and differences of fMRI
   and MEG or EEG dynamics during such naturalistic situations.
   We thus compared MEG and fMRI responses to the same 15-min
   black-and-white movie in the same eight subjects who watched the movie
   twice during both MEG and fMRI recordings. We analyzed intra-and
   intersubject voxel-wise correlations within each imaging modality as
   well as the correlation of the MEG envelopes and fMRI signals. The fMRI
   signals showed voxel-wise within-and between-subjects correlations up to
   r = 0.66 and r = 0.37, respectively, whereas these correlations were
   clearly weaker for the envelopes of band-pass filtered (7 frequency
   bands below 100 Hz) MEG signals (within-subjects correlation r < 0.14
   and between-subjects r < 0.05). Direct MEG-fMRI voxel-wise correlations
   were unreliable. Notably, applying a spatial-filtering approach to the
   MEG data uncovered consistent canonical variates that showed
   considerably stronger (up to r = 0.25) between-subjects correlations
   than the univariate voxel-wise analysis. Furthermore, the envelopes of
   the time courses of these variates up to about 10 Hz showed association
   with fMRI signals in a general linear model. Similarities between
   envelopes of MEG canonical variates and fMRI voxel time-courses were
   seen mostly in occipital, but also in temporal and frontal brain
   regions, whereas intra-and intersubject correlations for MEG and fMRI
   separately were strongest only in the occipital areas.
   In contrast to the conventional univariate analysis, the
   spatial-filtering approach was able to uncover associations between the
   MEG envelopes and fMRI time courses, shedding light on the similarities
   of hemodynamic and electromagnetic brain activities during movie
   viewing.}},

Abstract = {{When another person tries to control one's decisions, some people might
   comply, but many will feel the urge to act against that control. This
   control aversion can lead to suboptimal decisions and it affects social
   interactions in many societal domains. To date, however, it has been
   unclear what drives individual differences in control-averse behavior.
   Here, we address this issue by measuring brain activity with fMRI while
   healthy female and male human participants made choices that were either
   free or controlled by another person, with real consequences to both
   interaction partners. In addition, we assessed the participants'
   affects, social cognitions, and motivations via self-reports. Our
   results indicate that the social cognitions perceived distrust and lack
   of understanding for the other person play a key role in explaining
   control aversion at the behavioral level. At the neural level, we find
   that control-averse behavior can be explained by functional connectivity
   between the inferior parietal lobule and the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex, brain regions commonly associated with attention reorientation
   and cognitive control. Further analyses reveal that the individual
   strength of functional connectivity complements and partially mediates
   the self-reported social cognitions in explaining individual differences
   in control-averse behavior. These findings therefore provide valuable
   contributions to a more comprehensive model of control aversion.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which
   the severity of symptoms varies over subjects. The iCAPs model
   (innovation-driven co-activation patterns) is a recently developed
   spatio-temporal model to describe fMRI data. In this study, the iCAPs
   model was employed to find functional imaging biomarkers for ASD in
   resting-state fMRI data.
   MRI data from 125 ASD patients and 243 healthy controls was selected
   from the online ABIDE data repository. Following standard fMRI
   preprocessing steps, the iCAP patterns were fitted to the data to obtain
   network time series. Furthermore, specific combinations of iCAPs were
   mapped to behavioral domain time series. To quantify to which extent the
   time series contribute to the fMRI dynamics, their (temporal) standard
   deviation was calculated and compared between patients and controls.
   Abnormalities were found in networks involving subcortical and limbic
   areas and default mode network regions. When mapping the network
   dynamics to behavioral domain time series, abnormalities were found in
   emotional and visual behavioral subdomains, and within the ASD spectrum
   were more pronounced in subjects with autism compared to Asperger's
   syndrome. Also a trend towards impairment in networks facilitating
   social cognition was found. The functional imaging abnormalities are
   consistent with the behavioral impairments typical for ASD.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Are some people generally more successful using cognitive regulation or
   does it depend on the choice domain? Why? We combined behavioral
   computational modeling and multivariate decoding of fMRI responses to
   identify neural loci of regulation-related shifts in value
   representations across goals and domains (dietary or altruistic choice).
   Surprisingly, regulatory goals did not alter integrative value
   representations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which represented
   all choice-relevant attributes across goals and domains. Instead, the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) flexibly encoded goal-consistent
   values and predicted regulatory success for the majority of
   choice-relevant attributes, using attribute-specific neural codes. We
   also identified domain-specific exceptions: goal-dependent encoding of
   prosocial attributes localized to precuneus and temporo-parietal
   junction (not DLPFC). Our results suggest that cognitive regulation
   operated by changing specific attribute representations (not integrated
   values). Evidence of domain-general and domain-specific neural loci
   reveals important divisions of labor, explaining when and why regulatory
   success generalizes (or doesn't) across contexts and domains.}},

Abstract = {{Gratitude is a typical social-moral emotion that plays a crucial role in
   maintaining human cooperative interpersonal relationship. Although
   neural correlates of gratitude have been investigated, the
   neurocognitive processes that lead to gratitude, namely, the
   representation and integration of its cognitive antecedents, remain
   largely unknown. Here, we combined fMRI and a human social interactive
   task to investigate how benefactor's cost and beneficiary's benefit, two
   critical antecedents of gratitude, are encoded and integrated in
   beneficiary's brain, and how the neural processing of gratitude is
   converted to reciprocity. A coplayer decided whether to help a human
   participant (either male or female) avoid pain at his/her own monetary
   cost; the participants could transfer monetary points to the benefactor
   with the knowledge that the benefactor was unaware of this transfer. By
   independently manipulating monetary cost and the degree of pain
   reduction, we could identify the neural signatures of benefactor's cost
   and recipient's benefit and examine how they were integrated.
   Recipient's self-benefit was encoded in reward-sensitive regions (e.g.,
   ventral striatum), whereas benefactor-cost was encoded in regions
   associated with mentalizing (e.g., temporoparietal junction). Gratitude
   was represented in perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), the
   strength of which correlated with trait gratitude. Dynamic causal
   modeling showed that the neural signals representing benefactor-cost and
   self-benefit passed to pgACC via effective connectivities, suggesting an
   integrative role of pgACC in generating gratitude. Moreover, gyral ACC
   plays an intermediary role in converting gratitude representation into
   reciprocal behaviors. Our findings provide a neural mechanistic account
   of gratitude and its role in social-moral life.}},

Title = {{Regional Homogeneity Predicts Creative Insight: A Resting-State fMRI
   Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Creative insight plays an important role in our daily life. Previous
   studies have investigated the neural correlates of creative insight by
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), however, the intrinsic
   resting-state brain activity associated with creative insight is still
   unclear. In the present study, we used regional homogeneity (ReHo) as an
   index in resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) to identify brain regions involved
   in individual differences in creative insight, which was compued by the
   response time (RT) of creative Chinese character chunk decomposition.
   The findings indicated that ReHo in the anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC)/caudate nucleus (CN) and angular gyrus (AG)/superior temporal
   gyrus (STG)/inferior parietal lobe (IPL) negatively predicted creative
   insight. Furthermore, these findings suggested that spontaneous brain
   activity in multiple regions related to breaking and establishing mental
   sets, goal-directed solutions exploring, shifting attention, forming new
   associations and emotion experience contributes to creative insight. In
   conclusion, the present study provides new evidence to further
   understand the cognitive processing and neural correlates of creative
   insight.}},

Abstract = {{The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is a
   microglial innate immune receptor associated with a lethal form of
   early, progressive dementia, Nasu-Hakola disease, and with an increased
   risk of Alzheimer's disease. Microglial defects in phagocytosis of toxic
   aggregates or apoptotic membranes were proposed to be at the origin of
   the pathological processes in the presence of Trem2 inactivating
   mutations. Here, we show that TREM2 is essential for microglia-mediated
   synaptic refinement during the early stages of brain development. The
   absence of Trem2 resulted in impaired synapse elimination, accompanied
   by enhanced excitatory neurotransmission and reduced long-range
   functional connectivity. Trem2(-/-) mice displayed repetitive behavior
   and altered sociability. TREM2 protein levels were also negatively
   correlated with the severity of symptoms in humans affected by autism.
   These data unveil the role of TREM2 in neuronal circuit sculpting and
   provide the evidence for the receptor's involvement in
   neurodevelopmental diseases.}},

Title = {{Investigating the Neural Basis of Theta Burst Stimulation to Premotor
   Cortex on Emotional Vocalization Perception: A Combined TMS-fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have established a role for premotor cortex in the
   processing of auditory emotional vocalizations. Inhibitory continuous
   theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) applied to right
   premotor cortex selectively increases the reaction time to a
   same-different task, implying a causal role for right ventral premotor
   cortex (PMv) in the processing of emotional sounds. However, little is
   known about the functional networks to which PMv contribute across the
   cortical hemispheres. In light of these data, the present study aimed to
   investigate how and where in the brain cTBS affects activity during the
   processing of auditory emotional vocalizations. Using functional
   neuroimaging, we report that inhibitory cTBS applied to the right
   premotor cortex (compared to vertex control site) results in three
   distinct response profiles: following stimulation of PMv, widespread
   frontoparietal cortices, including a site close to the target site, and
   parahippocampal gyrus displayed an increase in activity, whereas the
   reverse response profile was apparent in a set of midline structures and
   right IFG. A third response profile was seen in left supramarginal gyrus
   in which activity was greater post-stimulation at both stimulation
   sites. Finally, whilst previous studies have shown a condition specific
   behavioral effect following cTBS to premotor cortex, we did not find a
   condition specific neural change in BOLD response. These data
   demonstrate a complex relationship between cTBS and activity in
   widespread neural networks and are discussed in relation to both
   emotional processing and the neural basis of cTBS.}},

Title = {{Brain Structural and Functional Substrates of Personal Distress in
   Empathy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Empathy is the capacity to understand and experience the feeling state
   of others. While individuals attribute negative empathic responses to
   their own feelings, they would endure personal distress that can be
   harmful to social interaction. However, the neural mechanism of personal
   distress remains unclear. Here, we examined the neural substrates of
   personal distress by combining structural (Voxel-based morphometry
   (VBM)) and functional (resting-state functional connectivity (FC)
   analysis) MRI approaches in 53 college students (aged 19-26). A negative
   correlation was found between a trait measure of personal distress and
   gray matter (GM) volume in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC).
   FC analyses with the dmPFC as a seed further revealed that the
   connectivity between the dmPFC and posterior insula was positively
   correlated with the personal distress, and the connectivities between
   the dmPFC and the anterior middle cingulate cortex, left lateral frontal
   cortex, and left inferior parietal gyrus were negatively correlated with
   the personal distress. Our results suggested that personal distress is
   underlain by neural substrates associated with both cognitive and
   affective mechanisms. Taken together, the structural and functional
   correlates of personal distress revealed in the present findings shed
   new light into the understanding of empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Delineation of functional topography is critical to the evolving
   understanding of the cerebellum's role in a wide range of nervous system
   functions. We used data from the Human Connectome Project (n = 787) to
   analyze cerebellar fMRI task activation (motor, working memory,
   language, social and emotion processing) and resting-state functional
   connectivity calculated from cerebral cortical seeds corresponding to
   the peak Cohen's d of each task contrast. The combination of exceptional
   statistical power, activation from both motor and multiple non-motor
   tasks in the same participants, and convergent resting-state networks in
   the same participants revealed novel aspects of the functional
   topography of the human cerebellum. Consistent with prior studies there
   were two distinct representations of motor activation. Newly revealed
   were three distinct representations each for working memory, language,
   social, and emotional task processing that were largely separate for
   these four cognitive and affective domains. In most cases, the
   task-based activations and the corresponding resting-network
   correlations were congruent in identifying the two motor representations
   and the three non-motor representations that were unique to working
   memory, language, social cognition, and emotion. The definitive
   localization and characterization of distinct triple representations for
   cognition and emotion task processing in the cerebellum opens up new
   basic science questions as to why there are triple representations (what
   different functions are enabled by the different representations?) and
   new clinical questions (what are the differing consequences of lesions
   to the different representations?).}},

   whole-brain functional connectivity}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety is one of the most common mental states of humans. Although it
   drives us to avoid frightening situations and to achieve our goals, it
   may also impose significant suffering and burden if it becomes extreme.
   Because we experience anxiety in a variety of forms, previous studies
   investigated neural substrates of anxiety in a variety of ways. These
   studies revealed that individuals with high state, trait, or
   pathological anxiety showed altered neural substrates. However, no
   studies have directly investigated whether the different dimensions of
   anxiety share a common neural substrate, despite its theoretical and
   practical importance. Here, we investigated a brain network of anxiety
   shared by different dimensions of anxiety in a unified analytical
   framework using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We
   analyzed different datasets in a single scale, which was defined by an
   anxiety-related brain network derived from whole brain. We first
   conducted the anxiety provocation task with healthy participants who
   tended to feel anxiety related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in
   their daily life. We found a common state anxiety brain network across
   participants (1585 trials obtained from 10 participants). Then, using
   the resting-state fMRI in combination with the participants' behavioral
   trait anxiety scale scores (879 participants from the Human Connectome
   Project), we demonstrated that trait anxiety shared the same brain
   network as state anxiety. Furthermore, the brain network between common
   to state and trait anxiety could detect patients with OCD, which is
   characterized by pathological anxiety-driven behaviors (174 participants
   from multi-site datasets). Our findings provide direct evidence that
   different dimensions of anxiety have a substantial biological
   inter-relationship. Our results also provide a biologically defined
   dimension of anxiety, which may promote further investigation of various
   human characteristics, including psychiatric disorders, from the
   perspective of anxiety.}},

Title = {{Subjective Experience, Heterophenomenology, or Neuroimaging? A
   Perspective on the Meaning and Application of Mental Disorder Terms, in
   Particular Major Depressive Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Increasing research efforts try to identify biological markers in order
   to support or eventually replace current practices of diagnosing mental
   disorders. Inasmuch as these disorders refer to subjective mental
   states, such efforts amount to their objectification. This gives rise to
   conceptual as well as empirical challenges: What kind of things are
   mental disorders? And how to deal with situations where subjective
   reports, clinical decisions, and brain scans contradict each other? The
   present paper starts out with a discussion of recent efforts to
   objectify beauty. Such attempts to quantify and localize psychological
   constructs in the brain are compared to earlier examples from the
   history of psychology. The paper then discusses personal and social
   implications of the objectification of subjective mental states,
   including mental disorders. The construct of Major Depressive Disorder,
   one of the most prevalent mental disorders, is then analyzed in more
   detail. It turns out that this is a very complex construct probably
   associated with highly heterogeneous actual instances of the disorder.
   It is then shown that it is unlikely to replace these symptoms'
   descriptions with patterns of brain activations, at least in the near
   future, given these patterns' empirical lack of specificity. The paper
   then discusses which of the disorder's core symptoms are more or less
   amenable to behavioral or neuroscientific investigation and analyses
   whether the heterophenomenological method can solve the problem. The
   conclusion is that the disorder construct is neither entirely
   subjective, nor completely objectifiable, and that clinical experts do
   well by continuing to take a pragmatical stance.}},

Title = {{Spectral Dynamics of Resting State fMRI Within the Ventral Tegmental
   Area and Dorsal Raphe Nuclei in Medication-Free Major Depressive
   Disorder in Young Adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA)
   are major brainstem monamine nuclei consisting of serotonin and dopamine
   neurons respectively. Animal studies show that firing patterns in both
   nuclei are altered when animals exhibit depression like behaviors.
   Functional MRI studies in humans have shown reduced VTA activation and
   DRN connectivity in depression. This study for the first time aims at
   investigating the functional integrity of local neuronal firing
   concurrently in both the VTA and DRN in vivo in humans using spectral
   analysis of resting state low frequency fluctuation fMRI.
   Method: A total of 97 medication-free subjects-67 medication-free young
   patients (ages 18-30) with major depressive disorder and 30 closely
   matched healthy controls were included in the study to detect aberrant
   dynamics in DRN and VTA. For the investigation of altered localized
   dynamics we conducted power spectral analysis and above this spectral
   cross correlation between the two groups. Complementary to this,
   spectral dependence of permutation entropy, an information theoretical
   measure, was compared between groups.
   Results: Patients displayed significant spectral slowing in VTA vs.
   controls (p = 0.035, corrected). In DRN, spectral slowing was less
   pronounced, but the amount of slowing significantly correlated with
   17-item Hamilton Depression Rating scores of depression severity (p =
   0.038). Signal complexity as assessed via permutation entropy showed
   spectral alterations inline with the results on spectral slowing.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that altered functional dynamics of VTA
   and DRN in depression can be detected from regional fMRI signal. On this
   basis, impact of antidepressant treatment and treatment response can be
   assessed using these markers in future studies.}},

Title = {{Magnitude processing of symbolic and non-symbolic proportions: an fMRI
   study}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recent research indicates that processing proportion
   magnitude is associated with activation in the intraparietal sulcus.
   Thus, brain areas associated with the processing of numbers (i.e.,
   absolute magnitude) were activated during processing symbolic fractions
   as well as non-symbolic proportions. Here, we investigated
   systematically the cognitive processing of symbolic (e.g., fractions and
   decimals) and non-symbolic proportions (e.g., dot patterns and pie
   charts) in a two-stage procedure. First, we investigated relative
   magnitude-related activations of proportion processing. Second, we
   evaluated whether symbolic and non-symbolic proportions share common
   neural substrates.
   Methods: We conducted an fMRI study using magnitude comparison tasks
   with symbolic and non-symbolic proportions, respectively. As an
   indicator for magnitude-related processing of proportions, the distance
   effect was evaluated.
   Results: A conjunction analysis indicated joint activation of specific
   occipito-parietal areas including right intraparietal sulcus (IPS)
   during proportion magnitude processing. More specifically, results
   indicate that the IPS, which is commonly associated with absolute
   magnitude processing, is involved in processing relative magnitude
   information as well, irrespective of symbolic or non-symbolic
   presentation format. However, we also found distinct activation patterns
   for the magnitude processing of the different presentation formats.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that processing for the separate
   presentation formats is not only associated with magnitude manipulations
   in the IPS, but also increasing demands on executive functions and
   strategy use associated with frontal brain regions as well as visual
   attention and encoding in occipital regions. Thus, the magnitude
   processing of proportions may not exclusively reflect processing of
   number magnitude information but also rather domain-general processes.}},

   Based on Linear ICA Analysis in Autism Spectrum Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Some functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) researches in autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD) patients have shown that ASD patients have
   significant impairment in brain response. However, few researchers have
   studied the functional structure changes of the eight resting state
   networks (RSNs) in ASD patients. Therefore, research on statistical
   differences of RSNs between 42 healthy controls (HC) and 50 ASD patients
   has been studied using linear independent component analysis (ICA) in
   this paper. Our researches showed that there was abnormal functional
   connectivity (FC) of RSNs in ASD patients. The RSNs with the decreased
   FC and increased FC in ASD patients included default mode network (DMN),
   central executive network (CEN), core network (CN), visual network (VN),
   self-referential network (SRN) compared to HC. The RSNs with the
   increased FC in ASD patients included auditory network (AN),
   somato-motor network (SMN). The dorsal attention network (DAN) in ASD
   patients showed the decreased FC. Our findings indicate that the
   abnormal FC in RSNs extensively exists in ASD patients. Our results have
   important contribution for the study of neuro-pathophysiological
   mechanisms in ASD patients.}},

   social information: An automated meta-analysis and an independent study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{How the human brain processes social information is an increasingly
   researched topic in psychology and neuroscience, advancing our
   understanding of basic human cognition and psychopathologies.
   Neuroimaging studies typically seek to isolate one specific aspect of
   social cognition when trying to map its neural substrates. It is unclear
   if brain activation elicited by different social cognitive processes and
   task instructions are also spontaneously elicited by general social
   information. In this study, we investigated whether these brain regions
   are evoked by the mere presence of social information using an automated
   meta-analysis and confirmatory data from an independent study of simple
   appraisal of social vs. non-social images. Results of 1,000 published
   fMRI studies containing the keyword of ``social{''} were subject to an
   automated meta-analysis (http://neurosynth.org). To confirm that
   significant brain regions in the meta-analysis were driven by a social
   effect, these brain regions were used as regions of interest (ROIs) to
   extract and compare BOLD fMRI signals of social vs. non-social
   conditions in the independent study. The NeuroSynth results indicated
   that the dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, posterior
   cingulate cortex, bilateral amygdala, bilateral occipito-temporal
   junction, right fusiform gyrus, bilateral temporal pole, and right
   inferior frontal gyrus are commonly engaged in studies with a prominent
   social element. The social-non-social contrast in the independent study
   showed a strong resemblance to the NeuroSynth map. ROI analyses revealed
   that a social effect was credible in 9 out of the 11 NeuroSynth regions
   in the independent dataset. The findings support the conclusion that the
   ``social brain{''} is highly sensitive to the mere presence of social
   information.}},

Title = {{Unsupervised Scalable Statistical Method for Identifying Influential
   Users in Online Social Networks}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 3}},
Abstract = {{Billions of users interact intensively every day via Online Social
   Networks (OSNs) such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google+. This makes OSNs
   an invaluable source of information, and channel of actuation, for
   sectors like advertising, marketing, or politics. To get the most of
   OSNs, analysts need to identify influential users that can be leveraged
   for promoting products, distributing messages, or improving the image of
   companies. In this report we propose a new unsupervised method, Massive
   Unsupervised Outlier Detection (MUOD), based on outliers detection, for
   providing support in the identification of influential users. MUOD is
   scalable, and can hence be used in large OSNs. Moreover, it labels the
   outliers as of shape, magnitude, or amplitude, depending of their
   features. This allows classifying the outlier users in multiple
   different classes, which are likely to include different types of
   influential users. Applying MUOD to a subset of roughly 400 million
   Google+ users, it has allowed identifying and discriminating
   automatically sets of outlier users, which present features associated
   to different definitions of influential users, like capacity to attract
   engagement, capacity to attract a large number of followers, or high
   infection capacity.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that Parkinson's disease leads to impaired
   learning from reward and enhanced learning from punishment. The
   administration of dopaminergic medications reverses this learning
   pattern. However, few studies have investigated the neural underpinnings
   of these cognitive processes. In this study, using fMRI, we tested a
   group of Parkinson's disease patients on and off dopaminergic
   medications and matched healthy individuals. All individuals completed
   an fMRI cognitive task that dissociates feedback learning from reward
   versus punishment. The administration of dopaminergic medications
   attenuated blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses to punishment
   in the bilateral putamen, in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   and the left premotor cortex. Further, the administration of
   dopaminergic medications resulted in a higher ratio of BOLD activity
   between reward and punishment trials in these brain areas. BOLD activity
   in these brain areas was significantly correlated with learning from
   punishment, but not from reward trials. Furthermore, the administration
   of dopaminergic medications altered BOLD activity in the right insula
   and ventromedial prefrontal cortex when Parkinson's disease patients
   were anticipating feedback. These findings are in agreement with a large
   body of literature indicating that Parkinson's disease is associated
   with enhanced learning from punishment. However, it was surprising that
   dopaminergic medications modulated punishment learning as opposed to
   reward learning, although reward learning has been directly linked to
   dopaminergic function. We argue that these results might be attributed
   to both a change in the balance between direct and indirect pathway
   activation in the basal ganglia as well as the differential activity of
   D1 versus D2 dopamine receptors.}},

   for Reacting to Social Threat: A Combined cTBS-fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Expressions of emotion are powerful triggers for situation-appropriate
   responses by the observer. Of particular interest regarding the
   preparation of such adaptive actions are parietal and premotor cortices,
   given their potential for interaction with the amygdala (AMG), which is
   known to play a crucial role in the processing of affective information
   and in motor response. We set out to disentangle the respective roles of
   the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and ventral premotor cortex (PMv) in
   humans in the processing of emotional body expressions by assessing
   remote effects of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) in the
   action network and in AMG. Participants were presented with blocks of
   short videos showing either angry or neutral whole-body actions. The
   experiment consisted of three fMRI sessions: two sessions were preceded
   by stimulation of either right IPL (rIPL) or right PMv (rPMv); and a
   third session assessed baseline activity. Interestingly, whereas at
   baseline the left AMG did not differentiate between neutral and angry
   body postures, a significant difference between these conditions emerged
   after stimulation of either rIPL or rPMv, with much larger responses to
   angry than to neutral stimuli. In addition, the effects of cTBS
   stimulation and emotion were also observed in two other action-relevant
   areas, the supplementary motor area and the superior parietal cortex.
   Together, these results show how areas involved in action and emotion
   perception and in action preparation interact dynamically.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Neuroimaging studies have shown that major depressive
   disorder is associated with altered activity patterns of the
   default-mode network (DMN). In this study, we sought to investigate the
   topological organization of the DMN in patients with remitted geriatric
   depression (RGD) and whether RGD patients would be more likely to show
   disrupted topological configuration of the DMN during the resting-state.
   Methods: Thirty-three RGD patients and thirty-one healthy control
   participants underwent clinical and cognitive evaluations as well as
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The
   functional connectivity (FC) networks were constructed by thresholding
   Pearson correlation metrics of the DMN regions defined by group
   independent component analysis, and their topological properties (e.g.
   small-world and network efficiency) were analyzed using graph
   theory-based approaches.
   Results: Relative to the healthy controls, the RGD patients showed
   decreased FC in the posterior regions of the DMN (i.e. the posterior
   cingulate cortex/precuneus, angular gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus).
   Furthermore, the RGD patients showed abnormal global topology of the DMN
   (i.e. increased characteristic path length and reduced global
   efficiency) when compared with healthy controls. Importantly,
   significant correlations between these network measures and cognitive
   performance indicated their potential use as biomarkers of cognitive
   dysfunction in RGD.
   Conclusions: The present study indicated disrupted FC and topological
   organization of the DMN in the context of RGD, and further implied their
   contribution to cognitive deficits in RGD patients.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is the problem of selection of some meanings of
   ambiguous information to become aware of, and the problem of subsequent
   influence of unnoticed meanings on recognition processes. For the
   purpose of experimental verification of the idea that there is a
   dynamics of recognition of unnoticed meanings of ambiguous images, two
   experiments were conducted. The ambiguous images and reversible pictures
   were used as stimuli for memorization which had to be recognized
   immediately after presentation, the next day, a week and a month later.
   We tested the hypothesis according to which previously unnoticed
   meanings of ambiguous images tend to penetrate into consciousness as
   recognition errors in the course of time. The experimental results are
   consistent with the hypothesis: a month after the presentation the
   number of recognition errors for inverted characters of the reversible
   pictures reached 71.2\%; the number of false recognition errors for
   descriptions of noticed meanings of ambiguous images with elements of
   alternative meanings reached 67,8\% (both values are significantly
   different from those in control conditions). The comparison of several
   theoretical approaches to polysemy perception allows us to conclude that
   the best explanation for the obtained results can be proposed by the
   negative choice theory. This theory postulates that unnoticed polysemy
   interpretations show themselves in two ways: they are missed repeatedly
   in the same context but penetrate into consciousness as errors when
   context changes.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Middle-aged offspring from long-lived families are thought
   to have a slower pace of aging, possibly related to HPA-axis function.
   Here, we investigated the neural and behavioral effects of social stress
   in offspring compared to their regular aging partners on emotional
   distraction during working memory (WM).
   Methods: 104 middle-aged participants (53 males) consisting of offspring
   and their partners underwent the Trier Social Stress Test or a control
   procedure. Hereafter, a WM task with emotional distracters was performed
   using fMRI. Saliva cortisol levels were obtained during the procedure.
   Results: Partners had higher overall cortisol levels than offspring. In
   addition, partners had decreased deactivations compared to offspring in
   the medial posterior cingulate cortex (mPCC) during emotional
   distraction, which were significantly correlated with lower accuracy
   during emotional distraction.
   Discussion: mPCC-deactivations are known to be modulated by
   chronological aging, with more deactivations in the young than in the
   old. Here we show the same pattern in familial longevity versus regular
   aging after mild stress, with more deactivations related to better
   accuracy during emotional distraction. Functional mPCC deactivations
   might thus be related to pace of aging, and can be revealed by inducing
   mild stress.}},

   large-scale brain network connectivity underlying creativity. The
   results showed that the strength of the connectivity between the

   connectivity strength was weaker in the creative condition than in the

   connectivity strength in the divergent thinking task was positively
   correlated with the connectivity strength between anterior DMN and left

   connectivity strength during the resting-state was positively correlated
   with the originality score derived from divergent thinking task. Taken
   together, these findings extend previous research by revealing the
   cooperation between the DMN and FPN involved in creative thinking during

Abstract = {{We aimed to identify biomarkers to guide the decision to add selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) to psychological treatment for
   social anxiety disorder (SAD). Forty-eight patients with SAD underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and collection of clinical and
   demographic variables before treatment with cognitive-behavioural
   therapy, combined on a double-blind basis with either escitalopram or
   placebo for 9 weeks. Pre-treatment neural reactivity to aversive faces
   in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but not
   clinical/demographic variables, moderated clinical outcomes.
   Cross-validated individual-level predictions accurately identified 81\%
   of responders/non-responders. Dorsal ACC reactivity is thus a potential
   bio-marker for SAD treatment selection.}},

Abstract = {{Personal space, defined as the distance individuals choose to maintain
   between themselves and others, is an indicator of affiliation and
   closeness. Most paradigms that measure personal space preferences
   involve explicit choice and therefore fail to examine the implicit
   aspects of such preferences. In the current study, we sought to
   investigate an implicit form of interpersonal space that is more closely
   related to real-life situations involving affiliation. We studied the
   effects of oxytocin (OT) on neural networks that involve affiliation and
   tested the impact on personal space preferences. In a double-blind
   placebo-controlled study, we asked participants to choose between two
   rooms that differed only in the distances between two stimuli. The
   stimuli were either social stimuli (two chairs) or non-social stimuli
   (table and plant). The behavioral results showed that OT caused
   participants to choose a closer space in social blocks but did not
   affect their choices in non-social blocks. Imaging results revealed an
   interaction between stimulus and treatment (OT/PL) in the dorsal
   striatum, an area that is related to approach motivation and is part of
   the reward circuitry. Specifically, OT increased activity in the dorsal
   striatum in the social blocks and decreased this activity in the
   non-social blocks. The results of the study strengthen the social
   salience theory regarding OT, indicating that OT does not uniformly
   affect all social responses and that context has a determining impact on
   our behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In second language acquisition studies, the high talker variability
   training approach has been frequently used to train participants to
   learn new speech patterns. However, the neuroplasticity induced by
   training is poorly understood. In the present study, native English
   speakers were trained on non-native pitch patterns (linguistic tones
   from Mandarin Chinese) in multi-talker (N = 16) or single-talker (N =
   16) training conditions. We focused on two aspects of multi-talker
   training, voice processing and lexical phonology accessing, and used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the brain
   activation and functional connectivity (FC) of two regions of interest
   in a tone identification task conducted before and after training,
   namely the anterior part of the right superior temporal gyrus (aRSTG)
   and the posterior left superior temporal gyrus (pLSTG). The results
   showed distinct patterns of associations between neural signals and
   learning success for multi-talker training. Specifically, post-training
   brain activation in the aRSTG and FC strength between the aRSTG and
   pLSTG were correlated with learning success in the multi-talker training
   group but not in the single-talker group. These results suggest that
   talker variability in the training procedure may enhance neural
   efficiency in these brain areas and strengthen the cooperation between
   them. Our findings highlight the brain processing of newly learned
   speech patterns is influenced by the given training approach.}},

   reasoning or theory of mind, a key cognitive process for moral judgment.
   First, univariate analyses reveal item-specific features that lead to
   greater recruitment of theory of mind regions for psychological harm
   versus physical harm. Second, multivariate pattern analyses reveal
   sensitivity to the psychological/physical distinction in two regions
   implicated in theory of mind: the right temporoparietal junction and the
   precuneus. Third, we find no reliable differences between neurotypical
   adults and adults with autism spectrum disorder with regard to neural

Abstract = {{Social rejection is a painful event that often increases aggression.
   However, the neural mechanisms of this rejection-aggression link remain
   unclear. A potential clue may be that rejected people often recruit the
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex's (VLPFC) self-regulatory processes to
   manage the pain of rejection. Using functional MRI, we replicated
   previous links between rejection and activity in the brain's mentalizing
   network, social pain network and VLPFC. VLPFC recruitment during
   rejection was associated with greater activity in the brain's reward
   network (i.e. the ventral striatum) when individuals were given an
   opportunity to retaliate. This retaliation-related striatal response was
   associated with greater levels of retaliatory aggression.
   Dispositionally aggressive individuals exhibited less functional
   connectivity between the ventral striatum and the right VLPFC during
   aggression. This connectivity exerted a suppressing effect on
   dispositionally aggressive individuals' greater aggressive responses to
   rejection. These results help explain how the pain of rejection and
   reward of revenge motivate rejected people to behave aggressively.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we utilized a novel fMRI paradigm to examine the
   behavioral and neural correlates of parenting self-evaluation in a
   sample of mothers with at least one child under the age of 4 (N = 37).
   Prior self-report, behavioral and observational research document the
   implications of parenting self-evaluations for parent well-being and
   caregiving behavior; however, relatively little is known about the
   neural circuitry underlying these self-referential processes and to what
   extent they are influenced by caregiving experience. Although
   neuroimaging paradigms indexing other aspects of parental function
   exist, this is the first to use functional neuroimaging to study
   parenting self-evaluation in a controlled laboratory setting. We found
   parenting self-evaluations elicited significantly greater activity
   across most cortical midline structures, including the medial prefrontal
   cortex compared to control evaluations; these findings converge with
   previous work on the neural underpinning of general trait
   self-evaluation. Notable differences by parity were observed in
   exploratory analyses: specifically, primiparous mothers endorsed a
   higher number of developmentally supportive traits, exhibited faster
   reaction times, and showed a greater difference in mPFC activity when
   making self-evaluations of developmentally supportive traits than of
   developmentally unsupportive traits, compared to multiparous mothers.
   Implications of these findings and study limitations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a time of increased social-affective sensitivity, which

   knock on doors in order to earn points. With each knock, the facial
   expression of the house's resident shifted from happy to somewhat
   angrier. If the resident became too angry, the door slammed and
   participants lost points. Social sensitivity was defined as the extent
   to which adolescents adjusted their risky choices based on shifting
   facial expressions. Results confirmed a curvilinear relationship between
   social sensitivity and self-reported adaptive decision-making at the
   behavioral and neural level. Moderate adolescent social sensitivity was
   modulated via heightened tracking of social cues in the temporoparietal
   junction, insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and related to
   adaptive decision-making. These findings suggest that social-affective
   sensitivity may positively impact outcomes in adolescence and have
   implications for interventions to help adolescents reach mature social
   goals into adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{The functional organization of human emotion systems as well as their
   neuroanatomical basis and segregation in the brain remains unresolved.
   Here, we used pattern classification and hierarchical clustering to
   characterize the organization of a wide array of emotion categories in
   the human brain. We induced 14 emotions (6 `basic', e.g. fear and anger;
   and 8 `non-basic', e.g. shame and gratitude) and a neutral state using
   guided mental imagery while participants' brain activity was measured
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve out of 14
   emotions could be reliably classified from the haemodynamic signals. All
   emotions engaged a multitude of brain areas, primarily in midline
   cortices including anterior and posterior cingulate gyri and precuneus,
   in subcortical regions, and in motor regions including cerebellum and
   premotor cortex. Similarity of subjective emotional experiences was
   associated with similarity of the corresponding neural activation
   patterns. We conclude that different basic and non-basic emotions have
   distinguishable neural bases characterized by specific, distributed
   activation patterns in widespread cortical and subcortical circuits.
   Regionally differentiated engagement of these circuits defines the
   unique neural activity pattern and the corresponding subjective feeling
   associated with each emotion.}},

Abstract = {{There is accumulating evidence that youths with antisocial behavior or
   psychopathic traits show deficits in facial emotion recognition, but
   little is known about the neuralmechanisms underlying these impairments.
   A number of neuroimaging studies have investigated brain activity during
   facial emotion processing in youths with Conduct Disorder (CD) and
   adults with psychopathy, but few of these studies tested for group
   differences in effective connectivity-i.e. changes in connectivity
   during emotion processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   and psycho-physiological interaction methods, we investigated the impact
   of CD and psychopathic traits on amygdala activity and effective
   connectivity in 46 male youths with CD and 25 typically-developing
   controls when processing emotional faces. All participants were aged
   16-21 years. Relative to controls, youths with CD showed reduced
   amygdala activity when processing angry or sad faces relative to neutral
   faces, but the groups did not significantly differ in amygdala-related
   effective connectivity. In contrast, psychopathic traits were negatively
   correlated with amygdala-ventral anterior cingulate cortex connectivity
   for angry vs neutral faces, but were unrelated to amygdala responses to
   angry or sad faces. These findings suggest that CD and psychopathic
   traits have differential effects on amygdala activation and functional
   interactions between limbic regions during facial emotion processing.}},

Abstract = {{Norm violations are ubiquitous in organizations and often result in
   tangible harm and a loss of trust. One possible response to enhance
   trust involves the provision of financial compensation. Unfortunately,
   little is known about the processes that underlie the effect of such a
   tangible response to increase trust. We employed techniques in cognitive
   neuroscience (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to examine these
   processes. Participants placed in the scanner played the role of
   recipient in a series of dictator games with different allocators who
   (unknown to them) were preprogrammed. An unequal division of resources
   was used as a norm violation that resulted in a financial loss.
   Afterward the inflicted harm was restored through equal financial
   compensation. Our neuroimaging data indicate that financial compensation
   activates forgiveness-related brain areas and that this activation
   mediates the positive effect of financial compensation on trust. We
   discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of using tangible
   responses to increase trust in organizational settings.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{107-117}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: A vast literature finds that low self-control is associated
   with a myriad of antisocial behaviors. Consequently, increasing
   attention has focused on the causes of low self-control. While
   criminologists have directed significant attention to studying its
   social causes, fewer studies have considered its neural bases.
   Methods: We add to this nascent body of research by using data collected
   on an at-risk sample of adolescents participating in the ongoing
   Michigan Longitudinal Study. We examine the functioning of prefrontal
   and limbic regions of the brain during failed inhibitory control,
   assessed using the go/no-go task and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, in relation to low self-control and self-reported delinquency.
   Results: Results indicate that greater activation localized in the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during failed inhibitory control is
   negatively associated with low self-control. Moreover, the association
   between ACC activity and later delinquency is mediated through low
   self-control.
   Conclusions: Findings of this study demonstrate the utility of
   integrating neuroscientific and criminological perspectives on the
   causes of antisocial behavior. Concluding remarks address the
   theoretical and policy implications of the findings, as well as
   directions for future research.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate functional connectivity (FC) of the ventrolateral
   thalamus, a common target for drug-resistant essential tremor (ET),
   resting-state data were analyzed before and 1 year after stereotactic
   radiosurgical thalamotomy and compared against healthy controls (HCs).
   METHODS: In total, 17 consecutive patients with ET and 10 HCs were
   enrolled. Tremor network was investigated using the ventrolateral
   ventral (VLV) thalamic nucleus as the region of interest, extracted with
   automated segmentation from pretherapeutic diffusion magnetic resonance
   imaging. Temporal correlations of VLV at whole brain level were
   evaluated by comparing drug-naive patients with ET with HCs, and
   longitudinally, 1 year after stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy. 1
   year thalamotomy MR signature was always located inside VLV and did not
   correlate with any of FC measures (P > 0.05). This suggested presence of
   longitudinal changes in VLV FC independently of the MR signature volume.
   RESULTS: Pretherapeutic ET displayed altered VLV FC with left primary
   sensory-motor cortex, pedunculopontine nucleus, dorsal anterior
   cingulate, left visual association, and left superior parietal areas.
   Pretherapeutic negative FC with primary somatosensory cortex and
   pedunculopontine nucleus correlated with poorer baseline tremor scores
   (Spearman = 0.04 and 0.01). Longitudinal study displayed changes within
   right dorsal attention (frontal eye-fields and posterior parietal) and
   salience (anterior insula) networks, as well as areas involved in hand
   movement planning or language production.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that patients with ET and HCs
   differ in their left VLV FC to primary somatosensory and supplementary
   motor, visual association, or brainstem areas (pedunculopontine
   nucleus). Longitudinal changes display reorganization of dorsal
   attention and salience networks after thalamotomy. Beside attentional
   gateway, they are also known for their major role in facilitating a
   rapid access to the motor system.}},

Abstract = {{The experience of being in control of one's actions and thier outcomes
   is called the sense of agency. This is a fundamental feature of our
   human experience, and may underpin important social functions such as
   morality and responsibility. Sense of agency can be measured explicitly,
   by asking people to report their experience, or implicitly by recording
   the perceived time interval between actions and outcomes (intentional
   binding). The current studies used transcranial direct current
   stimulation to assess the role of left and right temporoparietal
   junction in both implicit and explicit sense of agency. Participants
   were informed that they could control the volume output of the computer
   with one of two buttons. Participants experienced reduced sense of
   agency when the outcome was inconsistent with their action. However,
   binding did not differ between congruent and incongruent
   action-outcomes. The modulation of explicit agency ratings by
   action-outcome congruency was significantly reduced by right TPJ
   stimulation (experiment 1) but not left TPJ stimulation (experiment 2).
   Implicit agency was not affected in either stimulation condition. These
   findings are discussed in terms of the possible neural mechanisms of
   implicit and explicit sense of agency.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{116-128}},

Abstract = {{Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a devastating disorder, linked
   to profound mental, physical, occupational, and functional impairment.
   In addition, it is a highly complex disorder, characterized by symptom
   heterogeneity across multiple domains. Nevertheless, emotion
   dysregulation arising from the exaggerated response to threat or from
   the inability to regulate negative emotional states plays a defining
   role in the pathophysiology of PTSD. In order to improve our
   understanding of how emotion dysregulation manifests in this illness,
   functional neuroimaging research over the past 20 years provides great
   insight into underlying neuroanatomy of each component of emotion
   dysregulation in the context of PTSD. While prior reviews exist on the
   topic of neuroimaging findings in PTSD, the present review synthesizes
   that work through the lens of emotion and its regulation. Studies that
   employed tasks of emotional responding and symptom provocation, implicit
   regulation (e.g., emotional Stroop and interference), explicit
   regulation (e.g., cognitive reappraisal), and fear
   conditioning/extinction were reviewed. Findings demonstrate that emotion
   dysregulation in PTSD arises from complications within a large
   neurocircuitry involving the amygdala, insula, hippocampus, anterior
   cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex. Although an exaggerated
   response in the amygdala and insula to negative emotional triggers is
   pervasive, PTSD is also marked by deficient appraisal, resolution, and
   management of negative emotional states subserved by the anterior
   cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex during regulation. These findings
   further support the importance of studying emotion-regulation deficits
   in tandem with exaggerated symptom provocation in order to better
   understand the constellation of symptoms present in those with PTSD.}},

Journal = {{ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLISM}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{201-208}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Aims: Social decision making has recently been evaluated in alcohol use
   disorder (AUD) using the ultimatum game (UG) task, suggesting a possible
   deficit in aversive emotion regulation elicited by the unfairness during
   this task. Despite the relevance to relapse of this possible faulty
   regulation, the brain correlates of the UG in AUD are unknown.
   Methods: In total, 23 AUD and 27 healthy controls (HC) played three
   consecutive fMRI runs of the UG, while behavioral and brain responses
   were recorded.
   Results: Overall, acceptance rate of unfair offers did not differ
   between groups, but there was a difference in the rate of behavioral
   change across runs. We found significant anterior insula (aINS)
   activation in both groups for both fair and unfair conditions, but only
   HC showed a trend towards increased activation during unfair vs. fair
   offers. There were not overall whole-brain between-group significant
   differences. We found a trend of signal attenuation, instead of an
   increase, in the aINS for AUD when compared to HC during the third run,
   which is consistent with our recent findings of selective insula atrophy
   in AUD.
   Conclusion: We found differential group temporal dynamics of behavioral
   response in the UG. The HC group had a low acceptance rate for unfair
   offers in the first two runs that increased markedly for the third run;
   whereas the AUD group was consistent in their rejection of unfair offers
   across the three runs. We found a strong significant decrease in neural
   response across runs for both groups.
   Short summary: This fMRI study of UG in alcohol use disorder found
   behavioral group differences in acceptance rate across runs, which
   together with significant BOLD-signal decrease across runs in UG-related
   regions in both groups, highlights the impairment of strategy in AUD and
   the effect of repetitive exposure to unfairness in this task.}},

Abstract = {{A number of brain regions have been implicated in articulation, but
   their precise computations remain debated. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we examine the degree of functional specificity of
   articulation-responsive brain regions to constrain hypotheses about
   their contributions to speech production. We find that
   articulation-responsive regions (1) are sensitive to articulatory
   complexity, but (2) are largely nonoverlapping with nearby
   domain-general regions that support diverse goal-directed behaviors.
   Furthermore, premotor articulation regions show selectivity for speech
   production over some related tasks (respiration control), but not others
   (nonspeech oral-motor {[}NSO] movements). This overlap between speech
   and nonspeech movements concords with electrocorticographic evidence
   that these regions encode articulators and their states, and with
   patient evidence whereby articulatory deficits are often accompanied by
   oral-motor deficits. In contrast, the superior temporal regions show
   strong selectivity for articulation relative to nonspeech movements,
   suggesting that these regions play a specific role in speech
   planning/production. Finally, articulation-responsive portions of
   posterior inferior frontal gyrus show some selectivity for articulation,
   in line with the hypothesis that this region prepares an articulatory
   code that is passed to the premotor cortex. Taken together, these
   results inform the architecture of the human articulation system.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to assess changes in
   the resting-state networks (RSNs) of patients with multiple sclerosis
   (MS) after a cognitive rehabilitation program (CRP), by retrospectively
   analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using the
   classical block design.
   METHODS: Fifteen patients with MS (2 primary progressive, 3
   relapsing-remitting, 10 secondary progressive) were scanned before and
   after the CRP on a 1.5T MRI scanner. In addition, patients underwent
   pre-and post-CRP neuropsychological assessment using a battery of
   standardized tests. Five healthy individuals were scanned at the same
   time points to confirm the test-retest reliability of the imaging
   technique. For each study, the individual fMRI blocks of rest were
   merged to produce a ``pseudo{''}resting-state (pseudo-RS) of 3 minutes
   duration. RS studies were analyzed with the MELODIC toolbox. A dual
   regression analysis was applied to estimate the longitudinal changes in
   RSNs of patients and test controls relative to a set of predefined RSNs
   used as templates.
   RESULTS: In healthy individuals, there were no significant differences
   in RSN results between the two time points studied. In the group of
   patients with MS, significant differences were found post-CRP in the
   visual medial, cerebellar, auditory, and frontal-executive RSNs.
   Furthermore, synchronization increases in the frontal-executive RSN were
   associated with cognitive improvement on neuropsychological testing.
   CONCLUSIONS: Results obtained using a pseudo-RS approach to analyze data
   from block-design fMRI studies suggest that a CRP of 5 weeks' duration
   induces measurable changes in specific RSNs of patients with MS.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: In this study, we aimed to explore how cues signaling rewards
   and feedbacks about rewards are processed in ADHD. Method: Inside the
   scanner, 16 healthy children and 19 children with ADHD completed a
   spatial attention paradigm where cues informed about the availability of
   reward and feedbacks were provided about the earned reward. Results: In
   ventral anterior thalamus (VA), the controls exhibited greater
   activation in response to reward-predicting cues, as compared with
   no-reward cues, whereby in the ADHD group, the reverse pattern was
   observed (nonreward > reward). For feedbacks; absence of rewards
   produced greater activation than presence in the left caudate and
   frontal eye field for the control group, whereas for the ADHD group, the
   reverse pattern was again observed (reward > nonreward). Discussion: The
   present findings indicate that ADHD is associated with difficulty
   integrating reward contingency information with the orienting and

Abstract = {{Structural and functional changes in the lateral temporal language areas
   have been related to formal thought disorder (FTD) in schizophrenia.
   Continuous, natural speech production activates the right lateral
   temporal lobe in schizophrenia, as opposed to the left in healthy
   subjects. Positive and negative FTD can be elicited in healthy subjects
   by glutamatergic NMDA blockade with ketamine. It is unclear whether the
   glutamate system is related to the reversed hemispheric lateralization
   during speaking in patents. In a double-blind, crossover,
   placebo-controlled study, 15 healthy, male, right-handed volunteers
   overtly described 7 pictures for 3 min each while BOLD signal changes
   were acquired with fMRI. As a measure of linguistic demand, the number
   of words within 20 s epochs was correlated with BOLD responses.
   Participants developed S-ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms,
   particularly positive FTD. Ketamine vs placebo was associated with
   enhanced neural responses in the right middle and inferior temporal
   gyri. Similar to a previous fMRI study in schizophrenia patients vs
   healthy controls applying the same design, S-ketamine reversed
   functional lateralization during speech production in healthy subjects.
   Results demonstrate an association between glutamatergic imbalance,
   dysactivations in lateral temporal brain areas, and FTD symptom
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{Difficulties in emotion regulation are commonly reported among
   individuals with alcohol and drug addictions and contribute to the
   acquisition and maintenance of addictive behaviors. Alterations in
   neural processing of negative affective stimuli have further been
   demonstrated among individuals with addictions. However, it is unclear
   whether these alterations are a general feature of addictions or are a
   result of prolonged exposure to drugs of abuse. To test the hypothesis
   of altered negative affect processing independent of drug effects, this
   study assessed neural function among drug-naive youth with a behavioral
   addiction-Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Fifty-six young adults (28
   with IGD, 28 matched controls) participated in fMRI scanning during
   performance of a weal-validated emotion regulation task. Between-group
   differences In neural activity during task performance were assessed
   using a whole-brain, mixed-effects ANOVA with correction for multiple
   comparisons at currently recommended thresholds (voxel-level p <0.001,
   pFWE <0.05). Compared to controls, youth with IGD exhibited
   significantly blunted neural responses within distributed subcortical
   and cortical regions including the striatum, insula, lateral prefrontal
   cortex and anterior cingulate in response to negative affective cues, as
   well as during emotion regulation. Independent component analysis (ICA)
   further identified between-group differences in engagement of a
   fronto-cingulo-parietal network, involving decreased engagement in IGD
   youth relative to controls. Study findings are largely consistent with
   those from prior neuroimaging studies in substance-use disorders, thus
   raising the possibility that neural processing of negative affect may be
   blunted across drug and behavioral addictions independent of acute or
   chronic drug effects.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveEssential tremor (ET) represents the most common movement
   disorder. Drug-resistant ET can benefit from standard stereotactic
   procedures (deep brain stimulation or radiofrequency thalamotomy) or
   alternatively minimally invasive high-focused ultrasound or
   radiosurgery. All aim at same target, thalamic ventro-intermediate
   nucleus (Vim).
   MethodsThe study included a cohort of 17 consecutive patients, with ET,
   treated only with left unilateral stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy
   (SRS-T) between September 2014 and August 2015. The mean time to tremor
   improvement was 3.32months (SD 2.7, 0.5-10). Neuroimaging data were
   collected at baseline (n=17). Standard tremor scores, including
   activities of daily living (ADL) and tremor score on treated hand
   (TSTH), were completed pretherapeutically and 1year later. We further
   correlate these scores with baseline inter-connectivity in twenty major
   large-scale brain networks.
   ResultsWe report as predictive three networks, with the interconnected
   statistically significant clusters: primary motor cortex interconnected
   with inferior olivary nucleus, bilateral thalamus interconnected with
   motor cerebellum lobule V-2 (ADL), and anterior default-mode network
   interconnected with Brodmann area 10(3) (TSTH). For all, more positive
   pretherapeutic interconnectivity correlated with higher drop in points
   on the respective scores. Age, disease duration, or time-to-response
   after SRS-T were not statistically correlated with pretherapeutic brain
   connectivity measures (P>.05). The same applied to pretherapeutic tremor
   scores, after using the same methodology described above.
   ConclusionsOur findings have clinical implications for predicting
   clinical response after SRS-T. Here, using pretherapeutic magnetic
   resonance imaging and data processing without prior hypothesis, we show
   that pretherapeutic network(s) interconnectivity strength predicts
   tremor arrest in drug-naive ET, following stereotactic radiosurgical
   thalamotomy.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a unique developmental period when the salience of social
   and emotional information becomes particularly pronounced. Although this
   increased sensitivity to social and emotional information has frequently
   been considered with respect to risk behaviors and psychopathology,
   evidence suggests that increased adolescent sensitivity to social and
   emotional cues may confer advantages. For example, greater sensitivity
   to shifts in the emotions of others is likely to promote flexible and
   adaptive social behavior. In this study, a sample of 54 children and
   adolescents (age 8-19 years) performed a delayed match-to-sample task
   for emotional faces while undergoing fMRI scanning. Recruitment of the
   anterior cingulate and anterior insula when the emotion of the probe
   face did not match the emotion held in memory followed a quadratic
   developmental pattern that peaked during early adolescence. These
   findings indicate meaningful developmental variation in the neural
   mechanisms underlying sensitivity to changes in the emotional
   expressions. Across all participants, greater activation of this network
   for changes in emotional expression was associated with less social
   anxiety and fewer social problems. These results suggest that the
   heightened salience of social and emotional information during
   adolescence may confer important advantages for social behavior,
   providing sensitivity to others' emotions that facilitates flexible
   social responding.}},

Title = {{Let's chat: developmental neural bases of social motivation during
   real-time peer interaction}},
Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Humans are motivated to interact with each other, but the neural bases
   of social motivation have been predominantly examined in non-interactive
   contexts. Understanding real-world social motivation is of special
   importance during middle childhood (ages 8-12), a period when social
   skills improve, social networks grow, and social brain networks
   specialize. To assess interactive social motivation, the current study
   used a novel fMRI paradigm in which children believed they were chatting
   with a peer. The design targeted two phases of interaction: (1)
   Initiation, in which children engaged in a social bid via sharing a like
   or hobby, and (2) Reply, in which children received either an engaged
   (Me too) or non-engaged (I'm away) reply from the peer. On control
   trials, children were told that their answers were not shared and that
   they would receive either engaged (Matched) or non-engaged
   (Disconnected) replies from the computer. Results indicated that during
   Initiation and Reply, key components of reward circuitry (e.g., ventral
   striatum) were more active for the peer than the computer trials. In
   addition, during Reply, social cognitive regions were more activated by
   the peer, and this social cognitive specialization increased with age.
   Finally, the effect of engagement type on reward circuitry activation
   was larger for social than non-social trials, indicating developmental
   sensitivity to social contingency. These findings demonstrate that both
   reward and social cognitive brain systems support real-time social
   interaction in middle childhood. An interactive approach to
   understanding social reward has implications for clinical disorders,
   where social motivation is more affected in real-world contexts.}},

Abstract = {{A central feature of major depression (MDD) is heightened negative
   self-focused thought (negative-SFT). Neuroscientific research has
   identified abnormalities in a network of brain regions in MDD, including
   brain areas associated with SFT such as medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
   and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). To our knowledge no studies have
   investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of negative-SFT using
   a sentence completion task in a sample of individuals with varying
   depression histories and severities. We test the following hypotheses:
   (1) negative-SFT will be associated with depression; and (2) depression
   and negative-SFT will be related to resting-state functional
   connectivity (rsFC) for brain regions implicated in SFT. Seventy-nine
   women with varying depression histories and severities completed a
   sentence completion task and underwent resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Standard seed-based voxelwise rsFC was
   conducted for self-network regions of interest: dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC)
   and pregenual ACC (pgACC). We performed linear regression analyses to
   examine the relationships among depression, negative-SFT, and rsFC for
   the dmPFC and pgACC. Greater negative-SFT was associated with depression
   history and severity. Greater negative-SFT predicted increased rsFC
   between dmPFC and pgACC seeds and dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) and
   parietal regions; depression group was also associated with increased
   pgACC-dlPFC connectivity. These findings are consistent with previous
   literature reporting elevated negative-SFT thought in MDD. Our rs-fMRI
   results provide novel support linking negative-SFT with increased rsFC
   between self-network and frontoparietal network regions across different
   levels of depression. Broadly, these findings highlight a dimension of
   social-affective functioning that may underlie MDD and other psychiatric
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical models have implicated amygdala dysfunction in the
   development of Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBDs; Conduct
   Disorder/Oppositional Defiant Disorder). Amygdala dysfunction impacts
   valence evaluation/response selection and emotion attention in youth
   with DBDs, particularly in those with elevated callous-unemotional (CU)
   traits. However, amygdala responsiveness during social cognition and the
   responsiveness of the acute threat circuitry (amygdala/periaqueductal
   gray) in youth with DBDs have been less well-examined, particularly with
   reference to CU traits. 31 youth with DBDs and 27 typically developing
   youth (IQ, age and gender-matched) completed a threat paradigm during
   fMRI where animate and inanimate, threatening and neutral stimuli
   appeared to loom towards or recede from participants. Reduced
   responsiveness to threat variables, including visual threats and
   encroaching stimuli, was observed within acute threat circuitry and
   temporal, lateral frontal and parietal cortices in youth with DBDs. This
   reduced responsiveness, at least with respect to the looming variable,
   was modulated by CU traits. Reduced responsiveness to animacy
   information was also observed within temporal, lateral frontal and
   parietal cortices, but not within amygdala. Reduced responsiveness to
   animacy information as a function of CU traits was observed in PCC,
   though not within the amygdala. Reduced threat responsiveness may
   contribute to risk taking and impulsivity in youth with DBDs,
   particularly those with high levels of CU traits. Future work will need
   to examine the degree to which this reduced response to animacy is
   independent of amygdala dysfunction in youth with DBDs and what role PCC
   might play in the dysfunctional social cognition observed in youth with
   high levels of CU traits.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Altered amygdala activation to fear-related stimuli has been
   proposed to be a potential neural correlate of heightened threat
   sensitivity in anxiety-and stress-related disorders. However, the role
   of stimulus awareness and disorder specificity remains widely unclear.
   Here we investigated amygdala responses to conscious and unconscious
   fearful faces in patients suffering from panic disorder (PD),
   generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or post-traumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD) and in a large sample of healthy controls (HC).
   Methods. During event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
   participants (n = 120; 20 PD, 20 GAD, 20 PTSD, 60 HC) were confronted
   with briefly presented fearful faces, neutral faces, and non-faces in a
   backward masking paradigm. The design allowed for the analysis of
   trial-by-trial face detection performance and amygdala responses to
   fearful v. neutral faces.
   Results. All participants exhibited increased amygdala activation to
   fearful v. neutral faces during conscious trials. Specifically during
   unconscious face processing, the PTSD, compared with all other groups,
   showed higher right basolateral (BLA) amygdala activity to fearful v.
   neutral faces.
   Conclusions. The present study shows that BLA amygdala hyperactivity
   during unconscious, but not conscious, processing of fearful faces
   differentiates PTSD from the investigated disorders. This finding
   suggests an automatic and specific neural hyper-responsivity to general
   fear cues in PTSD and supports the idea of categorical differences
   between PTSD and other anxiety-related disorders.}},

Abstract = {{To assess structural and functional changes of the amygdala due to
   premenstrual syndrome (PMS) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Twenty PMS patients and 21 healthy control (HC) subjects underwent a
   6-min resting-state fMRI scan during the luteal phase as well as
   scanning high-resolution T1-weighted images. Subcortical
   amygdala-related volume and functional connectivity (FC) were estimated
   between the two groups. Each subject completed a daily record of
   severity of problems (DRSP) to measure the severity of clinical
   symptoms.
   Greater bilateral amygdalae volumes were found in PMS patients compared
   with HC subjects, and PMS patients had increased FC between the amygdala
   and certain regions of the frontal cortex (e.g. medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right precentral gyrus), the
   right temporal pole and the insula, as well as decreased FC between the
   bilateral amygdalae and the right orbitofrontal cortex and right
   hippocampus. The strength of FC between the right amygdala and right
   precentral gyrus, left ACC and left mPFC were significantly and
   positively correlated with DRSP scores in PMS patients.
   Our findings may improve our understanding of the neural mechanisms
   involved in PMS.

Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{7-17}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is essential for successful social interactions and
   relationships. The neural underpinnings of empathy have predominantly
   been studied in the young adult population, thus little is known about
   how they evolve across the life span. In the present study, we used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate age-related
   differences in brain activity associated to empathy for positive and
   negative emotions. Female participants of 3 age groups-adolescents,
   young, and older adults-underwent an experimental paradigm inducing both
   first-hand and empathic experience of pleasant and unpleasant touch.
   Group comparisons and regression analyses revealed that older adults
   showed lower activation within the anterior insula with respect to young
   adults, during both empathy conditions. Further analyses provided
   evidence that years of education, theory of mind ability, gray matter
   volume, and first-hand affect processing did not account for these
   effects. These findings indicate that the neural bases of empathy change
   across different age groups, from adolescence to old age. Different ages
   and in particular older age seem to significantly influence the way in
   which we represent and share others' positive and negative emotions. (C)

Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{15-25}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Acute stress has a profound influence on learning, as has been
   demonstrated in verbal learning or fear conditioning. However, its
   effect on appetitive conditioning is still unclear. Fear conditioning
   research suggests the possibility of overgeneralization of conditioning
   to the CS-under acute stress due to its effect on prefrontal and
   hippocampal processing.
   In this study, participants (N = 56 males) were subjected to the Trier
   Social Stress Test or a placebo version. After that, all participants
   underwent an appetitive conditioning paradigm in the fMRI, in which one
   neutral cue (CS+) was repeatedly paired with reward, while another (CS-)
   was not. Importantly, the stress-group revealed over-generalization of
   conditioning to the CS-on the behavioral level. On the neural level,
   stressed participants showed increased connectivity between the
   hippocampus and amygdala, vACC, and OFC, which maintain specificity of
   conditioning and also showed reduced differential activation. The
   results indicate overgeneralization of appetitive conditioning promoted
   by maladaptive balancing of pattern separation and pattern completion in
   the hippocampus under acute stress and are discussed with respect to
   clinical implications.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Joint decision-making entails that you sometimes have to go along with
   the other's choice even though you disagree. In this situation, a
   resulting negative outcome may, however, elicit a feeling of
   satisfaction and an impulse to say ``I told you so{''}. Using fMRI, we
   investigated the neural correlates of this complex process comprised of
   both positive and negative outcomes. During a social visual search task,
   19 participants gave their advice to a co-actor who then made the
   decision resulting in a mutual loss or gain. This design allowed direct
   comparisons of situations that resulted in the same monetary outcome but
   that differed with respect to the correctness of the initial advice of
   the participant. Increased striatal activations were found for gains
   compared to losses and for correct compared to incorrect advice.
   Importantly, ROI analyses also showed enhanced striatum activation for
   monetary losses that were preceded by correct compared to incorrect
   advices. The current study therefore suggests that reward-related neural
   mechanisms may be involved when being right even in situations that end
   in monetary losses.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{In human occipitotemporal cortex, category-specific processing for
   visual objects seems to involve pairs of cortical regions, often with
   one located in the occipital cortex and another more anteriorly. We
   investigated whether such an arrangement might be the case for visual
   word processing. In addition to the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) located
   in the occipitotemporal sulcus, we observed that another region in
   occipital lobe with robust responses to written words (Chinese
   characters). The current fMRI study investigated this area's precise
   location and its functional selectivity using Chinese characters and
   other categories of visual images (cars, chairs and insects). In all the
   13 subjects we could identify a cluster of voxels near the inferior
   occipital gyrus or middle occipital gyrus with stronger responses to
   Chinese characters than scrambled objects. We tentatively label this
   area as the Occipital Word Form Sensitive Area (OWA). The OWA's response
   amplitudes showed similar preference to written words as the VWFA, with
   the VWFA showing a higher degree of word selectivity, which was
   confirmed by the result from spatial patterns of response. These results
   indicate that the OWA, together with the VWFA, are critical parts of the
   network for processing and representing the category information for
   word.}},

Title = {{Individualized Functional Parcellation of the Human Amygdala Using a
   Semi-supervised Clustering Method: A 7T Resting State fMRI Study}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala plays an important role in emotional functions and its
   dysfunction is considered to be associated with multiple psychiatric
   disorders in humans. Cytoarchitectonic mapping has demonstrated that the
   human amygdala complex comprises several subregions. However, it's
   difficult to delineate boundaries of these subregions in vivo even if
   using state of the art high resolution structural MRI. Previous attempts
   to parcellate this small structure using unsupervised clustering methods
   based on resting state fMRI data suffered from the low spatial
   resolution of typical fMRI data, and it remains challenging for the
   unsupervised methods to define subregions of the amygdala in vivo. In
   this study, we developed a novel brain parcellation method to segment
   the human amygdala into spatially contiguous subregions based on 7T high
   resolution fMRI data. The parcellation was implemented using a
   semi-supervised spectral clustering (SSC) algorithm at an individual
   subject level. Under guidance of prior information derived from the
   Julich cytoarchitectonic atlas, our method clustered voxels of the
   amygdala into subregions according to similarity measures of their
   functional signals. As a result, three distinct amygdala subregions can
   be obtained in each hemisphere for every individual subject. Compared
   with the cytoarchitectonic atlas, our method achieved better performance
   in terms of subregional functional homogeneity. Validation experiments
   have also demonstrated that the amygdala subregions obtained by
   ourmethod have distinctive, lateralized functional connectivity (FC)
   patterns. Our study has demonstrated that the semi-supervised brain
   parcellation method is a powerful tool for exploring amygdala
   subregional functions.}},

Title = {{Altered Amygdala Resting-State Functional Connectivity and Hemispheric
   Asymmetry in Patients With Social Anxiety Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: The amygdala plays a key role in emotional hyperreactivity
   in response to social threat in patients with social anxiety disorder
   (SAD). We investigated resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FCN) of
   the left and right amygdala with various brain regions and functional
   lateralization in patients with SAD.
   Methods: A total of 36 patients with SAD and 42 matched healthy controls
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at rest. Using
   the left and right amygdala as seed regions, we compared the strength of
   the rs-FCN in the patient and control groups. Furthermore, we
   investigated group differences in the hemispheric asymmetry of the
   functional connectivity maps of the left and right amygdala.
   Results: Compared with healthy controls, the rs-FCN between the left
   amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was reduced in patients
   with SAD, whereas left amygdala connectivity with the fusiform gyrus,
   anterior insula, supramarginal gyrus, and precuneus was increased or
   positively deflected in the patient group. Additionally, the strength
   rs-FCN between the left amygdala and anterior insula was positively
   associated with the severity of the fear of negative evaluation in
   patients with SAD (r = 0.338, p = 0.044). The rs-FCN between the right
   amygdala and medial frontal gyrus was decreased in patients with SAD
   compared with healthy controls, whereas connectivity with the
   parahippocampal gyrus was greater in the patient group than in the
   control group. The hemispheric asymmetry patterns in the anterior
   insula, intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and inferior frontal gyrus of the
   patient group were opposite those of the control group, and functional
   lateralization of the connectivity between the amygdala and the IPS was
   associated with the severity of social anxiety symptoms (r = 0.365, p =
   0.037).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that in addition to impaired
   fronto-amygdala communication, the functional lateralization of amygdala
   function plays a central role in the pathophysiology of SAD.}},

Abstract = {{Why do certain group members end up liking each other more than others?
   How does affective reciprocity arise in human groups? The prediction of
   interpersonal sentiment has been a long-standing pursuit in the social
   sciences. We combined fMRI and longitudinal social network data to test
   whether newly acquainted group members' reward-related neural responses
   to images of one another's faces predict their future interpersonal
   sentiment, even many months later. Specifically, we analyze associations
   between relationship-specific valuation activity and
   relationship-specific future liking. We found that one's own future (T2)
   liking of a particular group member is predicted jointly by actor's
   initial (T1) neural valuation of partner and by that partner's initial
   (T1) neural valuation of actor. These actor and partner effects
   exhibited equivalent predictive strength and were robust when
   statistically controlling for each other, both individuals' initial
   liking, and other potential drivers of liking. Behavioral findings
   indicated that liking was initially unreciprocated at T1 yet became
   strongly reciprocated by T2. The emergence of affective reciprocity was
   partly explained by the reciprocal pathways linking dyad members' T1
   neural data both to their own and to each other's T2 liking outcomes.
   These findings elucidate interpersonal brain mechanisms that define how
   we ultimately end up liking particular interaction partners, how group
   members' initially idiosyncratic sentiments become reciprocated, and
   more broadly, how dyads evolve. This study advances a flexible framework
   for researching the neural foundations of interpersonal sentiments and
   social relations that-conceptually, methodologically, and
   statistically-emphasizes group members' neural interdependence.}},

Title = {{A Multitude of Neural Representations Behind Multisensory ``Social
   Norm{''} Processing}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{Humans show a unique capacity to process complex information from
   multiple sources. Social perception in natural environment provides a
   good example of such capacity as it typically requires the integration
   of information from different sensory systems, and also from different
   levels of sensory processing. Here, instead of studying one isolate
   system and level of representation, we focused upon a neuroimaging
   paradigm which allows to capture multiple brain representations
   simultaneously, i.e., low and high-level processing in two different
   sensory systems, as well as abstract cognitive processing of congruency.
   Subjects performed social decisions based on the congruency between
   auditory and visual processing. Using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA)
   of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, we probed a wide
   variety of representations. Our results confirmed the expected
   representations at each level and system according to the literature.
   Further, beyond the hierarchical organization of the visual, auditory
   and higher order neural systems, we provide a more nuanced picture of
   the brain functional architecture. Indeed, brain regions of the same
   neural system show similarity in their representations, but they also
   share information with regions from other systems. Further, the strength
   of neural information varied considerably across domains in a way that
   was not obviously related to task relevance. For instance, selectivity
   for task-irrelevant animacy of visual input was very strong. The present
   approach represents a new way to explore the richness of co-activated
   brain representations underlying the natural complexity in human
   cognition.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{The human neural correlates of social rejection have attracted
   significant research interest, but remain subject to vigorous debate.
   Specifically, it has been proposed that a matrix of brain regions
   overlapping with the classical pain matrix, and including the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the anterior insular cortex (AI) is
   critical for processing of social rejection. The present study expands
   on this conceptualization, by showing that these areas are involved in
   processing of self-relevant social evaluation, irrespective of valence.
   Forty healthy adolescents (N = 20 females) were tested in a magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. We used a novel paradigm that balanced
   participants' experience of rejection and acceptance. In addition, the
   paradigm also controlled for whether the social judgment was towards the
   participants or towards other fictitious players. By creating a
   ``self{''} and ``other{''} distinction, we show that right AI and dACC
   are involved in processing the salience of being judged by others,
   irrespective of the quality of this judgment. This finding supports the
   idea that these regions are not specific to social rejection or even to
   pain or metaphorically painful experiences, but activate to
   self-relevant, highly salient information.}},

Title = {{Potential Reporting Bias in Neuroimaging Studies of Sex Differences}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Numerous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have
   reported sex differences. To empirically evaluate for evidence of
   excessive significance bias in this literature, we searched for
   published fMRI studies of human brain to evaluate sex differences,
   regardless of the topic investigated, in Medline and Scopus over 10
   years. We analyzed the prevalence of conclusions in favor of sex
   differences and the correlation between study sample sizes and number of
   significant foci identified. In the absence of bias, larger studies
   (better powered) should identify a larger number of significant foci.
   Across 179 papers, median sample size was n = 32 (interquartile range
   23-47.5). A median of 5 foci related to sex differences were reported
   (interquartile range, 2-9.5). Few articles (n = 2) had titles focused on
   no differences or on similarities (n = 3) between sexes. Overall, 158
   papers (88\%) reached ``positive{''} conclusions in their abstract and
   presented some foci related to sex differences. There was no
   statistically significant relationship between sample size and the
   number of foci (-0.048\% increase for every 10 participants, p = 0.63).

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental
   disorder which affects the developmental trajectory in several
   behavioral domains, including impairments of social communication,
   cognitive and language abilities. Transcranial direct current
   stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, and it
   was used for modulating the brain disorders. In this paper, we enrolled
   13 ASD children (11 males and 2 females; mean +/- SD age: 6.5 +/- 1.7
   years) to participate in our trial. Each patient received 10 treatments
   over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) once every 2 days. Also,
   we enrolled 13 ASD children (11 males and 2 females; mean +/- SD age:
   6.3 +/- 1.7 years) waiting to receive therapy as controls. A maximum
   entropy ratio (MER) method was adapted to measure the change of
   complexity of EEG series. It was found that the MER value significantly
   increased after tDCS. This study suggests that tDCS may be a helpful
   tool for the rehabilitation of children with ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been associated with abnormal
   synaptic development causing a breakdown in functional connectivity.
   However, when measured at the macro scale using resting state fMRI,
   these alterations are subtle and often difficult to detect due to the
   large heterogeneity of the pathology. Recently, we outlined a novel
   approach for generating robust biomarkers of resting state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) using connectivity based
   parcellation of gross morphological structures to improve single-subject
   reproducibility and generate more robust connectivity fingerprints. Here
   we apply this novel approach to investigating the organization and
   connectivity strength of the cortico-striatal system in a large sample
   of ASD individuals and typically developed (TD) controls (N=130 per
   group). Our results showed differences in the parcellation of the
   striatum in ASD. Specifically, the putamen was found to be one single
   structure in ASD, whereas this was split into anterior and posterior
   segments in an age, IQ, and head movement matched TD group. An analysis
   of the connectivity fingerprints revealed that the group differences in
   clustering were driven by differential connectivity between striatum and
   the supplementary motor area, posterior cingulate cortex, and posterior
   insula. Our approach for analysing RS-fMRI in clinical populations has
   provided clear evidence that cortico-striatal circuits are organized
   differently in ASD. Based on previous task-based segmentations of the
   striatum, we believe that the anterior putamen cluster present in TD,
   but not in ASD, likely contributes to social and language processes.}},

Title = {{Hostile Attribution Bias Mediates the Relationship Between Structural
   Variations in the Left Middle Frontal Gyrus and Trait Angry Rumination}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Angry rumination is a common mental phenomenon which may lead to
   negative social behaviors such as aggression. Although numerous
   neuroimaging studies have focused on brain area activation during angry
   rumination, to our knowledge no study has examined the neuroanatomical
   and cognitive mechanisms of this process. In this study, we conducted a
   voxel-based morphometry analysis, using a region of interest analysis to
   identify the structural and cognitive mechanisms underlying individual
   differences in trait angry rumination (as measured by the Angry
   Rumination Scale) in a sample of 82 undergraduate students. We found
   that angry rumination was positively correlated with gray matter density
   in the left middle frontal gyrus (left-MFG), which is implicated in
   inhibition control, working memory, and emotional regulation. The
   mediation analysis further revealed that hostile attribution bias (as
   measured by the Social Information Processing-Attribution Bias
   Questionnaire) acted as a cognitive mechanism underlying the positive
   association between the left-MFG gray matter density and trait angry
   rumination. These findings suggest that hostile attribution bias may
   contribute to trait angry rumination, while the left-MFG may play an
   important role in the development of hostile attribution bias and trait
   angry rumination. The study reveals the brain mechanisms of trait angry
   rumination and plays a role in revealing the cognitive mechanisms of the
   development of trait angry rumination.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of interference resolution in the multi-source
   interference task: a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Interference resolution refers to cognitive control
   processes enabling one to focus on task-related information while
   filtering out unrelated information. But the exact neural areas, which
   underlie a specific cognitive task on interference resolution, are still
   equivocal. The multi-source interference task (MSIT), as a particular
   cognitive task, is a well-established experimental paradigm used to
   evaluate interference resolution. Studies combining the MSIT with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that the MSIT
   evokes the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and
   cingulate-frontal-parietal cognitive-attentional networks. However,
   these brain areas have not been evaluated quantitatively and these
   findings have not been replicated.
   Methods: In the current study, we firstly report a voxel-based
   meta-analysis of functional brain activation associated with the MSIT so
   as to identify the localization of interference resolution in such a
   specific cognitive task. Articles on MSIT-related fMRI published between
   2003 and July 2017 were eligible. The electronic databases searched
   included PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar. Differential BOLD
   activation patterns between the incongruent and congruent condition were
   meta-analyzed in anisotropic effect-size signed differential mapping
   software.
   Results: Robustness meta-analysis indicated that two significant
   activation clusters were shown to have reliable functional activity in
   comparisons between incongruent and congruent conditions. The first
   reliable activation cluster, which included the dACC, medial prefrontal
   cortex, supplementary motor area, replicated the previous MSIT-related
   fMRI study results. Furthermore, we found another reliable activation
   cluster comprising areas of the right insula, right inferior frontal
   gyrus, and right lenticular nucleus-putamen, which were not typically
   discussed in previous MSIT-related fMRI studies.
   Conclusions: The current meta-analysis study presents the reliable brain
   activation patterns on MSIT. These findings suggest that the
   cingulate-frontal-striatum network and right insula may allow control
   demands to resolve interference on MSIT. These results provide new
   insights into the neural mechanisms underlying interference resolution.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Social impairments are described as a common feature of the
   22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). However, the neural correlates
   underlying these impairments are largely unknown in this population. In
   this study, we investigated neural substrates of socio-emotional
   perception.
   Methods: We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to explore neural activity in individuals with 22q11DS and
   healthy controls during the visualization of stimuli varying in social
   (social or non-social) or emotional (positive or negative valence)
   content.
   Results: Neural hyporesponsiveness in regions of the default mode
   network (inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, posterior and anterior
   cingulate cortex and frontal regions) in response to social versus
   non-social images was found in the 22q11DS population compared to
   controls. A similar pattern of activation for positive and negative
   emotional processing was observed in the two groups. No correlation
   between neural activation and social functioning was observed in
   patients with the 22q11DS. Finally, no social x valence interaction
   impairment was found in patients.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate atypical neural correlates of social
   perception in 22q11DS that appear to be independent of valence
   processing. Abnormalities in the social perception network may lead to
   social impairments observed in 22q11DS individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Brain phenotypes showing environmental influence may help clarify
   unexplained associations between urban exposure and psychiatric risk.
   Heritable prefrontal fMRI activation during working memory (WM) is such

   urbanicity) would alter this phenotype and interact with dopamine genes
   that regulate prefrontal function during WM. Further, dopamine has been
   hypothesized to mediate urban-associated factors like social stress.
   WM-related prefrontal function was tested for main effects of
   urbanicity, main effects of three dopamine genes
   catechol-O-methyltransferase (COM7), dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), and
   dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2)-and, importantly, dopamine
   gene-by-urbanicity interactions. For COMT, three independent human
   samples were recruited (total n = 487). We also studied 253 subjects
   genotyped for DRD1 and DRD2. 3T fMRI activation during the N-back WM
   task was the dependent variable, while childhood urbanicity, dopamine
   genotype, and urbanicity-dopamine interactions were independent
   variables. Main effects of dopamine genes and of urbanicity were found.
   Individuals raised in an urban environment showed altered prefrontal
   activation relative to those raised in rural or town settings. For each
   gene, dopamine genotype-by-urbanicity interactions were shown in
   prefrontal cortex COMTreplicated twice in two independent samples. An
   urban childhood upbringing altered prefrontal function and interacted
   with each gene to alter genotype-phenotype relationships.
   Gene-environment interactions between multiple dopamine genes and urban
   upbringing suggest that neural effects of developmental environmental
   exposure could mediate, at least partially, increased risk for
   psychiatric illness in urban environments via dopamine genes expressed
   into adulthood.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{The social cognitive basis of music processing has long been noted, and
   recent research has shown that trait empathy is linked to musical
   preferences and listening style. Does empathy modulate neural responses
   to musical sounds? We designed two functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) experiments to address this question. In Experiment 1, subjects
   listened to brief isolated musical timbres while being scanned. In
   Experiment 2, subjects listened to excerpts of music in four conditions
   (familiar liked (FL)/disliked and unfamiliar liked (UL)/disliked). For
   both types of musical stimuli, emotional and cognitive forms of trait
   empathy modulated activity in sensorimotor and cognitive areas: in the
   first experiment, empathy was primarily correlated with activity in
   supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and insula;
   in Experiment 2, empathy was mainly correlated with activity in
   prefrontal, temporo-parietal and reward areas. Taken together, these
   findings reveal the interactions between bottom-up and top-down
   mechanisms of empathy in response to musical sounds, in line with recent
   findings from other cognitive domains.}},

Title = {{Right Hemisphere Regions Critical for Expression of Emotion Through
   Prosody}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 6}},
Abstract = {{Impaired expression of emotion through pitch, loudness, rate, and rhythm
   of speech (affective prosody) is common and disabling after right
   hemisphere (RH) stroke. These deficits impede all social interactions.
   Previous studies have identified cortical areas associated with
   impairments of expression, recognition, or repetition of affective
   prosody, but have not identified critical white matter tracts. We
   hypothesized that: (1) differences across patients in specific acoustic
   features correlate with listener judgment of affective prosody and (2)
   these differences are associated with infarcts of specific RH gray and
   white matter regions. To test these hypotheses, 41 acute ischemic RH
   stroke patients had MRI diffusion weighted imaging and described a
   picture. Affective prosody of picture descriptions was rated by 21
   healthy volunteers. We identified percent damage (lesion load) to each
   of seven regions of interest previously associated with expression of
   affective prosody and two control areas that have been associated with
   recognition but not expression of prosody. We identified acoustic
   features that correlated with listener ratings of prosody (hereafter
   ``prosody acoustic measures{''}) with Spearman correlations and linear
   regression. We then identified demographic variables and brain regions
   where lesion load independently predicted the lowest quartile of each of
   the ``prosody acoustic measures{''} using logistic regression. We found
   that listener ratings of prosody positively correlated with four
   acoustic measures. Furthermore, the lowest quartile of each of these
   four ``prosody acoustic measures{''} was predicted by sex, age, lesion
   volume, and percent damage to the seven regions of interest. Lesion load
   in pars opercularis, supramarginal gyrus, or associated white matter
   tracts (and not control regions) predicted lowest quartile of the four
   ``prosody acoustic measures{''} in logistic regression. Results indicate
   that listener perception of reduced affective prosody after RH stroke is
   due to reduction in specific acoustic features caused by infarct in
   right pars opercularis or supramarginal gyrus, or associated white
   matter tracts.}},

Title = {{Anger Modulates Influence Hierarchies Within and Between Emotional
   Reactivity and Regulation Networks}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{Emotion regulation is hypothesized to be mediated by the interactions
   between emotional reactivity and regulation networks during the dynamic
   unfolding of the emotional episode. Yet, it remains unclear how to
   delineate the effective relationships between these networks. In this
   study, we examined the aforementioned networks' information flow
   hierarchy during viewing of an anger provoking movie excerpt. Anger
   regulation is particularly essential for averting individuals from
   aggression and violence, thus improving prosocial behavior. Using
   subjective ratings of anger intensity we differentiated between low and
   high anger periods of the film. We then applied the Dependency Network
   Analysis (DEPNA), a newly developed graph theory method to quantify
   networks' node importance during the two anger periods. The DEPNA
   analysis revealed that the impact of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC) was higher in the high anger condition, particularly within the
   regulation network and on the connections between the reactivity and
   regulation networks. We further showed that higher levels of vmPFC
   impact on the regulation network were associated with lower subjective
   anger intensity during the high-anger cinematic period, and lower trait
   anger levels. Supporting and replicating previous findings, these
   results emphasize the previously acknowledged central role of vmPFC in
   modulating negative affect. We further show that the impact of the vmPFC
   relies on its correlational influence on the connectivity between
   reactivity and regulation networks. More importantly, the hierarchy
   network analysis revealed a link between connectivity patterns of the
   vmPFC and individual differences in anger reactivity and trait,
   suggesting its potential therapeutic role.}},

Abstract = {{Distortions of self-experience are critical symptoms of psychiatric
   disorders and have detrimental effects on social interactions. In light
   of the immense need for improved and targeted interventions for social
   impairments, it is important to better understand the neurochemical
   substrates of social interaction abilities. We therefore investigated
   the pharmacological and neural correlates of self-and other-initiated
   social interaction. In a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced,
   crossover study 24 healthy human participants (18 males and 6 females)
   received either (1) placebo + placebo, (2) placebo + lysergic acid
   diethylamide (LSD; 100 mu g, p.o.), or (3) ketanserin (40 mg, p.o.) +
   LSD (100 mu g, p.o.) on three different occasions. Participants took
   part in an interactive task using eye-tracking and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging completing trials of self-and other-initiated joint
   and non-joint attention. Results demonstrate first, that LSD reduced
   activity in brain areas important for self-processing, but also social
   cognition; second, that change in brain activity was linked to
   subjective experience; and third, that LSD decreased the efficiency of
   establishing joint attention. Furthermore, LSD-induced effects were
   blocked by the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) antagonist ketanserin,
   indicating that effects of LSD are attributable to 5-HT2AR stimulation.
   The current results demonstrate that activity in areas of the ``social
   brain{''} can be modulated via the 5-HT2AR thereby pointing toward this
   system as a potential target for the treatment of social impairments
   associated with psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with fetal brain lesions
   and other serious birth defects classified as congenital ZIKV syndrome.
   Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported;
   however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes
   following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of
   infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and
   functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to
   age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and
   neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the
   peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory
   infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show
   persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in
   specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between
   brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions,
   including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in two of two
   ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from
   peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in
   the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were
   predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that
   postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects
   neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of
   pediatric cases is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{When we encounter a new word, there are often multiple objects that the
   word might refer to {[}1]. Nonetheless, because names for concrete nouns
   are constant, we are able to learn them across successive encounters
   {[}2, 3]. This form of ``cross-situational'' learning may result from
   either associative mechanisms that gradually accumulate evidence for
   each word-object association {[}4, 5] or rapid proposebut-verify (PbV)
   mechanisms where only one hypothesized referent is stored for each word,
   which is either subsequently verified or rejected {[}6, 7]. Using
   model-based representation similarity analyses of fMRI data acquired
   during learning, we find evidence for learning mediated by a PbV
   mechanism. This learning may be underpinned by rapid pattern-separation
   processes in the hippocampus. Our findings shed light on the
   psychological and neural processes that support word learning,
   suggesting that adults rely on their episodic memory to track a limited
   number of word-object associations.}},

Abstract = {{Mental imitation, perhaps a precursor to motor imitation, involves
   visual perspective-taking and motor imagery. Research on mental
   imitation in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been rather limited
   compared to that on motor imitation. The main objective of this fMRI
   study is to determine the differences in brain responses underlying
   mirroring and mentalizing networks during mental imitation in children
   and adolescents with ASD. Thirteen high-functioning children and
   adolescents with ASD and 15 age-and- IQ-matched typically developing
   (TD) control participants took part in this fMRI study. In the MRI
   scanner, participants were shown cartoon pictures of people performing
   everyday actions (Transitive actions: e.g., ironing clothes but with the
   hand missing; and Intransitive actions: e.g., clapping hands with the
   palms missing) and were asked to identify which hand or palm orientation
   would best fit the gap. The main findings are: 1) both groups performed
   equally while processing transitive and intransitive actions; 2) both
   tasks yielded activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)
   and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in ASD and TD groups; 3) Increased
   activation was seen in ASD children, relative to TD, in left ventral
   premotor and right middle temporal gyrus during intransitive actions;
   and 4) ASD symptom severity positively correlated with activation in
   left parietal, right middle temporal, and right premotor regions across
   all subjects. Overall, our findings suggest that regions mediating
   mirroring may be recruiting more brain resources in ASD and may have
   implications for understanding social movement through modeling.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN CONNECTIVITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{129-138}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Multimodal neuroimaging research has become increasingly popular, and
   structure-function correspondence is tacitly assumed. Researchers have
   not yet adequately assessed whether the functional connectivity (FC) and
   structural connectivity (SC) of large-scale cortical networks are in
   agreement. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), resting-state
   functional MRI (rfMRI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data sets
   from 36 healthy subjects (age 27.4) were selected from a Rockland sample
   (Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute). The cerebral cortex was parcellated
   into 62 regions according to the Desikan-Killiany atlas for FC and SC
   analyses. Thresholded correlations in rfMRI and tractography derived
   from DWI were used to construct FC and SC maps, respectively. A
   community detection algorithm was applied to reveal the underlying
   organization, and modular consistency was quantified to bridge
   cross-modal comparisons. The distributions of correlation coefficients
   in FC and SC maps were significantly different. Approximately one-fourth
   of the connections in the SC map were located at a correlation level
   below 0.2 (df 253). The index of modular consistency in the
   within-modality interindividual condition (either FC or SC) was
   considerably greater than that in the between-modality intraindividual
   analog. In addition, the SC-FC differential map (SC connections with
   lower correlations) revealed reliable modular structures. Based on these
   results, the hypothesized FC-SC agreement is partially valid. Contingent
   on extant neuroimaging tools and analytical conventions, the neural
   informatics of FC and SC should be regarded as complementary rather than
   concordant. Furthermore, the results verify the physiological
   significance of moderately (or mildly) correlated brain signals in
   rfMRI, which are often discarded by stringent thresholding.}},

Title = {{Pretherapeutic Functional Imaging Allows Prediction of Head Tremor
   Arrest After Thalamotomy for Essential Tremor: The Role of Altered
   Interconnectivity Between Thalamolimbic and Supplementary Motor Circuits}},
Journal = {{WORLD NEUROSURGERY}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To correlate pretherapeutic resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) measures with pretherapeutic head tremor
   presence and/or further improvement 1 year after stereotactic
   radiosurgical thalamotomy (SRS-T) for essential tremor (ET).
   METHODS: We prospectively collected head tremor scores (range, 0-3) and
   rs-fMRI data for a cohort of 17 consecutive ET patients in
   pretherapeutic and 1 year after SRS-T states. We additionally acquired
   rs-fMRI data for a healthy control (HC) group (n = 12). Group-level
   independent component analysis (n = 17 for pretherapeutic rs-fMRI) was
   applied to decompose neuroimaging data into 20 large-scale brain
   networks using a standard approach. Through spatial regression, we
   projected 1 year after SRS-T and HC rs-fMRI time points, on the same 20
   brain networks.
   RESULTS: Pretherapeutic interconnectivity (IC) strength between the
   network including bilateral thalamus and limbic system with left
   supplementary motor area predicted head tremor improvement at 1 year
   after SRS-T (family-wise corrected P < 0.001, cluster size K-c = 146).
   For the statistically significant cluster, IC strength was strongest in
   HCs (mean, 4.6; median, 3.8) compared with pre- (mean, 0.1; median, 0.2)
   or posttherapeutic (mean, -02; median, 0.09) states.
   CONCLUSIONS: Baseline measures of IC between bilateral thalamus and
   limbic system with left supplementary motor area may predict head tremor
   arrest after thalamotomy. However, procedures such as SRS-T, for this
   particular clinical feature, do not align patients to HCs in terms of
   functional brain connectivity. We postulate that supplementary motor
   area is modulating head tremor appearance, by abnormal connectivity with
   the thalamolimbic system.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is crucial for successful interpersonal interactions, and it is
   impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders.
   Action-perception matching, or action simulation mechanisms, has been
   suggested to facilitate empathy by supporting the simulation of
   perceived experience in others. However, this remains unclear, and the
   involvement of the action simulation circuit in cognitive empathy (the
   ability to adopt another's perspective) vs emotional empathy (the
   capacity to share and react affectively to another's emotional
   experience) has not been quantitatively compared. Presently, healthy
   adults completed a classic cognitive empathy task (false belief), an
   emotional empathy task and an action simulation button-pressing task
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Conjunction analyses
   revealed common recruitment of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), thought
   to be critical for action-perception matching, during both action
   simulation and emotional, but not cognitive, empathy. Furthermore,
   activation was significantly greater in action simulation regions in the
   left IFG during emotional vs cognitive empathy, and activity in this
   region was positively correlated with mean feeling ratings during the
   emotional empathy task. These findings provide evidence for greater
   involvement of action simulation mechanisms in emotional than cognitive
   empathy. Thus, the action simulation circuit may be an important target
   for delineating the pathophysiology of disorders featuring emotional
   empathy impairments.}},

Abstract = {{The way we view ourselves may play an important role in our responses to
   interpersonal interactions. In this study, we investigate how feedback
   valence, consistency of feedback with self-knowledge and global
   self-esteem influence affective and neural responses to social feedback.
   Participants (N = 46) with a high range of self-esteem levels performed
   the social feedback task in an MRI scanner. Negative, intermediate and
   positive feedback was provided, supposedly by another person based on a
   personal interview. Participants rated their mood and applicability of
   feedback to the self. Analyses on trial basis on neural and affective
   responses are used to incorporate applicability of individual feedback
   words. Lower self-esteem related to low mood especially after receiving
   non-applicable negative feedback. Higher self-esteem related to
   increased posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus activation (i.e.
   self-referential processing) for applicable negative feedback. Lower
   self-esteem related to decreased medial prefrontal cortex, insula,
   anterior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex activation
   (i.e. self-referential processing) during positive feedback and
   decreased temporoparietal junction activation (i.e. other referential
   processing) for applicable positive feedback. Self-esteem and
   consistency of feedback with self-knowledge appear to guide our
   affective and neural responses to social feedback. This may be highly
   relevant for the interpersonal problems that individuals face with low

Abstract = {{The neurobiology of emotional prosody production is not well
   investigated. In particular, the effects of cues and social context are
   not known. The present study sought to differentiate cued from free
   emotion generation and the effect of social feedback from a human
   listener. Online speech filtering enabled functional magnetic resonance
   imaging during prosodic communication in 30 participants. Emotional
   vocalizations were (i) free, (ii) auditorily cued, (iii) visually cued
   or (iv) with interactive feedback. In addition to distributed language
   networks, cued emotions increased activity in auditory and-in case of
   visual stimuli-visual cortex. Responses were larger in posterior
   superior temporal gyrus at the right hemisphere and the ventral striatum
   when participants were listened to and received feedback from the
   experimenter. Sensory, language and reward networks contributed to
   prosody production and were modulated by cues and social context. The
   right posterior superior temporal gyrus is a central hub for
   communication in social interactions-in particular for interpersonal
   evaluation of vocal emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Early life stress has been associated with disrupted functional

   but it is unknown how early in development stress-related differences in
   amygdala-mPFC connectivity emerge. In a resting-state functional

   we found a significant correlation between more adverse experiences and
   weaker amygdala-mPFC rs-FC. We also found that weaker amygdala-mPFC
   rs-FC was associated with higher levels of aggressive behavior and
   attention problems. These findings suggest that the impact of stress on
   emotional circuitry is detectable in early childhood and that this
   impact is associated with mental health difficulties. Connectivity in
   this circuit may be useful as a marker for mental health risk and for
   tracking the efficacy of early interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies in adults showed that cortical midline regions
   including medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior parietal cortex
   (PPC) are important in self-evaluations. The goals of this study were to
   investigate the contribution of these regions to self-evaluations in
   late childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood, and to examine whether
   these differed per domain (academic, physical and prosocial) and valence
   (positive versus negative). Also, we tested whether this activation
   changes across adolescence. For this purpose, participants between ages
   11-21-years (N = 150) evaluated themselves on trait sentences in an fMRI
   session. Behaviorally, adolescents rated their academic traits less
   positively than children and young adults. The neural analyses showed
   that evaluating self-traits versus a control condition was associated
   with increased activity in mPFC (domain-general effect), and positive
   traits were associated with increased activity in ventral mPFC (valence
   effect). Self-related mPFC activation increased linearly with age, but
   only for evaluating physical traits. Furthermore, an adolescent-specific
   decrease in striatum activation for positive self traits was found.
   Finally, we found domain-specific neural activity for evaluating traits
   in physical (dorsolateral PFC, dorsal mPFC) and academic (PPC) domains.
   Together, these results highlight the importance of domain distinctions
   when studying self-concept development in late childhood, adolescence,
   and early adulthood.}},

Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{70-76}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Mindfulness is thought to promote well-being by shaping the way people
   respond to challenging social-emotional situations. Current
   understanding of how this occurs at the neural level is based on studies
   of response to decontextualized emotion stimuli that may not adequately
   represent lived experiences. In this study, we tested relations between
   mothers' dispositional mindfulness and neural responses to their own
   infant in different emotion-eliciting contexts. Mothers (n = 25) engaged
   with their 3-month-old infants in videorecorded tasks designed to elicit
   negative (arm restraint) or positive (peekaboo) emotion. During a
   functional MRI session, mothers were presented with 15-s clips from
   these recordings, and dispositional mindfulness scores were used to
   predict their neural responses to arm restraint > peekaboo videos.
   Mothers higher in nonreactivity showed relatively lower activation to
   their infants' arm restraint compared to peekaboo videos in hypothesized
   regions- insula and dorsal prefrontal cortex-as well as non-hypothesized
   regions. Other mindfulness dimensions were associated with more limited
   areas of lower (nonjudgment) and higher (describing) activation in this
   contrast. Mothers who were higher in mindfulness generally activated
   more to the positive emotion context and less to the negative emotion
   context in perceptual and emotion processing areas, a pattern that may
   help to explain mindfulness-related differences in well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a period of sensitivity to social stimuli. In particular,
   research has focused on the increased sensitivity to risks and social
   information seen during adolescence. However, recent evidence also
   suggests that adolescents can flexibly use information in service of
   their goals, raising an interesting question: are adolescents able to
   selectively discount social information if it conflicts with their
   goals? To test this question, fifty-five children and adolescents (ages
   8-17 years) completed a social variant of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task
   during an fMRI session. Adolescents showed decreased tracking of
   negative social feedback in regions involved in salience-monitoring
   (e.g. insula) and social processing (e.g., TPJ, pSTS). Age-related
   changes in neural processing of risk and social feedback contributed to
   better performance for older participants. These results suggest that
   adolescents are able to suppress goal-irrelevant social feedback, rather
   than being uniformly hyper-sensitive to social information.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Stimulants such as methylphenidate and modafinil are
   frequently used as cognitive enhancers in healthy people, whereas
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) is proposed to enhance mood
   and empathy in healthy subjects. However, comparative data on the
   effects of methylphenidate and modafinil on negative emotions in healthy
   subjects have been partially missing. The aim of this study was to
   compare the acute effects of methylphenidate and modafinil on the neural
   correlates of fearful face processing using
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine as a positive control.
   Methods: Using a double-blind, within-subject, placebo-controlled,
   cross-over design, 60 mg methylphenidate, 600 mg modafinil, and 125 mg
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine were administrated to 22 healthy
   subjects while performing an event-related fMRI task to assess brain
   activation in response to fearful faces. Negative mood states were
   assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and subjective ratings.
   Results: Relative to placebo, modafinil, but not methylphenidate or
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, increased brain activation within a
   limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit during fearful face
   processing. Modafinil but not methylphenidate also increased amygdala
   responses to fearful faces compared with
   3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Furthermore, activation in the middle
   and inferior frontal gyrus in response to fearful faces correlated
   positively with subjective feelings of fearfulness and depressiveness
   after modafinil administration.
   Conclusions: Despite the cognitive enhancement effects of 600 mg
   modafinil in healthy people, potential adverse effects on emotion
   processing should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Success in the social world requires the ability to perceive not just
   individuals and their actions, but pairs of people and the interactions
   between them. Despite the complexity of social interactions, humans are
   adept at interpreting those interactions they observe. Although the
   brain basis of this remarkable ability has remained relatively
   unexplored, converging functional MRI evidence suggests the posterior
   superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is centrally involved. Here, we sought
   to determine whether this region is sensitive to both the presence of
   interactive information, as well as to the content of qualitatively
   different interactions (i.e. competition vs. cooperation). Using
   point-light human figure stimuli, we demonstrate that the right pSTS is
   maximally activated when contrasting dyadic interactions vs. dyads
   performing independent, non-interactive actions. We then used this task
   to localize the same pSTS region in an independent participant group,
   and tested responses to nonhuman moving shape stimuli (i.e. two circles'
   movements conveying either interactive or non-interactive behaviour). We
   observed significant support vector machine classification for both the
   presence and type of interaction (i.e. interaction vs. non-interaction,
   and competition vs. cooperation, respectively) in the pSTS, as well as
   neighbouring temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). These findings demonstrate
   the important role that these regions play in perceiving and
   understanding social interactions, and lay the foundations for further
   research to fully characterize interaction responses in these areas.}},

Title = {{The two processes underlying the testing effect- Evidence from
   Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{77-85}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical explanations of the testing effect (why people learn better
   from a test than a re-study) have largely focused on either the benefit
   of attempting to retrieve the answer or on the benefit of re-encoding
   the queried information after a successful retrieval. While a less
   parsimonious account, prior neuroimaging evidence has led us to
   postulate that both of these processes contribute to the benefit of
   testing over re-study. To provide further empirical support for our
   position, we recorded ERPs while subjects attempted to recall the second
   word of a pair when cued with the first. These ERPs were analyzed based
   on the current response accuracy and as a function of accuracy on the
   subsequent test, yielding three groups: the first and second tests were
   correct, the first was correct and the second was not, both were
   incorrect. Mean amplitude waveforms during the first test showed
   different patterns depending on the outcome patterns: Between 400 and
   700 ms the amplitudes were most positive when both tests were correct
   and least positive when both were incorrect; mean amplitudes between 700
   and 1000 ms only differed as a function of subsequent memory. They were
   more positive when the second test was correct. Importantly, the later
   component only predicted subsequent memory when the answers were not
   overlearned, i.e. only correctly recalled once previously. We interpret
   the 400-700 ms time window as a component reflecting a retrieval attempt
   process, which differs as a function of both current and subsequent
   accuracy, and the later time window as a component reflecting a
   re-encoding process, which only involves learning from tests, both of
   which are involved in the testing effect.}},

Abstract = {{Resting state functional brain connectivity (rsFC) may be an important
   neuromarker of smoking behavior. Prior research has shown, among
   cigarette smokers, that nicotine administration alters rsFC within
   frontal and parietal cortices involved in executive control, as well as
   striatal regions that drive reward processing. These changes in rsFC
   have been associated with reductions in withdrawal symptom severity. We
   currently have a limited understanding of how rsFC is affected by the
   use of electronic cigarettes (ecigs), an increasingly popular class of
   products, the members of which deliver nicotine with varying
   effectiveness. The current study used fMRI to determine the effects of
   ecig use on rsFC and withdrawal symptoms. Independent component, dual
   regression, and permutation analyses were conducted on rsFC collected
   from ecig users before and after an ecig use episode (n = 9) that
   occurred after 14 h of nicotine abstinence. Similar to the known effects
   of nicotine administration, ecig use decreased rsFC of two clusters in
   the right frontal pole and frontal medial cortex with an attentional
   control salience network, and decreased rsFC of five clusters in the
   left thalamus, insula, and brain stem with a reward network encompassing
   the striatum. Ecig use increased inverse coupling between the prefrontal
   reward network and the right frontoparietal executive control network.
   Reductions in craving and difficulty with concentration were correlated
   with decreases in coupling strength between reward and executive control
   networks. These preliminary results suggest that the effects of ecig use
   on rsFC are similar to those seen with nicotine administration in other
   forms. In order to gain insight into the addictive potential of ecigs,
   further research is needed to understand the neural influence of ecigs
   across the range of nicotine delivery within this class of products.}},

Volume = {{185}},
Pages = {{198-206}},

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known regarding the combined influence of
   psychosocial and neural protective mechanisms against substance use. The
   present study examined the extent to which neuroimaging measures of
   disinhibition predicted resilience against binge drinking and marijuana
   use among youth with a family history of substance use disorder (SUD; FH
   +), accounting for psychosocial measures of behavioral control.
   Methods: Participants were 57 FH + youth from the Michigan Longitudinal
   Study categorized into resilient and high-risk groups based on patterns
   of weekly binge drinking and monthly marijuana use during early
   adulthood. Psychosocial measures of behavioral control (reactive control
   and externalizing behavior during early and late adolescence) and neural
   measures of disinhibition (Go/No-Go task and Monetary Incentive Delay
   Task (MIDT) measured through functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI)) were entered sequentially in hierarchical logistic regression
   models to predict resilient versus high-risk groups.
   Results: Greater activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC) during correctly inhibited trials on the Go/No-Go task was a
   significant predictor of resilience (OR = 2.46, p < 0.05), over and
   above greater reactive control in early adolescence (OR = 4.96, p <
   0.05) and lower externalizing behavior in late adolescence (OR = 0.64, p
   < 0.05). Neural activation in the ventral striatum associated with
   reward anticipation during the MIDT was not a significant predictor of
   resilience.
   Conclusions: Brain function in the right DLPFC associated with
   inhibitory control may be a neural indicator of resilience against
   elevated substance use among FH + youth, even after accounting for
   psychosocial measures of behavioral control.}},

Abstract = {{Clarifying dynamic fluctuations in resting-state connectivity in
   individuals at risk for psychosis (termed clinical high risk {[}CHR])
   may inform understanding of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia,
   which have been associated with dysconnectivity and aberrant salience

   insight into how neural networks exchange information over time.
   Currently, there are no published DFC studies involving CHR individuals.
   This is notable, because understanding how networks may come together
   and disassociate over time could lend insight into the neural
   communication that underlies psychosis development and symptomatology. A
   sliding-window analysis was utilized to examine DFC (defined as the
   standard deviation over a series of sliding windows) in resting-state
   scans in a total of 31 CHR individuals and 28 controls. Clinical
   assessments at baseline and 12 months later were conducted. CHR
   participants exhibited less DFC (lower standard deviation) in
   connectivity involving areas of both the salience network (SN) and
   default mode network (DMN) with regions involved in sensory, motor,
   attention, and internal cognitive functions relative to controls. Within
   CHR participants, this pattern was associated with greater positive
   symptoms 12 months later, possibly reflecting a mechanism behind
   aberrant salience processing. Higher SN-DMN internetwork DFC related to
   elevated baseline negative symptoms, anxiety, and depression in CHR
   participants, which may indicate neurological processes underlying worry
   and rumination. Overall, through highlighting unique DFC properties
   within CHR individuals and detecting informative links with clinically
   relevant symptomatology, results support dysconnectivity and aberrant
   salience processing models of psychosis.}},

Title = {{The functional network signature of heterogeneity in freezing of gait}},
Journal = {{BRAIN}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Freezing of gait is a complex, heterogeneous, and highly variable
   phenomenon whose pathophysiology and neural signature remains enigmatic.
   Evidence suggests that freezing is associated with impairments across
   cognitive, motor and affective domains; however, most research to date
   has focused on investigating one axis of freezing of gait in isolation.
   This has led to inconsistent findings and a range of different
   pathophysiological models of freezing of gait, due in large part to the
   tendency for studies to investigate freezing of gait as a homogeneous
   entity. To investigate the neural mechanisms of this heterogeneity, we
   used an established virtual reality paradigm to elicit freezing
   behaviour in 41 Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait and
   examined individual differences in the component processes (i.e.
   cognitive, motor and affective function) that underlie freezing of gait
   in conjunction with task-based functional MRI. First, we combined three
   unique components of the freezing phenotype: impaired set-shifting
   ability, step time variability, and self-reported anxiety and depression
   in a principal components analysis to estimate the severity of freezing
   behaviour with a multivariate approach. By combining these measures, we
   were then able to interrogate the pattern of task-based functional
   connectivity associated with freezing (compared to normal foot tapping)
   in a subcohort of 20 participants who experienced sufficient amounts of
   freezing during task functional MRI. Specifically, we used the first
   principal component from our behavioural analysis to classify patterns
   of functional connectivity into those that were associated with: (i)
   increased severity; (ii) increased compensation; or (iii) those that
   were independent of freezing severity. Coupling between the cognitive
   and limbic networks was associated with `worse freezing severity',
   whereas anti-coupling between the putamen and the cognitive and limbic
   networks was related to `increased compensation'. Additionally,
   anti-coupling between cognitive cortical regions and the caudate nucleus
   were `independent of freezing severity' and thus may represent common
   neural underpinnings of freezing that are unaffected by heterogenous
   factors. Finally, we related these connectivity patterns to each of the
   individual components (cognitive, motor, affective) in turn, thus
   exposing latent heterogeneity in the freezing phenotype, while also
   identifying critical functional network signatures that may represent
   potential targets for novel therapeutic intervention. In conclusion, our
   findings provide confirmatory evidence for systems-level impairments in
   the pathophysiology of freezing of gait and further advance our
   understanding of the whole-brain deficits that mediate symptom
   expression in Parkinson's disease.}},

Title = {{Thalamic functional connectivity and its association with behavioral
   performance in older age}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Despite the thalamus' dense connectivity with both
   cortical and subcortical structures, few studies have specifically
   investigated how thalamic connectivity changes with age and how such
   changes are associated with behavior. This study investigated the effect
   of age on thalamo-cortical and thalamo-hippocampal functional
   connectivity (FC) and the association between thalamic FC and
   visual-spatial memory and reaction time (RT) performance in older
   adults.
   Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance images were
   obtained from younger (n = 20) and older (n = 20) adults. A seed-based
   approach was used to assess the FC between the thalamus and (1) sensory
   resting-state networks; (2) the hippocampus. Participants also completed
   visual-spatial memory and RT tasks, from the Cambridge
   Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB).
   Results: Older adults exhibited a loss of specificity in the FC between
   sensory thalamic subregions and corresponding sensory cortex. Greater
   thalamo-motor FC in older adults was associated with faster RTs.
   Furthermore, older adults exhibited greater thalamo-hippocampal FC
   compared to younger adults, which was greatest for those with the
   poorest visual-spatial memory performance.
   Conclusion: Although older adults exhibited poorer visual-spatial memory
   and slower reaction times compared to younger adults, ``good{''} and
   ``poorer{''} older performers exhibited different patterns of
   thalamo-cortical and thalamo-hippocampal FC. These results highlight the
   potential role of thalamic connectivity in supporting reaction times and
   memory in aging. Furthermore, these results highlight the importance of
   including the thalamus in studies of aging to fully understand how brain
   changes with age may be associated with behavior.}},

Title = {{Change in emotional self-concept following socio-cognitive training
   relates to structural plasticity of the prefrontal cortex}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Self-referential processing is a key component of the
   emotional self-concept. Previous studies have shown that emotional
   self-referential processing is related to structure and function of
   cortical midline areas such as medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and that
   it can be altered on a behavioral level by specific mental training
   practices. However, it remains unknown how behavioral training-related
   change in emotional self-concept content relates to structural
   plasticity.
   Methods: To address this issue, we examined the relationship between
   training-induced change in participant's emotional self-concept measured
   through emotional word use in the Twenty Statement Test and change in
   cortical thickness in the context of a large-scale longitudinal mental
   training study called the ReSource Project.
   Results: Based on prior behavioral findings showing increased emotional
   word use particularly after socio-cognitive training targeting
   perspective-taking capacities, this study extended these results by
   revealing that individual differences in the degree to which
   participants changed their emotional self-concept after training was
   positively related to cortical thickness change in right mPFC extending
   to dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC). Furthermore, increased self-related
   negative emotional word use after training was positively associated
   with cortical thickness change in left pars orbitalis and bilateral
   dlPFC.
   Conclusions: Our findings reveal training-related structural brain
   change in regions known to be involved in self-referential processing
   and cognitive control, and could indicate a relationship between
   restructuring of the emotional self-concept content as well as
   reappraisal of negative aspects and cortical thickness change. As such,
   our findings can guide the development of psychological interventions
   targeted to alter specific facets of the self-concept.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN AND LANGUAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{22-32}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The processing disadvantage of verbs compared to nouns and the greater
   vulnerability of verbs in brain damage have been ascribed to greater
   processing demands of morpho-syntactical or/and semantic properties for
   verbs, or/and visual complexity in picture-naming studies. Using picture
   naming, the current functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined
   the neural substrates underlying the semantic distinction between nouns
   and verbs. Under forced (externally-elicited) or free
   (internally-motivated) conditions, participants named a set of pictorial
   stimuli as objects or actions performed on/with the objects in Chinese.
   Use of a language with impoverished inflectional morphology (i.e.,
   Chinese) and the same set of pictures for naming objects and actions
   allows for the control of both morpho-syntactical and visual confounds.
   The results revealed specific neural correlates for action verbs in the
   cortical-subcortical motor system, irrespective of the naming
   conditions. Plausible accounts for the motor aspects of action-verb
   processing were interpreted basically on a semantic basis.}},

   across partial face samples}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{31-43}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A network of cortical and sub-cortical regions is known to be important
   in the processing of facial expression. However, to date no study has
   investigated whether representations of facial expressions present in
   this network permit generalization across independent samples of face
   information (e.g., eye region vs mouth region). We presented
   participants with partial face samples of five expression categories in
   a rapid event-related fMRI experiment. We reveal a network of
   face-sensitive regions that contain information about facial expression
   categories regardless of which part of the face is presented. We further
   reveal that the neural information present in a subset of these regions:
   dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC), superior temporal sulcus (STS), lateral
   occipital and ventral temporal cortex, and even early visual cortex,
   enables reliable generalization across independent visual inputs (faces
   depicting the `eyes only' vs `eyes removed'). Furthermore,
   classification performance was correlated to behavioral performance in
   STS and dPFC. Our results demonstrate that both higher (e.g., STS, dPFC)
   and lower level cortical regions contain information useful for facial
   expression decoding that go beyond the visual information presented, and
   implicate a key role for contextual mechanisms such as cortical feedback
   in facial expression perception under challenging conditions of visual
   occlusion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   performing an adapted go/no-go task alone or in the presence of a

   periods of positive arousal. Adolescents showed diminished cognitive
   control to positive social cues when anticipating a reward in the

   self-experienced and observed ostracism had the same negative effect on
   mood. Also, both self-experienced and observed ostracism evoked need
   threat, but this effect was slightly lower after observed ostracism. In
   sum, the findings suggest that we do feel the pain of others' ostracism

Abstract = {{Alcohol intoxication is implicated in approximately half of all violent
   crimes. Over the past several decades, numerous theories have been
   proposed to account for the influence of alcohol on aggression. Nearly
   all of these theories imply that altered functioning in the prefrontal
   cortex is a proximal cause. In the present functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) experiment, 50 healthy young men consumed either a low
   dose of alcohol or a placebo and completed an aggression paradigm
   against provocative and nonprovocative opponents. Provocation did not
   affect neural responses. However, relative to sober participants, during
   acts of aggression, intoxicated participants showed decreased activity
   in the prefrontal cortex, caudate, and ventral striatum, but heightened
   activation in the hippocampus. Among intoxicated participants, but not
   among sober participants, aggressive behavior was positively correlated
   with activation in the medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These
   results support theories that posit a role for prefrontal cortical
   dysfunction as an important factor in intoxicated aggression.}},

Abstract = {{Many fMRI studies have examined the neural mechanisms supporting
   emotional memory for stimuli that generate emotion rather automatically
   (e.g., a picture of a dangerous animal or of appetizing food). However,
   far fewer studies have examined how memory is influenced by emotion
   related to social and political issues (e.g., a proposal for large
   changes in taxation policy), which clearly vary across individuals. In
   order to investigate the neural substrates of affective and mnemonic
   processes associated with personal opinions, we employed an fMRI task
   wherein participants rated the intensity of agreement/disagreement to
   sociopolitical belief statements paired with neural face pictures.
   Following the rating phase, participants performed an associative
   recognition test in which they distinguished identical versus recombined
   face-statement pairs. The study yielded three main findings:
   behaviorally, the intensity of agreement ratings was linked to greater
   subjective emotional arousal as well as enhanced high-confidence
   subsequent memory. Neurally, statements that elicited strong (vs. weak)
   agreement or disagreement were associated with greater activation of the
   amygdala. Finally, a subsequent memory analysis showed that the
   behavioral memory advantage for statements generating stronger ratings
   was dependent on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Together, these
   results both underscore consistencies in neural systems supporting
   emotional arousal and suggest a modulation of arousal-related encoding
   mechanisms when emotion is contingent on referencing personal beliefs.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have found that theory of mind (ToM) and discourse
   comprehension involve similar brain regions. These brain regions may be
   associated with three cognitive components that are necessarily or
   frequently involved in ToM and discourse comprehension, including social
   concept representation and retrieval, domain-general semantic
   integration, and domain-specific integration of social semantic
   contents. Using fMRI, we investigated the neural correlates of these
   three cognitive components by exploring how discourse topic
   (social/nonsocial) and discourse processing period (ending/beginning)
   modulate brain activation in a discourse comprehension (and also ToM)
   task. Different sets of brain areas showed sensitivity to discourse
   topic, discourse processing period, and the interaction between them,
   respectively. The most novel finding was that the right temporoparietal
   junction and middle temporal gyrus showed sensitivity to discourse
   processing period only during social discourse comprehension, indicating
   that they selectively contribute to domain-specific semantic
   integration. Our finding indicates how different domains of semantic
   information are processed and integrated in the brain and provides new
   insights into the neural correlates of ToM and discourse comprehension.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is characterized by extensive neural development and
   sensitivity to social context, both of which contribute to engaging in
   prosocial behaviors. Although it is established that prosocial behaviors
   are linked to positive outcomes in adulthood, little is known about the
   neural correlates of adolescents' prosociality. Identifying whether the
   brain is differentially responsive to varying types of social input may
   be important for fostering prosocial behavior. We report pilot results
   using new stimuli and an ecologically valid donation paradigm indicating
   (1) brain regions typically recruited during socioemotional processing
   evinced differential activation when adolescents evaluated prosocial
   compared with social or noninteractive scenes (N = 20, ages 13-17 years,
   M (Age) = 15.30 years), and (2) individual differences in
   temporoparietal junction recruitment when viewing others' prosocial
   behaviors were related to adolescents' own charitable giving. These
   novel findings have significant implications for understanding how the
   adolescent brain processes prosocial acts and for informing ways to
   support adolescents to engage in prosocial behaviors in their daily
   lives.}},

Abstract = {{Mediation analysis is an important tool in the behavioral sciences for
   investigating the role of intermediate variables that lie in the path
   between a treatment and an outcome variable. The influence of the
   intermediate variable on the outcome is often explored using a linear
   structural equation model (LSEM), with model coefficients interpreted as
   possible effects. While there has been significant research on the
   topic, little work has been done when the intermediate variable
   (mediator) is a high-dimensional vector. In this work, we introduce a
   novel method for identifying potential mediators in this setting called
   the directions of mediation (DMs). DMs linearly combine potential
   mediators into a smaller number of orthogonal components, with
   components ranked based on the proportion of the LSEM likelihood each
   accounts for. This method is well suited for cases when many potential
   mediators are measured. Examples of high dimensional potential mediators
   are brain images composed of hundreds of thousands of voxels, genetic
   variation measured at millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs), or vectors of thousands of variables in large-scale
   epidemiological studies. We demonstrate the method using a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study of thermal pain where we are interested
   in determining which brain locations mediate the relationship between
   the application of a thermal stimulus and self-reported pain.}},

Abstract = {{Critical thinking enables people to form sound beliefs and provides a
   basis for emotional life. Research has indicated that individuals with
   better critical thinking disposition can better recognize and regulate
   their emotions, though the neuroanatomical mechanisms involved in this
   process remain to be elucidated. Further, the influence of emotional
   intelligence on the relationship between brain structure and critical
   thinking disposition has not been examined. The present study utilized
   voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate the neural structures
   underlying critical thinking disposition in a large sample of college
   students (N = 296). Regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in the bilateral
   temporal pole, which reflects an individual's ability to process social
   and emotional information, was negatively correlated with critical
   thinking disposition. In addition, rGMV in bilateral para hippocampal
   regions -regions involved in contextual association/emotional
   regulation-exhibited negative correlation with critical thinking
   disposition. Further analysis revealed that emotional intelligence
   moderated the relationship between rGMV of the temporal pole and
   critical thinking disposition. Specifically, critical thinking
   disposition was associated with decreased GMV of the temporal pole for
   individuals who have relatively higher emotional intelligence rather
   than lower emotional intelligence. The results of the present study
   indicate that people who have higher emotional intelligence exhibit more
   effective and automatic processing of emotional information and tend to
   be strong critical thinkers.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to investigate the brain network alternation
   in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with and without cognitive
   impairment (CI) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   to further explore the potential mechanisms of epilepsy-induced CI.
   Forty patients with TLE and nineteen healthy controls (HCs) were
   recruited for this study. All participants received the Montreal
   Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, and the patients were divided into CI
   (n = 21) and cognitive nonimpairment (CNI) groups (n = 19) according to
   MoCA performance. Functional connectivity (FC) differences of resting
   state networks (RSNs) were compared among the CI, CNI, and HC groups.
   Correlation between FC and MoCA scores was also observed. When compared
   with the HC group, significantly decreased FC between medial visual
   network (mVN) and left frontoparietal network (lFPN) as well as between
   visuospatial network (VSN) and the anterior default mode network (aDMN)
   were revealed in both CI and CNI groups. In addition, significantly
   decreased FC between lFPN and executive control network (ECN) and
   increased FC between ECN and sensorimotorrelated network (SMN) were
   found in CNI and CI groups, respectively. When compared with the CNI
   group, the CI group exhibited significant increased FC between ECN and
   lFPN as well as between ECN and SMN. Moreover, in the CI group, FC
   between ECN and lFPN showed negative correlation with attention scores.
   Our findings suggested that cognitive networks are different from
   epileptic networks, and the increased FC between RSNs closely related to
   cognitive function changes may help us to further understand the
   mechanism of CI in TLE. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to test the reliability of
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evaluation of memory
   function in clinical practice to predict postoperative memory decline in
   patients with refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) candidate
   to surgery.
   Methods: Twenty-six consecutive patients with MTLE who underwent a
   complete presurgical evaluation were included. All patients underwent
   fMRI memory study and complete neuropsychological assessment. Lesions
   consisted in hippocampal sclerosis in 18 patients (12 right and 6 left),
   dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) in 5 cases (4 right, 1
   left), epidermoid cyst in one patient (right). Two patients had no
   lesion (2 left).
   Results: Nineteen patients (73\%) underwent surgery. The other seven
   patients (27\%) declined surgery, mainly because of the risk of memory
   deficit. The fMRI procedure correctly predicted both verbal and
   nonverbal memory postoperative outcome in 13 of the patients (72\%),
   failed to predict a postoperative memory worsening in only two patients
   (12\%), and predicted worsening in three patients (17\%) that remained
   stable (versus 44\%, 39\%, and 17\% with the sole neuropsychological
   testing). The reliability of the fMRI procedure was not influenced by
   the type of lesion, the side of the epileptic focus, or the type of
   preoperative memory profile (typical or atypical).
   Significance: Appearing as a valuable clinical tool to predict
   postoperative memory outcome, fMRI may add information over and above
   other available tests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Premature birth is a significant risk factor for learning disabilities
   in general and mathematics learning difficulties in particular. However,
   the exact reasons for this relation are still unknown. While typical
   numerical development is associated with a frontal-to-parietal shift of
   brain activation with increasing age, influences of gestational age have
   hardly been considered so far. Therefore, we investigated the influence
   of gestational age on the neural correlates of number processing in 6-
   and 7-year-old children born prematurely (n = 16). Only the numerical
   distance effect - as a measure of intentional number magnitude
   processing elicited the frontoparietal activation pattern typically
   observed for numerical cognition. On the other hand, the size congruity
   effect - as a measure of automatic number magnitude processing - was
   associated with activation of brain areas typically attributed to
   cognitive control. Most importantly, however, we observed that
   gestational age reliably predicted the frontal-to-parietal shift of
   activation observed for the numerical distance effect. Our findings seem
   to indicate that human numerical development may start even before birth
   and prematurity might hamper neural facilitation of the brain circuitry
   subserving numerical cognition. In turn, this might contribute to the
   high risk of premature children to develop mathematical learning
   difficulties.}},

Abstract = {{Functional connectivity aberrancies, as measured with resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), have been consistently
   observed in the brain of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) patients.
   However, the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of these findings
   remain unclear. Homozygous mutations in contactin associated
   protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2), a neurexin-related cell-adhesion protein, are
   strongly linked to autism and epilepsy. Here we used rsfMRI to show that
   homozygous mice lacking Cntnap2 exhibit reduced long-range and local
   functional connectivity in prefrontal and midline brain ``connectivity
   hubs.{''} Long-range rsfMRI connectivity impairments affected
   heteromodal cortical regions and were prominent between fronto-posterior
   components of the mouse default-mode network, an effect that was
   associated with reduced social investigation, a core ``autism trait{''}
   in mice. Notably, viral tracing revealed reduced frequency of
   prefrontal-projecting neural clusters in the cingulate cortex of
   Cntnap(2-/-) mutants, suggesting a possible contribution of defective
   mesoscale axonal wiring to the observed functional impairments.
   Macroscale cortico-cortical white-matter organization appeared to be
   otherwise preserved in these animals. These findings reveal a key
   contribution of ASD-associated gene CNTNAP2 in modulating macroscale
   functional connectivity, and suggest that homozygous loss-of-function
   mutations in this gene may predispose to neurodevelopmental disorders
   and autism through a selective dysregulation of connectivity in
   integrative prefrontal areas.}},

Abstract = {{Action and speech may take different forms, being expressed, for
   example, gently or rudely. These aspects of social communication, named
   vitality forms, have been little studied in neuroscience. In the present
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated the role of
   insula in processing action and speech vitality forms. In speech runs,
   participants were asked to listen or imaging themselves to pronounce
   action verbs gently or rudely. In action runs, they were asked to
   observe or imaging themselves to perform actions gently or rudely. The
   results showed that, relative to controls, there was an activation of
   the dorso-central insula in both tasks of speech and action runs. The
   insula sector specific for action vitality form was located slightly
   more dorsally than that of speech with a large overlap of their
   activations. The psycho-physiological interaction analysis showed that
   the insular sector involved in action vitality forms processing is
   connected with the left hemisphere areas controlling arm actions,
   whereas the sector involved in speech vitality forms processing is
   linked with right hemisphere areas related to speech prosody. We
   conclude that the central part of the insula is a key region for
   vitality forms processing regardless of the modality by which they are
   conveyed or expressed.}},

Abstract = {{Major depressive disorder (MDD) is known to be associated with altered
   interactions between distributed brain regions. How these regional
   changes relate to the reorganization of cortical functional systems, and
   their modulation by antidepressant medication, is relatively unexplored.
   To identify changes in the community structure of cortical functional
   networks in MDD, we performed a multiscale community detection algorithm
   on resting-state functional connectivity networks of unmedicated MDD
   (uMDD) patients (n = 46), medicated MDD (mMDD) patients (n = 38), and
   healthy controls (n = 50), which yielded a spectrum of multiscale
   community partitions. we selected an optimal resolution level by
   identifying the most stable community partition for each group. uMDD and
   mMDD groups exhibited a similar reconfiguration of the community
   structure of the visual association and the default mode systems but
   showed different reconfiguration profiles in the frontoparietal control
   (FPC) subsystems. Furthermore, the central system (somatomotor/salience)
   and 3 frontoparietal subsystems showed strengthened connectivity with
   other communities in uMDD but, with the exception of 1 frontoparietal
   subsystem, returned to control levels in mMDD. These findings provide
   evidence for reconfiguration of specific cortical functional systems
   associated with MDD, as well as potential effects of medication in
   restoring disease-related network alterations, especially those of the
   FPC system.}},

Abstract = {{The presence and degree of specialization between the anterior temporal
   lobes (ATLs) is a key issue in debates about the neural architecture of
   semantic memory. Here, we comprehensively assessed multiple aspects of
   semantic cognition in a large group of postsurgical temporal lobe
   epilepsy (TLE) patients with left versus right anterior temporal
   lobectomy (n = 40). Both subgroups showed deficits in expressive and
   receptive verbal semantic tasks, word and object recognition, naming and
   recognition of famous faces and perception of faces and emotions. Graded
   differences in performance between the left and right groups were
   secondary to the overall mild semantic impairment; primarily, left
   resected TLE patients showed weaker performance on tasks that required
   naming or accessing semantic information from a written word. Right
   resected TLE patients were relatively more impaired at recognizing
   famous faces as familiar, although this effect was observed less
   consistently. These findings unify previous partial, inconsistent
   results and also align directly with fMRI and transcranial magnetic
   stimulation results in neurologically intact participants. Taken
   together, these data support a model in which the 2 ATLs act as a
   coupled bilateral system for the representation of semantic knowledge,
   and in which graded hemispheric specializations emerge as a consequence
   of differential connectivity to lateralized speech production and face
   perception regions.}},

Title = {{Resting regional brain metabolism in social anxiety disorder and the

Pages = {{569-581}},

Abstract = {{While there is mounting evidence of abnormal reactivity of several brain
   regions in social anxiety disorder, and disrupted functional
   connectivity between these regions at rest, relatively little is known
   regarding resting regional neural activity in these structures, or how
   such activity is affected by pharmacotherapy. Using
   2-deoxy-2-(F-18)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography, we
   compared resting regional brain metabolism between SAD and healthy
   control groups; and in SAD participants before and after moclobemide
   therapy. Voxel-based analyses were confined to a predefined search
   volume. A second, exploratory whole-brain analysis was conducted using a
   more liberal statistical threshold. Fifteen SAD participants and fifteen
   matched controls were included in the group comparison. A subgroup of
   SAD participants (n = 11) was included in the therapy effect comparison.
   No significant clusters were identified in the primary analysis. In the
   exploratory analysis, the SAD group exhibited increased metabolism in
   left fusiform gyrus and right temporal pole. After therapy, SAD
   participants exhibited reductions in regional metabolism in a medial
   dorsal prefrontal region and increases in right caudate, right insula
   and left postcentral gyrus. This study adds to the limited existing work
   on resting regional brain activity in SAD and the effects of therapy.
   The negative results of our primary analysis suggest that resting
   regional activity differences in the disorder, and moclobemide effects
   on regional metabolism, if present, are small. While the outcomes of our
   secondary analysis should be interpreted with caution, they may
   contribute to formulating future hypotheses or in pooled analyses.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{9-19}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The neural bases of emotion are commonly measured using
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal and the late positive
   potential (LPP) event-related potential (ERP) component, but rarely
   together in the same individuals. Despite evidence of developmental
   changes in processing socio-emotional signals (e.g., faces) as reflected
   by both BOLD and LPP indices of brain maturation, the literature on the
   correspondence between these measures is limited to healthy adults,
   leaving questions regarding such correspondence across development and
   in clinical populations unaddressed. We examined the relationship
   between BOLD and LPP during an emotional face processing task in a large
   sample of youth (N = 70; age 7-19 years) with and without anxiety
   disorders, and tested whether BOLD signal in regions corresponding to
   LPP may account for age-related decreases in LPP. Greater activation in
   bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)/orbitofrontal gyrus (OFG), left
   supplementary motor area, right superior parietal lobule, and bilateral
   amygdala correlated with enhanced LPP to emotional faces in both anxious
   and healthy youth. Older youth exhibited reduced activation in bilateral
   IFG/OFG and bilateral amygdala, as well as reduced LPP. Decreased right
   IFG/OFG activation mediated the association between age and LPP. These
   findings support correspondence between these measures and need for
   multi-method approaches and indicate that age-related decreases in LPP
   may be driven, in part, by decreased IFG/OFG activation.}},

   developmental prosopagnosia}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{151-161}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Face recognition is supported by collaborative work of multiple
   face-responsive regions in the brain. Based on findings from individuals
   with normal face recognition ability, a neural model has been proposed
   with the occipital face area (OFA), fusiform face area (FFA), and
   face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) as the core
   face network (CFN) and the rest of the face-responsive regions as the
   extended face network (EFN). However, little is known about how these
   regions work collaboratively for face recognition in our daily life.
   Here we focused on individuals suffering developmental prosopagnosia
   (DP), a neurodevelopmental disorder specifically impairing face
   recognition, to shed light on the infrastructure of the neural model of
   face recognition. Specifically, we used a variant of global brain
   connectivity method to comprehensively explore resting-state functional
   connectivity (FC) among face-responsive regions in a large sample of DPs
   (N = 64). We found that both the FCs within the CFN and those between
   the CFN and EFN were largely reduced in DP. Importantly, the right OFA
   and FFA served as the dysconnectivity hubs within the CFN, i.e., FCs
   concerning these two regions within the CFN were largely disrupted. In
   addition, DPs' right FFA also showed reduced FCs with the EFN. Moreover,
   these disrupted FCs were related to DP's behavioral deficit in face
   recognition, with the FCs from the FFA to the anterior temporal lobe
   (ATL) and pSTS the most predictive. Based on these findings, we proposed
   a revised neural model of face recognition demonstrating the relatedness
   of interactions among face-responsive regions to face recognition.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{169}},
Pages = {{286-301}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Natural environments elicit both phase-locked and non-phase-locked
   neural responses to the stimulus in the brain. The interpretation of the
   BOLD signal to date has been based on an association of the
   non-phase-locked power of high-frequency local field potentials (LFPs),
   or the related spiking activity in single neurons or groups of neurons.
   Previous studies have not examined the prediction of the BOLD signal by
   phase-locked responses. We examined the relationship between the BOLD
   response and LFPs in the same nine human subjects from multiple
   corresponding points in the auditory cortex, using amplitude modulated
   pure tone stimuli of a duration to allow an analysis of phase locking of
   the sustained time period without contamination from the onset response.
   The results demonstrate that both phase locking at the modulation
   frequency and its harmonics, and the oscillatory power in
   gamma/high-gamma bands are required to predict the BOLD response.
   Biophysical models of BOLD signal generation in auditory cortex
   therefore require revision and the incorporation of both phase locking
   to rhythmic sensory stimuli and power changes in the ensemble neural
   activity.}},

Volume = {{169}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Moment-to-moment reaction time variability on tasks of attention, often
   quantified by intra-individual response variability (IRV), provides a
   good indication of the degree to which an individual is vulnerable to
   lapses in sustained attention. Increased IRV is a hallmark of several
   disorders of attention, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
   Disorder (ADHD). Here, task-based fMRI was used to provide the first
   examination of how average brain activation and functional connectivity
   patterns in adolescents are related to individual differences in
   sustained attention as measured by IRV. We computed IRV in a large
   sample of adolescents (n = 758) across `Go' trials of a Stop Signal Task
   (SST). A data-driven, multi-step analysis approach was used to identify
   networks associated with low IRV (i.e., good sustained attention) and
   high IRV (i.e., poorer sustained attention). Low IRV was associated with
   greater functional segregation (i.e., stronger negative connectivity)
   amongst an array of brain networks, particularly between cerebellum and
   motor, cerebellum and prefrontal, and occipital and motor networks. In
   contrast, high IRV was associated with stronger positive connectivity
   within the motor network bilaterally and between motor and parietal,
   prefrontal, and limbic networks. Consistent with these observations, a
   separate sample of adolescents exhibiting elevated ADHD symptoms had
   increased fMRI activation and stronger positive connectivity within the
   same motor network denoting poorer sustained attention, compared to a
   matched asymptomatic control sample. With respect to the functional
   connectivity signature of low IRV, there were no statistically
   significant differences in networks denoting good sustained attention
   between the ADHD symptom group and asymptomatic control group. We
   propose that sustained attentional processes are facilitated by an array
   of neural networks working together, and provide an empirical account of
   how the functional role of the cerebellum extends to cognition in
   adolescents. This work highlights the involvement of motor cortex in the
   integrity of sustained attention, and suggests that atypically strong
   connectivity within motor networks characterizes poor attentional
   capacity in both typically developing and ADHD symptomatic adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been implicated in the
   pathophysiology of social dysfunction, but the specific circuit partners
   mediating PFC function in health and disease are unclear.
   METHODS: The excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by
   designer drugs (DREADD) hM3Dq was used to induce PFC activation during
   social behavior measured in the three-chamber sociability assay
   (rats/mice). Functional magnetic resonance imaging was combined with
   hM3Dq-mediated PFC activation to identify novel nodes in the ``social
   brain{''} in a hypothesis-free manner. In multiplexed DREADD
   experiments, hM3Dq and the inhibitory KORDi were used to bidirectionally
   modulate PFC activity and measure social behavior and global functional
   magnetic resonance imaging signature. To characterize the functional
   role of specific nodes identified in this functional magnetic resonance
   imaging screen, we used anterograde and retrograde tracers, optogenetic
   and DREADD-assisted circuit mapping, and circuit behavioral experiments.
   RESULTS: PFC activation suppressed social behavior and modulated
   activity in a number of regions involved in emotional behavior.
   Bidirectional modulation of PFC activity further refined this subset of
   brain regions and identified the habenula as a node robustly correlated
   with PFC activity. Furthermore, we showed that the lateral habenula
   (LHb) receives direct synaptic input from the PFC and that activation of
   LHb neurons or the PFC inputs to the LHb suppresses social preference.
   Finally, we demonstrated that LHb inhibition can prevent the social
   deficits induced by PFC activation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The LHb is thought to provide reward-related contextual
   information to the mesolimbic reward system known to be involved in
   social behavior. Thus, PFC projections to the LHb may represent an
   important part of descending PFC pathways that control social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Multimodal functional neuroimaging by combining functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) or
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) is able to provide high spatiotemporal
   resolution mapping of brain activity. However, the accuracy of
   fMRI-constrained EEG/MEG source imaging may be degraded by potential
   spatial mismatches between the locations of fMRI activation and
   electrical source activities. To address this problem, we propose a
   novel fMRI informed time-variant constraint (FITC) method. The weights
   in FITC are determined by combining the fMRI activities and electrical
   source activities in a time-variant manner to reduce the impact of the
   fMRI extra sources. The fMRI weights are modified using cross-talk
   matrix and normalized partial area under the curve to reduce the impact
   of fMRI missing sources. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to
   compare the source estimates produced by L2-minimum norm estimation
   (MNE), fMRI-weighted minimum norm estimation (fMNE), FITC, and
   depth-weighted FITC (wFITC) algorithms with various spatial mismatch
   conditions. Localization error and temporal correlation were calculated
   to compare the four algorithms under different conditions. The
   simulation results indicated that the FITC and wFITC methods were more
   robust than the MNE and fMNE algorithms. Moreover, FITC and wFITC were
   significantly better than fMNE under the fMRI missing sources condition.
   A human visual-stimulus EEG, MEG, and fMRI test was performed, and the
   experimental data revealed that FITC and wFITC displayed more focal
   areas than fMNE and MNE. In conclusion, the proposed FITC method is able
   to better resolve the spatial mismatch problems encountered in
   fMRI-constrained EEG/MEG source imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Previous studies have highlighted the role of the brain
   reward and cognitive control systems in the etiology of anorexia nervosa
   (AN). In an attempt to disentangle the relative contribution of these
   systems to the disorder, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to investigate hemodynamic responses to reward-related stimuli
   presented both subliminally and supraliminally in acutely underweight AN
   patients and age-matched healthy controls (HC).
   Methods. fMRI data were collected from a total of 35 AN patients and 35
   HC, while they passively viewed subliminally and supraliminally
   presented streams of food, positive social, and neutral stimuli.
   Activation patterns of the group x stimulation condition x stimulus type
   interaction were interrogated to investigate potential group differences
   in processing different stimulus types under the two stimulation
   conditions. Moreover, changes in functional connectivity were
   investigated using generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis.
   Results. AN patients showed a generally increased response to
   supraliminally presented stimuli in the inferior frontal junction (IFJ),
   but no alterations within the reward system. Increased activation during
   supraliminal stimulation with food stimuli was observed in the AN group
   in visual regions including superior occipital gyrus and the fusiform
   gyrus/parahippocampal gyrus. No group difference was found with respect
   to the subliminal stimulation condition and functional connectivity.
   Conclusion. Increased IFJ activation in AN during supraliminal
   stimulation may indicate hyperactive cognitive control, which resonates
   with clinical presentation of excessive self-control in AN patients.
   Increased activation to food stimuli in visual regions may be
   interpreted in light of an attentional food bias in AN.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivePride is an important, self-conscious emotion composed of two
   distinct conceptual facets: arrogant, egotistic hubristic pride, and
   pro-social, achievement-oriented authentic pride. However, little is
   known about the neural basis of the two facets of pride. Here, we
   investigated the association between spontaneous brain activity and
   these two facets of pride in resting state.
   MethodWe measured 276 participants on authentic and hubristic pride. The
   fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was used to
   identify pride-related regions.
   ResultsThe results revealed individual differences in authentic pride
   were associated with the fALFF in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus
   (STG), which has been implicated in social processing. In contrast,
   individual differences in hubristic pride were associated with the fALFF
   in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and posterior cingulate cortex
   (PCC), which have been implicated in self-referential and reward
   processing.
   ConclusionsTogether, our results provide initial evidence for the
   distinct neural substrates for authentic and hubristic pride.}},

Abstract = {{Life-threatening diseases (e.g., cancer) affect people's future time
   perspective (FTP) and affect their mental health. When one's lifetime is
   perceived as running out, the individual possesses a future limitation
   perspective (FLP), which is one of factors in FTP. In this study, we
   explored the structural relationship between FLP, fear of cancer
   recurrence (FCR), mental health status (MHS), and brain activity in
   patients with cancer. Cancer patients were divided into two groups using
   the FTP scale and Feelings About Life Scale: a strong FLP group (S-FLP)
   and a weak FLP group (W-FLP). For these groups, we measured cancer
   patients' MHS using the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) and FCR using the
   Cancer Acceptance Scale; brain activity was measured using resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Behavioral results
   showed that the S-FLP group had higher mental symptoms and FCR scores
   than did the W-FLP group. Neuroimaging results revealed that spontaneous
   brain activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was
   stronger in the W-FLP group than in the S-FLP group. Moreover, brain
   activity in the vmPFC negatively correlated with FLP, FCR, and SCL-90
   scores only in the S-FLP group, and the model constructed further
   indicated that FCR and SCL-90 scores fully mediated the relationship
   between FLP and vmPFC activities. These findings suggested that a strong
   FLP might lead to mental disorders and greater FCR, which might change
   the spontaneous activity of the vmPFC in cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{Ageing is associated with grey matter atrophy and changes in
   task-related neural activations. This study investigated the effects of
   age and education on neural activation during a spatial working memory
   task in 189 participants aged between 20-80 years old, whilst
   controlling for grey matter density. Age was related to linear decreases
   in neural activation in task activated areas, and this effect was no
   longer significant when adjusting for education or accuracy. Age was
   also related to cubic increases in neural activation in non-task related
   areas, such as the temporal gyrus, cuneus and cerebellum when adjusting
   for accuracy and education. These findings support previous lifespan
   datasets indicating linear age-related decreases in task activation, but
   non-linear increases in non-task related areas during episodic memory
   tasks. The findings also support past studies indicating education
   offers a form of cognitive reserve through providing a form of neural
   compensation and highlights the need to consider education in ageing
   studies.}},

Title = {{The effects of intranasal oxytocin on reward circuitry responses in
   children with autism spectrum disorder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Intranasal oxytocin (OT) has been shown to improve social
   communication functioning of individuals with autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) and, thus, has received considerable interest as a potential ASD
   therapeutic agent. Although preclinical research indicates that OT
   modulates the functional output of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system
   that processes rewards, no clinical brain imaging study to date has
   examined the effects of OT on this system using a reward processing
   paradigm. To address this, we used an incentive delay task to examine
   the effects of a single dose of intranasal OT, versus placebo (PLC), on
   neural responses to social and nonsocial rewards in children with ASD.
   Methods: In this placebo-controlled double-blind study, 28 children and
   adolescents with ASD (age: M = 13.43 years, SD = 2.36) completed two
   fMRI scans, one after intranasal OT administration and one after PLC
   administration. During both scanning sessions, participants completed
   social and nonsocial incentive delay tasks. Task-based neural activation
   and connectivity were examined to assess the impact of OT relative to
   PLC on mesocorticolimbic brain responses to social and nonsocial reward
   anticipation and outcomes.
   Results: Central analyses compared the OT and PLC conditions. During
   nonsocial reward anticipation, there was greater activation in the right
   nucleus accumbens (NAcc), left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
   bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC), left superior frontal cortex,
   and right frontal pole (FP) during the OT condition relative to PLC.
   Alternatively, during social reward anticipation and outcomes, there
   were no significant increases in brain activation during the OT
   condition relative to PLC. A Treatment Group x Reward Condition
   interaction revealed relatively greater activation in the right NAcc,
   right caudate nucleus, left ACC, and right OFC during nonsocial relative
   to social reward anticipation during the OT condition relative to PLC.
   Additionally, these analyses revealed greater activation during
   nonsocial reward outcomes during the OT condition relative to PLC in the
   right OFC and left FP. Finally, functional connectivity analyses
   generally revealed changes in frontostriatal connections during the OT
   condition relative to PLC in response to nonsocial, but not social,
   rewards.
   Conclusions: The effects of intranasal OT administration on
   mesocorticolimbic brain systems that process rewards in ASD were
   observable primarily during the processing of nonsocial incentive
   salience stimuli. These findings have implications for understanding the
   effects of OT on neural systems that process rewards, as well as for
   experimental trials of novel ASD treatments developed to ameliorate
   social communication impairments in ASD.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study
   investigated influences of language contexts on inhibitory control and
   the underlying neural processes. Thirty Cantonese-Mandarin-English
   trilingual speakers, who were highly proficient in Cantonese (L1) and
   Mandarin (L2), and moderately proficient in English (L3), performed a
   picture-naming task in three dual-language contexts (L1-L2, L2-L3, and
   L1-L3). After each of the three naming tasks, participants performed a
   flanker task, measuring contextual effects on the inhibitory control
   system. Behavioral results showed a typical flanker effect in the L2-L3
   and L1-L3 condition, but not in the L1-L2 condition, which indicates
   contextual facilitation on inhibitory control performance by the L1-L2
   context. Whole brain analysis of the fMRI data acquired during the
   flanker tasks showed more neural activations in the right prefrontal
   cortex and subcortical areas in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 condition on one
   hand as compared to the L1-L2 condition on the other hand, suggesting
   greater involvement of the cognitive control areas when participants
   were performing the flanker task in L2-L3 and L1-L3 contexts. Effective
   connectivity analyses displayed a cortical-subcortical-cerebellar
   circuitry for inhibitory control in the trilinguals. However, contrary
   to the right-lateralized network in the L1-L2 condition, functional
   networks for inhibitory control in the L2-L3 and L1-L3 condition are
   less integrated and more left-lateralized. These findings provide a
   novel perspective for investigating the interaction between bilingualism
   (multilingualism) and inhibitory control by demonstrating instant
   behavioral effects and neural plasticity as a function of changes in
   global language contexts.}},

Title = {{Heightened Salience of Anger and Aggression in Female Adolescents With
   Borderline Personality Disorder-A Script-Based fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anger and aggression belong to the core symptoms of
   borderline personality disorder. Although an early and specific
   treatment of BPD is highly relevant to prevent chronification, still
   little is known about anger and aggression and their neural
   underpinnings in adolescents with BPD.
   Method: Twenty female adolescents with BPD (age 15-17 years) and 20
   female healthy adolescents (age 15-17 years) took part in this
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. A script-driven
   imagery paradigm was used to induce rejection-based feelings of anger,
   which was followed by descriptions of self-directed and other-directed
   aggressive reactions. To investigate the specificity of the neural
   activation patterns for adolescent patients, results were compared with
   data from 34 female adults with BPD (age 18-50 years) and 32 female
   healthy adults (age 18-50 years).
   Results: Adolescents with BPD showed increased activations in the left
   posterior insula and left dorsal striatum as well as in the left
   inferior frontal cortex and parts of the mentalizing network during the
   rejection-based anger induction and the imagination of aggressive
   reactions compared to healthy adolescents. For the other-directed
   aggression phase, a significant diagnosis by age interaction confirmed
   that these results were specific for adolescents.
   Discussion: The results of this very first fMRI study on anger and
   aggression in adolescents with BPD suggest an enhanced emotional
   reactivity to and higher effort in controlling anger and aggression
   evoked by social rejection at an early developmental stage of the
   disorder. Since emotion dysregulation is a known mediator for aggression
   in BPD, the results point to the need of appropriate early interventions
   for adolescents with BPD.}},

Abstract = {{The study of brain networks has developed extensively over the last
   couple of decades. By contrast, techniques for the statistical analysis
   of these networks are less developed. In this paper, we focus on the
   statistical comparison of brain networks in a nonparametric framework
   and discuss the associated detection and identification problems. We
   tested network differences between groups with an analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) test we developed specifically for networks. We also propose and
   analyse the behaviour of a new statistical procedure designed to
   identify different subnetworks. As an example, we show the application
   of this tool in resting-state fMRI data obtained from the Human
   Connectome Project. We identify, among other variables, that the amount
   of sleep the days before the scan is a relevant variable that must be
   controlled. Finally, we discuss the potential bias in neuroimaging
   findings that is generated by some behavioural and brain structure
   variables. Our method can also be applied to other kind of networks such
   as protein interaction networks, gene networks or social networks.}},

Abstract = {{Affective states, such as anticipatory anxiety, critically influence
   speech communication behavior in adults who stutter. However, there is
   currently little evidence regarding the involvement of the limbic system
   in speech disfluency during interpersonal communication. We designed
   this neuroimaging study and experimental procedure to sample neural
   activity during interpersonal communication between human participants,
   and to investigate the relationship between the amygdala activity and
   speech disfluency. Participants were required to engage in live
   communication with a stranger of the opposite sex in the MRI scanner
   environment. In the gaze condition, the stranger gazed at the
   participant without speaking, while in the live conversation condition,
   the stranger asked questions that the participant was required to
   answer. The stranger continued to gaze silently at the participant while
   the participant answered. Adults who stutter reported significantly
   higher discomfort than fluent controls during the experiment. Activity
   in the right amygdala, a key anatomical region in the limbic system
   involved in emotion, was significantly correlated with stuttering
   occurrences in adults who stutter. Right amygdala activity from pooled
   data of all participants also showed a significant correlation with
   discomfort level during the experiment. Activity in the prefrontal
   cortex, which forms emotion regulation neural circuitry with the
   amygdala, was decreased in adults who stutter than in fluent controls.
   This is the first study to demonstrate that amygdala activity during
   interpersonal communication is involved in disfluent speech in adults
   who stutter. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights
