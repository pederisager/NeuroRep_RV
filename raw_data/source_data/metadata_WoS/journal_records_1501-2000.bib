Abstract = {{Social status is a key regulator of health and reproduction in mammals,
   including humans. Despite this, relatively little is known about how
   social status influences the mammalian brain. Furthermore, the extent to
   which status is an independent construct, i.e., not simply acting as a
   psychosocial stressor, is yet to be determined. Research to date reveals
   several promising mechanisms and/or systems associated with social
   status, including monoamine systems, hypothalamic neuroendocrine axes,
   and the hippocampus, though whether these differences are the cause or
   effect of status is often unclear. We review these candidates and
   propose how best to approach this research question in the future.}},

Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive and biological processes play a role in human aggression.
   However, relatively little is known about the neural correlates of
   cognitive processes in aggressive individuals, particularly as they
   unfold during an aggressive encounter. We investigated whether the P3
   event-related potential (ERP) discriminates aggressive versus
   nonaggressive individuals during a provocative, aggressive encounter.
   Forty-eight participants (23 men and 25 women) were classified as
   aggressive or nonaggressive based on self-reported life history of
   aggression. Aggressive behavior was assessed using a modification of a
   well-validated laboratory task during which the participant and a
   fictitious opponent ostensibly delivered and received noise blasts of
   low, medium, and high intensity. Provocation was manipulated by altering
   the level of noise set by the opponent. Aggression was defined as the
   number of high-intensity noise blasts the participant set for the
   opponent. As predicted, P3 amplitude in response to provocation differed
   as a function of aggressive history. Nonaggressive individuals showed
   enhanced P3 when provoked by the opponent relative to low provocation,
   but this effect was absent in aggressive individuals. The results
   suggest that aggressive individuals engage fewer neural processing
   resources in response to provoking social cues, which may reflect
   aberrant cognitive and emotional processes.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated whether and how self-construal priming
   influences empathic neural responses to others' emotional states. We
   recorded event-related brain potentials to stimuli depicting the hands
   of unknown others experiencing painful or non-painful events from
   Chinese and Western participants after they had been primed in three
   conditions (independent self-construal priming, interdependent
   self-construal priming, and a control condition). Stimuli depicting
   painful events (as opposed to non-painful ones) elicited a positive
   shift of the fronto-central activity at 232-332ms and of the
   central-parietal activity at 440-740ms in the control condition.
   Moreover, neural responses to stimuli depicting painful (vs.
   non-painful) situations at 232-332ms were decreased by interdependent
   self-construal priming among Chinese and by independent self-construal
   priming among Westerners. Our findings suggest that self-construal
   priming modulates sensitivity to perceived pain in unknown others and
   that this effect varies with culture.}},

   DLPFC (Brodmann's area 9) was associated with high neuroticism and low
   conscientious factor and facet scores (anxiety and self-discipline,
   respectively). Compared with lesioned and normal controls, veterans with
   damage in left DLPFC also reported higher neuroticism and lower
   conscientiousness facet scores, slower reaction times on the California
   Computerized Assessment Package assessment, and lower scores on the
   Delis-Kaplan executive function battery. Findings suggest that while

Abstract = {{Social support refers to interpersonal exchanges that include the
   combinations of aid, affirmation and affection. Perceived social support
   is a kind of subjective judgment of one's availability of social
   support. In spite of the importance of perceived social support to
   health, however, its neural substrate remains unknown. To address this
   question, voxel-based morphometry was employed to investigate the neural
   bases of individual differences in responses to the Perceived Social
   Support Scale (PSSS) in healthy volunteers (144 men and 203 women; mean
   age=19.9; SD=1.33, age range : 17-27). As a result, multiple regression
   analysis revealed that the PSSS scores were significantly and positively
   correlated with gray matter volume in a cluster that mainly included
   areas in posterior parts of posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral
   lingual cortex, left occipital lobe and cuneus. Highly-supported
   individuals had larger gray matter volume in these brain regions,
   implying a relatively high level of ability to engage in
   self-referential processes and social cognition. Our results provide a
   biological basis for exploring perceived social support particularly in
   relationship to various health parameters and outcomes.}},

Pages = {{160-173}},

Abstract = {{The goal was to develop quantitative models of the neurodynamic
   organizations of teams that could be used for comparing performance
   within and across teams and sessions. A symbolic modeling system was
   developed, where raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals from dyads
   were first transformed into second-by-second estimates of the cognitive
   Workload or Engagement of each person and transformed again into symbols
   representing the aggregated levels of the team. The resulting
   neurodynamic symbol streams had a persistent structure and contained
   segments of differential symbol expression. The quantitative Shannon
   entropy changes during these periods were related to speech,
   performance, and team responses to task changes.The dyads in an
   unscripted map navigation task (Human Communication Research Centre
   (HCRC) Map Task (MT)) developed fluctuating dynamics for Workload and
   Engagement, as they established their teamwork rhythms, and these were
   disrupted by external changes to the task. The entropy fluctuations
   during these disruptions differed in frequency, magnitude, and duration,
   and were associated with qualitative and quantitative changes in team
   organization and performance. These results indicate that neurodynamic
   models may be reliable, sensitive, and valid indicators of the changing
   neurodynamics of teams around which standardized quantitative models can
   begin to be developed.}},

Abstract = {{Social exclusion is so aversive that it causes broad cognitive and
   behavioral changes to regulate the individual's belonging status. The
   present study examined whether such changes also occur at early neural
   or automatic behavioral levels in response to social cues. Event-related
   brain potentials (ERPs) and facial electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded
   during a task in which participants viewed smiling, disgusted, and
   neutral faces after experiencing social exclusion or inclusion. Social
   exclusion was manipulated using a simple ball-tossing game (Cyberball),
   and need threat was assessed after the game. We found that zygomaticus
   major muscle activity, which reflects facial mimicry, was larger in
   response to smiling faces after exclusion than after inclusion. In
   addition, P1 amplitude, which reflects visual attention, was larger for
   disgusted faces than for neutral faces following social exclusion. N170
   amplitude, which reflects structural encoding of the face, was
   correlated with heightened need threat. These findings demonstrate that
   social exclusion induces immediate and rapid changes in attention,
   perception, and automatic behavior. These findings reflect the rapid and

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Intranasal oxytocin has been shown to alter self-perceptions of
   personality (e.g., more trusting, increased extraversion). To follow up
   these findings, we examined the acute effects of two doses of intranasal
   oxytocin (24 IU and 48 IU) on another form of self-referential
   cognition: autobiographical memory. Changes in autobiographical memory
   (personal memories for the past) could conceivably effect change in
   self-perception and consequently alter social behaviors. We predicted
   that oxytocin would increase the number of specific personal memories
   recalled, and promote the recall of positive social affiliation
   memories. Seventeen male participants self-administered a placebo or
   oxytocin (24 IU, 48 IU) using a nasal spray on three separate occasions
   in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, and within-subject experiment.
   Participants completed the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT) 110
   minutes later. Analyses revealed a quadratic dose-response curve for the
   effects of intranasal oxytocin on autobiographical memory recall. The 24
   IU dose, relative to the 48 IU dose and placebo, increased the number of
   specific personal memories recalled and promoted the recall of social
   affiliation memories that were rated more positively. The lack of effect
   with the 48 IU dose could be due to saturation of the oxytocin receptors
   at higher doses. Changes in autobiographical memory may be one mechanism

Abstract = {{It is now common practice, in digital communication, to use the
   character combination :-), known as an emoticon, to indicate a smiling
   face. Although emoticons are readily interpreted as smiling faces, it is
   unclear whether emoticons trigger face-specific mechanisms or whether
   separate systems are utilized. A hallmark of face perception is the
   utilization of regions in the occipitotemporal cortex, which are
   sensitive to configural processing. We recorded the N170 event-related
   potential to investigate the way in which emoticons are perceived.
   Inverting faces produces a larger and later N170 while inverting objects
   which are perceived featurally rather than configurally reduces the
   amplitude of the N170. We presented 20 participants with images of
   upright and inverted faces, emoticons and meaningless strings of
   characters. Emoticons showed a large amplitude N170 when upright and a
   decrease in amplitude when inverted, the opposite pattern to that shown
   by faces. This indicates that when upright, emoticons are processed in
   occipitotemporal sites similarly to faces due to their familiar
   configuration. However, the characters which indicate the physiognomic
   features of emoticons are not recognized by the more laterally placed
   facial feature detection systems used in processing inverted faces.}},

Abstract = {{Guilt, shame, and embarrassment are quintessential moral emotions with
   important regulatory functions for the individual and society. Moral
   emotions are, however, difficult to study with neuroimaging methods
   because their elicitation is more intricate than that of basic emotions.
   Here, using functional MRI (fMRI), we employed a novel social prejudice
   paradigm to examine specific brain regions associated with real-time
   moral emotion, focusing on guilt and related moral-negative emotions.
   The paradigm induced intense moral-negative emotion (primarily guilt) in
   22 low-prejudice individuals through preprogrammed feedback indicating
   implicit prejudice against Black and disabled people. fMRI data
   indicated that this experience of moral-negative emotion was associated
   with increased activity in anterior paralimbic structures, including the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula, in addition to
   areas associated with mentalizing, including the dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus. Of significance was
   prominent conflict-related activity in the supragenual ACC, which is
   consistent with theories proposing an association between acute guilt
   and behavioral inhibition. Finally, a significant negative association
   between self-reported guilt and neural activity in the pregenual ACC
   suggested a role of self-regulatory processes in response to
   moral-negative affect. These findings are consistent with the
   multifaceted self-regulatory functions of moral-negative emotions in
   social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Appraisal of fearful stimuli is an integral aspect of social cognition.
   Neural circuitry underlying this phenomenon has been well-described and
   encompasses a distributed network of affective and cognitive nodes.
   Interestingly, this ability to process fearful faces is impaired in
   Turner syndrome (TS), a genetic disorder of females in which all or part
   of an X chromosome is missing. However, neurofunctional correlates for
   this impairment have not been well-studied, particularly in young girls.
   Given that the core features of TS include X chromosome gene
   haploinsufficiency and secondary sex hormone deficiencies, investigation
   of fearful face processing may provide insights into the influence of X
   chromosome gene expression on this network. Therefore, we examined
   behavioral and neural responses during an explicit emotional face
   labeling task in 14 prepubertal girls with TS and 16 typically
   developing age-matched controls (6-13 years). We demonstrate that girls
   with TS have a specific impairment in the identification of fearful
   faces and show decreased activation in several cognitive control
   regions, including the anterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex,
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus. Our
   results indicate that aberrant functional activation in dorsal cognitive
   regions plays an integral role in appraisal of, and regulation of
   response to fear in TS.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive neuroscience has made considerable progress in understanding
   the neural architecture of human intelligence, identifying a broadly
   distributed network of frontal and parietal regions that support
   goal-directed, intelligent behavior. However, the contributions of this
   network to social and emotional aspects of intellectual function remain
   to be well characterized. Here we investigated the neural basis of
   emotional intelligence in 152 patients with focal brain injuries using
   voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Latent variable modeling was applied
   to obtain measures of emotional intelligence, general intelligence and
   personality from the Mayer, Salovey, Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test
   (MSCEIT), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the
   Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Inventory, respectively. Regression
   analyses revealed that latent scores for measures of general
   intelligence and personality reliably predicted latent scores for
   emotional intelligence. Lesion mapping results further indicated that
   these convergent processes depend on a shared network of frontal,
   temporal and parietal brain regions. The results support an integrative
   framework for understanding the architecture of executive, social and
   emotional processes and make specific recommendations for the
   interpretation and application of the MSCEIT to the study of emotional
   intelligence in health and disease.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated associations between delusions in
   psychotic disorders and abnormalities of brain areas involved in social
   cognition, including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior
   cingulate cortex, and lateral temporal cortex (LTC). General population
   studies have linked subclinical delusional thinking to impaired social
   cognition, raising the question of whether a specific pattern of brain
   activity during social perception is associated with delusional beliefs.
   Here, we tested the hypothesis that subclinical delusional thinking is
   associated with changes in neural function, while subjects made
   judgments about themselves or others {[}'social reflection' (SR)].
   Neural responses during SR and non-social tasks, as well as
   resting-state activity, were measured using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging in 22 healthy subjects. Delusional thinking was
   measured using the Peters et al. Delusions Inventory. Delusional
   thinking was negatively correlated with responses of the left LTC during
   SR (r = -0.61, P = 0.02, Bonferroni corrected), and connectivity between
   the left LTC and left ventral MPFC, and was positively correlated with
   connectivity between the left LTC and the right middle frontal and
   inferior temporal cortices. Thus, delusional thinking in the general
   population may be associated with reduced activity and aberrant
   functional connectivity of cortical areas involved in SR.}},

Abstract = {{Research on intertemporal behavior has emphasized trait-like variance.
   However, recent studies have begun to explore situational factors that
   affect intertemporal preference. In this study, we examined the
   associations between emotional primes and both behavior and brain
   function during intertemporal decision making. Twenty-two participants
   completed a dual task in which they were required to make intertemporal
   choices while holding an expressive face in memory. From trial-to-trial,
   the facial expression varied between three alternatives: (i) fearful,
   (ii) happy and (iii) neutral. Brain activity was recorded using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging for 16 participants. Behavioral
   data indicated that fearful (relative to happy) faces were associated
   with greater preference for larger but later rewards. During observation
   of fearful faces, greater signal change was observed in the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. During subsequent decision making, the
   fear prime was associated with greater signal increase in structures
   including the posterior sector of the anterior cingulate cortex.
   Individual differences in this activity correlated with the magnitude of
   the priming effect on behavior. These findings suggest that incidental
   emotions affect intertemporal choice. Increased farsightedness after the
   fear prime may be explained by an `inhibition spillover' effect.}},

Abstract = {{Group membership is an important aspect of our everyday behavior.
   Recently, we showed that existing relevant in-group labels increased
   activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) compared with
   out-group labels, suggesting a role of the MPFC in social
   categorization. However, the question still remains whether this
   increase in MPFC activation for in-group representation is solely
   related with previous experience with the in-group. To test this, we
   randomly assigned participants to a red or blue team and in a subsequent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment they categorized red
   and blue team words as belonging to either the in-group or the
   out-group. Results showed that even under these minimal conditions
   increased activation was found in the MPFC when participants indicated
   that they belonged to a group, as compared with when they did not. This
   effect was found to be associated with the level of group
   identification. These results confirm the role of MPFC in social
   categorization.}},

Abstract = {{Research has illustrated that the brain regions implicated in moral
   cognition comprise a robust and broadly distributed network. However,
   understanding how these brain regions interact and give rise to the
   complex interplay of cognitive processes underpinning human moral
   cognition is still in its infancy. We used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to examine patterns of activation for `difficult' and `easy'
   moral decisions relative to matched non-moral comparators. This revealed
   an activation pattern consistent with a relative functional double
   dissociation between the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and
   ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Difficult moral decisions
   activated bilateral TPJ and deactivated the vmPFC and OFC. In contrast,
   easy moral decisions revealed patterns of activation in the vmPFC and
   deactivation in bilateral TPJ and dorsolateral PFC. Together these
   results suggest that moral cognition is a dynamic process implemented by
   a distributed network that involves interacting, yet functionally
   dissociable networks.}},

Abstract = {{Mental effort is a limited resource which must be invested to perform
   mental tasks. The amount of mental effort investment that an individual
   experiences during task performance can be measured afterwards with the
   help of self-rating scales. Earlier research suggests that integration
   of information about somatic state changes is crucial for the
   self-evaluation of mental effort investment. Damage to the pathways
   which convey information about somatic state changes can lead to an
   inability to self-evaluate mental effort investment, while conceptually
   similar evaluations of task difficulty can still be performed. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activation,
   while subjects rated their mental effort investment and the difficulty
   of a previously performed task. Our results show stronger activation of
   the left anterior insular cortex (aIC) during evaluation of mental
   effort. Additionally, the activity in left aIC during task performance
   was modulated by changes in task demand in a similar way as the
   self-ratings of mental effort. We argue that aIC does not only play a
   role in the integration of self-related information during
   self-evaluation of mental effort investment, but that left aIC might
   also be involved in the experience of mental effort during task
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined sex differences in categorization of facial emotions
   and activation of brain regions supportive of those classifications. In
   Experiment 1, performance on the Facial Emotion Perception Test (FEPT)
   was examined among 75 healthy females and 63 healthy males. Females were
   more accurate in the categorization of fearful expressions relative to
   males. In Experiment 2, 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging data
   were acquired for a separate sample of 21 healthy females and 17 healthy
   males while performing the FEPT. Activation to neutral facial
   expressions was subtracted from activation to sad, angry, fearful and
   happy facial expressions. Although females and males demonstrated
   activation in some overlapping regions for all emotions, many regions
   were exclusive to females or males. For anger, sad and happy, males
   displayed a larger extent of activation than did females, and greater
   height of activation was detected in diffuse cortical and subcortical
   regions. For fear, males displayed greater activation than females only
   in right postcentral gyri. With one exception in females, performance
   was not associated with activation. Results suggest that females and
   males process emotions using different neural pathways, and these
   differences cannot be explained by performance variations.}},

Abstract = {{People perceive and evaluate others on the basis of social categories,
   such as race, gender and age. Initial processing of targets in terms of
   visually salient social categories is often characterized as inevitable.
   In the current study, we investigated the influence of processing goals
   on the representation of race in the visual processing stream.
   Participants were assigned to one of two mixed-race teams and
   categorized faces according to their group membership or skin color. To
   assess neural representations of race, we employed multivariate pattern
   analysis to examined neural activity related to the presentation of
   Black and White faces. As predicted, patterns of neural activity within
   the early visual cortex and fusiform gyri (FG) could decode the race of
   face stimuli above chance and were moderated by processing goals. Race
   decoding in early visual cortex was above chance in both categorization
   tasks and below chance in a prefrontal control region. More importantly,
   race decoding was greater in the FG during the group membership vs skin
   color categorization task. The results suggest that, ironically,
   explicit racial categorization can diminish the representation of race
   in the FG. These findings suggest that representations of race are
   dynamic, reflecting current processing goals.}},

Abstract = {{Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have reported
   activation of primary and secondary somatosensory cortices when
   participants observe another person or object being touched. In this
   study, we used event-related potentials to examine the nature and
   time-course of the neural mechanisms associated with the observation of
   humans and non-human objects being touched. Participants were presented
   with short video clips of a human arm or a non-human cylindrical object
   being touched by an object, compared with an object moving in front of
   the arms or cylinders without touching them. Touch vs non-touch effects
   were observed in the amplitudes of the N100 and N250 components, as well
   as a late slow wave component (500-600 ms), measured from electrodes
   over primary somatosensory cortex. Human vs non-human stimulus effects
   were reflected in the latencies of the N100, P170 and N250 components
   recorded over somatosensory cortex, as well as the temporal-parietal
   visual-perceptual N170 and N250 components. These findings suggest that
   human and non-human touch observation are associated with somatosensory
   processing at both an early sensory-perceptual stage and a relatively
   late cognitive stage, both preceding and following the perceptual
   encoding of the humanness of stimuli that typically occurs in
   extrastriate visual areas.}},

Abstract = {{It is ecologically adaptive that the amount of effort invested to
   achieve a reward increases the relevance of the resulting outcome. Here,
   we investigated the effect of effort on activity in reward and loss

   In total, 28 subjects were endowed with monetary rewards of randomly
   varying magnitude after performing arithmetic calculations that were
   either difficult (high effort), easy (low effort) or already solved (no
   effort). Subsequently, a forced donation took place, where a varying
   part of the endowment was transferred to a charity organization, causing
   a loss for the subject. Results show that reward magnitude positively
   modulates activity in reward-processing brain areas (subgenual anterior
   cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens) only in the high effort
   condition. Furthermore, anterior insular activity was positively
   modulated by loss magnitude only after high effort. The results strongly
   suggest an increasing relevance of outcomes with increasing previous
   effort.}},

Abstract = {{To understand social interactions, we must decode dynamic social cues
   from seen faces. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study the
   neural responses underlying the perception of emotional expressions and
   gaze direction changes as depicted in an interaction between two agents.
   Subjects viewed displays of paired faces that first established a social
   scenario of gazing at each other (mutual attention) or gazing laterally
   together (deviated group attention) and then dynamically displayed
   either an angry or happy facial expression. The initial gaze change
   elicited a significantly larger M170 under the deviated than the mutual
   attention scenario. At around 400 ms after the dynamic emotion onset,
   responses at posterior MEG sensors differentiated between emotions, and
   between 1000 and 2200 ms, left posterior sensors were additionally
   modulated by social scenario. Moreover, activity on right anterior
   sensors showed both an early and prolonged interaction between emotion
   and social scenario. These results suggest that activity in right
   anterior sensors reflects an early integration of emotion and social
   attention, while posterior activity first differentiated between
   emotions only, supporting the view of a dual route for emotion
   processing. Altogether, our data demonstrate that both transient and
   sustained neurophysiological responses underlie social processing when
   observing interactions between others.}},

Abstract = {{Voters tend to misattribute issue positions to political candidates that
   are consistent with their partisan affiliation, even though these
   candidates have never explicitly stated or endorsed such stances. The
   prevailing explanation in political science is that voters misattribute
   candidates' issue positions because they use their political knowledge
   to make educated but incorrect guesses. We suggest that voter errors can
   also stem from a different source: false memories. The current study
   examined event-related potential (ERP) responses to misattributed and
   accurately remembered candidate issue information. We report here that
   ERP responses to misattributed information can elicit memory signals
   similar to that of correctly remembered old information-a pattern
   consistent with a false memory rather than educated guessing
   interpretation of these misattributions. These results suggest that some
   types of voter misinformation about candidates may be harder to correct
   than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and social anxiety disorder (SAD) are
   both characterized by social dysfunction, but no study to date has
   compared neural responses to social rewards in ASDs and SAD. Neural
   responses during social and non-social reward anticipation and outcomes
   were examined in individuals with ASD (n = 16), SAD (n = 15) and a
   control group (n = 19) via functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Analyses modeling all three groups revealed increased nucleus accumbens
   (NAc) activation in SAD relative to ASD during monetary reward
   anticipation, whereas both the SAD and ASD group demonstrated decreased
   bilateral NAc activation relative to the control group during social
   reward anticipation. During reward outcomes, the SAD group did not
   differ significantly from the other two groups in ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex activation to either reward type. Analyses comparing
   only the ASD and SAD groups revealed greater bilateral amygdala
   activation to social rewards in SAD relative to ASD during both
   anticipation and outcome phases, and the magnitude of left amygdala
   hyperactivation in the SAD group during social reward anticipation was
   significantly correlated with the severity of trait anxiety symptoms.
   Results suggest reward network dysfunction to both monetary and social
   rewards in SAD and ASD during reward anticipation and outcomes, but that
   NAc hypoactivation during monetary reward anticipation differentiates
   ASD from SAD.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that the effectiveness with which unpleasant events
   are encoded into memory is related to brain activity set in train before
   the events. Here, we assessed whether encoding-related activity before
   an aversive event can be modulated by emotion regulation. Electrical
   brain activity was recorded from the scalps of healthy women while they
   performed an incidental encoding task on randomly intermixed unpleasant
   and neutral visual scenes. A cue presented 1.5 s before each picture
   indicated the upcoming valence. In half of the blocks of trials, the
   instructions emphasized to let emotions arise in a natural way. In the
   other half, participants were asked to decrease their emotional response
   by adopting the perspective of a detached observer. Memory for the
   scenes was probed 1 day later with a recognition memory test. Brain
   activity before unpleasant scenes predicted later memory of the scenes,
   but only when participants felt their emotions and did not detach from
   them. The findings indicate that emotion regulation can eliminate the
   influence of anticipatory brain activity on memory encoding. This may be
   relevant for the understanding and treatment of psychiatric diseases
   with a memory component.}},

Abstract = {{Event-related potential (ERP) approaches to social cognitive and
   affective neuroscience (SCAN) are not as widely used as other
   neuroimaging techniques, yet they offer several unique advantages. In
   particular, the high temporal resolution of ERP measures of neural
   activity make them ideally suited for studying the dynamic interplay of
   rapidly unfolding cognitive and affective processes. In this article, we
   highlight the utility of ERP methods for scientists investigating
   questions of SCAN. We begin with a brief description of the
   physiological basis of ERPs and discussion of methodological practices.
   We then discuss how ERPs may be used to address a range of questions
   concerning social perception, social cognition, attitudes, affect and
   self-regulation, with examples of research that has used the ERP
   approach to contribute important theoretical advances in these areas.
   Whether used alone or in combination with other techniques, the ERP is
   an indispensable part of the social and affective neuroscientist's
   methodological toolkit.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the network of brain regions activated prior to
   explicit awareness of emotionally salient social stimuli. We
   investigated this in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study using
   a technique that combined elements of binocular rivalry and motion flash
   suppression in order to prevent awareness of fearful faces and houses.
   We found increased left amygdala and fusiform gyrus activation for
   fearful faces compared to houses, despite suppression from awareness.
   Psychophysiological interaction analyses showed that amygdala activation
   was associated with task-specific (fearful faces greater than houses)
   modulation of an attention network, including bilateral pulvinar,
   bilateral insula, left frontal eye fields, left intraparietal sulcus and
   early visual cortex. Furthermore, we report an unexpected main effect of
   increased left parietal cortex activation associated with suppressed
   fearful faces compared to suppressed houses. This parietal finding is
   the first report of increased dorsal stream activation for a social
   object despite suppression, which suggests that information can reach
   parietal cortex for a class of emotionally salient social objects, even
   in the absence of awareness.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has revealed that people value morality as a more

   tested whether people adjust their less explicit behavior more to moral
   than competence values. Participants performed an Implicit Association
   Test (IAT) that was either framed as a test of their morality or as a
   test of their competence. The behavioral results revealed a smaller IAT
   effect (i.e. a weaker negative implicit bias toward Muslims) in the
   morality condition than in the competence condition. Moreover,
   event-related potentials indicated increased social categorization of
   faces (as indexed by the N1 and P150) and enhanced conflict-and error
   monitoring (N450 and error-related negativity) in the morality condition
   compared to the competence condition. These findings indicate that an
   emphasis on morality can increase attentional and motivational processes

Abstract = {{In this study, a functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm
   originally employed by Takahashi et al. was adapted to look for
   emotion-specific differences in functional brain activity within a
   healthy German sample (N = 14), using shame-and guilt-related stimuli
   and neutral stimuli. Activations were found for both of these emotions
   in the temporal lobe (shame condition: anterior cingulate cortex,
   parahippocampal gyrus; guilt condition: fusiform gyrus, middle temporal
   gyrus). Specific activations were found for shame in the frontal lobe
   (medial and inferior frontal gyrus), and for guilt in the amygdala and
   insula. This is consistent with Takahashi et al.'s results obtained for
   a Japanese sample (using Japanese stimuli), which showed activations in
   the fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, middle occipital gyrus and
   parahippocampal gyrus. During the imagination of shame, frontal and
   temporal areas (e. g. middle frontal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus)
   were responsive regardless of gender. In the guilt condition, women only
   activate temporal regions, whereas men showed additional frontal and
   occipital activation as well as a responsive amygdala. The results
   suggest that shame and guilt share some neural networks, as well as
   having individual areas of activation. It can be concluded that frontal,
   temporal and limbic areas play a prominent role in the generation of
   moral feelings.}},

Abstract = {{Lifetime experiences shape people's attitudes toward sexual stimuli.
   Visual sexual stimulation (VSS), for instance, may be perceived as
   pleasurable by some, but as disgusting or ambiguous by others. VSS
   depicting explicit penile-vaginal penetration (PEN) is relevant in this
   respect, because the act of penetration is a core sexual activity. In
   this study, 20 women without sexual complaints participated. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and a single-target implicit
   association task to investigate how brain responses to PEN were
   modulated by the initial associations in memory (PEN-'hot' vs
   PEN-disgust) with such hardcore pornographic stimuli. Many brain areas
   responded to PEN in the same way they responded to disgust stimuli, and
   PEN-induced brain activity was prone to modulation by subjective disgust
   ratings toward PEN stimuli. The relative implicit PEN-disgust (relative
   to PEN-'hot') associations exclusively modulated PEN-induced brain
   responses: comparatively negative (PEN-disgust) implicit associations
   with pornography predicted the strongest PEN-related responses in the
   basal forebrain (including nucleus accumbens and bed nucleus of stria
   terminalis), midbrain and amygdala. Since these areas are often
   implicated in visual sexual processing, the present findings should be
   taken as a warning: apparently their involvement may also indicate a
   negative or ambivalent attitude toward sexual stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{While impairments in emotion recognition are consistently reported in
   schizophrenia, there is some debate on the experience of emotion. Only
   few studies investigated neural correlates of emotional experience in
   schizophrenia. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study
   compared a standard visual mood induction paradigm with an audiovisual
   method aimed at eliciting emotions more automatically. To investigate
   the interplay of sensory, cognitive and emotional mechanisms during
   emotion experience, we examined connectivity patterns between brain
   areas. Sixteen schizophrenia patients and sixteen healthy subjects
   participated in two different mood inductions (visual and audiovisual)
   that were administered for different emotions (happiness, sadness and
   neutral). Confirming the dissociation of behavioral and neural
   correlates of emotion experience, patients rated their mood similarly to
   healthy subjects but showed differences in neural activations. Sensory
   brain areas were activated less, increased activity emerged in higher
   cortical areas, particularly during audiovisual stimulation.
   Connectivity was increased between primary and secondary sensory
   processing areas in schizophrenia. These findings support the hypothesis
   of a deficit in filtering and processing sensory information alongside
   increased higher-order cognitive effort compensating for perception
   deficits in the affective domain. This may suffice to recover emotion
   experience in ratings of clinically stable patients but may fail during
   acute psychosis.}},

Abstract = {{An individual's affective style is influenced by many things, including
   the manner in which an individual responds to an emotional challenge.
   Emotional response is composed of a number of factors, two of which are
   the initial reactivity to an emotional stimulus and the subsequent
   recovery once the stimulus terminates or ceases to be relevant. However,
   most neuroimaging studies examining emotional processing in humans focus
   on the magnitude of initial reactivity to a stimulus rather than the
   prolonged response. In this study, we use functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to study the time course of amygdala activity in healthy adults
   in response to presentation of negative images. We split the amygdala
   time course into an initial reactivity period and a recovery period
   beginning after the offset of the stimulus. We find that initial
   reactivity in the amygdala does not predict trait measures of affective
   style. Conversely, amygdala recovery shows predictive power such that
   slower amygdala recovery from negative images predicts greater trait
   neuroticism, in addition to lower levels of likability of a set of
   social stimuli (neutral faces). These data underscore the importance of
   taking into account temporal dynamics when studying affective processing
   using neuroimaging.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral approach and avoidance are fundamental to the experience of

   sought to address whether traits related to behavioral approach or
   avoidance influence responses to anger stimuli using multiple measures:
   ERP, electroencephalographic (EEG) alpha-asymmetry and self-report.
   After completing the behavioral inhibition system/behavioral approach
   system (BIS/BAS) scales, participants viewed anger pictures and neutral
   pictures. BAS predicted larger late positive potentials (LPPs) to anger
   pictures, but not to neutral pictures. In addition, BAS predicted
   greater left-frontal asymmetry to anger pictures. Moreover, larger LPPs
   to anger pictures related to greater left-frontal EEG asymmetry during
   anger pictures. These results suggest that trait approach motivation
   relates to neurophysiological responses of anger.}},

Abstract = {{Both behavioral and neuroimaging evidence support a female advantage in
   the perception of human faces. Here we explored the possibility that
   this relationship may be partially mediated by female sex hormones by
   investigating the relationship between the brain's response to faces and
   the use of oral contraceptives, as well as the phase of the menstrual
   cycle. First, functional magnetic resonance images were acquired in 20
   young women {[}10 freely cycling and 10 taking oral contraception (OC)]
   during two phases of their cycle: mid-cycle and menstruation. We found
   stronger neural responses to faces in the right fusiform face area (FFA)
   in women taking oral contraceptives (vs freely cycling women) and during
   mid-cycle (vs menstruation) in both groups. Mean blood oxygenation
   level-dependent response in both left and right FFA increased as
   function of the duration of OC use. Next, this relationship between the
   use of OC and FFA response was replicated in an independent sample of
   110 adolescent girls. Finally in a parallel behavioral study carried out
   in another sample of women, we found no evidence of differences in the
   pattern of eye movements while viewing faces between freely cycling
   women vs those taking oral contraceptives. The imaging findings might
   indicate enhanced processing of social cues in women taking OC and women

Abstract = {{The fundamentally social nature of humans is revealed in their
   exquisitely high sensitivity to potentially negative evaluations held by
   others. At present, however, little is known about neurocortical
   correlates of the response to such social-evaluative threat. Here, we
   addressed this issue by showing that mere exposure to an image of a
   watching face is sufficient to automatically evoke a social-evaluative
   threat for those who are relatively high in interdependent
   self-construal. Both European American and Asian participants performed
   a flanker task while primed with a face (vs control) image. The relative
   increase of the error-related negativity (ERN) in the face (vs control)
   priming condition became more pronounced as a function of interdependent
   (vs independent) self-construal. Relative to European Americans, Asians
   were more interdependent and, as predicted, they showed a reliably
   stronger ERN in the face (vs control) priming condition. Our findings
   suggest that the ERN can serve as a robust empirical marker of
   self-threat that is closely modulated by socio-cultural variables.}},

Abstract = {{Humans and other primates shift their attention to follow the gaze of
   others {[}gaze following (GF)]. This behavior is a foundational
   component of joint attention, which is severely disrupted in
   neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Both
   cortical and subcortical pathways have been implicated in GF, but their
   contributions remain largely untested. While the proposed subcortical
   pathway hinges crucially on the amygdala, the cortical pathway is
   thought to require perceptual processing by a region in the posterior
   superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). To determine whether pSTS is necessary
   for typical GF behavior, we engaged rhesus macaques in a reward
   discrimination task confounded by leftward-and rightward-facing social
   distractors following saline or muscimol injections into left pSTS. We
   found that reversible inactivation of left pSTS with muscimol strongly
   suppressed GF, as assessed by reduced influence of observed gaze on
   target choices and saccadic reaction times. These findings demonstrate
   that activity in pSTS is required for normal GF by primates.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of interpersonal power on
   co-operative performance. We used a paired electro-encephalogram
   paradigm: pairs of participants performed an attention task, followed by
   feedback indicating monetary loss or gain on every trial. Participants
   were randomly allocated to the power-holder, subordinate or neutral
   group by creating different levels of control over how a joint monetary
   reward would be allocated. We found that power was associated with
   reduced behavioural accuracy. Event-related potential analysis showed
   that power-holders devoted less motivational resources to their targets
   than did subordinates or neutrals, but did not differ at the level of
   early conflict detection. Their feedback potential results showed a
   greater expectation of rewards but reduced subjective magnitude
   attributed to losses. Subordinates, on the other hand, were
   asymmetrically sensitive to power-holders' targets. They expected fewer
   rewards, but attributed greater significance to losses. Our study shows
   that power corrupts balanced co-operation with subordinates.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the neural processes that characterize elite performers is
   a first step to develop a neuroscience model that can be used to improve
   performance in stressful circumstances. Adventure racers are elite
   athletes that operate in small teams in the context of environmental and
   physical extremes. In particular, awareness of team member's emotional
   status is critical to the team's ability to navigate high-magnitude
   stressors. Thus, this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study
   examined the hypothesis that adventure racers would show altered emotion
   processing in brain areas that are important for resilience and social
   awareness. Elite adventure racers (n = 10) were compared with healthy
   volunteers (n = 12) while performing a simple emotion face-processing
   (modified Hariri) task during fMRI. Across three types of emotional
   faces, adventure racers showed greater activation in right insula, left
   amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate. Additionally, compared with
   healthy controls adventure racers showed attenuated right medial
   prefrontal cortex activation. These results are consistent with previous
   studies showing elite performers differentially activate neural
   substrates underlying interoception. Thus, adventure racers
   differentially deploy brain resources in an effort to recognize and
   process the internal sensations associated with emotions in others,
   which could be advantageous for team-based performance under stress.}},

Abstract = {{There are marked individual differences in the pattern of cortical
   (sulcogyral) folding in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and there is a
   growing literature suggesting that these individual differences are
   associated with risk for psychotic disorders. To date, however, no study
   has investigated whether OFC folding patterns are associated with
   broader risk factors relevant to a range of psychopathology. This study
   helps address this knowledge gap by examining whether OFC sulcogyral
   folding patterns are associated with putative risk factors, specifically
   affective temperament and psychiatric symptoms, in a large community
   sample (N = 152) of adolescents. Results showed that the most common
   pattern of folding ('Type I', marked by discontinuity of the medial
   orbital sulcus and continuity of the lateral orbital sulcus) was
   associated with low levels of Surgency, high levels of Negative
   Affectivity (in girls) and higher depressive symptoms. This pattern was
   also associated with reduced thickness of OFC gray matter. Overall, the
   findings, combined with previous work, suggest some specificity of
   neurodevelopmental risk for different types of psychopathology. Thus,
   these results have the potential to inform the early identification of
   at-risk individuals.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides exploratory evidence about how behavioral and neural
   responses to standard moral dilemmas are influenced by religious belief.
   Eleven Catholics and 13 Atheists (all female) judged 48 moral dilemmas.
   Differential neural activity between the two groups was found in
   precuneus and in prefrontal, frontal and temporal regions. Furthermore,
   a double dissociation showed that Catholics recruited different areas
   for deontological (precuneus; temporoparietal junction) and utilitarian
   moral judgments {[}dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); temporal
   poles], whereas Atheists did not (superior parietal gyrus for both types
   of judgment). Finally, we tested how both groups responded to personal
   and impersonal moral dilemmas: Catholics showed enhanced activity in
   DLPFC and posterior cingulate cortex during utilitarian moral judgments
   to impersonal moral dilemmas and enhanced responses in anterior
   cingulate cortex and superior temporal sulcus during deontological moral
   judgments to personal moral dilemmas. Our results indicate that moral
   judgment can be influenced by an acquired set of norms and conventions
   transmitted through religious indoctrination and practice. Catholic
   individuals may hold enhanced awareness of the incommensurability
   between two unequivocal doctrines of the Catholic belief set, triggered
   explicitly in a moral dilemma: help and care in all circumstances-but
   thou shalt not kill.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{The prefrontal cortex (PFC), especially the medial sector, plays a
   crucial role in emotional processing. Damage to this region results in
   impaired processing of emotional information, perhaps attributable to an
   inability to initiate and maintain attention toward emotional materials,
   a process that is normally automatic. Childhood onset damage to the PFC
   impairs emotional processing more than adult-onset PFC damage. The aim
   of this work was to study the involvement of the PFC in attention to
   emotional stimuli, and to explore how age at lesion onset affects this
   involvement. To address these issues, we studied both the emotional and
   attentional modulation of the startle reflex. Our sample was composed of
   4 patients with childhood-onset PFC damage, 6 patients with adult-onset
   PFC damage, and 10 healthy comparison participants. Subjects viewed 54
   affective pictures; acoustic startle probes were presented at 300 ms
   after picture onset in 18 pictures (as an index of attentional
   modulation) and at 3,800 ms after picture onset in 18 pictures (as an
   index of emotional modulation). Childhood-onset PFC patients did not
   show attentional or emotional modulation of the response, in contrast to
   adult-onset PFC damage and comparison participants. Early onset damage
   to the PFC results, therefore, in more severe dysfunction in the
   processing of affective stimuli than adult-onset PFC damage, perhaps
   reflecting limited plasticity in the neural systems that support these
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive delay discounting (DD) has been related to various maladaptive
   behaviors and may stem from a myopic focus on immediate gratification.
   Neuroimaging studies have shown that episodic future thinking (EFT)
   -vivid mental simulation of future experiences-may reduce DD by
   promoting consideration of delayed outcomes. However, the EFT
   manipulations in these experiments may have induced positive affect,
   which could independently enhance executive functions that facilitate
   self-regulation. To clarify the mechanism of this effect, 87
   participants were randomized to visualize neutral- or positive-valenced
   events expected to occur in the present or in the future while
   completing a standardized DD questionnaire. Working memory capacity,
   inhibitory control, the genotypes of 3 functional dopaminergic
   polymorphisms (DRD1 rs686, DRD2 rs1800497, and COMT rs4680), as well as
   an additive dopamine genetic risk score were assessed as potential
   moderators. The results indicate that EFT reduces DD primarily by
   shifting the time perspective of intertemporal decision-making, and that
   this effect is moderated by working memory capacity. In addition,
   positive episodic thinking may independently attenuate the protective
   effects of high working memory capacity, high inhibitory control, and
   lower dopamine genetic risk scores on DD. The current findings dovetail
   with previous research to suggest that the time perspective and
   emotional valence of episodic thinking may dynamically shape
   intertemporal choice, perhaps in part by transiently modulating
   executive function and dopaminergic neurotransmission.}},

Title = {{Verbal Priming and Taste Sensitivity Make Moral Transgressions Gross}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{20-28}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The aims of the present study were to assess whether: (a) visceral and
   moral disgust share a common oral origin (taste); (b) moral
   transgressions that are also viscerally involving are evaluated
   accordingly as a function of individual differences in taste
   sensitivity; (c) verbal priming interacts with taste sensitivity to
   alter how disgust is experienced in moral transgressions; and (d)
   whether gender moderates these effects. Standard tests of disgust
   sensitivity, a questionnaire developed for this research assessing
   different types of moral transgressions (nonvisceral, implied-visceral,
   visceral) with the terms ``angry{''} and ``grossed-out,{''} and a taste
   sensitivity test of 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) were administered to 102
   participants. Results confirmed past findings that the more sensitive to
   PROP a participant was the more disgusted they were by visceral, but not
   moral, disgust elicitors. Importantly, the findings newly revealed that
   taste sensitivity had no bearing on evaluations of moral transgressions,
   regardless of their visceral nature, when ``angry{''} was the emotion
   primed. However, when ``grossed-out{''} was primed for evaluating moral
   violations, the more intense PROP tasted to a participant the more
   ``grossed-out{''} they were by all transgressions. Women were generally
   more disgust sensitive and morally condemning than men, but disgust
   test, transgression type, and priming scale modulated these effects. The
   present findings support the proposition that moral and visceral disgust
   do not share a common oral origin, but show that linguistic priming can
   transform a moral transgression into a viscerally repulsive event and
   that susceptibility to this priming varies as a function of an
   individual's sensitivity to the origins of visceral disgust-bitter
   taste.}},

Abstract = {{Measures of human mental development suggest that behavioral skills
   displayed during early life can predict an individual's subsequent
   cognitive performance. Support for this draws from longitudinal studies
   that reveal compelling within-subject correlations during childhood. If
   this idea applies across the life span, then correlations in performance
   should persist into adulthood. Here, we address this prediction in
   juvenile and adult gerbils by evaluating within-subject measures of
   auditory learning and perception. Animals were trained and tested as
   juveniles on either an amplitude modulation ( AM) or a frequency
   modulation ( FM) detection task. Measures of learning and perception
   obtained from juveniles were then compared to similar measures obtained
   when each subject was tested in adulthood on either the same task or the
   untrained task. For animals trained and tested on the AM detection task
   as juveniles and adults, there was no correlation between juvenile and
   adult learning metrics, or perceptual sensitivity. For animals trained
   and tested on FM detection as juveniles, we observed a significant
   relationship to their adult performance. Juveniles that performed the
   best on FM detection were the poorest at AM detection, and the best at
   FM detection, when tested as adults. Thus, across-age correlations for
   sensory and cognitive measures, obtained during development and in
   adulthood, depend heavily on the specific type of developmental
   experience and the outcome measure.}},

Abstract = {{Two commonly accepted functions of the mammalian hippocampus are the
   processing of spatial information and behavioral inhibition. Although
   there is clear evidence that the avian hippocampus is also critical for
   the processing of spatial information, there is a dearth of evidence
   that it plays a role in behavioral inhibition. In Experiment 1, the
   effect of hippocampal lesions on behavioral inhibition in pigeons was
   assessed. Control and hippocampal lesioned pigeons were trained to peck
   stimuli that were associated with one of three probabilities of
   reinforcement (40\%, 70\%, or 100\%). The number of pecks that control
   pigeons distributed to each stimulus was directly related to its
   respective probability of reinforcement. In contrast, hippocampal
   lesioned pigeons distributed their pecks evenly across the three
   stimuli. In Experiment 2, we tested whether these pigeons also displayed
   the well-accepted spatial deficit. Consistent with previous work,
   control pigeons acquired the radial arm maze in significantly fewer
   trials than the hippocampal lesioned pigeons. Together, Experiments 1
   and 2 demonstrate that, much like the mammalian hippocampus, the avian
   hippocampus is critical to behavioral inhibition and spatial processing.}},

Abstract = {{Monoaminergic neurotransmitters regulate different components of sexual
   behaviors, but how the different monoaminergic cell groups selectively
   regulate these behaviors is not well understood. We examined the
   potential contribution of these different cell groups in the control of
   different aspects of sexual behaviors in male and female quail. We used
   double-label immunohistochemistry, labeling the protein product of the
   immediate early gene, Fos, along with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) or
   tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), markers for catecholaminergic or
   indolaminergic cells, respectively. Rhythmic Cloacal Sphincter Movements
   (RCSM) were recorded as a measure of male appetitive sexual behavior.
   Consummatory sexual behaviors were evaluated based on the
   species-typical copulation sequence. Enhanced Fos expression in the
   medial preoptic nucleus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis was
   observed in association with both physical and visual contact to the
   opposite sex for males, but not for females. Fos induction associated
   with physical contact was observed in the ventral tegmental area and
   anterior periaqueductal gray in both sexes. In males only, the number of
   Fos-immunoreactive (ir) cells increased in the visual contact condition
   in these 2 dopaminergic cell groups, however no significant effect was
   observed for double-labeled TH-Fos-ir cells. In addition, consummatory
   but not appetitive sexual behavior increased Fos expression in TPH-ir
   cells in the raphe pallidus of males. This increase following physical
   but not visual contact agrees with the notion that activation of the
   serotoninergic system is implicated in the development of sexual
   satiation but not activated by simply viewing a female, in contrast to
   the dopaminergic system.}},

Abstract = {{The nonapeptides oxytocin and vasopressin are believed to be involved in
   affiliation across species, but converging evidence is lacking. In
   monogamous zebra finches, oxytocin antagonists decrease pairing. The
   goal of the present study was to test if this relationship is
   bidirectional. We predicted that pairing would increase mesotocin (MT)
   and vasotocin (VT) mRNA (avian homologues of oxytocin and vasopressin)
   at nonapeptide neurosecretory sites: the paraventrivular nucleus (PVN)
   of the hypothalamus, which contains both MT and VT, and the bed nucleus
   of the stria terminalis (BSTm), which contains VT. To test our
   hypotheses, zebra finches of both sexes paired for 48 hr or 2 weeks in a
   naturalistic choice paradigm. Birds that did not pair or were not given
   the opportunity to pair were included as control groups. Pairing
   increased VT and MT mRNA in the PVN compared to both control groups. In
   the BSTm, animals paired for 48 hr had more cells expressing VT mRNA
   than did animals not given the opportunity to pair, and males had higher
   VT mRNA than did females. In males, singing primarily explained
   variations in MT mRNA, as well as VT mRNA in both the PVN and BSTm. In
   females, pairing behaviors explained variations in MT, but did not
   explain variations in VT in either brain region. Our results provide
   evidence that the relationship between nonapeptides and pairing are
   bidirectional and may be sexually differentiated.}},

Abstract = {{Initially neutral conditioned stimuli (CSs) paired with food often
   acquire motivating properties. For example, CS presentations may enhance
   the rate of instrumental responding that normally earns that food reward
   (Pavlovian-instrumental transfer), or potentiate consumption of that
   food when the animal is food-sated. Recent evidence suggests that cues
   associated with the withdrawal of food and food cues (interruption
   stimuli or ISs) may also potentiate feeding, despite exhibiting some
   characteristics of conditioned inhibition. Here, we compared the ability
   of CSs and ISs to modulate both eating food and working for it. If CSs
   and ISs potentiate eating food by controlling a similar incentive state,
   both types of cues might also be expected to enhance instrumental
   responding for food. Although we found substantial potentiation of
   feeding by both CSs and ISs, and powerful enhancement of instrumental
   responding by a CS, we found no evidence for such instrumental
   enhancement by an IS. Furthermore, although an IS produced more FOS
   expression in the amygdala central nucleus (CeA) than either a
   previously reinforced CS or a control stimulus after a test for
   potentiated feeding, an intact CeA was unnecessary for potentiation of
   feeding by either a CS or an IS. Nevertheless, as in previous studies,
   CeA was critical to the ability of a CS to enhance instrumental
   responding. Implications for understanding the nature and basis for
   incentive learning are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The retrieval of extinction memories is dependent on contextual cues
   associated with extinction training. Various forms of response
   restoration after extinction, such as renewal, reinstatement, and
   spontaneous recovery, can be viewed as failures to retrieve an
   extinction memory. It follows that provision of a cue to aid retrieval
   of the extinction memory should attenuate response restoration or
   relapse after extinction. Six experiments studied the impact of an
   extinction retrieval cue (E-cue) on restoration of extinguished alcohol
   seeking in rats. Rats were trained to respond for alcoholic beer and
   this responding was then extinguished. Extinction training was
   accompanied by noncontingent presentations of a 60-s auditory stimulus
   that served as an E-cue. Presentations of the E-cue on test attenuated
   ABA renewal of alcohol seeking (Experiment 1) whereas an equally
   familiar cue from training had no effect (Experiment 2). Presentations
   of the E-cue had no effect on the reacquisition of alcohol seeking
   (Experiment 3). The same effects on ABA renewal (Experiments 4 and 6)
   and reacquisition (Experiment 5) were observed when the E-cue was
   trained in a response contingent manner during extinction. Taken
   together these findings show that presentations of an E-cue are able to
   attenuate the renewal but not reacquisition of alcohol seeking and are
   interpreted with reference to Bouton's model of extinction (Bouton,

Abstract = {{Whereas hippocampal lesions clearly impair performance on aversive trace
   conditioning tasks, recent evidence suggests that such lesions do not
   affect performance on appetitive trace conditioning tasks with trace
   intervals from 2 seconds up to 20 seconds. The current study first
   demonstrated that intact rats can learn trace conditioning tasks with
   longer trace intervals (8 s) when the average intertrial interval
   (intertrial interval {[}ITI]) was lengthened from 150-s to 300-s. In two
   subsequent experiments with longer ITIs (420-s and 825-s),
   hippocampal-lesioned rats performed similarly to intact controls in an
   appetitive trace conditioning task with 20-s trace interval but were
   impaired in an appetitive trace conditioning task with a 60-s trace
   interval. These results suggest that the training ITI and the trace
   interval are important variables to consider in appetitive trace
   conditioning, and the hippocampus may play an important role in
   appetitive trace conditioning when the ITI and trace intervals are both
   sufficiently long.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research indicates that the neuropeptide oxytocin and the gene
   for the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) have been implicated in the modulation
   of various social behaviors, including those related to empathy and
   sensitivity to others. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that
   genetic variation in OXTR is associated with autonomic reactions when
   perceiving others in distress. We also explore the possibility that
   individual disposition in empathic concern would differ by OXTR
   genotype. To address these questions, 51 male participants (18-35years
   of age), genotyped for OXTR rs53576, viewed a social interaction
   containing high levels of individual distress and apparent physical
   pain. Electrodermal activity, a measure of sympathetic nervous system
   activity, was collected during the presentation of the stimuli.
   Participants also completed a self-report dispositional measure of
   empathy prior to starting the study and provided ratings of arousal
   while viewing the stimuli. OXTR variant rs53576 GG individuals showed
   increased levels of sympathetic and subjective arousal in response to
   the stimuli compared to A allele carriers. GG homozygotes also expressed
   greater levels of empathic concern. These findings support the
   importance of the oxytocin receptor variation in emotional and
   physiological reactions to the affective experiences of other
   conspecifics.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{When people are confronted with social dilemmas, their decision-making
   strategies tend to be associated with individual social preferences;
   prosocials have an intrinsic willingness to cooperate, while proselfs
   need extrinsic motivators signaling personal gain. In this study, the
   biological roots for the proselfs/prosocials concept are explored by
   investigating the neural correlates of cooperative versus defect
   decisions when participants engage in a series of one-shot, anonymous
   prisoner's dilemma situations. Our data are in line with previous
   studies showing that prosocials activate several social cognition
   regions of the brain more than proselfs (here: medial prefrontal cortex,
   temporo-parietal junction, and precuneus BA 7 (Brodmann area 7), and
   that dispositional trust positively affects prosocials' decisions to
   cooperate. At the neural level, however, dispositional trust appears to
   exert a greater marginal effect on brain activity of proselfs in three
   social cognition regions, which does not translate into an increase in
   cooperation. An event-related analysis shows that cooperating prosocials
   show significantly more activation in the precuneus (BA 7) than
   proselfs. Based on previous research, we interpret this result to be
   consistent with prosocials' enhanced tendency to infer the intentions of
   others in social dilemma games, and the importance of establishing norm
   congruence when they decide to cooperate.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-35}},

Abstract = {{Humiliation, the emotion associated with being lowered in status in the
   eyes of others, seems to be very intense. As such, humiliation has been
   implied to play an important role in the escalation of inter-individual
   and inter-group conflict. Here, we provide the first clear empirical
   evidence that humiliation is indeed a very intense experience. Based on
   the electro-encephalogram recorded from people reading scenarios that
   evoked humiliation, anger, or happiness, electrophysiological measures
   of cognitive intensity were derived for each of the emotion types. The
   late positive potential (LPP), a measure of the level of perceived
   (negative), affect was markedly increased in humiliation scenarios
   compared to happiness and anger scenarios. In addition, event-related
   desynchronization (ERD) in the alpha-frequency range, a measure of the
   overall intensity of cortical activation, was significantly more
   pronounced for humiliation than for happiness and anger scenarios. Our
   findings support the idea that humiliation is a particularly intense
   experience that is likely to have far-reaching consequences.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{36-49}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Facial expressions play a critical role in social interactions by
   eliciting rapid responses in the observer. Failure to perceive and
   experience a normal range and depth of emotion seriously impact
   interpersonal communication and relationships. As has been demonstrated
   across a number of domains, abnormal emotion processing in individuals
   with psychopathy plays a key role in their lack of empathy. However, the
   neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific
   to particular emotions such as fear and perhaps sadness. Moreover,
   findings are inconsistent across studies. In the current experiment, 80
   incarcerated adult males scoring high, medium, and low on the Hare
   Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning while viewing dynamic facial
   expressions of fear, sadness, happiness, and pain. Participants who
   scored high on the PCL-R showed a reduction in neuro-hemodynamic
   response to all four categories of facial expressions in the face
   processing network (inferior occipital gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and
   superior temporal sulcus (STS)) as well as the extended network
   (inferior frontal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)), which supports
   a pervasive deficit across emotion domains. Unexpectedly, the response
   in dorsal insula to fear, sadness, and pain was greater in psychopaths
   than non-psychopaths. Importantly, the orbitofrontal cortex and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), regions critically implicated in
   affective and motivated behaviors, were significantly less active in
   individuals with psychopathy during the perception of all four emotional
   expressions.}},

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the
   neural substrates of empathy, Theory of Mind (ToM), and self-other
   differentiation involved in the adaptive understanding of people's
   internal states. Three conditions were distinguished in both sad and
   neutral (no obvious emotion) contexts. The empathy condition involved
   imagining what another person is feeling while the more cognitively
   loaded ToM condition involved imagining what would make another person
   feel better. The self-reference condition required participants to
   imagine how they would feel in someone else's situation. Areas
   previously implicated in empathy, ToM, and self-other differentiation
   were identified within the different conditions, regardless of emotional
   context. Specifically, the frontal and temporal poles responded more
   strongly for ToM than for empathy. The self-reference condition was
   associated with stronger dorsolateral prefrontal response than the
   empathy condition, while the reverse comparison revealed a stronger role
   for right frontal pole. Activations in frontal pole and orbitofrontal
   cortex were shared between the three conditions. Contrasts of parameter
   estimates demonstrated modulation by emotional context. The findings of
   common and differential patterns of responding observed in prefrontal
   and temporal regions suggest that within the social cognition network
   empathy, ToM and self-other differentiation have distinct roles that are
   responsive to context.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been growing emphasis on enhancing subjective

   the association between prefrontal function and subjective QOL was
   explored in 72 healthy volunteers (40 women and 32 men; age, 45.1 +/-
   20.1 y), using 52-channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), a portable
   neuroimaging device that can measure brain function in a
   less-constrained condition. Results confirmed that subjective QOL was
   positively correlated with prefrontal hemodynamic response during a
   cognitive task and that subjective satisfaction regarding social
   relationships and in the physical domains were cardinal contributors to
   the association. These findings suggest that subjective QOL has possible
   involvement in prefrontal function and that NIRS potentially plays a
   role as a biological marker of subjective QOL.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is defined as an individually varying but stable personality
   trait. To our knowledge this notion seems questionable considering
   recent studies proving neuronal plasticity not only in childhood and
   adolescence but over the whole lifespan. We propose a model in which an
   individual's basic empathic abilitiesarising from genetic factors, brain
   maturation, and early attachment experiences are continually modulated
   by the intensity, continuity, and frequency of interpersonal
   socio-emotional stimulation and challenges. We assume neural processes
   and their underlying neural structures being modified by social and
   socio-emotional stimulation. Continuous social interactions should
   produce noticeable effects on the empathic abilities of an individual
   independent of age or brain maturation level. In particular, empathic
   abilities should be learnable and expandable beyond specific
   developmental windows. To elucidate this hypothesis we surveyed empathy
   measures of students of various professions with the help of a new
   instrument, the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE)
   categorizing them into three different groups depending on their
   subsequent occupational fields: medical students, students of academic
   social professions, and a control group. Results indicate that
   continuous socio-emotional stimulation could increase empathic abilities
   potentially leading to learning effects.}},

Abstract = {{Engaging in prosocial behavior was explored in the present research, by
   investigating the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in
   modulation of intention to support other people and of emotional
   attuning as it was expressed by facial feedback (electromiography, EMG).
   High-frequency rTMS was applied on DLPFC to 25 subjects when they were
   required to choose to directly intervene or not to support other people
   in emotionally valenced social situations (cooperative, noncooperative,
   conflictual, neutral contexts). Two control conditions were included in
   the experimental design to control the simple stimulation effect (sham
   condition with absence of TMS stimulation) and the location effect
   (control site condition with Pz stimulation). In comparison with sham
   and control condition, rTMS stimulation induced increased prosocial
   behavior in all the emotional situations. Moreover, as a function of
   valence, zygomatic (for positive situations) and corrugators (for
   negative situations) muscle activity was increased, with significant
   effect by DLPFC stimulation which induced a facilitation effect. In
   addition, negative situations showed a higher rTMS impact for both
   behavioral and EMG responsiveness. Finally, prosocial behavior was found
   to be predicted (regression analysis) by EMG variations, as a function
   of the negative versus positive valence. The prefrontal circuit was
   suggested to support emotional responsiveness and facial feedback in
   order to facilitate the prosocial behavior.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Although research in moral psychology in the last decade has relied
   heavily on hypothetical moral dilemmas and has been effective in
   understanding moral judgment, how these judgments translate into
   behaviors remains a largely unexplored issue due to the harmful nature
   of the acts involved. To study this link, we follow a new approach based
   on a desktop virtual reality environment. In our within-subjects
   experiment, participants exhibited an order-dependent judgment-behavior
   discrepancy across temporally separated sessions, with many of them
   behaving in utilitarian manner in virtual reality dilemmas despite their
   nonutilitarian judgments for the same dilemmas in textual descriptions.
   This change in decisions reflected in the autonomic arousal of
   participants, with dilemmas in virtual reality being perceived more
   emotionally arousing than the ones in text, after controlling for
   general differences between the two presentation modalities (virtual
   reality vs. text). This suggests that moral decision-making in
   hypothetical moral dilemmas is susceptible to contextual saliency of the
   presentation of these dilemmas.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{548-561}},
Abstract = {{Although the successful pursuit of long-term goals constitutes an
   essential prerequisite to personal development, health, and well-being,
   little research has been devoted to the understanding of its underlying
   neural processes. A critical phase in the pursuit of long-term goals is
   defined as an action crisis, conceptualized as the intra-psychic
   conflict between further goal pursuit and disengagement from the goal.
   In the present research, we applied an interdisciplinary (cognitive and
   neural) approach to the analysis of processes underlying the experience
   of an action crisis. In Study 1, a longitudinal field study, action
   crises in personal goals gave rise to an increased and unbiased (re)
   evaluation of the costs and benefits (i.e., rewards) of the goal. Study
   2 was a magnetic resonance imaging study examining resting-state
   functional connectivity. The extent of experienced action crises was
   associated with enhanced fronto-accumbal connectivity signifying
   increased reward-related impact on prefrontal action control. Action
   crises, furthermore, mediated the relationship between a dispositional
   measure of effective goal pursuit (action orientation) and
   fronto-accumbal connectivity. The converging and complementary results
   from two methodologically different approaches advance the understanding
   of the neurobiology of personal long-term goals, especially with respect
   to the role of rewards in the context of goal-related conflicts.}},

Abstract = {{Even though electroencephalography has played a prominent role for lie

   with two experiments in which participants helped a virtual police

   announced whether they would lie or tell the truth about the knife's
   location. This design allowed us to study the signature of lie-telling
   in the absence of rare and personally significant oddball stimuli that
   are typically used for lie detection via electrophysiological markers,
   especially the P300 component. Our results indicate that active lying
   attenuated P300 amplitudes as well as N200 amplitudes for such
   non-oddball stimuli. These results support accounts that stress the high
   cognitive demand of lie-telling, including the need to suppress the

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{573-589}},
Abstract = {{Although universal, lying is generally considered immoral behavior. Most
   neuroscience studies on lying sanction or instruct deceptive behaviors
   and thus might fail to acknowledge the significance of lie-related moral
   conflicts. By combining electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings with a
   novel paradigm in which participants decided freely whether to deceive
   another person, we have generated indices of the cognitive (reaction
   times and stimulus-locked event-related components) and moral (readiness
   potential and its correlations with deception-related personality
   traits) cost of spontaneous deception. Our data fail to support the
   consensus that deception is cognitively more demanding than truth
   telling, suggesting that spontaneous deception, as opposed to lying out
   of requirement, might not mandate additional cognitive workload.
   Interestingly, lying was associated with decreased motor readiness, an
   event-related potential (ERP) component that is linked to motor
   preparation of self-determined actions and modulated when we face moral
   dilemmas. Notably, this reduction was less extensive in manipulative
   participants and greater in those who cared highly about their
   impression management. Our study expands on previous findings on
   deception by associating a cortical marker of reduced preparation to act
   with individual differences in moral cognition.}},

Abstract = {{People may be much less empathic than they think they are. It is not
   clear whether patients with schizophrenia who have impaired empathic
   abilities also exhibit diminished ability to accurately appraise their
   own such skills. The present study aimed to examine: (a) the accuracy of
   self-appraisal of empathy and (b) the impact of specific cognitive
   functions on both self-rated and performance-based empathy in
   schizophrenia patients and healthy volunteers. Self-reported empathy and
   performance-based empathy were assessed in 52 chronic patients with
   schizophrenia and 45 matched healthy participants with the empathy
   quotient and the empathy score in the Faux Pas test, respectively.
   Neuropsychological functioning and symptom severity were also assessed.
   No significant correlations between self-reported and performance-based
   empathy scores were found in patients, whereas these correlations were
   significant and positive in the control group, with the exception of
   Faux Pas recognition. Cognitive deficits, specifically in processing
   speed and theory of mind, negatively affected performance-based but not
   self-rated empathy in schizophrenia. Patients with less negative and
   more positive symptoms and lower set shifting ability reported higher
   empathic abilities. Self-reported empathy and empathic abilities do not
   show a simple relationship. Our findings highlight a double deficit
   related to empathic responding in schizophrenia: diminished performance
   associated with cognitive deficits and inaccurate self-appraisal of
   empathic abilities.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{601-609}},
Abstract = {{Turner syndrome is a genetic condition resulting from the partial or
   complete absence of an X-chromosome in phenotypic females. Individuals
   with Turner syndrome often display social difficulties that are
   reminiscent of those associated with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD),
   conditions associated with empathy and mirror-neuron system (MNS)
   deficits. The goal of the present study was (1) to investigate the
   extent to which adults with Turner syndrome display autistic and
   empathic traits, and (2) to probe the integrity of the MNS in this
   neurogenetic disorder. Sixteen individuals with Turner syndrome and 16
   age-, sex-, and IQ-matched controls took part in a neuropsychological
   assessment where the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, the
   Autism Spectrum Quotient and the Empathy Quotient were administered.
   Functioning of the MNS was assessed by measuring motor cortex activity
   with transcranial magnetic stimulation during an action-observation
   task. Results show that individuals with Turner syndrome do not differ
   significantly from controls regarding autistic or empathic traits, and
   present normal functioning of the MNS during action observation.
   Correlational analysis showed a significant positive relationship
   between scores on the Empathy Quotient and motor facilitation during
   action observation, bringing further support to the hypothesis that MNS

Abstract = {{Although neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is classically recognized as an
   affectation of optic nerves and spinal cord, recent reports have shown
   brain atrophy and cognitive dysfunction in this condition. Importantly,
   emotion-related brain regions appear to be impaired in NMO. However, no
   studies of NMO' emotional processing have been published. The goal of
   the current study was to investigate facial emotion recognition in 10
   patients with NMO and 10 healthy controls by controlling for relevant
   cognitive factors. Consistent with previous reports, NMO patients
   performed poorly across cognitive domains (divided attention, working
   memory, and information-processing speed). Our findings further evidence
   the relative inability of NMO patients to recognize negative emotions
   (disgust, anger, and fear), in comparison to controls, with these
   deficits not explained by other cognitive impairments. Results provide
   the first evidence that NMO may impair the ability to recognize negative
   emotions. These impairments appear to be related to possible damage in
   brain regions underling emotional networks, including the anterior
   cingulate cortex, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex. Findings
   increased both our understanding of NMO's cognitive impairment, and the
   neural networks underlying negative emotions.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{639-649}},
Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging research has revealed stronger empathic neural
   responses to same-race compared to other-race individuals. Is the
   in-group favouritism in empathic neural responses specific to race
   identification or a more general effect of social
   identification-including those based on religious/irreligious beliefs?
   The present study investigated whether and how intergroup relationships
   based on religious/irreligious identifications modulate empathic neural
   responses to others' pain expressions. We recorded event-related brain
   potentials from Chinese Christian and atheist participants while they
   perceived pain or neutral expressions of Chinese faces that were marked
   as being Christians or atheists. We found that both Christian and
   atheist participants showed stronger neural activity to pain (versus
   neutral) expressions at 132-168 ms and 200-320 ms over the frontal
   region to those with the same (versus different) religious/irreligious
   beliefs. The in-group favouritism in empathic neural responses was also
   evident in a later time window (412-612 ms) over the central/parietal
   regions in Christian but not in atheist participants. Our results
   indicate that the intergroup relationship based on shared beliefs,
   either religious or irreligious, can lead to in-group favouritism in
   empathy for others' suffering.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{650-660}},
Abstract = {{The detection of one's deviance from social norms is an essential
   mechanism of individual adjustment to group behavior and, thus, for the
   perpetuation of norms within groups. It has been suggested that error
   signals in mediofrontal cortex provide the neural basis of such deviance
   detection, which contributes to later adjustment to the norm. In the
   present study, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to demonstrate
   that, across participants, the strength of mediofrontal brain correlates
   of the detection of deviance from a peer group's norms was negatively
   related to attentive processing of the same group's judgments in a later
   task. We propose that an individual's perception of social deviance
   might bias basic cognitive processing during further interaction with
   the group. Strongly perceiving disagreement with a group could cause an
   individual to avoid or inhibit this group's judgments.}},

Pages = {{437-451}},
Abstract = {{Working memory (WM) refers to mental processes that enable temporary
   retention and manipulation of information, including information about
   other people ({''}social working memory{''}). Previous studies have
   demonstrated that nonsocial WM is supported by dopamine
   neurotransmission. Here, we investigated in 131 healthy adults whether
   dopamine is similarly involved in social WM by testing whether social
   and nonsocial WM are influenced by genetic variants in three genes
   coding for molecules regulating the availability of dopamine in the
   brain: catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), dopamine active transporter
   (DAT), and monoamine-oxidase A (MAOA). An advantage for the Met allele
   of COMT was observed in the two standard WM tasks and in the social WM
   task. However, the influence of COMT on social WM performance was not
   accounted for by its influence on either standard WM paradigms. There
   was no main effect of DAT1 or MAOA, but a significant COMT x DAT1
   interaction on social WM performance. This study provides novel
   preliminary evidence of effects of genetic variants of the dopamine
   neurotransmitter system on social cognition. The results further suggest
   that the effects observed on standard WM do not explain the genetic
   effects on effortful social cognition.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{452-470}},
Abstract = {{Throughout adolescence, progress in the understanding of the moral
   domain as well as changes in moral behavior is observable. We tested 16
   adolescents (14-16 years of age) and 16 healthy adults (22-31 years of
   age) on the developmental changes in everyday moral decision making
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using verbal stories
   describing everyday moral conflict situations, subjects had to decide
   between a moral standard or a personal desire. In the moral conflict
   situations, adolescents not only chose significantly more often the
   hedonistic alternative than adults, but they also reported higher
   certainty ratings. Contrasted with everyday social conflict situations
   that required a decision between a social-oriented behavior and a
   personal need, moral conflict situations induced an activity increase in
   frontal areas, the middle temporal gyrus, the thalamus, and the
   parahippocampal gyrus in adolescents compared to adults. Moreover, a
   closer look at the moral conflict situations revealed that adolescents
   showed more activity than adults in brain areas that are also centrally
   involved in theory of mind (ToM) during morally oriented decisions in
   contrast to personal-oriented decisions. This indicated that the
   development of moral reasoning may be strongly correlated with the
   development of ToM reasoning.}},

Abstract = {{Limited information is available regarding predictors of psychosocial

   compare social competence of children with arterial ischemic stroke
   (AIS) to those with chronic illness and healthy controls and (ii)
   investigate the contribution of stroke pathology, neurological outcome
   and environment. Thirty-six children with AIS > 12 months prior to
   recruitment were compared with children with chronic illness (asthma) (n
   = 15) and healthy controls (n = 43). Children underwent intellectual
   assessment, and children and parents completed questionnaires to assess
   social competence. Children with AIS underwent MRI scan and neurological
   evaluation. Child AIS was associated with poorer social adjustment and
   participation, and children with AIS were rated as having more social
   problems than controls. Lesion volume was not associated with social
   outcome, but subcortical stroke was linked to reduced social
   participation and younger stroke onset predicted better social
   interaction and higher self-esteem. Family function was the sole
   predictor of social adjustment. Findings highlight the risk of social
   impairment following pediatric stroke, with both stroke and
   environmental factors influencing children's social competence in the
   chronic stages of recovery. They indicate the potential for intervention

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Dominance hierarchies are an important aspect of group-living as they
   determine individual access to resources. The existence of dominance
   ranks in access to space has not been described in socially monogamous,
   communally nesting prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Here, we tested
   whether dominance could be assessed using the tube test. We also tested
   whether dominance related to alcohol intake, similar to what has been
   demonstrated in nonmonogamous species. Same-sex pairs of unfamiliar
   peers were tested in a series of three trials of the tube test, then
   paired and allowed individual access to alcohol and water for 4 days,
   and then tested again in the tube test. For all pairs, the same subjects
   won the majority of trials before and after alcohol drinking. The number
   of wins negatively correlated with alcohol intake on the first day of
   drinking and positively correlated with levels of Fos in the
   paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus following the tube test in a
   separate group of voles. Dominance was not related to Fos levels in
   other brain regions examined. Together, these results indicate that
   prairie voles quickly establish stable dominance ranks through a process
   possibly involving the hypothalamus and suggest that dominance is linked
   to alcohol drinking.}},

Abstract = {{Self-disclosure is an important performance in human social
   communication. Generally, an individual is likely to have a good
   physical and mental health if he is prone to self-disclosure under
   stressful life events. However, as for now, little is known about the
   neural structure associated with self-disclosure. Therefore, in this
   study, we used voxel-based morphometry to explore regional gray matter
   volume (rGMV) and white matter volume (rWMV) associated with
   self-disclosure measured by the Jourard Self-disclosure Questionnaire in
   a large sample of college students. Results showed that individual
   self-disclosure was significantly and positively associated with rGMV of
   the left postcentral gyrus, which might be related to strengthen
   individual's ability of body feeling; while self-disclosure was
   significantly and negatively associated with rGMV of the right
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which might be involved in increased
   positive emotion experience seeking (intrinsically rewarding). In
   addition, individual self-disclosure was also associated with smaller
   rWMV in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL). These findings
   suggested a biological basis for individual self-disclosure, distributed
   across different gray and white matter areas of the brain.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{504-513}},
Abstract = {{Experiences of social exclusion elicit social pain responses. The
   current study examined the ability of social exclusion to activate
   physiological stress responses and adaptively modulate affect and
   empathy consistent with ``defensive emotional analgesia.{''} Measures of
   affect and empathy, and saliva samples for cortisol and alpha-amylase
   (sAA) analysis, were collected before and after subjects participated in
   a computer game ({''}Cyberball{''}) designed to manipulate feelings of
   social exclusion. Contrary to our hypotheses, social exclusion was
   associated with a reduction in cortisol, and social inclusion with an
   increase in cortisol. Both Cyberball groups showed increases in sAA and
   decreases in both positive and negative affect, with the greatest drop
   in affect occurring after social exclusion. Empathy did not differ
   between the social exclusion and inclusion groups and was not correlated
   with cortisol or sAA levels. These results support the presence of a
   defensive response to social exclusion in which central stress pathways
   controlling cortisol release are inhibited. Cortisol and sAA were shown
   to have distinct patterns of responses to psychological stress, with sAA
   responding more rapidly. Related methodological concerns for the use of
   these physiological stress markers and of Cyberball in social
   neuroscience research are discussed.}},

Title = {{Belief in a just world is associated with activity in insula and
   somatosensory cortices as a response to the perception of norm
   violations}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{514-521}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies identified a network of brain regions involved in the
   perception of norm violations, including insula, anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), and right temporoparietal junction area (RTPJ).
   Activations in these regions are suggested to reflect the perception of
   norm violations and unfairness. The current study aimed to test this
   hypothesis by exploring whether a personal disposition to perceive the
   world as being just is related to neural responses to moral evaluations.
   The just-world-hypothesis describes a cognitive bias to believe in a
   just world in which everyone gets what he or she deserves and deserves
   what he or she gets. Since it has been demonstrated that ACC, RTPJ, and
   insula are involved in the perception of unfairness, we hypothesized
   that individual differences in the belief in a just world are reflected
   by different activations of these brain areas. Participants were
   confronted with scenarios describing norm-violating or -confirming
   behavior. FMRI results revealed an activation of dorsal ACC, RTPJ, and
   insula when perceiving norm violations, but only activity in
   insula/somatosensory cortex correlated with the belief in a just world.
   Thus, our results suggest a role for insula/somatosensory cortex for the
   belief in a just world.}},

Abstract = {{Fathering plays an important role in infants' socioemotional and
   cognitive development. Previous studies have identified brain regions
   that are important for parenting behavior in human mothers. However, the
   neural basis of parenting in human fathers is largely unexplored. In the
   current longitudinal study, we investigated structural changes in
   fathers' brains during the first 4 months postpartum using voxel-based
   morphometry analysis. Biological fathers (n = 16) with full-term,
   healthy infants were scanned at 2-4 weeks postpartum (time 1) and at
   12-16 weeks postpartum (time 2). Fathers exhibited increase in gray
   matter (GM) volume in several neural regions involved in parental
   motivation, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, striatum, and lateral
   prefrontal cortex. On the other hand, fathers exhibited decreases in GM
   volume in the orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and
   insula. The findings provide evidence for neural plasticity in fathers'
   brains. We also discuss the distinct patterns of associations among
   neural changes, postpartum mood symptoms, and parenting behaviors among
   fathers.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin has been implicated in parent-infant attachment and social
   recognition. With respect to emotion recognition memory, both
   memory-enhancing and impairing effects have been observed, suggesting an
   influence of individual factors. We assessed the effects of oxytocin on
   memory for infant cues, and whether these effects are moderated by
   self-reported childhood emotional maltreatment. Nulliparous females (N =
   102) participated in a randomized, double-blind, between-subjects study
   with intranasal oxytocin or placebo administration. Participants' memory
   was tested using the Baby Social Reward Task, where participants were
   asked to select the happier infant from a pair of two infants based on
   the information that they received about the infants' mood in the
   previous phase. Participants reporting more childhood emotional
   maltreatment were less accurate in this task after inhaling oxytocin.
   Our findings add to a growing body of literature showing that the
   effects of intranasal oxytocin on memory and social behavior are
   moderated by adverse early life experiences.}},

Pages = {{326-331}},
Abstract = {{Attachment to one's kin as an in-group emerges from a fundamental human
   motivation and is vital for human survival. Despite important recent
   advances in the field of social neuroscience, the neural mechanisms
   underlying family-related in-group perception remain obscure. To examine
   the neural basis of perceiving family-related in-group boundaries in
   response to written kinship scenarios, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging in 27 healthy adults and obtained self-report ratings
   of family-related entitativity, which measures to what degree
   participants perceive their family as a coherent and distinct group in
   society. We expected that activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex and
   septo-hypothalamic region would track individual differences in
   entitativity. Perceiving one's family as a distinct and cohesive group
   (high entitativity) was associated with increased subgenual cortex
   response to kinship scenarios. The subgenual cingulate cortex may
   represent a key link between kin-related emotional attachment and group
   perception, providing a neurobiological basis for group belongingness.}},

   functional changes in the anterior cingulate cortex within a sample of
   96 criminal offenders who were engaged in a Go/No-Go impulse control
   task significantly predicted their rearrest following release from
   prison. In an extended analysis, we use discrimination and calibration
   techniques to test the accuracy of these predictions relative to more
   traditional models and their ability to generalize to new observations
   in both full and reduced models. Modest to strong discrimination and
   calibration accuracy were found, providing additional support for the
   utility of neurobiological measures in predicting rearrest.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{337-351}},
Abstract = {{Early-stage romantic love involves reorganization of neurohormonal
   systems and behavioral patterns marked by mutual influences between the
   partners' physiology and behavior. Guided by the biobehavioral synchrony
   conceptual frame, we tested bidirectional influences between the
   partners' hormones and conflict behavior at the initiation of romantic
   love. Participants included 120 new lovers (60 couples) and 40 singles.
   Plasma levels of five affiliation and stress-related hormones were
   assessed: oxytocin (OT), prolactin (PRL), testosterone (T), cortisol
   (CT), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Couples were observed
   in conflict interaction coded for empathy and hostility. CT and DHEAS
   showed direct actor effects: higher CT and DHEAS predicted greater
   hostility. OT showed direct partner effects: individuals whose partners
   had higher OT showed greater empathy. T and CT showed combined
   actor-partner effects. High T predicted greater hostility only when
   partner also had high T, but lower hostility when partner had low T.
   Similarly, CT predicted low empathy only in the context of high
   partner's CT. Mediational analysis indicated that combined high CT in
   both partners was associated with relationship breakup as mediated by
   decrease in empathy. Findings demonstrate the mutual influences between
   hormones and behavior within an attachment bond and underscore the
   dynamic, co-regulated, and systemic nature of pair-bond formation in
   humans.}},

Title = {{Mothers' unresolved trauma blunts amygdala response to infant distress}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{352-363}},
Abstract = {{While the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder has been
   extensively researched, much less attention has been paid to the neural
   mechanisms underlying more covert but pervasive types of trauma (e. g.,
   those involving disrupted relationships and insecure attachment). Here,
   we report on a neurobiological study documenting that mothers'
   attachment-related trauma, when unresolved, undermines her optimal brain
   response to her infant's distress. We examined the amygdala blood
   oxygenation level-dependent response in 42 first-time mothers as they
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, viewing
   happy-and sad-face images of their own infant, along with those of a
   matched unknown infant. Whereas mothers with no trauma demonstrated
   greater amygdala responses to the sad faces of their own infant as
   compared to their happy faces, mothers who were classified as having
   unresolved trauma in the Adult Attachment Interview (Dynamic
   Maturational Model) displayed blunted amygdala responses when cued by
   their own infants' sadness as compared to happiness. Unknown infant
   faces did not elicit differential amygdala responses between the mother
   groups. The blunting of the amygdala response in traumatized mothers is
   discussed as a neural indication of mothers' possible disengagement from
   infant distress, which may be part of a process linking maternal
   unresolved trauma and disrupted maternal caregiving.}},

Title = {{Arousal modulates valence effects on both early and late stages of
   affective picture processing in a passive viewing task}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{364-377}},
Abstract = {{Valence and arousal are primary dimensions of affective stimuli. An
   interaction of these two factors on affective processing is largely
   unknown. In this study, the processing of affective pictures was
   investigated in an orthogonal valence (positive vs. negative) by arousal
   (high vs. low) task design. Participants were instructed to passively
   view each presented picture and did not need to make any responses. The
   valence by arousal interaction was observed on three event-related
   potential (ERP) components, including the P2 (160-190 ms), N2 (220-320
   ms) and late positive potential (LPP) (400-700 ms). This interaction
   revealed that negative pictures evoked larger neural responses compared
   with positive pictures (i.e., negative bias) at the high-arousal level,
   whereas negative pictures evoked smaller neural responses than positive
   pictures (i.e., positive offset) at the low-arousal level. The current
   results suggest that the effect of emotional valence on affective
   picture perception is modulated by levels of arousal at both early and
   late stages of processing. Finally, the main effect of valence was
   evident in the P1 component (90-110 ms) and arousal effect in the N1
   component (120-150 ms).}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin has repeatedly been shown to influence human behavior in social
   contexts; also, a relationship between oxytocin and the pathophysiology
   of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been suggested. In the present
   study, we investigated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
   oxytocin gene (OXT) and the genes for single-minded 1 (SIM1), aryl
   hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) and cluster of
   differentiation 38 (CD38) in a population of 1771 children from the
   Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS). Statistical analyses
   were performed to investigate any association between SNPs and
   autistic-like traits (ALTs), measured through ASD scores in the
   Autism-Tics, ADHD and other Co-morbidities inventory. Firstly, we found
   a statistically significant association between the SIM1 SNP rs3734354
   (Pro352Thr) and scores for language impairment (p = .0004), but due to
   low statistical power this should be interpreted cautiously.
   Furthermore, nominal associations were found between ASD scores and SNPs
   in OXT, ARNT2 and CD38. In summary, the present study lends support to
   the hypothesis that oxytocin and oxytocin neuron development may have an
   influence on the development of ALTs and suggests a new candidate gene
   in the search for the pathophysiology of ASD.}},

   the sentences again and asked participants to describe the specific
   thoughts they had during the initial presentation of each sentence. We
   categorized experimental trials for each participant according to
   whether they resulted in subsequently reported internal mentations or
   not. The results show that activation within classic language processing

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{400-411}},
Abstract = {{A host of research has attempted to explain why some believe in the
   supernatural and some do not. One suggested explanation for commonly
   held supernatural beliefs is that they are a by-product of theory of
   mind (ToM) processing. However, this does not explain why skeptics with
   intact ToM processes do not believe. We employed fMRI to investigate
   activation differences in ToM-related brain circuitries between
   supernatural believers (N = 12) and skeptics (N = 11) while they watched
   2D animations of geometric objects moving intentionally or randomly and
   rated the intentionality of the animations. The ToM-related circuitries
   in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were localized by contrasting
   intention-rating-related and control-rating-related brain activation.
   Compared with the skeptics, the supernatural believers rated the random
   movements as more intentional and had stronger activation of the
   ToM-related circuitries during the animation with random movement. The
   strength of the ToM-related activation covaried with the intentionality
   ratings. These findings provide evidence that differences in ToM-related
   activations are associated with supernatural believers' tendency to
   interpret random phenomena in mental terms. Thus, differences in ToM
   processing may contribute to differences between believing and
   unbelieving.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{412-423}},
Abstract = {{Patients with schizophrenia often show abnormal social interactions,
   which may explain their social exclusion behaviors. This study aimed to
   elucidate patients' brain responses to social rejection in an
   interactive situation. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia and 16
   healthy controls participated in the functional magnetic resonance
   imaging experiment with the virtual handshake task, in which socially
   interacting contents such as acceptance and refusal of handshaking were
   implemented. Responses to the refusal versus acceptance conditions were
   evaluated and compared between the two groups. Controls revealed higher
   activity in the refusal condition compared to the acceptance condition
   in the right superior temporal sulcus, whereas patients showed higher
   activity in the prefrontal regions, including the frontopolar cortex. In
   patients, contrast activities of the right superior temporal sulcus were
   inversely correlated with the severity of schizophrenic symptoms,
   whereas contrast activities of the left frontopolar cortex were
   positively correlated with the current anxiety scores. The superior
   temporal sulcus hypoactivity and frontopolar hyperactivity of patients
   with schizophrenia in social rejection situations may suggest the
   presence of mentalizing deficits in negative social situations and
   inefficient processes of socially aberrant stimuli, respectively. These
   abnormalities may be one of the neural bases of distorted or paranoid
   beliefs in schizophrenia.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{424-435}},
Abstract = {{The implicit positive association (IPA) theory attributed self-face
   advantage to the IPA with self-concept. Previous behavioral study has
   found that self-concept threat (SCT) could eliminate the self-advantage
   in face recognition over familiar-face, without taking levels of facial
   familiarity into account. The current event-related potential study
   aimed to investigate whether SCT could eliminate the self-face advantage
   over stranger-face. Fifteen participants completed a ``self-friend{''}
   comparison task in which participants identified the face orientation of
   self-face and friend-face after SCT and non-self-concept threat (NSCT)
   priming, and a ``self-stranger{''} comparison task was also completed in
   which participants identified the face orientation of self-face and
   stranger-face after SCT and NSCT priming. The results showed that the N2
   amplitudes were more negative for processing friend-face than self-face
   after NSCT priming, but there was no significant difference between them
   after SCT priming. Moreover, the N2 amplitudes were more negative for
   processing stranger-face than self-face both after SCT priming and after
   NSCT priming. Furthermore, SCT manipulated the N2 amplitudes of
   friend-face rather than self-face. Overall, the present study made a
   supplementary to the current IPA theory and further indicated that SCT
   would only eliminate this self-face recognition advantage when comparing
   with important others.}},

Title = {{When psychopathy impairs moral judgments: neural responses during

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathy is a disorder characterized by reduced empathy, shallow
   affect and behaviors that cause victims distress, like threats, bullying
   and violence. Neuroimaging research in both institutionalized and
   community samples implicates amygdala dysfunction in the etiology of
   psychopathic traits. Reduced amygdala responsiveness may disrupt
   processing of fear-relevant stimuli like fearful facial expressions. The
   present study links amygdala dysfunction in response to fear-relevant
   stimuli to the willingness of individuals with psychopathic traits to
   cause fear in other people. Thirty-three healthy adult participants
   varying in psychopathic traits underwent whole-brain fMRI scanning while
   they viewed statements that selectively evoke anger, disgust, fear,
   happiness or sadness. During scanning, participants judged whether it is
   morally acceptable to make each statement to another person. Psychopathy
   was associated with reduced activity in right amygdala during judgments
   of fear-evoking statements and with more lenient moral judgments about
   causing fear. No group differences in amygdala function or moral
   judgments emerged for other emotion categories. Psychopathy was also
   associated with increased activity in middle frontal gyrus (BA 10)
   during the task. These results implicate amygdala dysfunction in
   impaired judgments about causing distress in psychopathy and suggest
   that atypical amygdala responses to fear in psychopathy extend across
   multiple classes of stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) patients exhibit a disparity in their actual
   physical identity and their cognitive understanding of their physical
   identity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks have
   contributed to understanding the neural circuitry involved in processing
   identity in healthy individuals. We hypothesized that women recovering
   from AN would show altered neural responses while thinking about their
   identity compared with healthy control women. We compared brain
   activation using fMRI in 18 women recovering from anorexia (RAN) and 18
   healthy control women (CON) using two identity-appraisal tasks. These
   neuroimaging tasks were focused on separable components of identity: one
   consisted of adjectives related to social activities and the other
   consisted of physical descriptive phrases about one's appearance. Both
   tasks consisted of reading and responding to statements with three
   different perspectives: Self, Friend and Reflected. In the comparisons
   of the RAN and CON subjects, we observed differences in fMRI activation
   relating to self-knowledge ('I am', `I look') and perspective-taking ('I
   believe', `Friend believes') in the precuneus, two areas of the dorsal
   anterior cingulate, and the left middle frontal gyrus. These data
   suggest that further exploration of neural components related to
   identity may improve our understanding of the pathology of AN.}},

Abstract = {{Our life is full of stories: some of them depict real-life events and
   were reported, e. g. in the daily news or in autobiographies, whereas
   other stories, as often presented to us in movies and novels, are
   fictional. However, we have only little insights in the neurocognitive
   processes underlying the reading of factual as compared to fictional
   contents. We investigated the neurocognitive effects of reading short
   narratives, labeled to be either factual or fictional. Reading in a
   factual mode engaged an activation pattern suggesting an action-based
   reconstruction of the events depicted in a story. This process seems to
   be past-oriented and leads to shorter reaction times at the behavioral
   level. In contrast, the brain activation patterns corresponding to
   reading fiction seem to reflect a constructive simulation of what might
   have happened. This is in line with studies on imagination of possible
   past or future events.}},

Abstract = {{Two empathy-related processes were recently distinguished
   neuroscientifically: automatic embodied-simulation (ES) based on
   visceromotor representation of another's affective state via
   cingulo-insulary circuit, and emotional sharing relying on cognitive
   `theory of mind' (ToM) via prefrontal-temporoparietal circuit. Evidence
   that these regions are not only activated but also function as networks
   during empathic experience has yet to been shown. Employing a novel
   approach by analyzing fMRI fluctuations of network cohesion while
   viewing films portraying personal loss, this study demonstrates
   increased connectivity during empathic engagement (probed by behavioral
   and parasympathetic indices) both within these circuits, and between
   them and a set of limbic regions. Notably, this effect was
   context-dependent: when witnessing as a determined-loss presented as a
   future event, the ToM and ToM-limbic cohesion positively correlated with
   state-and empathy indices. During the dramatic peak of this condition,
   the ToM cohesion was positively correlated with the trait-empathy index
   of personal distress. However, when the loss was presented as a
   probabilistic real-time occurrence, ToM cohesion negatively correlated
   with state-empathy index, which positively correlated with ES-limbic
   cohesion. In this case, it was the ES-limbic cohesion during the
   emotional peak which was correlated with personal distress scores. The
   findings indicate a dichotomy between regulated empathy toward
   determined-loss and vicarious empathy toward a real-time occurrence.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{39-47}},

Abstract = {{Previous neuroimaging studies on empathy have not clearly identified
   neural systems that support the three components of empathy: affective
   congruence, perspective-taking, and prosocial motivation. These
   limitations stem from a focus on a single emotion per study, minimal
   variation in amount of social context provided, and lack of prosocial
   motivation assessment. In the current investigation, 32 participants
   completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging session assessing
   empathic responses to individuals experiencing painful, anxious, and
   happy events that varied in valence and amount of social context
   provided. They also completed a 14-day experience sampling survey that
   assessed real-world helping behaviors. The results demonstrate that
   empathy for positive and negative emotions selectively activates regions
   associated with positive and negative affect, respectively. In addition,
   the mirror system was more active during empathy for context-independent
   events (pain), whereas the mentalizing system was more active during
   empathy for context-dependent events (anxiety, happiness). Finally, the
   septal area, previously linked to prosocial motivation, was the only
   region that was commonly activated across empathy for pain, anxiety, and
   happiness. Septal activity during each of these empathic experiences was
   predictive of daily helping. These findings suggest that empathy has
   multiple input pathways, produces affect-congruent activations, and
   results in septally mediated prosocial motivation.}},

Abstract = {{The neuroendocrine state of new mothers may alter their neural
   processing of stressors in the environment through modulatory actions of
   oxytocin on the limbic system. We predicted that amygdala sensitivity to
   negatively arousing stimuli would be suppressed in postpartum compared
   to nulliparous women and that this suppression would be modulated by
   administration of oxytocin nasal spray. We measured brain activation
   (fMRI) and subjective arousal in response to negatively arousing
   pictures in 29 postpartum and 30 nulliparous women who received either
   oxytocin nasal spray or placebo before scanning. Pre- and post-exposure
   urinary cortisol levels were also measured. Postpartum women (placebo)
   demonstrated lower right amygdala activation in response to negative
   images, lower cortisol and lower negative photo arousal ratings to
   nulliparous women. Nulliparous women receiving oxytocin had lower right
   amygdala activation compared to placebo. Cortisol levels in the placebo
   group, and ratings of arousal across all women, were positively
   associated with right amygdala activation. Together, these findings
   demonstrate reductions in both amygdala activation and subjective
   negative arousal in untreated postpartum vs nulliparous women,
   supporting the hypothesis of an attenuated neural response to arousing
   stimuli in postpartum women. A causal role of oxytocin and the timing of
   potential effects require future investigation.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{55-62}},

Abstract = {{Rational decision making under uncertainty requires forming beliefs that
   integrate prior and new information through Bayes' rule. Human decision
   makers typically deviate from Bayesian updating by either overweighting
   the prior (conservatism) or overweighting new information (e. g. the
   representativeness heuristic). We investigated these deviations through
   measurements of electrocortical activity in the human brain during
   incentivized probability-updating tasks and found evidence of extremely
   early commitment to boundedly rational heuristics. Participants who
   overweight new information display a lower sensibility to conflict
   detection, captured by an event-related potential (the N2) observed
   around 260 ms after the presentation of new information. Conservative
   decision makers (who overweight prior probabilities) make up their mind
   before new information is presented, as indicated by the lateralized
   readiness potential in the brain. That is, they do not inhibit the
   processing of new information but rather immediately rely on the prior
   for making a decision.}},

Abstract = {{We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to tap the temporal dynamics of
   first impressions based on face appearance. Participants were asked to
   evaluate briefly presented faces for trustworthiness and political
   choice. Behaviorally, participants were better at discriminating faces
   that were pre-rated as untrustworthy. The ERP results showed that the
   P100 component was enhanced for untrustworthy faces, consistently with
   the view that signals of potential threat are given precedence in neural
   processing. The enhanced ERP responses to untrustworthy faces persisted
   throughout the processing sequence and the amplitude of early posterior
   negativity (EPN), and subsequent late positive potential (LPP) was
   increased with respect to trustworthy faces which, in contrast, elicited
   an enhanced positivity around 150 ms on frontal sites. These ERP
   patterns were found specifically for the trustworthiness evaluation and
   not for the political decision task. Political decision yielded an
   increase in the N170 amplitude, reflecting a more demanding and taxing
   structural encoding. Similar ERP responses, as previously reported in
   the literature for facial expressions processing, were found throughout
   the entire time course specifically elicited by faces explicitly judged
   as untrustworthy. One possibility might be that evolution has provided
   the brain with a `special toolkit' for trust evaluation that is fast and
   triggers ERPs related to emotional processing.}},

Abstract = {{Western cultures encourage self-construals independent of social

   self-construals that rely on how others perceive the self. How are
   culturally specific self-construals mediated by the human brain? Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, we monitored neural responses
   from adults in East Asian (Chinese) and Western (Danish) cultural
   contexts during judgments of social, mental and physical attributes of
   themselves and public figures to assess cultural influences on
   self-referential processing of personal attributes in different
   dimensions. We found that judgments of self vs a public figure elicited
   greater activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in Danish than
   in Chinese participants regardless of attribute dimensions for
   judgments. However, self-judgments of social attributes induced greater
   activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) in Chinese than in Danish
   participants. Moreover, the group difference in TPJ activity was
   mediated by a measure of a cultural value (i.e. interdependence of
   self-construal). Our findings suggest that individuals in different
   sociocultural contexts may learn and/or adopt distinct strategies for
   self-reflection by changing the weight of the mPFC and TPJ in the social

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{81-87}},

Abstract = {{The right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is a neural region
   involved in assessing the goals and intentions underlying the motion of
   social agents. Recent research has identified visual cues, such as
   chasing, that trigger animacy detection and intention attribution. When
   readily available in a visual display, these cues reliably activate the
   pSTS. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined if
   attributing intentions to random motion would likewise engage the pSTS.
   Participants viewed displays of four moving circles and were instructed
   to search for chasing or mirror-correlated motion. On chasing trials,
   one circle chased another circle, invoking the percept of an intentional
   agent; while on correlated motion trials, one circle's motion was mirror
   reflected by another. On the remaining trials, all circles moved
   randomly. As expected, pSTS activation was greater when participants
   searched for chasing vs correlated motion when these cues were present
   in the displays. Of critical importance, pSTS activation was also
   greater when participants searched for chasing compared to
   mirror-correlated motion when the displays in both search conditions
   were statistically identical random motion. We conclude that pSTS
   activity associated with intention attribution can be invoked by
   top-down processes in the absence of reliable visual cues for
   intentionality.}},

Abstract = {{In healthy individuals, direct eye contact initially leads to activation
   of a fast subcortical pathway, which then modulates a cortical route
   eliciting social cognitive processes. The aim of this study was to gain
   insight into the neurobiological effects of direct eye-to-eye contact
   using a virtual reality paradigm in individuals with posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD) related to prolonged childhood abuse. We examined
   16 healthy comparison subjects and 16 patients with a primary diagnosis
   of PTSD using a virtual reality functional magnetic resonance imaging
   paradigm involving direct vs averted gaze (happy, sad, neutral) as
   developed by Schrammel et al. in 2009. Irrespective of the displayed
   emotion, controls exhibited an increased blood oxygenation
   level-dependent response during direct vs averted gaze within the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, left temporoparietal junction and right
   temporal pole. Under the same conditions, individuals with PTSD showed
   increased activation within the superior colliculus (SC)/periaqueductal
   gray (PAG) and locus coeruleus. Our findings suggest that healthy
   controls react to the exposure of direct gaze with an activation of a
   cortical route that enhances evaluative `top-down' processes underlying
   social interactions. In individuals with PTSD, however, direct gaze
   leads to sustained activation of a subcortical route of eye-contact
   processing, an innate alarm system involving the SC and the underlying
   circuits of the PAG.}},

Abstract = {{Human beings constantly engage in attributing causal explanations to
   one's own and to others actions, and theory-of-mind (ToM) is critical in
   making such inferences. Although children learn causal attribution early
   in development, children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are known
   to have impairments in the development of intentional causality. This
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) study investigated the neural correlates of physical and
   intentional causal attribution in people with ASDs. In the fMRI scanner,
   15 adolescents and adults with ASDs and 15 age-and IQ-matched typically
   developing peers made causal judgments about comic strips presented
   randomly in an event-related design. All participants showed robust
   activation in bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus at the
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) in response to intentional causality.
   Participants with ASDs showed lower activation in TPJ, right inferior
   frontal gyrus and left premotor cortex. Significantly weaker functional
   connectivity was also found in the ASD group between TPJ and motor areas
   during intentional causality. DTI data revealed significantly reduced
   fractional anisotropy in ASD participants in white matter underlying the
   temporal lobe. In addition to underscoring the role of TPJ in ToM, this
   study found an interaction between motor simulation and mentalizing
   systems in intentional causal attribution and its possible discord in
   autism.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are often associated with impairments in
   judgment of facial expressions. This impairment is often accompanied by
   diminished eye contact and atypical amygdala responses to face stimuli.
   The current study used a within-subjects design to examine the effects
   of natural viewing and an experimental eye-gaze manipulation on amygdala
   responses to faces. Individuals with ASD showed less gaze toward the eye
   region of faces relative to a control group. Among individuals with ASD,
   reduced eye gaze was associated with higher threat ratings of neutral
   faces. Amygdala signal was elevated in the ASD group relative to
   controls. This elevated response was further potentiated by
   experimentally manipulating gaze to the eye region. Potentiation by the
   gaze manipulation was largest for those individuals who exhibited the
   least amount of naturally occurring gaze toward the eye region and was
   associated with their subjective threat ratings. Effects were largest
   for neutral faces, highlighting the importance of examining neutral
   faces in the pathophysiology of autism and questioning their use as
   control stimuli with this population. Overall, our findings provide
   support for the notion that gaze direction modulates affective response
   to faces in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Branding and advertising have a powerful effect on both familiarity and
   preference for products, yet no neuroimaging studies have examined
   neural response to logos in children. Food advertising is particularly
   pervasive and effective in manipulating choices in children. The purpose
   of this study was to examine how healthy children's brains respond to
   common food and other logos. A pilot validation study was first
   conducted with 32 children to select the most culturally familiar logos,
   and to match food and non-food logos on valence and intensity. A new
   sample of 17 healthy weight children were then scanned using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Food logos compared to baseline were
   associated with increased activation in orbitofrontal cortex and
   inferior prefrontal cortex. Compared to non-food logos, food logos
   elicited increased activation in posterior cingulate cortex. Results
   confirmed that food logos activate some brain regions in children known
   to be associated with motivation. This marks the first study in children
   to examine brain responses to culturally familiar logos. Considering the
   pervasiveness of advertising, research should further investigate how
   children respond at the neural level to marketing.}},

Abstract = {{Social cognition provides humans with the necessary skills to understand
   and interact with one another. One aspect of social cognition,
   mentalizing, is associated with a network of brain regions often
   referred to as the `social brain.' These consist of medial prefrontal
   cortex {[}medial Brodmann Area 10 (mBA10)], temporoparietal junction
   (TPJ), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and anterior temporal
   cortex (ATC). How these specific regions develop structurally across
   late childhood and adolescence is not well established. This study
   examined the structural developmental trajectories of social brain
   regions in the longest ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of human
   brain maturation. Structural trajectories of grey matter volume,
   cortical thickness and surface area were analyzed using surface-based
   cortical reconstruction software and mixed modeling in a longitudinal
   sample of 288 participants (ages 7-30 years, 857 total scans). Grey
   matter volume and cortical thickness in mBA10, TPJ and pSTS decreased
   from childhood into the early twenties. The ATC increased in grey matter
   volume until adolescence and in cortical thickness until early
   adulthood. Surface area for each region followed a cubic trajectory,
   peaking in early or pre-adolescence before decreasing into the early
   twenties. These results are discussed in the context of developmental
   changes in social cognition across adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we describe the ideas and circumstances that led to the
   experiment demonstrating a triple dissociation of memory systems. We
   then move on to discuss the results of 20 years of investigation of
   those ideas. First, evidence is described from animal studies consistent
   with the ideas that memory for different kinds of information is stored
   in different brain systems, and that the hippocampus, amygdala, and
   dorsal striatum are each central structures in one of the systems. We
   then focus on the 3 tasks used in the original triple dissociation:
   win-stay learning, conditioned cue preference, and win-shift learning.
   Each of these tasks is specific to behavior resulting from the type of
   information stored in one of the systems, but the use of other
   behavioral tests that are sensitive to the types of information stored
   in other systems has revealed that, in each case, other types of
   information are acquired in parallel. Next, evidence consistent with the
   idea that the outputs of the systems compete for control of behavior is
   discussed together with alternative forms of more direct interactions
   among the systems. Finally, some evidence that many of these ideas about
   multiple parallel memory systems may apply to humans is reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the respective roles of the hippocampus, the

   of experimental conditions for studying the effects of lesions to the
   three brain areas using an 8-arm radial maze was used: a win-shift
   version, a conditioned cue preference (CCP) version, and a win-stay
   version. Damage to the hippocampal system impaired acquisition of the
   win-shift task but not the CCP or win-stay tasks. Damage to the lateral
   amygdala impaired acquisition of the CCP task but not the win-shift or

   the win-stay task but not the win-shift or CCP tasks. These results are
   consistent with the hypothesis that the mammalian brain may be capable
   of acquiring different kinds of information with different, more-or-less
   independent neural systems. A neural system that includes the
   hippocampus may acquire information about the relationships among
   stimuli and events. A neural system that includes the amygdala may

Abstract = {{A considerable amount of research has demonstrated that animals can use
   different strategies when learning about, and navigating within, their
   environment. Since the influential research of Packard and McGaugh
   (1996), it has been widely accepted that, early in learning, rats use a
   flexible dorsal hippocampal-dependent place strategy. As learning
   progresses, they switch to a less effortful and more automatic
   dorsolateral caudate-dependent response strategy. However, supporting
   literature is dominated by the use of appetitively motivated tasks,
   using food reward. Because motivation often plays a crucial role in
   guiding learning, memory, and behavior, we examined spatial learning
   strategies of rats in an escape-motivated submerged T-maze. In
   Experiment 1, we observed rapid learning and the opposite pattern as
   that reported in appetitively motivated tasks. Rats exhibited a response
   strategy early in learning before switching to a place strategy, which
   persisted over extensive training. In Experiment 2, we replicated
   Packard and McGaugh's (1996) observations, using the apparatus and
   procedures as in Experiment 1, but with food reward instead of water
   escape. Mechanisms for, and implications of, this motivational
   modulation of spatial learning strategy are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Working memory depends on communication between the hippocampus and the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, the neural circuitry that mediates
   interactions between these brain areas has not been well characterized.
   Two candidate structures are the thalamic reuniens (RE) and rhomboid
   (Rh) nuclei, which are reciprocally connected with both the hippocampus
   and PFC. These known anatomical connections suggest that RE/Rh may be
   involved in mediating hippocampal-prefrontal communication, and
   therefore may be critical for working memory processing. To test the
   hypothesis that RE/Rh are necessary for working memory, we trained
   separate groups of rats to perform 1 of 2 tasks in a T-maze. The first
   task was a working memory-dependent conditional discrimination (CDWM)
   task, and the second task was a nonworking memory-dependent conditional
   discrimination (CD) task. These tasks took place in the same maze,
   featured the same number of trials, and utilized the same cue (a
   tactile-visual maze insert). After rats had learned either task, RE/Rh
   were transiently inactivated with the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol,
   and performance was assessed. RE/Rh inactivation caused performance
   deficits on the CDWM task, but not the CD task. This result suggests
   that RE/Rh are a necessary component of working memory task performance,
   which is also thought to depend on the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit.
   RE/Rh inactivation did not cause a performance deficit on the CD task,
   suggesting that RE/Rh have dissociable contributions to working
   memory-dependent and nonworking memory-dependent tasks, independently of
   the known contributions of these 2 thalamic nuclei to the sensorimotor
   and attention-related aspects of other memory tasks.}},

Abstract = {{The head-direction (HD) signal is believed to originate in the dorsal
   tegmental nucleus (DTN) and lesions to this structure have been shown to
   disrupt HD cell firing in other areas along the HD cell circuit. To
   investigate the role of the DTN in spatial navigation, rats with
   bilateral, electrolytic (Experiment 1), or neurotoxic (Experiment 2)
   lesions to the DTN were compared with sham controls on two tasks that
   differed in difficulty and could be solved using directional heading.
   Rats were first trained on a direction problem in a water T maze where
   they learned to travel either east or west from two locations in the
   experimental room. DTN-lesioned rats were impaired relative to sham
   controls, both early in training, on the first block of eight trials,
   and on the total trials taken to reach criterion. In the food-foraging
   task, rats were trained to leave a home cage at the periphery of a
   circular table, find food in the center of the table and return to the
   home cage. Again, DTN-lesioned rats were impaired relative to sham rats,
   making more errors on the return component of the foraging trip. These
   data extend previous cell-recording studies and behavioral tests in
   which rats with electrolytic DTN lesions were used, and they demonstrate
   the importance of the direction system to spatial learning.}},

Abstract = {{We report the results of a study based on 1,428 patients with eating
   disorders treated at 6 clinics. These patients were consecutively
   referred over 18 years and used inpatient and outpatient treatment. The
   subjects were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or an
   eating disorder not otherwise specified. Patients practiced a normal
   eating pattern with computerized feedback technology, they were supplied
   with external heat, their physical activity was reduced, and their
   social habits restored to allow them to return to their normal life. The
   estimated rate of remission for this therapy was 75\% after a median of
   12.5 months of treatment. A competing event such as the termination of
   insurance coverage, or failure of the treatment, interfered with
   outcomes in 16\% of the patients, and the other patients remained in
   treatment. Of those who went in remission, the estimated rate of relapse
   was 10\% over 5 years of follow-up and there was no mortality. These
   data replicate the outcomes reported in our previous studies and they
   compare favorably with the poor long-term remission rates, the high rate
   of relapse, and the high mortality rate reported with standard
   treatments for eating disorders.}},

Title = {{Dissociation of Thirst and Sodium Appetite in the Furo/Cap Model of
   Extracellular Dehydration and a Role for N-methyl-D-aspartate Receptors
   in the Sensitization of Sodium Appetite}},

Abstract = {{Depletion of extracellular fluids motivates many animals to seek out and
   ingest water and sodium. Animals with a history of extracellular
   dehydration display enhanced sodium appetite and, in some cases, thirst.
   The progressive increase in sodium intake induced by repeated sodium
   depletions is known as sensitization of sodium appetite. Administration
   of the diuretic and natriuretic drug, furosemide, along with a low dose
   of captopril (furo/cap), elicits thirst and a rapid onset of sodium
   appetite. In the present studies the furo/cap model was used to explore
   the physiological mechanisms of sensitization of sodium appetite.
   However, when thirst and sodium appetite were measured concurrently in
   the furo/cap model, individual rats exhibited sensitization of either
   thirst or sodium appetite. In subsequent studies, thirst and sodium
   appetite were dissociated by offering either water prior to sodium or
   sodium before water. When water and sodium intake were dissociated in
   time, the furo/cap model reliably produced sensitization of sodium
   appetite. It is likely that neuroplasticity mediates this sensitization.
   Glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) activation is
   critical for the development of most forms of neuroplasticity.
   Therefore, we hypothesized that integrity of NMDA-R function is
   necessary for the sensitization of sodium appetite. Pharmacological
   blockade of NMDA-Rs with systemic administration of MK-801 (0.15 mg/kg)
   prevented the sensitization of fluid intake in general when water and
   sodium were offered concurrently, and prevented sensitization of sodium
   intake specifically when water and sodium intake were dissociated. The
   involvement of NMDA-Rs provides support for the possibility that
   sensitization of sodium appetite is mediated by neuroplasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Nicotine and ethyl alcohol (EtOH) interact neurophysiologically and
   induce internal sensory states that contribute to their coabuse.
   Evaluating the combined internal sensory effects of nicotine and alcohol
   may be important for understanding this nexus. With rats, this
   investigation used an operant drug discrimination procedure to establish
   discriminative stimulus control with a mixture of nicotine plus EtOH
   (NE) at doses of nicotine (0.3 mg/kg) and EtOH (1.0g/kg) that have
   previously been shown to be equally salient (Gauvin \& Holloway, 1993).
   In Experiment (Exp) 1 the NE compound mixture continued to evoke
   responding despite extinction of responding with nicotine and EtOH
   alone. In Exp 2 the NE mixture was reliably discriminated from the
   nicotine and EtOH elements. Experiment 3 showed that the discriminative
   functions of the NE mixture emerged when the nicotine and EtOH elements
   were combined following their initial establishment as separate
   discriminative stimuli; however, nicotine evoked more control than EtOH.
   Extinction of responding with the NE mixture impacted rates of
   responding with nicotine and EtOH alone. The results of the all three
   studies parallel findings with exteroceptive Pavlovian literature in
   showing that extinction of responding with the elemental parts does not
   appear to impact the whole-but, extinction with the whole appears to
   affect its parts. The multielement discriminative function of a NE
   mixture appears to be a ``unique cue{''} that differs qualitatively from
   nicotine or EtOH alone. Associative factors related to compound
   conditioning (i.e., configural learning) play an important role in
   mediating the discriminative functions of drug mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the pattern of gene expression in brains associated with
   mothering during the postpartum period, in the present study we assessed
   gene expression through microarrays in four groups of female rats: two
   groups of new mothers that were experiencing the hormonal and
   neurochemical changes associated with pregnancy and parturition, and two
   groups of virgin females that were not. Within each of these parity
   groups we assessed one group of animals that was exposed to and
   responded to pups and engaged in maternal behavior, and one group left
   without any exposure to pups and therefore had no maternal experience.
   We explored the pattern of expression of genes related to the hormones,
   neurotransmitters, and modulatory neuropeptides associated with maternal
   behavior within the medial preoptic area (MPOA) and the medial amygdala
   (MeA) in the rat. Within the MPOA there were significant main effects of
   pup exposure for the dopamine-related genes (DRD4 and dopamine
   transporter, DAT), the glucocorticoid-related gene (CYPX1B1a), the
   opioid receptor mu-1 gene (OPRM1) and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
   receptor gene (GABAbRid). OPRM1 and the serotonin-related gene that
   regulates biosynthesis of serotonin (5HTR2A) showed a main effect of
   parity. For both sets of analyses, higher gene expression was associated
   with pup exposure and parity. Genes expressed in the MeA tended to
   reside in the glucocorticoid family. The microarrays were able to
   identify, on a transcriptional level, a list of candidate genes involved
   in maternal behavior and the factors that surround it.}},

Abstract = {{Rodents rely heavily on odor detection, discrimination, and memory to
   locate food, find mates, care for pups, and avoid predators. Estrogens
   have been shown to increase memory retention in rodents performing
   spatial memory and object placement tasks. Here we evaluate the extent
   to which 17 beta-estradiol modulates memory formation and duration in
   the olfactory system. Adult CD-1 mice were gonadectomized and given
   either systemic 17 beta-estradiol replacement, local 17 beta-estradiol
   in the main olfactory bulb, or no replacement. Before performing the
   behavioral task the mice were given saline or PHTPP (an estrogen
   receptor beta {[}ER-beta] antagonist) via bilateral infusion into the
   main olfactory bulb. As the beta-type estrogen receptor (ER-beta) is
   more abundant than the alpha-type estrogen receptor in the murine main
   olfactory bulb, the current study focuses on 17 beta-estradiol and its
   interactions with ER beta. Habituation, a simple, nonassociative
   learning task in which an animal is exposed to the same odor over
   successive presentations, was used to evaluate the animals' ability to
   detect odors and form an olfactory memory. To evaluate memory duration,
   we added a final trial of intertrial interval time (30 or 60 min) in
   which we presented the habituated odor. Neither surgical nor drug
   manipulation affected the ability of mice to detect or habituate to an
   odor. After habituation, gonadectomized 17 beta-estradiol-treated mice
   retained memory of an odor for 30 min, whereas non-estradiol-treated, 17
   beta-estradiol+ER beta antagonist (PHTPP), and untreated male mice did
   not remember an odor 30 min after habituation. The results show that
   both systemic and local bulbar infusions of 17 beta-estradiol enhance
   odor memory duration in mice.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has demonstrated that glucose administration improves
   memory performance. These glucose facilitation effects have been most
   reliably demonstrated in medial temporal lobe tasks with the greatest
   effects found for cognitively demanding tasks. The aim of the proposed
   research was to first explore whether such effects might be demonstrated
   in a frontal lobe task. A second aim was to investigate whether any
   beneficial effects of glucose may arise more prominently under tasks of
   increasing cognitive demand. To achieve these aims, the Stroop Task was
   administered to participants and effects of a drink of glucose (25 g)
   were compared with an aspartame-sweetened control drink on performance
   in young adults. Results demonstrated that glucose ingestion
   significantly reduced RTs in the congruent and incongruent conditions.
   No effect on error rates was observed. Of most importance was the
   finding that this glucose facilitative effect was significantly greatest
   in the most cognitively demanding task, that is, the incongruent
   condition. The present results support the contention that the glucose
   facilitation effect is most robust under conditions of enhanced task
   difficulty and demonstrate that such benefits extend to frontal lobe
   function.}},

Abstract = {{Humans today are routinely and increasingly presented with vast
   quantities of data that challenge their capacity for efficient
   processing. To restore the balance between man and machine, it is
   worthwhile to explore new methods for enhancing or accelerating this
   capacity. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of
   transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS) to reduce training time and increase
   proficiency in spatial recognition using a simulated synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) task. Twenty-seven Air Force active duty members volunteered
   to participate in the study. Each participant was assigned to 1 of 3
   stimulation groups and received two, 90-min training sessions on a
   target search and identification task using SAR imagery followed by a
   test. The tDCS anode was applied to site F10 according to the 10-20
   electroencephalographic electrode convention while the cathode was
   placed on the contralateral bicep. Group 1 received anodal tDCS at 2 mA
   for 30 min in the first training session and sham tDCS in the second
   session. Group 2 received the stimulation conditions in the opposite
   order. Group 3 did not receive stimulation at all. Results showed that
   participants receiving training plus tDCS attained visual search
   accuracies similar to 25\% higher than those provided with sham
   stimulation or no stimulation. However, a corresponding performance
   improvement was not found in the first training session for the change
   detection portion of the task. This indicates that experience with the
   imagery is important in the tDCS-elicited performance improvements in
   change detection.}},

Abstract = {{Repetition has long been known to facilitate memory performance, but its
   effects on event-related potentials (ERPs), measured as an index of
   recognition memory, are less well characterized. In Experiment 1,
   effects of both massed and distributed repetition on old-new ERPs were
   assessed during an immediate recognition test that followed incidental
   encoding of natural scenes that also varied in emotionality. Distributed
   repetition at encoding enhanced both memory performance and the
   amplitude of an old-new ERP difference over centro-parietal sensors. To
   assess whether these repetition effects reflect encoding or retrieval
   differences, the recognition task was replaced with passive viewing of
   old and new pictures in Experiment 2. In the absence of an explicit
   recognition task, ERPs were completely unaffected by repetition at
   encoding, and only emotional pictures prompted a modestly enhanced
   old-new difference. Taken together, the data suggest that repetition
   facilitates retrieval processes and that, in the absence of an explicit
   recognition task, differences in old-new ERPs are only apparent for
   affective cues.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Maternal care (MC) and dopamine modulate brain activity
   during emotion processing in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), striatum and
   amygdala. Reuptake of dopamine from the synapse is performed by the
   dopamine transporter (DAT), whose abundance is predicted by variation in
   its gene (DAT 3'VNTR; 10 > 9-repeat alleles). Here, we investigated the
   interaction between perceived MC and DAT 3'VNTR genotype on brain
   activity during processing of aversive facial emotional stimuli.
   Methods: Sixty-one healthy subjects were genotyped for DAT 3'VNTR and
   categorized in low and high MC individuals. They underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging while performing a task requiring gender
   discrimination of facial stimuli with angry, fearful or neutral
   expressions.
   Results: An interaction between facial expression, DAT genotype and MC
   was found in left IFG, such that low MC and homozygosity for the
   10-repeat allele are associated with greater activity during processing
   of fearful faces. This greater activity was also inversely correlated
   with a measure of emotion control as scored with the Big Five
   Questionnaire. Moreover, MC and DAT genotype described a double
   dissociation on functional connectivity between IFG and amygdala.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that perceived early parental bonding
   may interact with DAT 3'VNTR genotype in modulating brain activity
   during emotionally relevant inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Brief periods of unconscious thought (UT) have been shown to improve
   decision making compared with making an immediate decision (ID). We
   reveal a neural mechanism for UT in decision making using blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Participants (N = 33) encoded information on a set of consumer products
   (e.g. 48 attributes describing four different cars), and we manipulated
   whether participants (i) consciously thought about this information
   (conscious thought), (ii) completed a difficult 2-back working memory
   task (UT) or (iii) made an immediate decision about the consumer
   products (ID) in a within-subjects blocked design. To differentiate UT
   neural activity from 2-back working memory neural activity, participants
   completed an independent 2-back task and this neural activity was
   subtracted from neural activity occurring during the UT 2-back task.
   Consistent with a neural reactivation account, we found that the same
   regions activated during the encoding of complex decision information
   (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left intermediate visual
   cortex) continued to be activated during a subsequent 2-min UT period.
   Moreover, neural reactivation in these regions was predictive of
   subsequent behavioral decision-making performance after the UT period.
   These results provide initial evidence for post-encoding unconscious
   neural reactivation in facilitating decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Social categorization is known to be an important part of social
   cognition. The categorizations we use, despite their multitude,
   frequently take the form of the general ingroup/outgroup distinction. A
   meta-analysis of 33 fMRI studies, reporting selective activations to
   various social groups, was used to identify common neural structures
   responsible for relational representation of social structure.
   Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) analysis revealed areas in
   bilateral amygdala, cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, right TPJ and right
   insula as implementing various aspects of social categorization.
   Activation of amygdala can be associated with modulation of behavioral
   response to subjectively significant stimuli. A more ventral part of
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) can be associated with self-referential
   reasoning about ingroup members while a more dorsal part of ACC is
   involved in the regulation of emotions toward outgroup members. Right
   insula can be engaged in the modulation of outgroup avoidance behavior.
   Fusiform gyrus (FG) appears to be directly involved in social
   categorization process via top-down modulation of social perception. Yet
   it is difficult to associate any of the revealed clusters with the
   relational ingroup/outgroup structure.}},

Abstract = {{Humans tend to have a positive self-evaluation (PSE). To what extent
   positive self-perception is interacting with valenced self-related
   memories is debated. The underlying neural substrates are not adequately
   explained yet. To explore the cerebral correlates of PSE and its
   influence on memory, 24 healthy subjects were asked during fMRI to
   decide in two conditions whether presented positive and negative
   personality traits characterized their own selves (self-evaluation) or
   an intimate other (other-evaluation). A lexical condition served as
   control task. In a subsequent unannounced recognition task, trait
   adjectives had to be classified as old or new. Activation during
   positive self- vs positive other-evaluation was found in the medial
   ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal gyri, the parahippocampus and the
   supplementary motor area. Memory increased for positive personality
   traits and traits that had been referred to oneself or the other. In
   contrast to adjectives of the other-evaluation or lexical condition,
   recollection of negative vs positive traits of the self-evaluation
   condition specifically induced increased activation in the hippocampus
   and several prefrontal and temporal areas. Our data imply a specific
   network for PSE (although intimate others are perceived similarly).
   Moreover, memory for traits contradicting PSE resulted in activation
   increases indicating greater cognitive effort and emotional involvement.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperation and betrayal are universal features of social interactions,
   and knowing who to trust is vital in human society. Previous studies
   have identified brain regions engaged by decision making during social
   encounters, but the mechanisms supporting modification of future
   behaviour by utilizing social experience are not well characterized.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that
   cooperation and betrayal during social exchanges elicit specific
   patterns of neural activity associated with future behaviour.
   Unanticipated cooperation leads to greater behavioural adaptation than
   unexpected betrayal, and is signalled by specific neural responses in
   the striatum and midbrain. Neural responses to betrayal and willingness
   to trust novel partners both decrease as the number of individuals
   encountered during repeated social encounters increases. We propose
   that, as social groups increase in size, uncooperative or untrustworthy
   behaviour becomes progressively less surprising, with cooperation
   becoming increasingly important as a stimulus for social learning.
   Effects on reputation of non-trusting decisions may also act to drive
   pro-social behaviour. Our findings characterize the dynamic neural
   processes underlying social adaptation, and suggest that the brain is
   optimized to cooperate with trustworthy partners, rather than avoiding
   those who might betray us.}},

Abstract = {{Unhappy couple relationships are associated with impaired individual
   health, an effect thought to be mediated through ongoing couple
   conflicts. Little is known, however, about the underlying mechanisms
   regulating psychobiological stress, and particularly autonomic nervous
   system (ANS) reactivity, during negative couple interaction. In this
   study, we tested the effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin on ANS
   reactivity during couple conflict in a standardized laboratory paradigm.
   In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 47 heterosexual couples
   (total n = 94) received oxytocin or placebo intranasally prior to
   instructed couple conflict. Participants' behavior was videotaped and
   salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), a measure of sympathetic activity, and
   emotional arousal were repeatedly measured during the experiment.
   Oxytocin significantly reduced sAA during couple conflict in women,
   whereas men showed increases in sAA levels (sex x group interaction: B =
   -49.36, t = -2.68, P = 0.009). In men, these increases were related to
   augmented emotional arousal (r = 0.286, P = 0.028) and more positive
   behavior (r = 0.291, P = 0.026), whereas there was no such association
   in women. Our results imply sex-specific effects of oxytocin on
   sympathetic activity, to negative couple interaction, with the
   neuropeptide reducing sAA responses and emotional arousal in women while
   increasing them in men.}},

Abstract = {{It is a unique human ability to regulate negative thoughts and feelings.
   Two well-investigated emotion-regulation strategies (ERSs), cognitive
   reappraisal and expressive suppression, are associated with overlapping
   prefrontal neural correlates, but differ temporally during the
   emotion-generation process. Although functional imaging studies have
   mainly investigated these ERS as a reaction to an emotion-inducing
   event, the intention to regulate upcoming negative emotions might
   already be associated with differences in neural activity. Hence,
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging was recorded in 42
   participants while they completed an emotion-regulation paradigm. During
   this task, participants were instructed to proactively prepare to use a
   specific ERS knowing that a negative, high-arousing image would appear
   after the preparation period. As expected, the results demonstrated
   prefrontal and parietal activation while participants were suppressing
   or reappraising their emotions (family-wise error (FWE)-corrected). The
   intention to suppress emotions was associated with increased activation
   in the right inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral putamen,
   pre-supplementary motor area and right supramarginal gyrus
   (FWE-corrected). This enhanced proactive inhibitory control: (i)
   predicted decreased motoric activity during the actual suppression of
   emotional expressions and (2) trended toward a significant association
   with how successfully participants suppressed their emotions. However,
   neural correlates of preparatory control for cognitive reappraisal were
   not observed, possibly because contextual cues about the upcoming
   emotional stimulus are necessary to proactively start to cognitively
   reinterpret the situation.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to cognitively regulate emotional responses to aversive
   events is essential for mental and physical health. One prerequisite of
   successful emotion regulation is the awareness of emotional states,
   which in turn is associated with the awareness of bodily signals
   {[}interoceptive awareness (IA)]. This study investigated the neural
   dynamics of reappraisal of emotional responses in 28 participants who
   differed with respect to IA. Electroencephalography was used to
   characterize the time course of emotion regulation. We found that
   reappraisal was accompanied by reduced arousal and significant
   modulation of late neural responses. What is more, higher IA facilitated
   downregulation of affect and was associated with more pronounced
   modulation of underlying neural activity. Therefore, we conclude that IA
   not only advances the consolidation of somatic markers required for
   guiding individual behaviour but also creates processing advantages in
   tasks referring to these bodily markers.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) has been related to impaired processing of
   emotional speech intonation (emotional prosody). One distinctive feature
   of idiopathic PD is motor symptom asymmetry, with striatal dysfunction
   being strongest in the hemisphere contralateral to the most affected
   body side. It is still unclear whether this asymmetry may affect vocal
   emotion perception. Here, we tested 22 PD patients (10 with
   predominantly left-sided {[}LPD] and 12 with predominantly right-sided
   motor symptoms) and 22 healthy controls in an event-related potential
   study. Sentences conveying different emotional intonations were
   presented in lexical and pseudo-speech versions. Task varied between an
   explicit and an implicit instruction. Of specific interest was emotional
   salience detection from prosody, reflected in the P200 component. We
   predicted that patients with predominantly right-striatal dysfunction
   (LPD) would exhibit P200 alterations. Our results support this
   assumption. LPD patients showed enhanced P200 amplitudes, and specific
   deficits were observed for disgust prosody, explicit anger processing
   and implicit processing of happy prosody. Lexical speech was
   predominantly affected while the processing of pseudo-speech was largely
   intact. P200 amplitude in patients correlated significantly with left
   motor scores and asymmetry indices. The data suggest that emotional
   salience detection from prosody is affected by asymmetric neuronal
   degeneration in PD.}},

Abstract = {{Amygdala structural and functional abnormalities have been associated to
   reactive aggression in previous studies. However, the possible linkage
   of these two types of anomalies has not been examined. We hypothesized
   that they would coincide in the same localizations, would be correlated
   in intensity and would be mediated by reactive aggression personality
   traits. Here violent (n = 25) and non-violent (n = 29) men were
   recruited on the basis of their reactive aggression. Callous-unemotional
   (CU) traits were also assessed. Gray matter concentration (gmC) and
   reactivity to fearful and neutral facial expressions were measured in
   dorsal and ventral amygdala partitions. The difference between responses
   to fearful and neutral facial expressions was calculated
   (F/N-difference). Violent individuals exhibited a smaller F/N-difference
   and gmC in the left dorsal amygdala, where a significant coincidence was
   found in a conjunction analysis. Moreover, the left amygdala
   F/N-difference and gmC were correlated to each other, an effect mediated
   by reactive aggression but not by CU. The F/N-difference was caused by
   increased reactivity to neutral faces. This suggests that anatomical
   anomalies within local circuitry (and not only altered input) may
   underlie the amygdala hyper-reactivity to social signals which is
   characteristic of reactive aggression.}},

   that attention to race can result in deeper levels of processing for
   ingroup members. Conversely, N170s were larger to Black faces than White
   faces for participants who attended to the unique identity of the faces,
   suggesting that attention to identity can result in preferential
   recruitment of cognitive resources for outgroup members. Taken together,
   these findings suggest that race can differentially impact face

   activated the same brain regions among all participants (e.g. the left

Abstract = {{Facial expressions convey important emotional and social information and
   are frequently applied in investigations of human affective processing.
   Dynamic faces may provide higher ecological validity to examine
   perceptual and cognitive processing of facial expressions. Higher order
   processing of emotional faces was addressed by varying the task and
   virtual face models systematically. Blood oxygenation level-dependent
   activation was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging in
   20 healthy volunteers while viewing and evaluating either emotion or
   gender intensity of dynamic face stimuli. A general linear model
   analysis revealed that high valence activated a network of
   motion-responsive areas, indicating that visual motion areas support
   perceptual coding for the motion-based intensity of facial expressions.
   The comparison of emotion with gender discrimination task revealed
   increased activation of inferior parietal lobule, which highlights the
   involvement of parietal areas in processing of high level features of
   faces. Dynamic emotional stimuli may help to emphasize functions of the
   hypothesized `extended' over the `core' system for face processing.}},

   observed increased activation in the right amygdala, the right fusiform
   gyrus, anterior and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices, striatum,
   ventral tegmental area, and posterior parietal cortices. Incongruent
   responses to JA bids elicited increased activity localized to the right

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Males have been suggested to have advantages over females in reactions
   to child facial resemblance, which reflects the evolutionary pressure on
   males to solve the adaptive paternal uncertainty problem and to identify
   biological offspring. However, previous studies showed inconsistent
   results and the male advantage in child facial resemblance perception,
   as a kin detection mechanism, is still unclear. Here, we investigated
   the behavioral and brain mechanisms underlying the self-resembling faces
   processing and how it interacts with sex and age using event-related
   potential (ERP) technique. The results showed a stable male advantage in
   self-resembling child faces processing, such that males have higher
   detectability to self-resembling child faces than females. For ERP
   results, males showed smaller N2 and larger late positive component
   (LPC) amplitudes for self-resembling child faces, which may reflect
   face-matching and self-referential processing in kin detection,
   respectively. Further source analysis showed that the N2 component and
   LPC were originated from the anterior cingulate cortex and medial
   frontal gyrus, respectively. Our results support the male advantage in
   self-resembling child detection and further indicate that such
   distinctions can be found in both early and late processing stages in
   the brain at different regions.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the neural underpinnings of gender differences in cooperation
   and their modulation by intensive media watching. We compared
   cooperative decisions and electroencephalograph data between genders
   from who participated in repeated rounds of the public goods game (PGG)
   and investigated within groups changes that occurred after watching a TV
   program known as investigative reporting that denounces unfair
   advantages taken by free-riders against the public. Women tended to be
   more cooperative than men during early rounds of PGG, mostly because
   they react differently to the defection of others; women also had
   greater and band activity in regions estimated to be associated with
   social cognition. These gender differences disappeared after
   participants watched the TV programs: women were more likely to choose
   free-riding in response to the defection of others that elicits
   significant increases in band activities that were estimated to be right
   insula. Greater activity in social cognition leads women to make
   decisions considering the motives of others, while men tend to make a
   decision by complying with the social norm. Watching the investigative
   TV reports produced a greater negative emotion to the defection and led
   women, in a similar manner as men, to opt for a tit-for-tat strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of emotions on gaze-oriented attention was investigated in
   non-anxious participants. A neutral face cue with straight gaze was
   presented, which then averted its gaze to the side while remaining
   neutral or expressing an emotion (fear/surprise in Exp.1 and
   anger/happiness in Exp.2). Localization of a subsequent target was
   faster at the gazed-at location (congruent condition) than at the
   non-gazed-at location (incongruent condition). This Gaze-Orienting
   Effect (GOE) was enhanced for fear, surprise, and anger, compared to
   neutral expressions which did not differ from happy expressions. In
   addition, Event Related Potentials (ERPs) to the target showed a
   congruency effect on P1 for fear and surprise and a left lateralized
   congruency effect on P1 for happy faces, suggesting that target visual
   processing was also influenced by attention to gaze and emotions.
   Finally, at cue presentation, early postero-lateral (Early Directing
   Attention Negativity (EDAN)) and later antero-lateral (Anterior
   Directing Attention Negativity (ADAN)) attention-related ERP components
   were observed, reflecting, respectively, the shift of attention and its
   holding at gazed-at locations. These two components were not modulated
   by emotions. Together, these findings show that the processing of social
   signals such as gaze and facial expression interact rather late and in a
   complex manner to modulate spatial attention.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{601-620}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies using the event-related potential (ERP) technique have
   found that emotional expressions modulate ERP components appearing at
   different post-stimulus onset times and are indicative of different
   stages of face processing. With the aim of studying the time course of
   integration of context and facial expression information, we
   investigated whether these modulations are sensitive to the situational
   context in which emotional expressions are perceived. Participants were
   asked to identify the expression of target faces that were presented
   immediately after reading short sentences that described happy or
   anger-inducing situations. The main manipulation was the congruency
   between the emotional content of the sentences and the target
   expression. Context-independent amplitude modulation of the N170 and
   N400 components by emotional expression was observed. On the other hand,
   context effects appeared on a later component (late positive potential,
   or LPP), with enhanced amplitudes on incongruent trials. These results
   show that the early stages of face processing where emotional
   expressions are coded are not sensitive to verbal information about the
   situation in which they appear. The timing of context congruency effects
   suggests that integration of facial expression with situational
   information occurs at a later stage, probably related to the detection
   of affective congruency.}},

Abstract = {{Looming stimuli are processed as threatening and activate basic neural
   defense systems. However, it is unclear how animacy information
   modulates this response. Participants (N=25) viewed threatening or
   neutral images that were either animate (animals) or inanimate (objects)
   and which either approached (loomed) or receded from the participant.
   The amygdala was responsive to emotional, animacy, and looming
   information (particularly to looming threats and looming animate
   stimuli). Periaqueductal gray was also sensitive to emotional
   information and particularly responsive to looming threats. The data are
   interpreted within category-specific models of the amygdala and temporal
   cortex.}},

Abstract = {{The misfortunes of enviable individuals are met by observers with
   pleasure whereas those of average, non-enviable individuals elicit pain.
   These responses are mirrored in deservingness judgments, as enviable
   individuals' misfortunes are perceived as deserved and those of
   non-enviable individuals perceived as undeserved. However, the neural
   underpinnings of these deservingness disparities remain unknown. To
   explore this phenomenon, we utilized fMRI to test the hypotheses that
   (A) non-enviable targets' misfortunes would be associated with
   activation of brain regions that mediate empathic responding (pain
   matrix, mentalizing network) and not for enviable targets and (B) that
   activation of those regions would predict decreases in deservingness
   judgments. Supporting our first hypothesis, the misfortunes of
   non-enviable targets (as opposed to good fortunes) were associated with
   activation of the mentalizing network: medial prefrontal cortex,
   posterior cingulate cortex, temporal-parietal junction, and anterior
   temporal lobes. Supporting our second hypothesis, dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex activation from this contrast was negatively correlated with
   subsequent reports of how much the non-enviable target deserved his/her
   misfortune. These findings suggest that non-enviable individuals'
   misfortunes are perceived as unjust due, in part, to the recruitment of
   the mentalizing network.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{An adaptation paradigm was used to investigate the influence of a
   previously experienced visual context on the interpretation of ambiguous
   emotional expressions. Affective classification of fear-neutral
   ambiguous expressions was performed following repeated exposure to
   either fearful or neutral faces. There was a shift in the behavioral
   classification of morphs toward fear following adaptation to neutral
   compared to adaptation to fear with a nonsignificant trend toward the
   high-anxiety group compared to the low being more influenced by the
   context. The event-related potential (ERP) data revealed a more
   pronounced late positive potential (LPP), beginning at similar to 400ms
   poststimulus onset, in the high but not the low-anxiety group following
   adaptation to neutral compared to fear. In addition, as the size of the
   behavioral adaptation increased, there was a linear increase in the
   magnitude of the late-LPP. However, context-sensitivity effects are not
   restricted to trait anxiety, with similar effects observed with state
   anxiety and depression. These data support the proposal that negative
   moods are associated with increased sensitivity to visual contextual
   influences from top-down elaborative modulations, as reflected in an
   enhanced LPP deflection.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of the selective cholinergic toxin, 192 IgG-saporin,
   dramatically shaped subsequent research on the role of the basal
   forebrain in learning and memory. In particular, several articles
   (including the authors' 1995 Behavioral Neuroscience paper; M. G.
   Baxter, D. J. Bucci, L. K., Gorman, R. G. Wiley, \& M. Gallagher, 1995)
   revealed that selective removal of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons
   had surprisingly little effect on spatial learning and memory. Here, as
   part of the series commemorating the 30th anniversary of Behavioral
   Neuroscience, we describe how our earlier findings prompted a
   reconsideration of the cholinergic contribution to cognitive function
   and also led to several new research directions, including renewed
   interest in basal forebrain GABA-ergic neurons and cholinergic
   contributions to neurocognitive development. The authors also describe
   how the successful use of 192 IgG-saporin led to the development and
   popularity of a wide range of selective new neurotoxic agents. Finally,
   they consider the utility of the permanent lesion approach in the wake
   of new transgenic and optogenetic methods.}},

Abstract = {{In 1985, a brief report published in Behavioral Neuroscience established
   the link between neonatal handling and concentrations of hippocampal
   glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the adult rat, suggesting a
   neurobiological basis for the attenuated stress reactivity observed in
   handled versus nonhandled offspring. To celebrate the 30th anniversary
   of Behavioral Neuroscience, this article explores the research that
   preceded and followed from this brief but significant publication.
   Changes in hippocampal GR induced by handling were determined to be the
   outcome of a cascade of cellular and molecular events involving thyroid
   hormones, serotonin turnover, and transcription factor binding to the
   Nr3c1 gene, leading to increased GR mRNA and protein. Though many
   hypotheses were proposed for the ``handling effect,{''} the role of
   handling-induced changes in maternal care, particularly pup
   licking/grooming (LG), generated a productive scientific framework for
   understanding the handling phenomenon. Indeed, LG has since been
   demonstrated to alter GR levels through the signaling pathways described
   for handling. Moreover, epigenetic mechanisms have been discovered to
   play a critical role in the effects of early life experience and
   particularly in the regulation of Nr3c1. Overall, the research avenues
   that have evolved from the initial finding of handling-induced changes
   in GR have broad applications to our understanding of plasticity,
   resilience, and the transmission of traits across generations.}},

   receptor assay. 3H Dex binding was significantly higher in the
   hippocampus of both H-Soc and H-Isol than in NH groups. In the frontal
   cortex, 3H Dex binding was higher in the H-Soc animals than in the
   H-Isol and NH-Isol animals. There were no significant handling or
   housing effects found in the amygdala, hypothalamus, septum, or

   frontal cortex. These results are discussed as providing a possible

Abstract = {{In 1984, there was considerable evidence that the hippocampus was
   important for spatial learning and some evidence that it was also
   involved in duration discrimination. The article ``Hippocampus, Time,
   and Memory{''} (Meck, Church, \& Olton, 1984), however, was the first to
   isolate the effects of hippocampal damage on specific stages of temporal
   processing. In this review, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of
   Behavioral Neuroscience, we look back on factors that contributed to the
   long-lasting influence of this article. The major results were that a
   fimbria-fornix lesion (a) interferes with the ability to retain
   information in temporal working memory, and (b) distorts the content of
   temporal reference memory, but (c) did not decrease sensitivity to
   signal duration. This was the first lesion experiment in which the
   results were interpreted by a well-developed theory of behavior (scalar
   timing theory). It has led to extensive research on the role of the
   hippocampus in temporal processing by many investigators. The most
   important ones are the development of computational models with
   plausible neural mechanisms (such as the striatal beat-frequency model
   of interval timing), the use of multiple behavioral measures of timing,
   and empirical research on the neural mechanisms of timing and temporal
   memory using ensemble recording of neurons in
   prefrontal-striatal-hippocampal circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Five experiments were conducted to determine the effects of hippocampal
   damage on timing and the memory for temporal events. In Experiments 1-3,
   rats were trained to discriminate between auditory signals that differed
   in both duration (2 or 8 s) and rate (2 or 16 cycles/s). Half of the
   rats were trained to discriminate duration, and half were trained to
   discriminate rate. After rats acquired the relevant discrimination,
   signals with intermediate durations and rates were presented to obtain
   psychophysical functions that related signal duration and/or rate to
   response choice. Rats then received either lesions of the fimbria-fornix
   or control operations. Postoperatively, the accuracy of duration and
   rate discriminations as measured by the difference limen (DL) was
   unaffected by the lesion, but the point of subjective equality (PSE) was
   shifted to a shorter duration and a slower rate by the lesion in
   Experiment 1. Both rats with lesions and rats with control operations
   showed cross-modal transfer of duration and rate from the auditory
   signals used in training to visual signals used in testing in Experiment
   2. A 5-s delay was imposed between the end of a signal and the
   opportunity to respond in Experiment 3. The delay served as a retention
   interval for the rats trained in the rate discrimination, and the rats
   with fimbria-fornix lesions were selectively impaired by the addition of
   the delay as measured by an increase in the DL. The delay did not serve
   as a retention interval for rats trained in the duration discrimination
   because they were able to continue timing through the delay. A peak
   procedure was employed in Experiment 4. The maximum response rate of
   control rats was approximately at the time of scheduled reinforcement
   (20 s), but the maximum response rate of rats with fimbria-fornix
   lesions was reliably earlier than the time of scheduled reinforcement.
   When a 5-s gap was imposed in the signal, control rats summed the signal
   durations before and after the gap, whereas rats with fimbria-fornix
   lesions showed no retention of the signal duration prior to the gap.
   Experiment 5 continued the testing of the rats used in Experiments 1-4
   and showed that rats with lesions had an impairment in a test of spatial
   working memory in an eight-arm radial maze. Taken together, these
   results demonstrate that a fimbria-fornix lesion interferes with
   temporal and spatial working memory, reduces the remembered time of
   reinforcement stored in reference memory, and has no effect on the
   animal's sensitivity to stimulus duration.}},

Abstract = {{I argue here that we have succeeded in localizing an essential memory

   the entire essential circuit, using eyelid conditioning as the model
   system, and used reversible inactivation, during training, of critical
   structures and pathways to localize definitively the essential memory
   trace. In recognition of the 30th anniversary of Behavioral
   Neuroscience, I highlight 1 paper (Tracy, Thompson, Krupa, \& Thompson,
   1998) that was particularly significant for the progress of this
   research program. In this review, I present definitive evidence that the
   essential memory trace for eyelid conditioning is localized to the
   cerebellum and to no other part of the essential circuit, using
   electrical stimulation of the pontine nuclei-mossy fibers projecting to
   the cerebellum as the conditional stimulus (CS; it proved to be a
   supernormal stimulus resulting in much faster learning than with any
   peripheral CS) and using an electrical stimulus to the output of the

Abstract = {{Central cannabinoid-1 receptors (CB1R) play a role in the acquisition of
   delay eyeblink conditioning (EBC) but not trace EBC in humans and
   animals. However, it is not clear why trace conditioning is immune to
   the effects of cannabinoid receptor compounds. The current study
   examined the effects of variants of delay and trace conditioning
   procedures to elucidate the factors that determine the effects of CB1R
   agonists on EBC. In Experiment 1, rats were administered the cannabinoid
   agonist WIN55,212-2 during delay, long-delay, or trace conditioning.
   Rats were impaired during delay and long-delay, but not trace
   conditioning; the impairment was greater for long-delay than delay
   conditioning. Trace conditioning was further examined in Experiment 2 by
   manipulating the trace interval and keeping constant the conditioned
   stimulus (conditional stimulus {[} CS]) duration. It was found that when
   the trace interval was 300 ms or less, WIN55,212-2 administration
   impaired the rate of learning. Experiment 3 tested whether the trace
   interval duration or the relative durations of the CS and trace interval
   were critical parameters influencing the effects of WIN55,212-2 on EBC.
   Rats were not impaired with a 100-ms CS, 200-ms trace paradigm but were
   impaired with a 1,000-ms CS, 500-ms trace paradigm, indicating that the
   duration of the trace interval does not matter, but the proportion of
   the interstimulus interval occupied by the CS relative to the trace
   period is critical. Taken together, the results indicate that
   cannabinoid agonists affect cerebellar learning when the CS is longer
   than the trace interval.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that chronic early life stress results in
   precocious expression of the adult-like phenotype of fear retention and
   inhibition. However, it is unknown whether the experience of acute early
   trauma has the same effects as exposure to chronic early stress. In the
   present study, a 24-hr period of maternal deprivation on postnatal day
   (P) 9 was used as an acute early life stressor. In infancy (P16-17),
   maternally deprived and standard-reared rats were conditioned to fear a
   noise paired with shock. In Experiments 1 and 2, fear to the noise was
   then extinguished before rats were tested for context-mediated fear
   renewal or stress-induced fear reinstatement. In Experiments 3a and 3b,
   conditioned rats were tested for fear retention 1, 7, or 14 days after
   training. Whereas standard-reared infants exhibited relapse-resistant
   extinction and infantile amnesia (i.e., behaviors typical of their age),
   maternally deprived infants exhibited the renewal and reinstatement
   effects (i.e., relapse-prone extinction) and showed good retention of
   fear over the 7- and 14-day intervals (i.e., infantile amnesia was
   reduced). In other words, similar to rats exposed to chronic early life
   stress, rats exposed to acute early stress expressed an adult-like
   profile of fear retention and inhibition during infancy. These findings
   suggest that similar mechanisms might be involved in the effects of
   acute and chronic stress on emotional development, and may have
   implications for our understanding and treatment of emotional disorders
   associated with early adversity.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has indicated that rearing in an enriched environment
   may promote self-control in an impulsive choice task. To further assess
   the effects of rearing environment on impulsivity, 2 experiments
   examined locomotor activity, impulsive action, impulsive choice, and
   different aspects of reward sensitivity and discrimination. In
   Experiment 1, rats reared in isolated or enriched conditions were tested
   on an impulsive choice procedure with a smaller-sooner versus a
   larger-later reward, revealing that the isolated rats valued the
   smaller-sooner reward more than the enriched rats. A subsequent reward
   challenge was presented in which the delay to the 2 rewards was the same
   but the magnitude difference remained. The enriched rats did not choose
   the larger reward as often as the isolated rats, reflecting poorer
   reward discrimination. Impulsive action was assessed using a
   differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate task, which revealed deficits in
   the enriched rats. In Experiment 2, rats reared in isolated, standard,
   or enriched conditions were tested on reward contrast and reward
   magnitude sensitivity procedures. The rats were presented with 2 levers
   that delivered different magnitudes of food on variable interval 30-s
   schedules. Across all tests, the enriched and social rats displayed more
   generalized responding to the small-reward lever, but a similar response
   to the large-reward lever, compared with the isolated rats. This
   confirmed the results of Experiment 1, indicating poorer reward
   discrimination in the enriched condition compared with the isolated
   condition. The results suggest that enrichment may moderate reward
   generalization/discrimination processes through alterations in incentive
   motivational processes.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have pointed to vulnerability to stress and stress-related
   pathologies at different timepoints during an individual's life span.
   These sensitive windows are usually during periods of neural
   development, such as embryogenesis, infancy, and adolescence. It is
   critical to understand how neural circuitry may change as an individual
   ages in ways that could affect susceptibility to stress. Here we compare
   two stages in Drosophila melanogaster: sexual immaturity and sexual
   maturity. We used the genetic resources available in Drosophila to
   manipulate pre- and postsynaptic dopamine signaling in sexually immature
   and mature animals that were then assayed for heart rate and locomotor
   behavior in response to starvation and oxidative stress. Our results
   show significant differences in the stress response for sexually
   immature and mature animals for heart rate, periods of high mobility,
   mean velocity, and several other parameters of locomotor behavior. Our
   data show that dopamine neurons are differentially recruited into the
   stress response circuitry for sexually immature and mature individuals.
   By observing behaviors that have been previously shown in mammalian
   models to be affected by stress and altered in models of affective
   disorders, we provide a genetically tractable model for development and
   maintenance of the stress response circuitry during sexual maturation.}},

Abstract = {{Several previous studies in mammalian systems have shown sexually
   dimorphic behaviors, neuroendocrine changes, and alterations in
   neurotransmitter release in response to stress. In addition, men and
   women are differentially vulnerable to stress-related pathologies, which
   have led to the hypothesis that the stress response circuitry differs
   depending on sex. The authors used the genetic tractability of
   Drosophila to manipulate pre- or postsynaptic dopamine signaling in
   transgenic animals, which were assayed for several parameters of
   locomotion and heart rate following exposure to 2 environmental
   stressors: starvation and oxidative stress. Their results show
   significant differences in the stress response for males and females by
   analyzing heart rate, centering time, and high mobility in addition to
   other locomotor parameters with translational relevance. These data
   demonstrate that both pre- and postsynaptic neurons are differentially
   recruited into the dopaminergic stress response circuitry for males and
   females. The results also show that the response circuits differ
   depending on the stressor and behavioral output. Furthermore, the
   authors' studies provide a translatable Drosophila model for further
   elucidation of factors involved in the sexually dimorphic recruitment of
   neurons into the stress response circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{Exercise has been demonstrated to improve multiple facets of health,
   including cognitive function. Rodent studies have suggested that
   exercise has robust effects on the hippocampus and on tasks that require
   the hippocampus. However, studies of the effects of exercise in humans
   often focus on the benefits to cognitive processes that engage areas
   outside of the hippocampus, such as executive function. Additionally,
   when exercise's cognitive benefits are examined, consideration of both
   males and females, and gonadal hormones, is rarely made. Here we looked
   at the interaction of gonadal hormones and exercise in terms of the
   ability of male and female rats to learn to discriminate rewarded from
   unrewarded arms in a T maze based on either brightness (white vs. black)
   or texture (rough vs. smooth) and then to set-shift (a measure of
   executive function), where this required discrimination is based on the
   opposite dimension. Gonadectomized or intact males and females had
   access to running wheels for 2 weeks before being tested. Intact males
   and females given access to unlocked running wheels performed better at
   the initial discrimination (Set 1) compared with intact males and
   females with locked running wheels but not at the set shift (Set 2). No
   advantage of exercise was observed in gonadectomized rats.}},

Abstract = {{A long-held view has been that interest of male mice in female body
   odors reflects an activation of reward circuits in the male brain
   following their detection by the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and processing
   via the accessory olfactory system. We found that adult, sexually naive
   male mice acquired a conditioned place preference (CPP) after repeatedly
   receiving estrous female urine on the nose and being placed in an
   initially nonpreferred chamber with soiled estrous bedding on the floor.
   CPP was not acquired in control mice that received saline on the nose
   before being placed in a nonpreferred chamber with clean bedding. Robust
   acquisition of a CPP using estrous female odors as the reward persisted
   in separate groups of mice in which VNO-accessory olfactory function was
   disrupted by bilateral lesioning of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB)
   or in which main olfactory function was disrupted by zinc sulfate
   lesions of the main olfactory epithelium (MOE). By contrast, no CPP was
   acquired for estrous odors in males that received combined AOB and MOE
   lesions. Either the main or the accessory olfactory system suffices to
   mediate the rewarding effects of estrous female odors in the male mouse,
   even in the absence of prior mating experience. The main olfactory
   system is part of the circuitry that responds to chemosignals involved
   in motivated behavior, a role that may be particularly important for
   humans who lack a functional accessory olfactory system.}},

Abstract = {{Data have suggested that rats avoid intake of an otherwise palatable
   saccharin cue when paired with a drug of abuse, at least, in part,
   because the value of the taste cue pales in anticipation of the
   availability of the highly rewarding drug. Earlier support for this
   hypothesis was provided by the finding that, relative to the less
   sensitive Fischer rats, Lewis rats exhibit greater avoidance of a
   saccharin cue when paired with a rewarding sucrose or cocaine
   unconditioned stimulus (US), but not when paired with the aversive
   agent, lithium chloride. More recent data, however, have shown that
   Fischer rats actually exhibit greater, not less, avoidance of the same
   saccharin cue when morphine serves as the US. Therefore, Experiment 1
   evaluated morphine-induced suppression of intake of the taste cue in
   Lewis and Fischer rats when the morphine US was administered
   subcutaneously, rather than intraperitoneally. Experiment 2 examined the
   effect of strain on the suppression of intake of the saccharin cue when
   paired with spiradoline, a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist. The
   results confirmed that Fischer rats are more responsive to the
   suppressive effects of morphine than Lewis rats, and that Fischer rats
   also exhibit greater avoidance of the saccharin cue when paired with
   spiradoline, despite the fact that spiradoline is devoid of reinforcing
   properties. Taken together, the data suggest that the facilitated
   morphine-induced suppression observed in Fischer rats, compared with
   Lewis rats, may reflect an increased sensitivity to the aversive,
   kappa-mediated properties of opiates.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past five decades, per capita caloric intake has increased by
   approximately 28\% in the United States. Excessive intake of calories
   from fats and sugars (high energy diets; HEDs) negatively impacts
   hippocampal-dependent memory. These deleterious effects of HEDs on
   hippocampal function involve HED-induced decreases in neuronal growth
   factors, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Given that HEDs also
   alter responses to emotional arousal, the present experiment determined
   whether the effects of HEDs on memory depend on the emotional arousal
   produced by the memory task during encoding. Rats were fed a high
   fat/sugar cafeteria-style diet for 4 weeks and then tested in a low or
   high emotional arousal version of a spatial object place recognition
   task. The results demonstrated that the HED prevented the
   memory-enhancing effects of emotional arousal. Thus, altered responses
   to emotional arousal likely contribute to HED-induced memory
   impairments, particularly in stressful memory tasks such as the spatial
   water maze.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to understand thoughts and feelings of another person is an

   faces. As prior studies outlined the importance of the oxytocin system
   for emotion recognition, the functional rs2268498 polymorphism on the
   OXTR-gene was investigated. Although there were no differences in
   reaction times between genotype groups, carriers of the T-allele
   exhibited more accurate recognition skills than subjects carrying the
   CC-genotype. There was no influence of gender or age. Results support
   recent findings, demonstrating the importance of the oxytocin system for

Abstract = {{Testing optokinetic head or eye movements is an established method to
   determine visual performance of laboratory animals, including chickens,
   guinea pigs, mice, or fish. It is based on the optokinetic reflex which
   causes the animals to track a drifting stripe pattern with eye and head
   movements. We have developed an improved version of the optomotor test
   with better control over the stimulus parameters, as well as a high
   degree of automation. The stripe pattern is presented on computer
   monitors surrounding the animal. By tracking the head position of freely
   moving animals in real time, the visual angle under which the stripes of
   the pattern appeared was kept constant even for changing head positions.
   Furthermore, an algorithm was developed for automated evaluation of the
   tracking performance of the animal. Comparing the automatically
   determined behavioral score with manual assessment of the animals'
   tracking behavior confirmed the reliability of our methodology. As an
   example, we reproduced the known contrast sensitivity function of wild
   type mice. Furthermore, the progressive decline in visual performance of
   a mouse model of retinal degeneration, rd10, was demonstrated.}},

Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{797-802}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Inspired in part by Gibson's (1979) ecological approach to perception,
   current neurocognitive theories of action suggest that the simple
   viewing of an object can automatically elicit motor programs for
   specific acts. However, the degree to which such affordances should be
   considered truly automatic is unknown. Here we explored the generation
   of motor plans afforded by pairs of cue objects that were viewed
   peripherally under different attentional states. Participants focused
   centrally while attending to just one of two peripheral cue objects that
   together had a strong significance for pinching, grasping, or both. They
   were instructed to ignore the objects and instead give power or
   precision grip responses to subsequent changes in background color. The
   data showed a significant interaction between type of response and type
   of object, indicating that object affordances are perceived even in
   nonfoveal vision. Critically, the generation of affordances was
   modulated by the locus of attention: Motor preparation was biased toward
   the attended object when two different categories of object appeared in
   the same trial, but the generation of affordances was also influenced by
   unattended stimuli. This finding demonstrates that object-action priming
   is not completely automatic, instead being constrained by processes of
   perceptual selection.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampus and thalamus assume a significant role in the overnight
   consolidation of memories, a process that is negatively impacted by
   sleep disruption. Emerging evidence suggests that disturbances of sleep
   in older people may co-occur with underlying neurobiological changes.
   This study sought to assess glial and neuronal integrity in these
   regions in relation to subjective sleep disturbance in a healthy older
   sample. Forty-three healthy older people (mean age = 70, SD = 5.0) were
   assessed clinically and medically and screened for cognitive and
   depressive symptoms, as well as sleep disturbance. Single voxel
   hippocampal and thalamus metabolite ratios of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)
   and myo-inositol (mI) with total creatine (Cr + PCr) were measured using
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3-Tesla. Higher hippocampal mI/Cr +
   PCr ratios were significantly correlated with poorer self-reported sleep
   quality (r = .42, p < .01) and less sleep efficiency (r = -0.42, p <
   .01) as recorded by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse,
   Reynolds, Monk, Berman, \& Kupfer, 1989). No other significant
   correlations were observed within the hippocampus or within the
   thalamus. These results indicate that in healthy older people,
   subjective sleep disturbance may be associated with glial alterations in
   the hippocampus. Future research is now needed to examine these
   associations with respect to objective sleep measures and overnight
   memory consolidation.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research suggests that people, when interacting with another
   agent, are sensitive to the other's visual perspective on the scene. The
   present study investigated how spontaneously another's different spatial
   perspective is taken into account and how this affects the processing of
   jointly attended stimuli. Participants viewed upright or inverted faces
   alone, next to another person (same spatial perspective), or opposite
   another person (different spatial perspectives) while
   electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The task (counting male
   faces) was in no way related to spatial aspects of the stimuli, and thus
   did not encourage perspective taking. EEG results revealed no general
   differences between viewing faces alone or with another person. However,
   when holding different perspectives (sitting opposite each other), the
   amplitudes of the N170 and of the N250 significantly increased for
   upright faces. This indicates that people spontaneously represented the
   other's different perspective, which led to higher demands for
   structural encoding (N170) and to increased allocation of attention to
   face recognition (N250) for stimuli that are typically processed
   configurally. When holding different spatial perspectives, thus, people
   may not merely represent that the other sees the object or scene
   differently, but how the object/scene looks for the other.}},

Abstract = {{Sensing others' emotions through subtle facial expressions is a highly
   important social skill. We investigated the effects of intranasal
   oxytocin treatment on the evaluation of explicit and `hidden' emotional
   expressions and related the results to individual differences in
   sensitivity to others' subtle expressions of anger and happiness. Forty
   healthy volunteers participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled
   crossover study, which shows that a single dose of intranasal oxytocin
   (40 IU) enhanced or `sharpened' evaluative processing of others'
   positive and negative facial expression for both explicit and hidden
   emotional information. Our results point to mechanisms that could
   underpin oxytocin's prosocial effects in humans. Importantly, individual
   differences in baseline emotional sensitivity predicted oxytocin's
   effects on the ability to sense differences between faces with hidden
   emotional information. Participants with low emotional sensitivity
   showed greater oxytocin-induced improvement. These participants also
   showed larger task-related pupil dilation, suggesting that they also
   allocated the most attentional resources to the task. Overall, oxytocin
   treatment enhanced stimulus-induced pupil dilation, consistent with
   oxytocin enhancement of attention towards socially relevant stimuli.
   Since pupil dilation can be associated with increased attractiveness and
   approach behaviour, this effect could also represent a mechanism by
   which oxytocin increases human affiliation.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Several theories suggest that people do not represent race when it does
   not signify group boundaries. However, race is often associated with
   visually salient differences in skin tone and facial features. In this
   study, we investigated whether race could be decoded from distributed
   patterns of neural activity in the fusiform gyri and early visual cortex
   when visual features that often covary with race were orthogonal to
   group membership. To this end, we used multivariate pattern analysis to
   examine an fMRI dataset that was collected while participants assigned
   to mixed-race groups categorized own-race and other-race faces as
   belonging to their newly assigned group. Whereas conventional univariate
   analyses provided no evidence of race-based responses in the fusiform
   gyri or early visual cortex, multivariate pattern analysis suggested
   that race was represented within these regions. Moreover, race was
   represented in the fusiform gyri to a greater extent than early visual
   cortex, suggesting that the fusiform gyri results do not merely reflect
   low-level perceptual information (e.g. color, contrast) from early
   visual cortex. These findings indicate that patterns of activation
   within specific regions of the visual cortex may represent race even
   when overall activation in these regions is not driven by racial
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Humans often change their beliefs or behavior due to the behavior or
   opinions of others. This study explored, with the use of human
   event-related potentials (ERPs), whether social conformity is based on a
   general performance-monitoring mechanism. We tested the hypothesis that
   conflicts with a normative group opinion evoke a feedback-related
   negativity (FRN) often associated with performance monitoring and
   subsequent adjustment of behavior. The experimental results show that
   individual judgments of facial attractiveness were adjusted in line with
   a normative group opinion. A mismatch between individual and group
   opinions triggered a frontocentral negative deflection with the maximum
   at 200 ms, similar to FRN. Overall, a conflict with a normative group
   opinion triggered a cascade of neuronal responses: from an earlier FRN
   response reflecting a conflict with the normative opinion to a later ERP
   component (peaking at 380 ms) reflecting a conforming behavioral
   adjustment. These results add to the growing literature on neuronal
   mechanisms of social influence by disentangling the conflict-monitoring
   signal in response to the perceived violation of social norms and the
   neural signal of a conforming behavioral adjustment.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of the two types of non-symbolic emotional stimuli most
   widely used in research on affective processes, faces and (non-facial)
   emotional scenes, to capture exogenous attention, was compared.
   Negative, positive and neutral faces and affective scenes were presented
   as distracters to 34 participants while they carried out a demanding
   digit categorization task. Behavioral (reaction times and number of
   errors) and electrophysiological (event-related potentials-ERPs) indices
   of exogenous attention were analyzed. Globally, facial expressions and
   emotional scenes showed similar capabilities to attract exogenous
   attention. Electrophysiologically, attentional capture was reflected in
   the P2a component of ERPs at the scalp level, and in left precentral
   areas at the source level. Negatively charged faces and scenes elicited
   maximal P2a/precentral gyrus activity. In the case of scenes, this
   negativity bias was also evident at the behavioral level. Additionally,
   a specific effect of facial distracters was observed in N170 at the
   scalp level, and in the fusiform gyrus and inferior parietal lobule at
   the source level. This effect revealed maximal attention to positive
   expressions. This facial positivity offset was also observed at the
   behavioral level. Taken together, the present results indicate that
   faces and non-facial scenes elicit partially different and, to some
   extent, complementary exogenous attention mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Social transmission of knowledge is one of the reasons for human

   infants possess eminent social learning abilities. However, nothing is
   known about the neurocognitive mechanisms that subserve infants'
   acquisition of novel action knowledge through the observation of other
   people's actions and their consequences in the physical world. In an
   electroencephalogram study on social learning in infancy, we demonstrate
   that 9-month-old infants represent the environmental effects of others'
   actions in their own motor system, although they never achieved these
   effects themselves before. The results provide first insights into the
   neurocognitive basis of human infants' unique ability for social

Abstract = {{Faced with a moral dilemma, conflict arises between a cognitive
   controlled response aimed at maximizing welfare, i.e. the utilitarian
   judgment, and an emotional aversion to harm, i.e. the deontological
   judgment. In the present study, we investigated moral judgment in adult
   individuals with high functioning autism/Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS), a
   clinical population characterized by impairments in prosocial emotions
   and social cognition. In Experiment 1, we compared the response patterns
   of HFA/AS participants and neurotypical controls to moral dilemmas with
   low and high emotional saliency. We found that HFA/AS participants more
   frequently delivered the utilitarian judgment. Their perception of
   appropriateness of moral transgression was similar to that of controls,
   but HFA/AS participants reported decreased levels of emotional reaction
   to the dilemma. In Experiment 2, we explored the way in which
   demographic, clinical and social cognition variables including emotional
   and cognitive aspects of empathy and theory of mind influenced moral
   judgment. We found that utilitarian HFA/AS participants showed a
   decreased ability to infer other people's thoughts and to understand
   their intentions, as measured both by performance on neuropsychological
   tests and through dispositional measures. We conclude that greater
   prevalence of utilitarianism in HFA/AS is associated with difficulties
   in specific aspects of social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of social exclusion are far-reaching, both on an emotional
   and behavioral level. The present study investigates whether social
   exclusion also directly influences basic cognitive functions,
   specifically the ability to exert cognitive control. Participants were
   either excluded or included while playing an online game. To test
   whether exclusion altered cognitive control, we measured the
   electrophysiological responses to a Go/No Go task. In this task
   participants had to withhold a response (No Go) on a small number of
   trials while the predominant tendency was to make an overt (Go)
   response. Compared to Go trials the event-related potential evoked by No
   Go trials elicited an increased N2, reflecting the detection of the
   response conflict, followed by an increased P3, reflecting the
   inhibition of the predominant response. The N2 effect was larger for
   participants who had experienced exclusion, while the P3 effect was
   smaller. This indicates that exclusion leads to an increased ability to
   detect response conflicts, while at the same time exclusion decreases
   the neural processes that underlie the inhibition of unwanted behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Much past research has focused on how traits related to the behavioral
   inhibition system (BIS) and avoidance motivation influence the almost
   obligatory attentional processing of aversive stimuli as measured as
   early as 100 ms into stimulus processing. These results fit with the
   functional importance assigned to the negativity bias. But do traits
   related to the behavioral approach system (BAS) influence attentional
   processing with similar rapidity? The present study addressed this
   unanswered question by testing whether trait BAS relates to
   event-related potentials (ERP) involved in rapid motivated attentional
   processing to appetitive stimuli. Results indicated that individual
   differences in BAS were correlated with larger ERP amplitudes as early
   as 100 ms into the processing of appetitive pictures. These results
   provide the first evidence linking trait approach motivational
   tendencies to very early stages of motivated attentional processing.}},

Abstract = {{More than a decade of research has demonstrated that faces evoke
   prioritized processing in a `core face network' of three brain regions.
   However, whether these regions prioritize the detection of global facial
   form (shared by humans and mannequins) or the detection of life in a
   face has remained unclear. Here, we dissociate form-based and
   animacy-based encoding of faces by using animate and inanimate faces
   with human form (humans, mannequins) and dog form (real dogs, toy dogs).
   We used multivariate pattern analysis of BOLD responses to uncover the
   representational similarity space for each area in the core face
   network. Here, we show that only responses in the inferior occipital
   gyrus are organized by global facial form alone (human vs dog) while
   animacy becomes an additional organizational priority in later
   face-processing regions: the lateral fusiform gyri (latFG) and right
   superior temporal sulcus. Additionally, patterns evoked by human faces
   were maximally distinct from all other face categories in the latFG and
   parts of the extended face perception system. These results suggest that
   once a face configuration is perceived, faces are further scrutinized
   for whether the face is alive and worthy of social cognitive resources.}},

Abstract = {{Complex social emotions involve both abstract cognitions and bodily
   sensations, and individuals may differ on their relative reliance on
   these. We hypothesized that individuals' descriptions of their feelings
   during a semi-structured emotion induction interview would reveal two
   distinct psychological styles-a more abstract, cognitive style and a
   more body-based, affective style-and that these would be associated with
   somatosensory neural activity. We examined 28 participants' open-ended
   verbal responses to admiration- and compassion-provoking narratives in
   an interview and BOLD activity to the same narratives during subsequent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Consistent with
   hypotheses, individuals' affective and cognitive word use were stable
   across emotion conditions, negatively correlated and unrelated to
   reported emotion strength in the scanner. Greater use of affective
   relative to cognitive words predicted more activation in SI, SII, middle
   anterior cingulate cortex and insula during emotion trials. The results
   suggest that individuals' verbal descriptions of their feelings reflect
   differential recruitment of neural regions supporting physical body
   awareness. Although somatosensation has long been recognized as an
   important component of emotion processing, these results offer `proof of
   concept' that individual differences in open-ended speech reflect
   different processing styles at the neurobiological level. This study
   also demonstrates SI involvement during social emotional experience.}},

Abstract = {{Hemispheric lateralization of hedonic evaluation ('liking') and
   incentive motivation ('wanting') in neural networks connecting the basal
   ganglia and insula (BG-I) in humans was examined. Participants with
   brain damage restricted to the BG-I of the right (n = 5) or left (n = 5)
   hemisphere, and 26 healthy participants matched on age, sex and
   intelligence quotient were tested on positively and negatively valenced
   pictures drawn from varied stimulus categories (Vijayaraghavan et al.,
   2008). Liking was assessed with explicit ratings of pleasantness using a
   nine-point Likert scale. Wanting was quantified as the amount of work
   (via repeated keypresses) that participants expended to increase
   (approach) or decrease (withdraw) viewing time. Right-lesion patients
   showed abnormally low viewing times and liking ratings for positive
   images. For a subset of positive images depicting sexual content,
   right-lesion patients exhibited active withdrawal, while the other two
   groups approached such stimuli. These results suggest that the right
   basal ganglia-insula complex plays a greater role than the left in
   supporting hedonic evaluation and motivational approach to positively
   valenced stimuli. The finding that active avoidance of stimuli that were
   not `liked' was spared in both right- and left-sided lesion subjects
   suggests that unilateral damage to insula/basal ganglia circuits may not
   be sufficient to affect general incentive motivation independent of
   preference.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous event-related brain potential (ERP) studies reveal the
   differential processing of emotional and neutral stimuli. Yet, it is an
   ongoing debate to what extent the ERP components found in previous
   research are sensitive to physical stimulus characteristics or emotional
   meaning. This study manipulated emotional meaning and stimulus
   orientation to disentangle the impact of stimulus physics and semantics
   on emotional stimulus processing. Negative communicative hand gestures
   of Insult were contrasted with neutral control gestures of Allusion to
   manipulate emotional meaning. An elementary physical manipulation of
   visual processing was implemented by presenting these stimuli vertically
   and horizontally. The results showed dissociable effects of stimulus
   meaning and orientation on the sequence of ERP components. Effects of
   orientation were pronounced in the P1 and N170 time frames and
   attenuated during later stages. Emotional meaning affected the P1,
   evincing a distinct topography to orientation effects. Although the N170
   was not modulated by emotional meaning, the early posterior negativity
   and late positive potential components replicated previous findings with
   larger potentials elicited by the Insult gestures. These data suggest
   that the brain processes different attributes of an emotional picture in
   parallel and that a coarse semantic appreciation may already occur
   during relatively early stages of emotion perception.}},

Abstract = {{Rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) plays a central role in the
   pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). As we reported in
   our previous study (Wagner et al., 2006), patients with MDD were
   characterized by an inability to deactivate this region during cognitive
   processing leading to a compensatory prefrontal hyperactivation. This
   hyperactivation in rACC may be related to a deficient inhibitory control
   of negative self-referential processes, which in turn may interfere with
   cognitive control task execution and the underlying fronto-cingulate
   network activation. To test this assumption, a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study was conducted in 34 healthy subjects. Univariate
   and functional connectivity analyses in statistical parametric mapping
   software 8 were used. Self-referential stimuli and the Stroop task were
   presented in an event-related design. As hypothesized, rACC was
   specifically engaged during negative self-referential processing (SRP)
   and was significantly related to the degree of depressive symptoms in
   participants. BOLD signal in rACC showed increased valence-dependent
   (negative vs neutral SRP) interaction with BOLD signal in prefrontal and
   dorsal anterior cingulate regions during Stroop task performance. This
   result provides strong support for the notion that enhanced rACC
   interacts with brain regions involved in cognitive control processes and
   substantiates our previous interpretation of increased rACC and
   prefrontal activation in patients during Stroop task.}},

Abstract = {{The emotions displayed by others can be cues to predict their behavior.
   Happy expressions are usually linked to positive consequences, whereas
   angry faces are associated with probable negative outcomes. However,
   there are situations in which the expectations we generate do not hold.
   Here, control mechanisms must be put in place. We designed an
   interpersonal game in which participants received good or bad economic
   offers from several partners. A cue indicated whether the emotion of
   their partner could be trusted or not. Trustworthy partners with happy
   facial expressions were cooperative, and angry partners did not
   cooperate. Untrustworthy partners cooperated when their expression was
   angry and did not cooperate when they displayed a happy emotion.
   Event-Related Potential (ERP) results showed that executive attention
   already influenced the frontal N1. The brain initially processed
   emotional expressions regardless of their contextual meaning but by the
   N300, associated to affective evaluation, emotion was modulated by
   control mechanisms. Our results suggest a cascade of processing that
   starts with the instantiation of executive attention, continues by a
   default processing of emotional features and is then followed by an
   interaction between executive attention and emotional factors before
   decision-making and motor stages.}},

   instruments and buccal cells for standard 5-HTTLPR genotyping from 398

   associated with prosocial behavior and the effect was partially mediated
   by social anxiety, such that those carrying the S allele reported higher
   levels of social avoidance and lower rates of helping others. These
   results are consistent with accounts of the role of serotonin on anxiety

Abstract = {{The importance of differentiating between social concepts when
   appraising actions (e.g., understanding behavior as critical vs.
   fault-finding) and its contribution to vulnerability to major depressive
   disorder (MDD) is unknown. We predicted poor integration of
   differentiated conceptual knowledge when people with MDD appraise their
   social actions, contributing to their tendency to grossly overgeneralize
   self-blame (e.g., I am unlikable rather than critical). To test this
   hypothesis, we used a neuropsychological test measuring social
   conceptual differentiation and its relationship with emotional biases in
   a remitted MDD and a control group. During fMRI, guilt- and
   indignation-evoking sentences were presented. As predicted, conceptual
   overgeneralization was associated with increased emotional intensity
   when appraising social actions. Interdependence of conceptual
   overgeneralization and negative emotional biases was stronger in MDD
   (reproducible in the subgroup without medication) and was associated
   with overgeneralized self-blame. This high conceptual-emotional
   interdependence was associated with functional disconnection between the
   right superior anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and right dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as a septal region across groups when
   experiencing guilt (SPM8). Strong coupling of conceptual information
   (ATL) with information about the context of actions and emotions
   (frontal-subcortical regions) is thus associated with appraisal being
   less dependent on conceptual overgeneralization, thereby protecting
   against excessive self-blame.}},

Abstract = {{Our goal was to test a model of sociopolitical attitudes that posits a
   relationship between individual differences in liberal versus
   conservative political orientation and differential levels of anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) responsivity. We recorded event-related
   potentials (ERPs) while participants who varied along a unidimensional
   liberal-conservative continuum engaged in a standard Go/NoGo task. We
   also measured component attitudes of political orientation in the form
   of traditionalism (degree of openness to social change) and
   egalitarianism (a preference for social equality). Generally,
   participants who reported a more liberal political orientation made
   fewer errors and produced larger ACC-generated ERPs (the error-related
   negativity, or ERN and the NoGo N2). This ACC activation, especially as
   indicated by a larger NoGo N2, was most strongly associated with greater
   preference for social equality. Performance accuracy, however, was most
   strongly associated with greater openness to social change. These data
   are consistent with a social neuroscience view that sociopolitical
   attitudes are related to aspects of neurophysiological responsivity.
   They also indicate that a bidimensional model of political orientation
   can enhance our interpretation of the nature of these associations.}},

Abstract = {{The recognition of emotional facial expressions is an important means to
   adjust behavior in social interactions. As facial expressions widely
   differ in their duration and degree of expressiveness, they often
   manifest with short and transient expressions below the level of
   awareness. In this combined behavioral and fMRI study, we aimed at
   examining whether or not consciously accessible (subliminal) emotional
   facial expressions influence empathic judgments and which brain
   activations are related to it. We hypothesized that subliminal facial
   expressions of emotions masked with neutral expressions of the same
   faces induce an empathic processing similar to consciously accessible
   (supraliminal) facial expressions. Our behavioral data in 23 healthy
   subjects showed that subliminal emotional facial expressions of 40 ms
   duration affect the judgments of the subsequent neutral facial
   expressions. In the fMRI study in 12 healthy subjects it was found that
   both, supra- and subliminal emotional facial expressions shared a
   widespread network of brain areas including the fusiform gyrus, the
   temporo-parietal junction, and the inferior, dorsolateral, and medial
   frontal cortex. Compared with subliminal facial expressions,
   supraliminal facial expressions led to a greater activation of left
   occipital and fusiform face areas. We conclude that masked subliminal
   emotional information is suited to trigger processing in brain areas
   which have been implicated in empathy and, thereby in social encounters}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Reports of age-related changes to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
   activity during socio-cognitive tasks have shown both age-equivalence
   and under recruitment. Emotion work illustrates selective mPFC response
   dependent on valence, such that negative emotional images evoke
   increased ventral mPFC activity for younger adults, while older adults
   recruit vmPFC more for positive material. By testing whether this
   differential age-related response toward valenced material is also
   present for the social task of forming impressions, we may begin to
   understand inconsistencies regarding when age differences are present
   vs. absent in the literature. Using fMRI, participants intentionally
   formed impressions of positive and negative face-behavior pairs in
   anticipation of a memory task. Extending previous findings to a social
   task, valence-based reversals were present in dorsal and ventral mPFC,
   and posterior cingulate cortex. Younger adults elicited increased
   activity when forming negative impressions, while older adults had more
   recruitment when forming positive impressions. This suggests an
   age-related shift toward emphasizing positive social information may be
   reflected in the recruitment of regions supporting forming impressions.
   Overall, the results indicate an age-related shift in neural response to
   socio-cognitive stimuli that is valence dependent rather than a general
   age-related reduction in activity, in part informing prior
   inconsistencies within the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Emotions elicited by interpersonal versus non-interpersonal experiences
   have different effects on neurobiological functioning in both animals
   and humans. However, the extent to which the brain circuits underlying
   interpersonal and non-interpersonal emotions are distinct still remains
   unclear. The goal of our study was to assess whether different neural
   circuits are implicated in the processing of arousal and valence of
   interpersonal versus non-interpersonal emotions. During functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, participants imagined themselves in
   emotion-eliciting interpersonal or non-interpersonal situations and then
   rated the arousal and valence of emotions they experienced. We
   identified (1) separate neural circuits that are implicated in the
   arousal and valence dimensions of interpersonal versus non-interpersonal
   emotions, (2) circuits that are implicated in arousal and valence for
   both types of emotion, and (3) circuits that are responsive to the type
   of emotion, regardless of the valence or arousal level of the emotion.
   We found extensive recruitment of limbic (for arousal) and
   temporal-parietal (for valence) systems associated with processing of
   specifically interpersonal emotions compared to non-interpersonal ones.
   The neural bases of interpersonal and non-interpersonal emotions may,
   therefore, be largely distinct.}},

Abstract = {{Violent offenders with schizophrenia have a particularly poor
   performance level in facial affect recognition.Nineteen male
   schizophrenia patients, who had been committed to psychiatric hospital
   detention because of violent offences and lack of criminal
   responsibility, were recruited to receive the Training of Affect
   Recognition (TAR). Performance in the Pictures of Facial Affect
   (PFA)-test and event-related potentials (ERPs) were registered in a
   pre-post-treatment design.TAR was feasible with a very high treatment
   effect (Cohen's d=1.88), which persisted for 2 months post-treatment.
   ERPs remained unchanged post- vs. pre-treatment, while low resolution
   brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) revealed activation decreases
   in left-hemispheric parietal-temporal-occipital regions at 172 msec and
   activation increases in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
   anterior cingulate at 250 msec.Possibly, violent offenders with
   schizophrenia are particularly amenable to TAR because of a high level
   of dysfunction at baseline. Post- vs. pre-treatment changes of neural
   activity (LORETA) may mirror a gain of efficiency in structural face
   decoding and a shift towards a more reflective mode of emotional face
   decoding, relying on increased frontal brain activity. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) -data from another study further
   supports this notion. TAR treatment might enable subjects with
   schizophrenia and a disposition to violence to reach a higher degree of
   deliberation of their reactive behavior to facial affect stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation theories argue that humans simulate motor processes of others
   to gain information about intentions and emotional states of others.
   Mu-suppression is a valid electrophysiological correlate of these
   processes. Mu-activity can be measured via electroencephalography (EEG)
   in the alpha-band (8-13Hz) above the sensorimotor cortex and is
   suppressed when actions are executed or observed. Based on a
   within-subject design, including 28 participants, it was tested whether
   the processes measured by mu-suppression could be modulated by empathic
   top-down-processes. Participants were asked to take the perspective of
   two actors, telling a story about a sad or neutral life event (video
   sequences). Afterwards, EEG was measured at central (C3, Cz, C4) and
   occipital (O1, Oz, O2) electrodes, while participants observed the
   actors drinking water (standardized video sequences, 8s duration). Fast
   fourier transformation showed stronger suppression of power in the
   alpha-range (relative to baseline) at central and occipital electrodes
   while the actor with the sad story was observed relative to the actor
   with the neutral story. Furthermore, measures of state empathy
   correlated positively with the difference of mu-suppression between
   executed and observed movements, an indicator of self-other
   discrimination. Thus, mirror neuron activity measured by mu-suppression
   is modulated by empathic processes.}},

Abstract = {{Human neuroimaging offers a powerful way to connect animal and human
   research on emotion, with profound implications for psychological
   science. However, the gulf between animal and human studies remains a
   formidable obstacle: human studies typically focus on the cortex and a
   few subcortical regions such as the amygdala, whereas deeper structures
   such as the brainstem periaqueductal gray (PAG) play a key role in
   animal models. Here, we directly assessed the role of PAG in human
   affect by interleaving in a single fMRI session two conditions known to
   elicit strong emotional responses-physical pain and negative image
   viewing. Negative affect and PAG activity increased in both conditions.
   We next examined eight independent data sets, half featuring pain
   stimulation and half negative image viewing. In sum, these data sets
   comprised 198 additional participants. We found increased activity in
   PAG in all eight studies. Taken together, these findings suggest PAG is
   a key component of human affective responses.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial research links economic adversity to poor coping in
   stressful or threatening environments. Neuroimaging studies suggest that
   activation of the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) plays a
   key role in self-control, and it seems that individual differences in
   neurocognitive systems underlying self-control are determined in part by
   subjective childhood socioeconomic status (SES). The present study used
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to investigate whether subjective
   childhood SES moderates rVLPFC activity during one form of threatening
   environment: social exclusion. Twenty-five undergraduates participated
   in a NIRS session in which they were socially included and then excluded
   during an online ball-tossing game. Lower subjective childhood SES was
   associated with higher levels of social distress and lower levels of
   rVLPFC activity during social exclusion. The present findings suggest
   that early family environments are reliably associated with deficits in
   offspring coping resources and processes, as well as with difficulties
   in regulating interpersonal circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Person perception is a dynamic, evolving process. Because other people
   are an endless source of social information, people need to update their
   impressions of others based upon new information. We devised an fMRI
   study to identify brain regions involved in updating impressions.
   Participants saw faces paired with valenced behavioral information and
   were asked to form impressions of these individuals. Each face was seen
   five times in a row, each time with a different behavioral description.
   Critically, for half of the faces the behaviors were evaluatively
   consistent, while for the other half they were inconsistent. In line
   with prior work, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was associated
   with forming impressions of individuals based on behavioral information.
   More importantly, a whole-brain analysis revealed a network of other
   regions associated with updating impressions of individuals who
   exhibited evaluatively inconsistent behaviors, including rostrolateral
   PFC, superior temporal sulcus, right inferior parietal lobule and
   posterior cingulate cortex.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to read emotions in the face of another person is an
   important social skill that can be impaired in subjects with traumatic
   brain injury (TBI). To determine the brain regions that modulate facial
   emotion recognition, we conducted a whole-brain analysis using a
   well-validated facial emotion recognition task and voxel-based lesion
   symptom mapping (VLSM) in a large sample of patients with focal
   penetrating TBIs (pTBIs). Our results revealed that individuals with
   pTBI performed significantly worse than normal controls in recognizing
   unpleasant emotions. VLSM mapping results showed that impairment in
   facial emotion recognition was due to damage in a bilateral
   fronto-temporo-limbic network, including medial prefrontal cortex (PFC),
   anterior cingulate cortex, left insula and temporal areas. Beside those
   common areas, damage to the bilateral and anterior regions of PFC led to
   impairment in recognizing unpleasant emotions, whereas bilateral
   posterior PFC and left temporal areas led to impairment in recognizing
   pleasant emotions. Our findings add empirical evidence that the ability
   to read pleasant and unpleasant emotions in other people's faces is a
   complex process involving not only a common network that includes
   bilateral fronto-temporo-limbic lobes, but also other regions depending
   on emotional valence.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{When forming impressions and trying to figure out why other people
   behave the way they do, we should take into account not only
   dispositional factors (i.e. personality traits) but also situational
   constraints as potential causes for a behavior. However, in their
   attributions, people often ignore the importance of situational factors.
   To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the integration of
   situational information into attributions, we decomposed the attribution
   process by separately presenting information about behaviors and about
   the situational circumstances in which they occur. After reading the
   information, participants judged whether dispositional or situational
   causes explained the behavior (attribution), and how much they liked the
   person described in the scenario (affective evaluation). The
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed increased blood
   oxygenation-level-dependent activation during the encoding of
   situational information when the resulting attribution was situational,
   relative to when the attribution was dispositional, potentially
   reflecting a controlled process that integrates situational information
   into attributions. Interestingly, attributions were strongly linked to
   subsequent affective evaluations, with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   emerging as potential substrate of the integration of attributions and
   affective evaluations. Our findings demonstrate how top-down control
   processes regulate impression formation when situational information is
   taken into account to understand others.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated processes of truth validation during reading.
   Participants responded to `true' and `false' probes after reading simple
   true or false sentences. Compatible sentence/probe combinations
   (true/'true', false/'false') facilitated responding compared with
   incompatible combinations (true/'false', false/'true'), indicating truth
   validation. Evidence for truth validation was obtained after inducing an
   evaluative mindset but not after inducing a non-evaluative mindset,
   using additional intermixed tasks requiring true/false decisions or
   sentence comparisons, respectively. Event-related potentials revealed an
   increased late negativity (500-1000 ms after onset of the last word of
   sentences) for false compared with true sentences. Paralleling
   behavioral results, this electroencephalographic marker only obtained in
   the evaluative mindset condition. Further, mere semantic mismatches
   between subject and object of sentences led to an elevated N400 for both
   mindset conditions. Taken together, our findings suggest that truth
   validation is a conditionally automatic process that is dependent on the
   current task demands and resulting mindset, whereas the processing of
   word meaning and semantic relations between words proceeds in an
   unconditionally automatic fashion.}},

Abstract = {{This electroencephalographic study investigated if negating one's
   emotion results in paradoxical effects or leads to effective emotional
   downregulation. Healthy participants were asked to downregulate their
   emotions to happy and fearful faces by using negated emotional cue words
   (e.g. no fun, no fear). Cue words were congruent with the emotion
   depicted in the face and presented prior to each face. Stimuli were
   presented in blocks of happy and fearful faces. Blocks of passive
   stimulus viewing served as control condition. Active regulation reduced
   amplitudes of early event-related brain potentials (early posterior
   negativity, but not N170) and the late positive potential for fearful
   faces. A fronto-central negativity peaking at about 250 ms after target
   face onset showed larger amplitude modulations during downregulation of
   fearful and happy faces. Behaviorally, negating was more associated with
   reappraisal than with suppression. Our results suggest that in an
   emotional context, negation processing could be quite effective for
   emotional downregulation but that its effects depend on the type of the
   negated emotion (pleasant vs unpleasant). Results are discussed in the
   context of dual process models of cognition and emotion regulation.}},

   actions would not be an effective or appropriate response, as successful
   interaction often requires complementary rather than emulative
   movements. At what point does the automatic tendency to mirror another's
   actions become the inclination to carry out appropriate, complementary
   movements? In the present study, single-pulse transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) was used to explore corticospinal excitability in
   participants observing action sequences evoking imitative or
   complementary movements. TMS was delivered at five time points
   corresponding to different moments in time when key kinematic landmarks
   characterizing an observed action occurred. A variation in motor evoked
   potentials (MEPs) confirmed that the motor system flexibly shifts from
   imitative to complementary action tendencies. That shift appears to take
   place very precociously in time. Observers are attuned to advance
   movement information and can use it to anticipate a future course of
   action and to prepare for an appropriate, complementary action.
   Altogether, these findings represent a step forward in research
   concerning social action-perception coupling mechanisms providing
   important data to better understand the role of predictive simulation in
   social contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Neurobiological investigations of empathy often support an embodied
   simulation account. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   we monitored statistical associations between brain activations
   indicating self-focused threat to those indicating threats to a familiar
   friend or an unfamiliar stranger. Results in regions such as the
   anterior insula, putamen and supramarginal gyrus indicate that
   self-focused threat activations are robustly correlated with
   friend-focused threat activations but not stranger-focused threat
   activations. These results suggest that one of the defining features of
   human social bonding may be increasing levels of overlap between neural
   representations of self and other. This article presents a novel and
   important methodological approach to fMRI empathy studies, which informs
   how differences in brain activation can be detected in such studies and
   how covariate approaches can provide novel and important information
   regarding the brain and empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with schizophrenia are more prone to violent behaviors than
   the general population. It is increasingly recognized that processing of
   emotionally valenced stimuli is impaired in schizophrenia, a deficit
   that may play a role in aggressive behavior. Our goal was to establish
   whether patients with a history of violence would show more severe
   deficits in processing emotionally valenced inputs than non-violent
   patients. Using event-related potentials, we measured how early during
   processing of emotional valence, evidence of aberrant function was
   observed. A total of 42 schizophrenia patients (21 with history of
   violence; 21 without) and 28 healthy controls were tested. Participants
   performed an inhibitory control task, making speeded responses to
   pictorial stimuli. Pictures occasionally repeated twice and participants
   withheld responses to these repeats. Valenced pictures from the
   International Affective Picture System were presented. Results in
   controls showed modulations during the earliest phases of sensory
   processing (< 100 ms) for negatively valenced pictures. A cascade of
   modulations ensued, involving sensory and perceptual processing stages.
   In contrast, neither schizophrenia group showed early differentiation.
   Non-violent patients showed earliest modulations beginning similar to
   150 ms. For violent patients, however, earliest modulations were further
   delayed and highly attenuated. The current study reveals
   sensory-perceptual processing dysfunction for negatively valenced
   inputs, which is particularly pronounced in aggressive patients.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the philosophical notion that language embodies thought we
   investigated whether a habitual tendency for intrusive thought that
   younger and older participants report over a period of 100 sessions,
   spread out over about 6 months, is associated with brain regions related
   to language production. In favour of this hypothesis, we found that
   individual differences in habitual intrusive thoughts are correlated
   with activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, Broca's area) as
   well as the cingulate cortex (CC) during a two-choice reaction-time task
   in fMRI. Participants who habitually tended to experience intrusive
   thoughts showed greater activity during task-free (baseline) compared to
   task periods in brain regions involved in language production. Task
   performance was unrelated to individual differences in intrusive
   thoughts. We conclude that intrusive thoughts may be represented in a
   language-like format and that individuals reporting a habitually higher
   tendency for intrusive thoughts may have stronger and more habitual
   inner speech processes.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) have difficulties in
   social interaction and communication, which is reflected in
   hypoactivation of brain regions engaged in social processing, such as
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala and insula. Resting state
   studies in ASC have identified reduced connectivity of the default mode
   network (DMN), which includes mPFC, suggesting that other resting state
   networks incorporating `social' brain regions may also be abnormal.
   Using Seed-based Connectivity and Group Independent Component Analysis
   (ICA) approaches, we looked at resting functional connectivity in ASC
   between specific `social' brain regions, as well as within and between
   whole networks incorporating these regions. We found reduced functional
   connectivity within the DMN in individuals with ASC, using both ICA and
   seed-based approaches. Two further networks identified by ICA, the
   salience network, incorporating the insula and a medial temporal lobe
   network, incorporating the amygdala, showed reduced inter-network
   connectivity. This was underlined by reduced seed-based connectivity
   between the insula and amygdala. The results demonstrate significantly
   reduced functional connectivity within and between resting state
   networks incorporating `social' brain regions. This reduced connectivity
   may result in difficulties in communication and integration of
   information across these networks, which could contribute to the
   impaired processing of social signals in ASC.}},

Abstract = {{In our study, we tried to clarify whether patients with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) reveal different moral decision patterns as compared to
   healthy subjects and whether common social interaction difficulties in
   ASD are reflected in altered brain activation during different aspects
   of moral reasoning. 28 patients with high-functioning ASD and 28 healthy
   subjects matched for gender, age and education took part in an
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Participants
   were confronted with textual dilemma situations followed by proposed
   solutions to which they could agree or disagree. On a neural level,
   moral decision making was associated with activation in anterior medial
   prefrontal regions, the temporo-parietal junction and the precuneus for
   both groups. However, while patients and healthy controls did not
   exhibit significant behavioral differences, ASD patients showed
   decreased activation in limbic regions, particularly the amygdala, as
   well as increased activation in the anterior and the posterior cingulate
   gyrus during moral reasoning. Alterations of brain activation in
   patients might thus indicate specific impairments in empathy. However,
   activation increases in brain regions associated with the `default mode
   network' and self-referential cognition also provide evidence for an
   altered way of patients' cerebral processing with regard to decision
   making based on social information.}},

Abstract = {{Is a short visuomotor associative training sufficient to reverse the
   visuomotor tuning of mirror neurons in adult humans? We tested the
   effects of associative training on corticospinal modulation during
   action observation in the 100-320 ms interval after action onset. In two
   separate experiments, the acceleration of transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS)-induced movements was recorded before and after
   training participants to respond to observed acts with an opposite or
   similar behavior. Before training, TMS-induced accelerations mirrored
   the observed action at 250 and 320 ms. After training, responses at 250
   ms were unchanged and still mirrored the stimuli, without any effect of
   training direction. Only at 320 ms, we observed training-dependent
   changes in evoked responses. A control experiment with non-biological
   rotational movements as visual stimuli indicated that spatial
   stimulus-response compatibility is not sufficient to account for the
   results of the two main experiments. We show that the effects of a short
   visuomotor associative training are not pervasive on the automatic
   mirror responses. `Early' (250 ms) responses were not influenced by
   training. Conversely only `late' (320 ms) responses changed according to
   the training direction. This biphasic time course indicates that two
   distinct mechanisms produce the automatic mirror responses and the newly
   learned visuomotor associations.}},

Abstract = {{The monetary incentive delay (MID) task (Knutson, 2000) is an imaging
   paradigm used to measure neural activity of incentive receipt
   anticipation. The task reliably elicits striatal activation and is
   commonly used with both adult and adolescent populations, but is not
   designed for use with children. In the current article, we present data
   on the newly designed `pinata task' a child-friendly analog of the MID
   task. We demonstrate the task can be used successfully in children to
   study the neural correlates of anticipatory incentive processing.
   Results from a behavioral study and a neuroimaging study are reported.
   In Study \#1, a sample of 8- to 14-year-old children demonstrates
   expected behavioral effects: subjects responded most quickly and most
   accurately on trials with greater potential rewards; older children
   displayed faster reaction times than younger. In Study \#2, 8- to
   12-year-old children showed neural activation patterns consistent with
   those seen in adults in the MID task: activation was modulated by cue
   incentive value in reward-processing regions, including the striatum,
   thalamus, mesial prefrontal cortex and insula. Study results suggest
   that the pinata task is a valid analog of the MID task, and can be used
   to assess neural correlates of reward processing in children as young as
   8-9 years of age.}},

Abstract = {{Social exclusion is known to cause alterations in neural activity and
   perceptions of social distress. However, previous research is largely
   limited to examining social interactions as a unitary phenomenon without
   investigating adjustments in neural and attentional processes that occur
   during social interactions. To address this limitation, we examined
   neural activity on a trial-by-trial basis during different social
   interactions. Our results show conflict monitoring neural alarm
   activation, indexed by the N2, in response to specific exclusionary
   events; even during interactions that are inclusionary overall and in
   the absence of self-reported feelings of social pain. Furthermore, we
   show enhanced attentional activation to exclusionary events, indexed by
   the P3b, during exclusionary, compared with inclusionary, interactions,
   and this P3b activation was associated with self-reported social
   distress following prolonged social exclusion. Finally, both the N2 and
   P3b showed larger amplitudes in the earlier stages of exclusion compared
   with later stages, suggesting heightened early sensitivity for both
   components. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the
   dynamic neural and perceptual processes of exclusion that exist during
   social interactions and the relationship between discrete events within
   interactions and the more general contexts of the social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Enriched sensorimotor environments enable rodents to compensate for a
   wide range of neurological challenges, including those induced in animal
   models of autism. Given the sensorimotor deficits in most children with
   autism, we attempted to translate that approach to their treatment. In a
   randomized controlled trial, 3-12 year-old children with autism were
   assigned to either a sensorimotor enrichment group, which received daily
   olfactory/tactile stimulation along with exercises that stimulated other
   paired sensory modalities, or to a control group. We administered tests
   of cognitive performance and autism severity to both groups at the
   initiation of the study and after 6 months. Severity of autism, as
   assessed with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, improved significantly
   in the enriched group compared to controls. Indeed, 42\% of the enriched
   group and only 7\% of the control group had what we considered to be a
   clinically significant improvement of 5 points on that scale.
   Sensorimotor enrichment also produced a clear improvement in cognition,
   as determined by their Leiter-R Visualization and Reasoning scores. At 6
   months, the change in average scores for the enriched group was 11.3
   points higher than that for the control group. Finally, 69\% of parents
   in the enriched group and 31\% of parents in the control group reported
   improvement in their child over the 6-month study. Environmental
   enrichment therefore appears to be effective in ameliorating some of the
   symptoms of autism in children.}},

Abstract = {{Forced-choice discrimination is a standard behavioral paradigm used to
   test animals' abilities in learning and memory. In this type of task, a
   reward association is made between a sensory stimulus and a food or
   water reward and the frequency of correct choice for the stimulus
   associated with the reward is measured. We show here that when olfactory
   sensory stimuli are used, spontaneous preferences for odors can
   influence speed of acquisition in a forced-choice discrimination task.
   We first show that among a battery of 53 odorants, some odorants elicit
   longer bouts of spontaneous investigation than others. By measuring
   relative spontaneous investigation times for pairs of simultaneously
   presented odorants, we confirm that these odor preferences are robust
   and reliable. Finally, we show that performance on a forced-choice
   olfactory discrimination task depends on relative spontaneous
   preferences between the rewarded and unrewarded odorants. Namely, rats
   acquire novel forced-choice odor discrimination problems significantly
   faster if the preferred odorant, as assessed by relative spontaneous
   investigation time, is associated with the reward. These results
   indicate that even subtle differences in the tendency for an animal to
   approach and investigate one odorant over another can lead to
   substantial biases in basic learning and memory tasks.}},

Abstract = {{In individuals naive to serious conflict in an unfamiliar environment,
   violence has long-lasting effects on subsequent aggressive behavior.
   This effect of the stressful experience of a first violent conflict
   occurs in victims as well as offenders. The authors study in the male
   rat as offender the role of a rapid corticosterone signal mediated by
   brain mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in adjusting the threshold of
   aggressive responses. For this purpose, the authors have applied
   electrical stimulation of the brain's aggression circuit via the
   hypothalamic attack area or HAA. Using this paradigm, they found that in
   inexperienced rats, retesting of the animals on subsequent days
   facilitated aggression. Hypothalamic attack thresholds decreased to
   about 50\% of their initial level. However, blocking the MR once with
   the mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone, during the very first
   evoked attacks, permanently prevented attack facilitation in subsequent
   conflicts in that same environment. The MR-mediated effect blocked by
   the antagonist occurred within an hour following the start of the first
   aggression tests only. A later MR blockade was not effective. These
   findings suggest that the corticosterone stress response during a very
   first serious conflict initializes an enhanced propensity for violent
   aggression through the brain MR.}},

Abstract = {{Benzodiazepines have been demonstrated to have a high abuse liability in
   persons suffering from anxiety but have demonstrated mixed abuse
   liability findings in preclinical models. We hypothesized that by
   modeling anxiety in a male C57BL/6 mouse model it would be possible to
   reveal a preference for benzodiazepines within this subpopulation
   through negative reinforcement. Using the Tube Test of Social Dominance
   and the Resident/Intruder Paradigm we investigated whether animals
   identified as dominant or submissive/defeated would differentially
   display a preference for midazolam (a short acting benzodiazepine) in a
   conditioned place preference paradigm. Consistent with our hypotheses,
   benzodiazepine conditioned motivation was mediated by negative
   reinforcement as submissive but not dominant mice displayed a preference
   for midazolam. Furthermore, different neural systems mediated midazolam
   conditioned motivation depending on the stress status of the animal
   (single vs. repeated stress as induced by the Resident/Intruder
   Paradigm). Singly stressed animals showed midazolam place preferences
   through a dopamine-independent pathway, whereas the place preferences of
   repeatedly stressed animals were mediated through a dopamine-dependent
   pathway. This demonstrates that stress is sufficient for switching the
   neural system mediating midazolam conditioned motivation. Finally,
   midazolam reinforcement in the conditioned place preference paradigm was
   shown to be predictive for dominance/submission status.}},

Abstract = {{Opioid medications are frequently used in the effective treatment of
   intractable pain, but prolonged use of such medications can be
   complicated by a host of adverse effects. Among these adverse effects,
   tolerance and mental clouding can be especially disabling and can lead
   to both a reduced effectiveness of treatment and a reduced quality of
   life for many requiring treatment with these medications. Here we
   examined the relative contributions of complete Freund's adjuvant
   (CFA)-induced inflammatory pain and opioid medication on spatial memory
   for a well-learned task in male Sprague Dawley rats. Although CFA, by
   itself, had little effect on spatial memory, morphine administered to
   pain-free animals produced profound detrimental effects on spatial
   memory that persisted longer than the analgesic effectiveness of the
   drug. However, no significant cognitive deficits were observed in
   animals receiving morphine in the presence of CFA-induced pain. Taken
   together, these results are evidence that the pain state of the organism
   can alter some of the negative effects of morphine.}},

Abstract = {{Opioid antagonists reduce the rate of relapse to drinking in clinical
   trials and reduce reinstatement in animal models of drug seeking.
   However, the neuroanatomical locus for this effect remains poorly
   understood. We examined the role of nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh)
   mu-opioid receptors in two different forms of recovery of alcoholic beer
   seeking. Rats were trained to nosepoke for alcoholic beer in a
   distinctive context and this response was then extinguished. Response
   recovery was produced via renewal (context-induced reinstatement)
   (Experiment 1) or primed reinstatement (Experiment 2). Rats received
   microinjections of the mu-opioid receptor antagonist CTAP before these
   tests. AcbSh microinfusion of 2.5 mu g CTAP attenuated the ABA renewal
   of alcoholic beer seeking in a neuroanatomically specific manner. In
   contrast, AcbSh microinfusion of 2.5 mu g or 5 mu g CTAP had no effect
   on the primed reinstatement of alcoholic beer seeking. These findings
   indicate a role for AcbSh mu-opioid receptors in renewal of alcoholic
   beer seeking and suggest that there are dissociable ventral striatal
   substrates for different forms of recovery of extinguished alcoholic
   beer seeking.}},

Abstract = {{The prefrontal cortex plays an important role in reward processing in
   humans and nonhuman primates. In the current study we examined reward
   modulation in the single cell activity of the avian analog of the
   prefrontal cortex, the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL). Pigeons had to
   peck at stimuli that represented either no reward, a small reward, or a
   large reward in a no-choice condition (only one stimulus presented) or a
   choice condition (two stimuli presented simultaneously). Of the 92
   recorded cells, 34 cells showed some form of reward modulation, either
   during the stimulus presentation or the delay activity preceding the
   delivery of reward in the no-choice or choice condition. Latencies to
   peck at the stimulus revealed that the differences in reward amount were
   behaviorally significant to the pigeons. Moreover, a majority of cells
   (approximately 70\%) showed activity during the actual reward phase. Our
   results show that cells in the NCL modulate their response as a function
   of the amount of reward.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in an animal's spatial environment can have dramatic effects
   on the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with spatial
   processing. Animals in spatially impoverished environments have
   decreased hippocampal attributes. However, we do not know if differences
   in the spatial environment differentially interact with territorial
   status, which also covaries with hippocampal attributes. Here, we asked
   whether territoriality and differential spatial-area use interact to
   generate different effects on cortical attributes (reptilian hippocampal
   homologue) in lizards. We compared medial and dorsal cortical attributes
   between territorial and nonterritorial morphotypes of side-blotched
   lizards, Uta stansburiana, in larger versus smaller (i.e., spatially
   impoverished) enclosures. We found that territorial males had increased
   neurogenesis rates in their medial cortices in larger enclosures when
   compared with their siblings in smaller enclosures; nonterritorial males
   had low levels of neurogenesis regardless of enclosure size. Enclosure
   size had no significant effect on cortical volumes or the total number
   of neurons in either cortical region. These results suggest that
   territorial morphotypes may be more sensitive to changes in the spatial
   environment, thus leading to increases in regulation of neurogenesis in
   the face of increased spatial processing and physical activity demands.}},

Abstract = {{Navigation depends on a network of neural systems that accurately
   monitor an animal's spatial orientation in an environment. Within this
   navigation system are head direction (HD) cells which discharge as a
   function of an animal's directional heading, providing an animal with a
   neural compass to guide ongoing spatial behavior. Experiments were
   designed to test this hypothesis by damaging the dorsal tegmental
   nucleus (DTN), a midbrain structure that plays a critical role in the
   generation of the rodent HD cell signal, and evaluating landmark based
   navigation using variants of the Morris water task. In Experiments 1 and
   2, shams and DTN-lesioned rats were trained to navigate toward a cued
   platform in the presence of a constellation of distal landmarks located
   outside the pool. After reaching a training criteria, rats were tested
   in three probe trials in which (a) the cued platform was completely
   removed from the pool, (b) the pool was repositioned and the cued
   platform remained in the same absolute location with respect to distal
   landmarks, or (c) the pool was repositioned and the cued platform
   remained in the same relative location in the pool. In general,
   DTN-lesioned rats required more training trials to reach performance
   criterion, were less accurate to navigate to the platform position when
   it was removed, and navigated directly to the cued platform regardless
   of its position in the pool, indicating a general absence of control
   over navigation by distal landmarks. In Experiment 3, DTN and control
   rats were trained in directional and place navigation variants of the
   water task where the pool was repositioned for each training trial and a
   hidden platform was placed either in the same relative location
   (direction) in the pool or in the same absolute location (place) in the
   distal room reference frame. DTN-lesioned rats were initially impaired
   in the direction task, but ultimately performed as well as controls. In
   the place task, DTN-lesioned rats were severely impaired and displayed
   little evidence of improvement over the course of training. Together,
   these results support the conclusion that the DTN is required for
   accurate landmark navigation.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional hyperreactivity can inhibit maternal responsiveness in female
   rats and other animals. Maternal behavior in postpartum rats is
   disrupted by increasing norepinephrine release in the ventral bed
   nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTv) with the alpha 2-autoreceptor
   antagonist, yohimbine, or the more selective alpha 2-autoreceptor
   antagonist, idazoxan (Smith et al., 2012). Because high noradrenergic
   activity in the BSTv can also increase anxiety-related behaviors,
   increased anxiety may underlie the disrupted mothering of dams given
   yohimbine or idazoxan. To assess this possibility, anxiety-related
   behaviors in an elevated plus maze were assessed in postpartum rats
   after administration of yohimbine or idazoxan. It was further assessed
   if the alpha 2-autoreceptor agonist clonidine (which decreases
   norepinephrine release) would, conversely, reduce dams' anxiety. Groups
   of diestrous virgins were also examined. It was found that peripheral or
   intra-BSTv yohimbine did increase anxiety-related behavior in postpartum
   females. However, BSTv infusion of idazoxan did not reproduce
   yohimbine's anxiogenic effects and anxiety was not reduced by peripheral
   or intra-BSTv clonidine. Because yohimbine is a weak 5HT1(A) receptor
   agonist, other groups of females received BSTv infusion of the 5HT1A
   receptor agonist 8OH-DPAT, but it did not alter their anxiety-related
   behavior. Lastly, levels of norepinephrine and serotonin in tissue
   punches from the BSTv did not differ between postpartum and diestrous
   rats, but serotonin turnover was lower in mothers. These results suggest
   that the impaired maternal behavior after BSTv infusion of yohimbine or
   idazoxan cannot both be readily explained by an increase in dams'
   anxiety, and that BSTv alpha 2-autoreceptor modulation alone has little
   influence on anxiety-related behaviors in postpartum or diestrous rats.}},

Abstract = {{Estrogens have been shown to rapidly promote male copulatory behaviors

   The present study tested the hypothesis that estrogen acts through a

   estradiol (E2), STX (a diphenylacrylamide compound that selectively
   activates a membrane ER pathway), or vehicle were administered acutely
   to castrated male rats that bore subcutaneous (sc) dihydrotestosterone
   implants to maintain genital sensitivity. Appetitive (level changes,
   genital investigation) and consummatory (mounts, intromissions,
   ejaculations) components of male sexual behavior were measured in a
   bilevel testing apparatus. Testing showed that E2 treatment promoted
   olfactory and mounting behaviors, but had no effect on motivation as
   measured by anticipatory level changes. STX treatment showed no effect
   on either component of male sexual behavior. These results support
   previous results that showed that E2 can rapidly affect male sexual
   behaviors but fail to support a role for the specific membrane-initiated
   pathway activated by STX.}},

Abstract = {{Infant faces elicit early, specific activity in the orbitofrontal cortex

   of the causal relationship between infant facial configuration and OFC

   structure. One such disruption is cleft lip, a small change to one
   facial feature, shown to disrupt parenting. Using
   magnetoencephalography, we investigated neural responses to infant faces
   with cleft lip compared with typical infant and adult faces. We found
   activity in the right OFC at 140 ms in response to typical infant faces
   but diminished activity to infant faces with cleft lip or adult faces.
   Activity in the right fusiform face area was of similar magnitude for
   typical adult and infant faces but was significantly lower for infant
   faces with cleft lip. This is the first evidence that a minor change to
   the infant face can disrupt neural activity potentially implicated in

   identified three groups of children who showed either (1) concern for
   others in distress (i.e., empathy and prosocial behaviors), (2) active
   disregard (i.e., anger/hostility and antisocial behavior), or (3)
   passive disregard (i.e., little or no concern). We compared groups on HR
   and HR deceleration. The active disregard group consistently showed the
   lowest HR both when groups were based on structured probes and on
   mothers' reports. Children who showed passive disregard displayed little
   self-distress during other's distress and different patterns of
   association of self-distress and HR than the other two groups. Active
   and passive disregard thus may reflect two different aspects of lack of
   concern for others. HR deceleration was seen for all three groups,
   suggesting it is not necessarily a cardiac index of concern for others.
   Interdisciplinary approaches and multiple-systems analysis are needed to
   better understand psychobiological substrates.}},

Abstract = {{The developmental origin of sex differences in adult brain function is
   poorly understood. Elucidating neural mechanisms underlying comparable
   cognitive functionality in both children and adults is required to
   address this gap. Humor appreciation represents a particularly relevant
   target for such developmental research because explanatory theories
   apply across the life span, and underlying neurocircuitry shows sex
   differences in adults. As a positive mood state, humor is also of
   interest due to sex differences in rates of depression, a disorder
   afflicting twice as many women as men. In this study, we employed
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain
   responses to funny versus positive (and neutral) video clips in 22
   children, ages 6-13 years, including eight sibling-pairs. Our data
   revealed increased activity to funny clips in bilateral
   temporo-occipital cortex, midbrain, and amygdala in girls. Conversely,
   we found heightened activation to positive clips in bilateral inferior
   parietal lobule, fusiform gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex in boys. Many of these effects persisted
   when looking at sibling-pairs only. We interpret such findings as
   reflecting the presence of early sex divergence in reward saliency or
   expectation and stimulus relevance attribution. These findings are
   discussed in the context of evolutionary and developmental theories of
   humor function.}},

Abstract = {{Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by interpersonal
   difficulties, whereby patients are negatively biased concerning the
   evaluation of others' trustworthiness. Here, we examined the effect of
   oxytocin on interpersonal behavior of BPD patients in a trust game,
   emphasizing the assessment of facial attractiveness of the patients'
   counterparts in the game, and patients' history of childhood trauma.
   Thirteen BPD patients and thirteen healthy controls played a trust game
   after receiving oxytocin or placebo in a randomized, double-blind
   crossover design. Childhood trauma was evaluated using the Childhood
   Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Patients transferred less money in the
   oxytocin condition compared to placebo. While healthy controls
   transferred more money units (MUs) to attractive counterparts than to
   unattractive ones only after the administration of oxytocin, BPD
   patients showed this pattern in both conditions. Emotional neglect
   during childhood negatively correlated with the amount of MUs
   transferred by patients under oxytocin, but not placebo. Oxytocin had a
   trust-lowering effect in BPD, which was correlated with patients'
   history of childhood trauma. Patients' evaluation of interpersonal trust
   seems to depend more on attractiveness features of their counterparts
   than in controls, a finding that may have important implications for
   further research on the usefulness of prosocial peptides as an adjunct
   to psychotherapeutic interventions.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to test whether the eyes of an intact
   face produced a specific brain response compared to the mouth, nose, or
   hair and whether their specificity was also maintained in a scrambled
   face. Fifteen subjects were asked to focus visual attention on global
   and single elements in intact faces and in their scrambled image. EEG
   data were recorded from 256-Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor-Net200.
   Event-related potentials (ERPs) analyses showed a difference between the
   intact face and the scrambled face from N170 component until 600 ms on
   the occipito-temporal montage and at 400-600 ms on the frontal montage.
   Only the eyes showed a difference between conditions (intact/scrambled
   face) at 500 ms. The most activated source detected by sLORETA was the
   right middle temporal gyrus (BA21) for both conditions and for all
   elements. Left BA21 resulted in significantly more activation in
   response to eyes in the intact face compared to the eyes in the
   scrambled face at 500 ms. The left BA21 has a central role in high-level
   visual processing and in understanding others' intentions. These
   findings suggest a specificity of the eyes and indicate that the eyes
   play the social and communicative role of comprehending the nonverbal
   intentions of others only when inserted in an intact face.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have reported that when people self-reflectthey
   typically judge the self as more positive (or less negative) compared to
   others on a range of dimensions (such as health, social skills, or
   achievement). In the present study, we investigated whether viewing the
   self through the eyes of other people reduces this egocentric
   (self-centered) bias. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were
   examined in 17 subjects who performed judgments of adjectives in
   positive or negative valences from either self-perspective or
   other-perspective. Reaction times revealed an interaction between the
   factors perspective and emotional valence. Faster responses occurred
   after positive words in the self-perspective condition. A similar
   interaction was observed in the ERP waveforms in the time range of the
   N400 component: smaller N400 amplitudes were elicited by positive
   stimuli compared to negative stimuli in the self-perspective condition,
   but not in the other-perspective condition. Similarly, a reversed
   pattern was found in the late positive component (LPC) at 415-815 ms.
   The present study suggests that shifts in perspectives between self and
   others can change self-appraisal, which in turn reduces egocentric
   biases of the self. On a neural level, this modulation may be associated
   with an increase in self-monitoring processes.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to a constellation of traits,
   competencies, or abilities that allow individuals to understand
   emotional information and successfully navigate and solve
   social/emotional problems. While little is known about the
   neurobiological substrates that underlie EI, some evidence suggests that
   these capacities may involve a core neurocircuitry involved in emotional
   decision-making that includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, and amygdala. In a
   sample of 39 healthy volunteers (22 men; 17 women), scores on the Bar-On
   EQ-i (a trait/mixed model of EI) and Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional
   Intelligence Test (MSCEIT; an ability model of EI) were correlated with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging responses during brief
   presentations of moving facial expressions that changed in the level of
   perceived trustworthiness. Core emotion neurocircuitry was responsive to
   dynamic changes in facial features, regardless of whether they reflected
   increases or decreases in apparent trustworthiness. In response to
   facial movements indicating decreasing trustworthiness, MSCEIT
   correlated positively with functional responses of the vmPFC and rostral
   ACC, whereas the EQ-i was unrelated to regional activation. Systematic
   differences in EI ability appear to be significantly related to the
   responsiveness of the vmPFC and rostral ACC to facial movements
   suggesting potential trustworthiness.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to combine two, otherwise separated, fields of
   research regarding motor resonance and mimicry by adopting a
   naturalistic mimicry paradigm while probing motor resonance with
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). At stake was whether the motor
   system resonates instantaneously with unobtrusive nonverbal behavior of
   another person. We measured excitability in the left and right hand
   while participants viewed sequences of video clips and static images. In
   the video clips an actor performed several clerical tasks, while either
   inconspicuously touching his face (face-touching (FT) condition) or not
   (no face-touching (NFT) condition). We found that excitability was
   higher in the FT condition than in the NFT and baseline conditions.
   Furthermore, our data showed a general heightened excitability in the
   left motor cortex relative to the right. Taken together, the results
   suggest that observed hand-face gestureseven though outside the primary
   focus of attention and occurring inconspicuously throughout an ongoing
   action settingcan cause instantaneous resonant activity in the
   observer's motor system. It thus supports the idea of motor resonance
   involvement in mimicry and demonstrates that this can be studied using a
   naturalistic mimicry paradigm.}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Pretend play emerges in children the world over around 18 months and
   continues into adolescence and even adulthood. Observing and engaging in
   pretense are thought to rely on similar neural mechanisms, but little is
   known about them. Here we examined neural activation patterns associated
   with observing pretense acts, including high-likelihood, low-likelihood,
   and imaginary substitute objects, as compared with activation patterns
   when observing parallel real acts. The association between fantasy
   predisposition and cortical representations of pretense was also
   explored. Supporting prior research that used more limited types of
   pretense, observed pretense acts, when contrasted with real acts,
   elicited activity in regions associated with mentalizing. A novel
   contribution here is that substitute object pretense (high- and
   low-likelihood) elicited significantly more activity than imaginary
   (pantomime) acts not only in theory of mind regions but also in the
   superior parietal lobule, a region thought to aid in the prediction and
   error-monitoring of motor actions. Finally, when high-likelihood

Abstract = {{Effective coaching and mentoring is crucial to the success of
   individuals and organizations, yet relatively little is known about its
   neural underpinnings. Coaching and mentoring to the Positive Emotional
   Attractor (PEA) emphasizes compassion for the individual's hopes and
   dreams and has been shown to enhance a behavioral change. In contrast,
   coaching to the Negative Emotional Attractor (NEA), by focusing on
   externally defined criteria for success and the individual's weaknesses
   in relation to them, does not show sustained change. We used fMRI to
   measure BOLD responses associated with these two coaching styles. We
   hypothesized that PEA coaching would be associated with increased global
   visual processing and with engagement of the parasympathetic nervous
   system (PNS), while the NEA coaching would involve greater engagement of
   the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Regions showing more activity in
   PEA conditions included the lateral occipital cortex, superior temporal
   cortex, medial parietal, subgenual cingulate, nucleus accumbens, and
   left lateral prefrontal cortex. We relate these activations to
   visioning, PNS activity, and positive affect. Regions showing more
   activity in NEA conditions included medial prefrontal regions and right
   lateral prefrontal cortex. We relate these activations to SNS activity,
   self-trait attribution and negative affect.}},

Abstract = {{We employed a social network analysis approach to examine the
   associations between friendship network position and cortisol levels.
   The sample consisted of 74 first-year students (93\% female, ages 22-38
   years, M=27) from a highly competitive, accelerated Nursing program.
   Participants completed questionnaires online, and the entire group met
   at one time to complete a series of sociometric nominations and donated
   a saliva sample. Saliva was later assayed for cortisol. Metrics derived
   from directed friendship nominations indexed each student's friendship
   network status regarding popularity, gregariousness, and degree of
   interconnectedness. Results revealed that (1) individuals with lower
   gregariousness status (i.e., lowest number of outgoing ties) had higher
   cortisol levels, and (2) individuals with higher popularity status
   (i.e., higher numbers of incoming ties) had higher cortisol levels.
   Popularity and gregariousness-based network status is significantly
   associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity.
   Implications for prevailing theories of the social determinants of
   individual differences in biological sensitivity and susceptibility to
   context are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research explores how
   observers make causal beliefs about an event in terms of the person or
   situation. Thirty-four participants read various short descriptions of
   social events that implied either the person or the situation as the
   cause. Half of them were explicitly instructed to judge whether the
   event was caused by something about the person or the situation
   (intentional inferences), whereas the other half was instructed simply
   to read the material carefully (spontaneous inferences). The results
   showed common activation in areas related to mentalizing, across all
   types of causes or instructions (posterior superior temporal sulcus,
   temporo-parietal junction, precuneus). However, the medial prefrontal
   cortex was activated only under spontaneous instructions, but not under
   intentional instruction. This suggests a bias toward person attributions
   (e.g. fundamental attribution bias). Complementary to this, intentional
   situation attributions activated a stronger and more extended network
   compared to intentional person attributions, suggesting that situation
   attributions require more controlled, extended and broader processing of

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin functions as a hormone and neurotransmitter
   and facilitates complex social cognition and approach behavior. Given
   that empathy is an essential ingredient for third-party decision-making
   in institutions of justice, we investigated whether exogenous oxytocin
   modulates empathy of an unaffected third-party toward offenders and
   victims of criminal offenses. Healthy male participants received
   intranasal oxytocin or placebo in a randomized, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled, between-subjects design. Participants were given a
   set of legal vignettes that described an event during which an offender
   engaged in criminal offenses against victims. As an unaffected
   third-party, participants were asked to rate those criminal offenses on
   the degree to which the offender deserved punishment and how much harm
   was inflicted on the victim. Exogenous oxytocin selectively increased
   third-party decision-makers' perceptions of harm for victims but not the
   desire to punish offenders of criminal offenses. We argue that oxytocin
   promoted empathic concern for the victim, which in turn increased the
   tendency for prosocial approach behavior regarding the interpersonal
   relationship between an unaffected third-party and a fictional victim in
   the criminal scenarios. Future research should explore the context- and
   person-dependent nature of exogenous oxytocin in individuals with
   antisocial personality disorder and psychopathy, in whom deficits in
   empathy feature prominently.}},

Abstract = {{Inconsistent or null findings among studies associating behaviors on the
   externalizing spectrum-addictions, impulsivity, risk-taking,
   novelty-seeking traits-with presence of the 7-repeat allele of a common
   length polymorphism in the gene encoding the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4)
   may stem from individuals' variable exposures to prominent environmental
   moderators (gene x environment interaction). Here, we report that
   relative preference for immediate, smaller rewards over larger rewards
   delayed in time (delay discounting), a behavioral endophenotype of
   impulsive decision-making, varied by interaction of DRD4 genotype with
   childhood socioeconomic status (SES) among 546 mid-life community
   volunteers. Independent of age, sex, adulthood SES and IQ, participants
   who were both raised in families of distinctly low SES (low parental
   education and occupational grade) and carried the DRD4 7-repeat allele
   discounted future rewards more steeply than like-reared counterparts of
   alternate DRD4 genotype. In the absence of childhood socioeconomic
   disadvantage, however, participants carrying the 7-repeat allele
   discounted future rewards less steeply. This bidirectional association
   of DRD4 genotype with temporal discounting, conditioned by participants'
   early life circumstances, accords with a recently proposed developmental
   model of gene x environment interaction ('differential susceptibility')
   that posits genetically modulated sensitivity to both adverse and
   salubrious environmental influences.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{515-522}},

Abstract = {{Our impressions of other people are formed mainly from the two possible
   factors of facial attractiveness and trustworthiness. Previous studies
   have shown the importance of orbitofrontal-hippocampal interactions in
   the better remembering of attractive faces, and psychological data have
   indicated that faces giving an impression of untrustworthiness are
   remembered more accurately than those giving an impression of
   trustworthiness. However, the neural mechanisms of the latter effect are
   largely unknown. To investigate this issue, we investigated neural
   activities with event-related fMRI while the female participants rated
   their impressions of the personalities of men in terms of
   trustworthiness. After the rating, memory for faces was tested to
   identify successful encoding activity. As expected, faces that gave bad
   impressions were remembered better than those that gave neutral or good
   impressions. In fMRI data, right insular activity reflected an
   increasing function of bad impressions, and bilateral hippocampal
   activities predicted subsequent memory success. Additionally,
   correlation between these insular and hippocampal regions was
   significant only in the encoding of faces associated with a bad
   impression. Better memory for faces associated with an impression of bad

Abstract = {{Visual working memory (VWM) capacity is affected by motivational
   influences; however, little is known about how reward-related brain
   activities facilitate the VWM systems. To investigate the dynamic
   relationship between VWM- and reward-related brain activities, we
   conducted time-frequency analyses using electroencephalograph (EEG) data
   obtained during a monetary-incentive delayed-response task that required
   participants to memorize the position of colored disks. In case of a
   correct answer, participants received a monetary reward (0, 10 or 50
   Japanese yen) announced at the beginning of each trial. Behavioral
   results showed that VWM capacity under high-reward condition
   significantly increased compared with that under low- or no-reward
   condition. EEG results showed that frontal theta (6 Hz) amplitudes
   enhanced during delay periods and positively correlated with VWM
   capacity, indicating involvement of theta local synchronizations in VWM.
   Moreover, frontal beta activities (24 Hz) were identified as
   reward-related activities, because delay-period amplitudes correlated
   with increases in VWM capacity between high-reward and no-reward
   conditions. Interestingly, cross-frequency couplings between frontal
   theta and beta phases were observed only under high-reward conditions.
   These findings suggest that the functional dynamic linking between
   VWM-related theta and reward-related beta activities on the frontal
   regions plays an integral role in facilitating increases in VWM
   capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) have severe problems
   in social interactions that might be caused by deficits in social
   cognition. Since the findings about social-cognitive abilities in BPD
   are inhomogeneous, ranging from deficits to superior abilities, we aimed
   to investigate the neuronal basis of social cognition in BPD. We applied
   a paradigm with three social cognition tasks, differing in their
   complexity: basal processing of faces with a neutral expression,
   recognition of emotions, and attribution of emotional intentions
   (affective ToM). A total of 13 patients with BPD and 13 healthy matched
   controls (HCs) were included in a functional magnet resonance imaging
   study. BPD patients showed no deficits in social cognition on the
   behavioral level. However, while HCs showed increasing activation in
   areas of the mirror neuron system with increasing complexity in the
   social-cognitive task, BPD patients had hypoactivation in these areas
   and hyperactivation in the amygdala which were not modulated by task
   complexity. This activation pattern seems to reflect an enhanced
   emotional approach in the processing of social stimuli in BPD that
   allows good performance in standardized social-cognitive tasks, but
   might be the basis of social-cognitive deficits in real-life social
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroscientific studies on agency focus rather exclusively on the notion
   of who initiates and regulates actions, not on the notion of why the
   person does. The present study focused on the latter to investigate two
   different reasons underlying personal agency. Using event-related
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 16 healthy human
   subjects while they imagined the enactment of volitional, agentic
   behavior on the same task but either for a self-determined and
   intrinsically motivated reason or for a non-self-determined and
   extrinsically motivated reason. Results showed that the anterior insular
   cortex (AIC), known to be related to the sense of agency, was more
   activated during self-determined behavior while the angular gyrus, known
   to be related to the sense of loss of agency, was more activated during
   non-self-determined behavior. Furthermore, AIC activities during
   self-determined behavior correlated highly with participants'
   self-reported intrinsic satisfactions. We conclude that self-determined
   behavior is more agentic than is non-self-determined behavior and that
   personal agency arises only during self-determined, intrinsically
   motivated action.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that a brain network mainly associated with
   episodic memory has a more general function in imagining oneself in
   another time, place or perspective (e.g. episodic future thought, theory
   of mind, default mode). If this is true, counterfactual thinking (e.g.
   `If I had left the office earlier, I wouldn't have missed my train.')
   should also activate this network. Present functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study explores the common and distinct neural activity of
   counterfactual and episodic thinking by directly comparing the imagining
   of upward counterfactuals (creating better outcomes for negative past
   events) with the re-experiencing of negative past events and the
   imagining of positive future events. Results confirm that episodic and
   counterfactual thinking share a common brain network, involving a core
   memory network (hippocampal area, temporal lobes, midline, and lateral
   parietal lobes) and prefrontal areas that might be related to
   mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex) and performance monitoring (right
   prefrontal cortex). In contrast to episodic past and future thinking,
   counterfactual thinking recruits some of these areas more strongly and
   extensively, and additionally activates the bilateral inferior parietal
   lobe and posterior medial frontal cortex. We discuss these findings in
   view of recent fMRI evidence on the working of episodic memory and

Abstract = {{Although it has been suggested that social deficits of autism spectrum
   disorders (ASDs) are related to reward circuitry dysfunction, very
   little is known about the neural reward mechanisms in ASD. In the
   current functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated
   brain activations in response to both social and monetary reward in a
   group of children with ASD, relative to matched controls. Participants
   with ASD showed the expected hypoactivation in the mesocorticolimbic
   circuitry in response to both reward types. In particular, diminished
   activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed when money, but not
   when social reward, was at stake, whereas the amygdala and anterior
   cingulate cortex were hypoactivated within the ASD group in response to
   both rewards. These data indicate that the reward circuitry is
   compromised in ASD in social as well as in non-social, i.e. monetary
   conditions, which likely contributes to atypical motivated behaviour.
   Taken together, with incentives used in this study sample, there is
   evidence for a general reward dysfunction in ASD. However, more
   ecologically valid social reward paradigms are needed to fully
   understand, whether there is any domain specificity to the reward
   deficit that appears evident in ASD, which would be most consistent with
   the ASD social phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research showed that perception of death-related vs

   death-relevance judgments on linguistic cues and (ii) whether the neural
   activity underlying death-related thought can predict individuals'

   death-related/unrelated words, life-related/unrelated words, and
   negative-valence/neutral words in separate sessions. Participants were

   judgments vs life-relevance/valence judgments showed decreased activity
   in the bilateral insula. The sustained insular activity was correlated
   with dispositional death anxiety, but only in those with weak transient
   frontoparietal responses to death-related words. Our results dissociate
   the transient and sustained neural responses to death-related linguistic
   cues and suggest that the combination of the transient and sustained
   neural activities can predict dispositional death anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that affect acts as modulator of cognitive
   processes and in particular that induced mood has an effect on the way
   semantic memory is used on-line. We used event-related potentials (ERPs)
   to examine affective modulation of semantic information processing under
   three different moods: neutral, positive and negative. Fifteen subjects
   read 324 pairs of sentences, after mood induction procedure with 30
   pictures of neutral, 30 pictures of positive and 30 pictures of neutral
   valence: 108 sentences were read in each mood induction condition.
   Sentences ended with three word types: expected words, within-category
   violations, and between-category violations. N400 amplitude was measured
   to the three word types under each mood induction condition. Under
   neutral mood, a congruency (more negative N400 amplitude for unexpected
   relative to expected endings) and a category effect (more negative N400
   amplitude for between- than to within-category violations) were
   observed. Also, results showed differences in N400 amplitude for both
   within- and between-category violations as a function of mood: while
   positive mood tended to facilitate the integration of unexpected but
   related items, negative mood made their integration as difficult as
   unexpected and unrelated items. These findings suggest the differential
   impact of mood on access to long-term semantic memory during sentence
   comprehension.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work has shown that emotional control is highly valued in Asian
   culture. However, little is known about how this cultural value might
   influence emotional processing. Here, we hypothesized that Asians are
   `culturally trained' to down-regulate emotional processing when required
   to suppress emotional expressions. Such down-regulation, however, is
   unlikely for European Americans because their culture values emotional
   expression (vs control) more. To test these predictions, we adopted the
   parietal late positive potential (LPP) of the event-related potential as
   an objective indicator of emotional processing. Both Asian and European
   Americans were exposed to either unpleasant or neutral pictures while
   instructed to either attend or suppress expression of emotions. Both
   groups showed an equally pronounced parietal positivity similar to 600
   ms post-stimulus. As predicted, however, Asians subsequently showed a
   significant decrease of the parietal LPP in the suppression (vs attend)
   condition. The initial positivity completely disappeared 2000 ms
   post-stimulus. In contrast, for European Americans the parietal LPP
   suppression effect was completely absent although there was an early
   occurring, sustained increase in frontal positivity in the suppression
   (vs attend) condition. Implications for culture and emotion research are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The manner in which disparate affective responses shape attitudes toward
   other individuals has received a great deal of attention in neuroscience
   research. However, the malleability of these affective responses remains
   largely unexplored. The perceived controllability of a stigma (whether
   or not the bearer of the stigma is perceived as being responsible for
   his or her condition) has been found to polarize behavioral affective
   responses to that stigma. The current study uses functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to identify the neural correlates underlying the
   evaluation of stigmatized individuals (people who are homeless) when
   perceptions of the controllability of their condition are altered.
   Results demonstrated that perceivers engaged neural networks implicated
   in inferring intentionality (e.g. the medial prefrontal cortex) when
   they evaluated a homeless individual who was described as being
   responsible for becoming homeless. Conversely, neural networks
   associated with resolving strong affective responses (e.g. insula) were
   engaged when evaluating a homeless individual who was described as not
   being responsible for becoming homeless.}},

Abstract = {{After reactivation, apparently stable memories may reenter an unstable
   state in which they are modifiable, requiring another phase of
   stabilization, called reconsolidation Recent evidence shows that during
   reconsolidation, reactivated memories may be updated by the
   incorporation of new information. In the present study, we examined
   whether the updating of episodic memories depends on the strength of new
   encoding after reactivation. To this end, healthy participants learned
   negative and neutral pictures, reactivated them 1 week later, and
   learned new pictures either once or three times immediately after
   reactivation. A recognition test was performed another week later. Our
   results show that the impact of new learning after reactivation depended
   critically on the strength of new encoding: Whereas learning new
   pictures only once after reactivation had no effect on subsequent
   memory, learning new pictures three times after reactivation reduced
   subsequent memory accuracy, mainly due to intrusions from the newly
   learned pictures. Our findings indicate that the strength of new
   encoding after reactivation plays a critical role for the updating of
   episodic memories and may have important implications for therapeutic
   interventions that aim to alter unwanted memories after reactivation.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 5.4 million Americans. Evidence
   suggests that individuals who are positive for the apolipoprotein E
   (ApoE) epsilon 4 allele are at higher risk for developing the disease.
   Studies have also shown that the epsilon 4 allele is linked to olfactory
   decline. Olfactory functioning may be investigated using olfactory
   event-related potentials (OERPs). The high temporal resolution of OERPs
   enables an understanding of the neural correlates of olfactory
   processing and functioning. This study investigated the effects of age,
   ApoE epsilon 4 status, response type, and electrode site on OERP latency
   and amplitude during encoding and retrieval in an odor recognition
   memory task. The 60 participants were equally divided into 3 age groups
   matched on epsilon 4 status: younger, middle, and older. Odors were
   presented using a computer-controlled olfactometer. Participants were
   notified during encoding that this was a task of odor memory. Results
   indicated differences in OERP activity as a function of age, ApoE
   epsilon 4 status, response type, and electrode site. These findings
   highlight the potential of OERPs to distinguish epsilon 4- and epsilon
   4+ individuals and to contribute to an earlier diagnosis of AD.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the effect of discriminative fear conditioning on the shape
   of the generalization gradient, two groups of participants first learned
   to discriminate between two color stimuli, one paired with an electrical
   shock (conditional stimulus, CS+) and the other explicitly unpaired
   (CS-). The CS+ was held constant as an intermediate (ambiguous) value
   along the blue-green color dimension while the CS- varied between groups
   as opposite endpoints along the blue-green color dimension.
   Postdiscrimination testing, using spectral wavelengths above and below
   the CS+, revealed opposing asymmetric gradients of conditioned skin
   conductance responses across training groups that skewed in a direction
   opposite the CS-. Moreover, perceptual ratings for the color of the CS+
   were affected by discriminative conditioning, with the color value of
   the blue or green CS inducing a shift in the frequency for ratings of
   the ambiguous CS+ as either ``green{''} or ``blue,{''} respectively.
   These results extend findings on gradient shifts in the animal
   literature and suggest that postdiscrimination testing provides a more
   comprehensive estimate of the effects of discriminative fear
   conditioning than testing responses solely to the conditioned stimuli.}},

   UCS Revaluation After Fear Conditioning in Humans}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The nature of the relationship between explicit and implicit learning is
   a topic of considerable debate. To investigate this relationship we
   conducted two experiments on postconditioning revaluation of the
   unconditional stimulus (UCS) in human fear conditioning. In Experiment
   1, the intensity of the UCS was decreased after acquisition for one
   group (devaluation) and held constant for another group (control). A
   subsequent test revealed that even though both groups exhibited similar
   levels of UCS expectancy, the devaluation group had significantly
   smaller conditional skin conductance responses. The devaluation effect
   was not explained by differences in the explicit estimates of UCS
   probability or explicit knowledge that the UCS intensity had changed. In
   Experiment 2, the value of the UCS was increased after acquisition for
   one group (inflation) and held constant for another group (control).
   Test performance revealed that UCS inflation did not alter expectancy
   ratings, but the inflation group exhibited larger learned skin
   conductance responses than the control group. The inflation effect was
   not explained by differences in the explicit estimates of UCS
   probability or explicit knowledge that the UCS intensity had changed.
   The SCR revaluation effect was not dependent on explicit memory
   processes in either experiment. In both experiments we found differences
   on an implicit measure of learning in the absence of changes in explicit
   measures. Together, the differences observed between expectancy measures
   and skin conductance support the idea that these responses might reflect
   different types of memory formed during the same training procedure and
   be supported by separate neural systems.}},

Abstract = {{In everyday life, decisions are often made under stress and while being
   occupied with multiple tasks. It has recently been shown that acute
   stress impairs decision making under risk. Performing a parallel
   executive task also caused riskier decision making. To investigate the
   effects of a combination of these two factors on decision making, we
   conducted a large (N = 126) experimental study with a 2 X 2 design
   (stress vs. no stress and parallel task vs. no parallel task). Stress
   was induced using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and controls
   underwent the placebo TSST. Salivary samples were collected to assess
   cortisol and alpha amylase concentrations as markers of the two stress
   response systems. Decision making was measured using the Game of Dice
   Task (GDT). A 2-back task served as parallel executive task. Our results
   revealed a significant interaction between stress and the parallel
   executive task. In line with our earlier findings, acute stress and a
   parallel executive task individually tended to impair decision making
   under risk, manifested by more high risky than low risky choices.
   Interestingly, stressed participants in the parallel-task condition (GDT
   plus 2-back) showed similar decision-maldng behavior as nonstressed
   single-task participants. Regression analyses revealed executive
   functions to moderate stress effects on decisions under risk. Reasons
   for these paradoxical findings are discussed with respect to
   stress-evoked cognitive alterations that may benefit decision making
   under risk, if an executive task is performed simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Disgust extinction is an important mechanism relevant for the treatment
   of psychiatric disorders. However, only a few studies have investigated
   disgust extinction. Moreover, because disgust sensitivity (DS) is
   considered as a relevant factor for learning processes, this study also
   investigated the potential relationship between DS and disgust
   extinction learning. The aim of this study was to explore the neuronal
   correlates of disgust extinction, as well as changes in skin conductance
   responses (SCRs) and evaluative conditioning. Twenty subjects were
   exposed to a differential extinction paradigm, in which a previous
   conditioned, and now unreinforced, stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS+)
   was compared to a second stimulus (CS-), which was previously not
   associated with the unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Extinction learning
   was measured on three different response levels (BOLD responses, SCRs,
   and evaluative conditioning). Regarding evaluative conditioning, the CS+
   was rated as more unpleasant than the CS-. Interestingly, significantly
   increased amygdala responses and SCRs toward to the CS- were observed.
   Finally, a (negative) trend was found between DS scores and BOLD
   responses of the prefrontal cortex. The present findings showed a
   dissociation of different response levels. The increased CS- responses
   could be explained by the assumption that the increased amygdala
   activity may reflect a safety learning signal during the first
   extinction trials and the subjective focus may therefore shift from the
   CS+ to the CS-. The correlation finding supports previous studies
   postulating that DS hampers extinction processes. The present results
   point toward dissociations between the response levels in context of
   extinction processes.}},

Title = {{Two Functional Serotonin Polymorphisms Moderate the Effect of Food
   Reinforcement on BMI}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{387-399}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Food reinforcement, or the motivation to eat, has been associated with
   increased energy intake, greater body weight, and prospective weight
   gain. Much of the previous research on the reinforcing value of food has
   focused on the role of dopamine, but it may be worthwhile to examine
   genetic polymorphisms in the serotonin and opioid systems as these
   neurotransmitters have been shown to be related to reinforcement
   processes and to influence energy intake. We examined the relationship
   among 44 candidate genetic polymorphisms in the dopamine, serotonin, and
   opioid systems, as well as food reinforcement and body mass index (BMI)
   in a sample of 245 individuals. Polymorphisms in the monoamine oxidase A
   (MAOA-LPR) and serotonin receptor 2A genes (rs6314) moderated the effect
   of food reinforcement on BMI, accounting for an additional 5-10\%
   variance and revealed a potential role of the single nucleotide
   polymorphism, rs6314, in the serotonin 2A receptor as a differential
   susceptibility factor for obesity. Differential susceptibility describes
   a factor that can confer either risk or protection depending on a second
   variable, such that rs6314 is predictive of both high and low BMI based
   on the level of food reinforcement, while the diathesis stress or
   dual-gain model only influences one end of the outcome measure. The
   interaction with MAOA-LPR better fits the diathesis stress model, with
   the 3.5R/4R allele conferring protection for individuals low in food
   reinforcement. These results provide new insight into genes
   theoretically involved in obesity, and support the hypothesis that
   genetics moderate the association between food reinforcement and BMI.}},

Abstract = {{Aggression in humans and animals has been linked to androgens and
   serotonin function. To further our understanding of the effect of
   androgens on serotonin and aggression in male macaques, we sought to
   manipulate circulating androgens and the activity of aromatase; and to
   then determine behavior and the endogenous availability of serotonin.
   Male Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) were castrated for 5-7 months
   and then treated for 3 months with (a) placebo; (b) testosterone (T);
   (c) T + Dutasteride (5a reductase inhibitor; Avodart (TM)); (d) T +
   Letrozole (nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor; Femera (TM)); (e) Flutamide
   + ATD (androgen antagonist plus steroidal aromatase inhibitor); or (f)
   dihydrotestosterone (DHT) + ATD (n = 5/group). Behavioral observations
   were made during treatments. At the end of the treatment period, each
   animal was sedated with propofol and administered a bolus of
   fenfluramine (5 mg/kg). Fenfluramine causes the release of serotonin
   proportional to endogenous availability and in turn, serotonin
   stimulates the secretion of prolactin. Therefore, serum prolactin
   concentrations reflect endogenous serotonin. Fenfluramine significantly
   increased serotonin/prolactin in all groups (p < .0001).
   Fenfluramine-induced serotonin/prolactin in the T-treated group was
   significantly higher than the other groups (p < .0001). Castration
   partially reduced the serotonin/prolactin response and Letrozole
   partially blocked the effect of T. Complete inhibition of aromatase with
   ATD, a noncompetitive inhibitor, significantly and similarly reduced the
   fenfluramine-induced serotonin/prolactin response in the presence or
   absence of DHT. Neither aggressive behavior nor yawning (indicators of
   androgen activity) correlated with serotonin/prolactin, but posited
   aromatase activity correlated significantly with prolactin (p < .0008;
   r(2) = 0.95). In summary, androgens induced aggressive behavior but they
   did not regulate serotonin. Altogether, the data suggest that aromatase
   activity supports serotonin production and that androgens increase
   aggression by another mechanism.}},

Volume = {{127}},

Abstract = {{The anterior thalamic nuclei form part of a network for episodic memory
   in humans. The importance of these nuclei for recognition and recency
   judgments remains, however, unclear. Rats with anterior thalamic nuclei
   lesions and their controls were tested on object recognition, along with
   two types of recency judgment. The spontaneous discrimination of a novel
   object or a novel odor from a familiar counterpart (recognition memory)
   was not affected by anterior thalamic lesions when tested after
   retention delays of 1 and 60 min. To measure recency memory, rats were
   shown two familiar objects, one of which had been explored more
   recently. In one condition, rats were presented with two lists (List A,
   List B) of objects separated by a delay, thereby creating two distinct
   blocks of stimuli. After an additional delay, rats were presented with
   pairs of objects, one from List A and one from List B (between-block
   recency). No lesion-induced deficit was apparent for recency
   discriminations between objects from different lists, despite using
   three different levels of task difficulty. In contrast, rats with
   anterior thalamic lesions were significantly impaired when presented
   with a continuous list of objects and then tested on their ability to
   distinguish between those items early and late in the same list
   (within-block recency). The contrasting effects on recognition and
   recency support the notion that interlinked hippocampal anterior
   thalamic interconnections support aspects of both spatial and nonspatial
   learning, although the role of the anterior thalamic nuclei may be
   restricted to a subclass of recency judgments (within-block).}},

Abstract = {{Pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), which are emitted by hypothermic
   pups, and pup odor are thought to be triggers of maternal behavior in
   mice. We investigated whether pup odor stimulated maternal responses to
   pup USVs in mother C57BL/6 mice. Two-choice tests were conducted by
   introducing mothers into a test cage in which a tube was attached on
   each long wall, and the duration spent in each tube was compared. Pup
   USVs were reproduced by an ultrasonic speaker at the tube end. In some
   cases, cotton with pup odor was also presented at the end of the tube.
   Compared to no stimuli, mothers did not specifically approach the sole
   presentation of either reproduced pup USVs or pup odor. However,
   compared to the sole presentation of pup odor, the simultaneous
   presentation of pup USVs and odor induced a specific approach response.
   These results suggested that pup USVs and odor synergistically
   stimulated maternal behavior. In addition, it was confirmed that mothers
   approached hypothermic pups emitting pup USVs for longer than
   anesthetized silent pups. To investigate the underlying neural
   mechanisms, we observed neural responses to various stimuli with the
   immunohistochemistry of c-fos expression. In the bed nucleus of the
   stria terminalis, the medial preoptic area, the central nucleus of the
   amygdala, and the basolateral amygdala, the numbers of c-fos-positive
   cells were significantly increased following the simultaneous
   presentation of pup USVs and odor compared to the presentation of each
   alone, suggesting that these nuclei were involved in multimodal
   processing related to maternal behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are emitted in response to a sexual
   partner before, during, and after copulation. These vocalizations are
   the so-called 50-kHz USVs and can be subdivided into flat and
   frequency-modulated (FM) 50-kHz trill calls. In the present series of
   experiments, the potential unconditioned and conditioned incentive
   properties of female 50-kHz USVs for male rats were examined. USVs were
   recorded from sexually receptive females during the precopulatory phase.
   A complete 10-min song, or single flat or FM trill calls were selected
   as auditory stimuli for Experiments 1 and 2. As FM trill calls, a
   multistep call was used in Experiments 1 and 2a, and an upward ramp call
   was used in Experiment 2b. The auditory stimuli were played back with a
   loudspeaker to naive and sexually experienced male rats in a sexual
   incentive motivation test. The odor of a sexually receptive female rat
   was also used as an incentive stimulus for comparison. In a third
   experiment, a devocalized female, a sham female and a male rat were used
   as incentive stimuli. It was found that the auditory stimuli did not
   induce approach behavior in naive and sexually experienced male rats,
   but the olfactory stimulus did. In addition, the males spent equal
   amounts of time in the vicinity of devocalized and vocalizing females.
   These data show that 50-kHz USVs neither are unconditioned nor
   conditioned incentives for male rats.}},

Abstract = {{Studies in songbirds implicate opioid neuropeptides in singing behavior;
   however, past results are contradictory. In starlings, the effect of
   opioid manipulations on sexually motivated courtship song differed in
   birds naturally singing at low compared to high rates, and mu-opioid
   receptors were denser in several regions, including the medial preoptic
   nucleus (POM) in low singing males. In the present study, we found that
   low singing male starlings also had significantly higher enkephalin
   (ENK) immunolabeling densities in the POM than high singers. We blocked
   opioid receptor activity in the POM with naloxone injections and found
   that this increased both song rate and song bout length in low singers,
   suggesting that high densities of mu receptors and ENK in the POM
   actively suppress song in these males. In contrast to its effects on low
   singers, naloxone in the POM of high singers dose dependently decreased
   song rate and tended to reduce song bout length. This suggests that at
   least some level of opioid activity in POM is necessary for song
   production. Our results are the first to demonstrate that direct
   administration of naloxone into the POM influences sexually motivated
   song, and that effects differ depending on an individual's initial rate
   of song and associated density of ENK. We suggest that differential
   effects seen in past studies of opioids and song may in part be
   explained by differences in the natural song rate of subjects and
   accompanying differences in ENK activity and neural substrate
   sensitivity to opioids in POM.}},

Abstract = {{Ejaculation promotes endogenous opioid release. Copulation to exhaustion
   produces several enduring behavioral and physiological changes, among
   which a long-lasting sexual behavior inhibition and generalized drug
   hypersensitivity are the most conspicuous. Because copulation to
   exhaustion involves multiple successive ejaculations, in this work we
   hypothesized that the endogenous opioids released by multiple
   ejaculations during the copulation to exhaustion process might mediate
   the abovementioned sexual satiation-induced changes. To test this
   hypothesis, sexually experienced male rats were injected with the opioid
   receptor antagonist naltrexone before copulation to exhaustion and were
   tested for sexual behavior or drug hypersensitivity 24 h later. The
   latter was assessed by the appearance of the flat body posture sign of
   the serotonergic syndrome, in response to doses of the
   5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A)) receptor agonist
   8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), lower than those
   normally inducing this sign. The effect of administering naltrexone to
   already sexually exhausted animals (i.e., 24 h after the sexual
   satiation process) on both responses was also tested. Results showed
   that endogenous opioids mediate the establishment and maintenance of the
   long-lasting sexual behavior inhibition but not the drug
   hypersensitivity (to 8-OH-DPAT) characteristic of sexually exhausted
   male rats. It is concluded that although both phenomena appear as a
   consequence of copulation to satiation and follow a same time course of
   recovery, they are produced by distinct mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Pavlovian conditioning processes contribute to the etiology of nicotine
   dependence. Conditioning involving interoceptive stimuli is increasingly
   recognized as playing a role in many diseases and psychopathologies,
   including drug addiction. Previous animal research on diminishing the
   influence of interoceptive conditioning has been limited to antagonism
   and nonreinforced exposures to the drug stimulus. The goal of the
   present research was to determine whether interoceptive conditioning
   with a nicotine stimulus could be diminished through an unconditioned
   stimulus (US) devaluation procedure. In two separate experiments, male
   Sprague Dawley rats received nicotine injections (0.4 mg base/kg)
   followed by intermittent sucrose (26\%) access in a conditioning
   chamber. On intermixed saline sessions, sucrose was withheld.
   Conditioning was demonstrated by a reliable increase in head entries in
   the dipper receptacle on nicotine versus saline sessions. After
   conditioning, rats in a devaluation condition were given access to
   sucrose in their home cages immediately followed by a lithium chloride
   (LiCl) injection on 3 consecutive days. On subsequent test days,
   nicotine-evoked conditioned responding was significantly attenuated.
   Within-subject (Experiment 1) and between-subjects (Experiment 2)
   controls revealed that the diminished responding was not attributable to
   mere exposure to the sucrose US in the devaluation phase. Experiment 2
   included a LiCl-alone control group. Repeated illness induced by LiCl
   did not reduce later nicotine-evoked responding. These findings suggest
   that there is a direct association between the interoceptive stimulus
   effects of nicotine and the appetitive sucrose US (i.e., stimulus
   stimulus) rather than a stimulus response association.}},

Abstract = {{Rats avoid intake of a saccharin cue when paired with a drug of abuse.
   While this is true for most subjects, the degree of avoidance of the
   drug-paired cue depends upon many factors including an individual rat's
   preference for rewards. That said, the direction of this effect is
   complex. For example, reward-preferring Lewis rats exhibit greater
   cocaine-induced avoidance of a saccharin cue relative to Fischer 344
   rats; while reward-preferring mice that overexpress Delta PosB (NSE-tTA
   X TetOp-Delta FosB) exhibit less avoidance of the drug-paired taste cue
   compared to controls. The aim here was to use two strains of commonly
   used mice, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, to determine whether known differences
   in sensitivity to rewards will facilitate or attenuate drug-induced
   suppression of intake of a drug-paired taste cue. The results of
   Experiment 1 demonstrate that C57BL/6J mice, compared with DBA/2J mice,
   exhibit attenuated suppression of saccharin intake when if is paired
   with cocaine. The results of Experiment 2 demonstrate that strain
   differences in impulsivity are not likely to account for these
   differences. It is proposed that, while the C57BL/6J mice typically are
   more responsive to drug, they also are more responsive to natural
   rewards (in this case saccharin), and the stronger preference for
   saccharin serves to militate against drug.}},

Abstract = {{Considering advice from others is a pervasive element of human social
   life. We used the judge-advisor paradigm to investigate the neural
   correlates of advice evaluation and advice integration by means of
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results demonstrate that
   evaluating advice recruits the mentalizing network, brain regions
   activated when people think about others' mental states. Important
   activation differences exist, however, depending upon the perceived
   competence of the advisor. Consistently, additional analyses demonstrate
   that integrating others' advice, i.e., how much participants actually
   adjust their initial estimate, correlates with neural activity in the
   centromedial amygdala in the case of a competent and with activity in
   visual cortex in the case of an incompetent advisor. Taken together, our
   findings, therefore, demonstrate that advice evaluation and integration
   rely on dissociable neural mechanisms and that significant differences
   exist depending upon the advisor's reputation, which suggests different
   modes of processing advice depending upon the perceived competence of
   the advisor.}},

Abstract = {{Self-construal priming modulates human behavior and associated neural
   activity. However, the neural activity associated with the
   self-construal priming procedure itself remains unknown. It is also
   unclear whether and how self-construal priming affects neural activity
   prior to engaging in a particular task. To address this gap, we scanned
   Chinese adults, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, during
   self-construal priming and a following resting state. We found that,
   relative to a calculation task, both interdependent and independent
   self-construal priming activated the ventral medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The contrast of
   interdependent vs. independent self-construal priming also revealed
   increased activity in the dorsal MPFC and left middle frontal cortex.
   The regional homogeneity analysis of the resting-state activity revealed
   increased local synchronization of spontaneous activity in the dorsal
   MPFC but decreased local synchronization of spontaneous activity in the
   PCC when contrasting interdependent vs. independent self-construal
   priming. The functional connectivity analysis of the resting-state
   activity, however, did not show significant difference in
   synchronization of activities in remote brain regions between different
   priming conditions. Our findings suggest that accessible
   collectivistic/individualistic mind-set induced by self-construal
   priming is associated with modulations of both task-related and
   resting-state activity in the default mode network.}},

Abstract = {{The human ability to perceive and understand others' suffering is
   critical to reinforcing and maintaining our social bonds. What is not
   clear, however, is the extent to which this generalizes to nonhuman
   entities. Anecdotal evidence indicates that people may engage in
   empathy-like processes when observing suffering nonhuman entities, but
   psychological research suggests that we more readily empathize with
   those to whom we are closer and more similar. In this research, we
   examined neural responses in participants while they were presented with
   pictures of human versus dog suffering. We found that viewing human and
   animal suffering led to large overlapping regions of activation
   previously implicated in empathic responding to suffering, including the
   anterior cingulate gyrus and anterior insula. Direct comparisons of
   viewing human and animal suffering also revealed differences such that
   human suffering yielded significantly greater medial prefrontal
   activation, consistent with high-level theory of mind, whereas animal
   suffering yielded significantly greater parietal and inferior frontal
   activation, consistent with more semantic evaluation and perceptual
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Depressed mothers show negatively biased responses to their infants'
   emotional bids, perhaps due to faulty processing of infant cues. This
   study is the first to examine depression-related differences in mothers'
   neural response to their own infant's emotion faces, considering both
   effects of perinatal depression history and current depressive symptoms.
   Primiparous mothers (n=22), half of whom had a history of major
   depressive episodes (with one episode occurring during pregnancy and/or
   postpartum), were exposed to images of their own and unfamiliar infants'
   joy and distress faces during functional neuroimaging. Group differences
   (depression vs. no-depression) and continuous effects of current
   depressive symptoms were tested in relation to neural response to own
   infant emotion faces. Compared to mothers with no psychiatric diagnoses,
   those with depression showed blunted responses to their own infant's
   distress faces in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Mothers with
   higher levels of current symptomatology showed reduced responses to
   their own infant's joy faces in the orbitofrontal cortex and insula.
   Current symptomatology also predicted lower responses to own infant
   joydistress in left-sided prefrontal and insula/striatal regions. These
   deficits in self-regulatory and motivational response circuits may help
   explain parenting difficulties in depressed mothers.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Testosterone to cortisol (T/C) ratios could be associated with feelings
   and expression of anger as high testosterone and low cortisol levels
   indicate a predisposition to violence. The basal T/C ratio has recently
   been proposed as a marker for proneness to social aggression; so far,
   however, only its value as an indicator of state anger or violence has
   been investigated. Given this, we aimed to establish whether the T/C
   ratio response to acute stress was a specific psychobiological feature
   in individuals with a history of violence, namely, perpetrators of
   intimate partner violence (IPV). T/C ratio and anger responses were
   compared in men jailed for IPV and controls using the Trier Social
   Stress Test. IPV perpetrators had higher T/C ratios than controls,
   during the preparation period, and 15 and 30 minutes post-task. In IPV
   perpetrators, high T/C ratios were linked to better self-esteem and good
   mental health. An increase in anger may increase proneness to violence
   by altering hormones and, thereby, increasing T/C ratios. The basal T/C
   ratio together with acute stress responses and other indicators could
   serve as a marker to identify men at high risk of reacting violently to
   their partners.}},

Abstract = {{Taking another person's viewpoint and making sense of their actions are
   key processes that guide social behavior. Previous neuroimaging
   investigations have largely studied these processes separately. The
   current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine how
   the brain incorporates another person's viewpoint and actions into
   visual perspective judgments. Participants made a leftright judgment
   about the location of a target object from their own (egocentric) or an
   actor's visual perspective (altercentric). Actor location varied around
   a table and the actor was either reaching or not reaching for the target
   object. Analyses examined brain regions engaged in the egocentric and
   altercentric tasks, brain regions where response magnitude tracked the
   orientation of the actor in the scene and brain regions sensitive to the
   action performed by the actor. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   response in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was sensitive to actor
   orientation in the altercentric task, whereas the response in right
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was sensitive to actor orientation in the
   egocentric task. Thus, dmPFC and right IFG may play distinct but
   complementary roles in visual perspective taking (VPT). Observation of a
   reaching actor compared to a non-reaching actor yielded activation in
   lateral occipitotemporal cortex, regardless of task, showing that these
   regions are sensitive to body posture independent of social context. By
   considering how an observed actor's location and action influence the
   neural bases of visual perspective judgments, the current study supports
   the view that multiple neurocognitive routes operate during VPT.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of chronic childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM;
   emotional abuse and/or neglect), adequately responding to facial
   expressions is an important skill. Over time, however, this adaptive
   response may lead to a persistent vigilance for emotional facial
   expressions. The amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are
   key regions in face processing. However, the neurobiological correlates
   of face processing in adults reporting CEM are yet unknown. We examined
   amydala and mPFC reactivity to emotional faces (Angry, Fearful, Sad,
   Happy, Neutral) vs scrambled faces in healthy controls and unmedicated
   patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders reporting CEM before
   the age of 16 years (n = 60), and controls and patients who report no
   childhood abuse (n = 75). We found that CEM was associated with enhanced
   bilateral amygdala reactivity to emotional faces in general, and
   independent of psychiatric status. Furthermore, we found no support for
   differential mPFC functioning, suggesting that amygdala
   hyper-responsivity to emotional facial perception in adults reporting
   CEM may be independent from top-down influences of the mPFC. These
   findings may be key in understanding the increased emotional sensitivity
   and interpersonal difficulties, that have been reported in individuals
   with a history of CEM.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown overlapping neural activations for

   These shared representations have been assumed to provide indirect
   evidence for a human mirror neuron system, which is suggested to be a
   prerequisite of action comprehension. We aimed at clarifying whether
   shared representations in and beyond human mirror areas are specifically
   activated by affective facial expressions or whether they are activated
   by facial expressions independent of the emotional meaning. During
   neuroimaging, participants observed and executed happy and non-emotional
   facial expressions. Shared representations were revealed for happy
   facial expressions in the pars opercularis, the precentral gyrus, in the
   superior temporal gyrus/medial temporal gyrus (MTG), in the
   pre-supplementary motor area and in the right amygdala. All areas showed
   less pronounced activation in the non-emotional condition. When directly
   compared, significant stronger neural responses emerged for happy facial
   expressions in the pre-supplementary motor area and in the MTG than for
   non-emotional stimuli. We assume that activation of shared
   representations depends on the affect and (social) relevance of the
   facial expression. The pre-supplementary motor area is a core-shared
   representation-structure supporting observation and execution of
   affective contagious facial expressions and might have a modulatory role
   during the preparation of executing happy facial expressions.}},

Abstract = {{`Social brain' circuitry has recently been implicated in processing
   slow, gentle touch targeting a class of slow-conducting, unmyelinated
   nerves, CT afferents, which are present only in the hairy skin of
   mammals. Given the importance of such `affective touch' in social
   relationships, the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study aimed to replicate the finding of `social brain' involvement in
   processing CT-targeted touch and to examine the relationship between the
   neural response and individuals' social abilities. During an fMRI scan,
   19 healthy adults received alternating blocks of slow (CT-optimal) and
   fast (non-optimal) brushing to the forearm. Relative to fast touch, the
   slow touch activated contralateral insula, superior temporal sulcus
   (STS), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and
   amygdala. Connectivity analyses revealed co-activation of the mPFC,
   insula and amygdala during slow touch. Additionally, participants'
   autistic traits negatively correlated with the response to slow touch in
   the OFC and STS. The current study replicates and extends findings of
   the involvement of a network of `social brain' regions in processing
   CT-targeted affective touch, emphasizing the multimodal nature of this
   system. Variability in the brain response to such touch illustrates a
   tight coupling of social behavior and social brain function in typical
   adults.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the existence and underlying neural mechanism of a new norm

   willing to make choices-such as who is more intelligent, or who is more
   polite-between two white individuals (same-race decisions) than between
   a white and a black individual (cross-race decisions), a tendency which
   was evident more when judgments involved traits related to black
   stereotypes. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the
   mechanisms underlying racial paralysis, to examine the mechanisms
   underlying racial paralysis, revealing greater recruitment of brain
   regions implicated in socially appropriate behavior (ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex), conflict detection (anterior cingulate cortex),
   deliberative processing (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and inhibition
   (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex). We also discuss the impact of racial
   paralysis on the quality of interracial relations.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Social dysfunction has been recognized as an elementary feature of
   schizophrenia, but it remains a crucial issue whether social deficits in
   schizophrenia concern the inter-subjective domain or primarily have
   their roots in disturbances of self-experience. Social perception
   comprises vicarious processes grounding an experiential
   inter-relationship with others as well as self-regulation processes
   allowing to maintain a coherent sense of self. The present study
   investigated whether the functional neural basis underlying these
   processes is altered in first-episode schizophrenia (FES). Twenty-four
   FES patients and 22 healthy control participants underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging during a social perception task requiring
   them to watch videos depicting other individuals' inanimate and
   animate/social tactile stimulations, and a tactile localizer condition.
   Activation in ventral premotor cortex for observed bodily tactile
   stimulations was reduced in the FES group and negatively correlated with
   self-experience disturbances. Moreover, FES patients showed aberrant
   differential activation in posterior insula for first-person tactile
   experiences and observed affective tactile stimulations. These findings
   suggest that social perception in FES at a pre-reflective level is
   characterized by disturbances of self-experience, including impaired
   multisensory representations and self-other distinction. However, the
   results also show that social perception in FES involves more complex
   alterations of neural activation at multiple processing levels.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Reasoning often occurs under emotionally charged, opinion-laden
   circumstances. The belief-bias effect indexes the extent to which
   reasoning is based upon beliefs rather than logical structure. We
   examined whether emotional content increases this effect, particularly
   for adults genetically predisposed to be more emotionally reactive.
   SS/SLG carriers of the serotonin transporter genotype (5-HTTLPR) were
   less accurate selectively for evaluating emotional relational reasoning
   problems with belief-logic conflict relative to LALA carriers. Trait
   anxiety was positively associated with emotional belief-bias, and the
   5-HTTLPR genotype significantly accounted for the variance in this
   association. Thus, deductive reasoning, a higher cognitive ability, is
   sensitive to differences in emotionality rooted in serotonin
   neurotransmitter function.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{410-417}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The ability to self-regulate can become impaired when people are
   required to engage in successive acts of effortful self-control, even
   when self-control occurs in different domains. Here, we used functional
   neuroimaging to test whether engaging in effortful inhibition in the
   cognitive domain would lead to putative dysfunction in the emotional
   domain. Forty-eight participants viewed images of emotional scenes
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging in two sessions that were
   separated by a challenging attention control task that required
   effortful inhibition (depletion group) or not (control group). Compared
   to the control group, depleted participants showed increased activity in
   the left amygdala to negative but not to positive or neutral scenes.
   Moreover, whereas the control group showed reduced amygdala activity to
   all scene types (i.e. habituation), the depletion group showed increased
   amygdala activity relative to their pre-depletion baseline; however this
   was only significant for negative scenes. Finally, depleted participants
   showed reduced functional connectivity between the left amygdala and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex during negative scene processing. These
   findings demonstrate that consuming self-regulatory resources leads to
   an exaggerated neural response to emotional material that appears
   specific to negatively valenced stimuli and further suggests a failure
   to recruit top-down prefrontal regions involved in emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Insight has been mostly studied from a clinical perspective. Recently,
   attention moved to cognitive insight or the ability to monitor and
   correct one's erroneous convictions. Here, we investigated the
   neuroanatomical correlates of cognitive insight. We administered the
   Beck cognitive insight scale to 45 outpatients with a schizophrenia
   diagnosis and 45 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects who
   underwent a MRI investigation, including high-resolution volumetric and
   diffusion tensor imaging sequences. Gray and white matter volume, mean
   diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were used as dependent variables
   and were analyzed on a voxel-by-voxel basis with reference to the
   cognitive insight indexes. Self-reflectiveness was positively related to
   gray matter volume of the right ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex
   (VLPFC). No statistically significant results emerged from the DTI
   analyses, and no significant relationships were found for self-certainty
   and global cognitive insight. Reduced self-reflectiveness is related to
   a reduced volume of the VLPFC, an area involved in generating and
   maintaining in working memory different hypotheses about the self. This
   line of research focusing on the metacognitive features of insight in
   schizophrenia can provide relevant information to identify patients who
   are most vulnerable to lack of insight and develop effective cognitive
   therapeutic strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Rejections of unfair offers in the ultimatum game (UG) are commonly
   assumed to reflect negative emotional arousal mediated by the anterior
   insula and medial prefrontal cortex. We aimed to disentangle those
   neural mechanisms associated with direct personal involvement ('I have
   been treated unfairly') from those associated with fairness
   considerations, such as the wish to discourage unfair behavior or social
   norm violations ('this person has been treated unfairly'). For this
   purpose, we used fMRI and asked participants to play the UG as
   responders either for themselves (myself) or on behalf of another person
   (third party). Unfair offers were equally often rejected in both
   conditions. Neuroimaging data revealed a dissociation between the medial
   prefrontal cortex, specifically associated with rejections in the myself
   condition, thus confirming its role in self-related emotional responses,
   and the left anterior insula, associated with rejections in both myself
   and third-party conditions, suggesting a role in promoting fair behavior
   also toward third parties. Our data extend the current understanding of
   the neural substrate of social decision making, by disentangling the
   structures sensitive to direct emotional involvement of the self from
   those implicated in pure fairness considerations.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to infer other people's mental states such as desires,
   emotions, intentions and beliefs is essential for successful social
   interactions, and it is usually referred to as theory of mind (ToM). In
   particular, the ability to detect and understand that people have
   beliefs about reality that may be false is considered an important
   hallmark of ToM. This experiment reports on the results of 18
   participants who viewed photographic sequences of an actress performing
   actions as a consequence of true and false beliefs. Consistent with
   prior work, results from the passive viewing of stimuli depicting true
   belief indicated an increased response over frontal, central and
   parietal regions when compared with the amplitude for the false belief
   condition. These results show that (i) frontal activity is required for
   processing false belief tasks and (ii) parietal effects reported in
   previous studies to reflect specific cognitive process of monitoring
   others' beliefs can be elicited in the absence of an explicit
   instruction for mentalizing.}},

Abstract = {{Perception and evaluation of facial expressions are known to be heavily
   modulated by emotional features of contextual information. Such
   contextual effects, however, might also be driven by non-emotional
   aspects of contextual information, an interaction of emotional and
   non-emotional factors, and by the observers' inherent traits. Therefore,
   we sought to assess whether contextual information about self-reference
   in addition to information about valence influences the evaluation and
   neural processing of neutral faces. Furthermore, we investigated whether
   social anxiety moderates these effects. In the present functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, participants viewed neutral
   facial expressions preceded by a contextual sentence conveying either
   positive or negative evaluations about the participant or about somebody
   else. Contextual influences were reflected in rating and fMRI measures,
   with strong effects of self-reference on brain activity in the medial
   prefrontal cortex and right fusiform gyrus. Additionally, social anxiety
   strongly affected the response to faces conveying negative, self-related
   evaluations as revealed by the participants' rating patterns and brain
   activity in cortical midline structures and regions of interest in the
   left and right middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that face
   perception and processing are highly individual processes influenced by
   emotional and non-emotional aspects of contextual information and
   further modulated by individual personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Humans observe various peoples' social suffering throughout their lives,
   but it is unknown whether the same brain mechanisms respond to people we
   are close to and strangers' social suffering. To address this question,
   we had participant's complete functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) while observing a friend and stranger experience social
   exclusion. Observing a friend's exclusion activated affective pain
   regions associated with the direct (i.e. firsthand) experience of
   exclusion {[}dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula], and
   this activation correlated with self-reported self-other overlap with
   the friend. Alternatively, observing a stranger's exclusion activated
   regions associated with thinking about the traits, mental states and
   intentions of others {[}'mentalizing'; dorsal medial prefrontal cortex
   (DMPFC), precuneus, and temporal pole]. Comparing activation from
   observing friend's vs stranger's exclusion showed increased activation
   in brain regions associated with the firsthand experience of exclusion
   (dACC and anterior insula) and with thinking about the self {[}medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC)]. Finally, functional connectivity analyses
   demonstrated that MPFC and affective pain regions activated in concert
   during empathy for friends, but not strangers. These results suggest
   empathy for friends' social suffering relies on emotion sharing and
   self-processing mechanisms, whereas empathy for strangers' social
   suffering may rely more heavily on mentalizing systems.}},

Abstract = {{The power of an object to afford a suitable act has been shown to depend
   on its reachability. Nevertheless, most of our perception and action
   occur in a social context. Little research has directly explored whether
   the possibility for other people to act upon an object may affect our
   processing of its affording features. To tackle this issue, we
   magnetically stimulated the left primary motor cortex and recorded
   motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) while participants were presented with a
   handled object (i.e. a mug) close either to them or to a virtual
   individual such as an avatar. We found highest MEPs both when the mug
   was near enough to be actually reachable for the participants and also
   when it was out of reach for them, provided that it was ready to the
   avatar's hand. We propose that this effect is likely to be due to an
   interpersonal bodily space representation, which plays critical role in
   basic social interaction.}},

Abstract = {{We examined social cognition in a sample of healthy participants who had
   prior magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gray matter volume studies of the
   orbital frontal cortex (OFC) that was parcellated into three regions:
   gyrus rectus, middle orbital gyrus and lateral orbital gyrus. These
   subjects also completed a self-report measure of Machiavelli personality
   traits, along with psychometric tests of social comprehension and
   declarative episodic memory, all of which we used as proxy measures to
   examine various features of social cognition. The data pointed to
   distinct functional-anatomical relationships highlighted by strong
   correlations of left lateral orbital gyrus and Machiavellian scores and
   right middle orbital gyrus with social comprehension and declarative
   episodic memory. In addition, hierarchical regression analyses revealed
   statistical evidence of a double dissociation between Machiavellian
   scores and left lateral orbital gyrus on one hand, and social
   comprehension with right middle orbital gyrus, on the other hand. To our
   knowledge, these findings are the first to show evidence linking normal

Abstract = {{Self-conscious emotions such as embarrassment arise when one's actions
   fail to meet salient social expectations and are accompanied by marked
   physiological and behavioral activation. We investigated the neural
   correlates of self-conscious emotional reactivity in 27 patients with
   behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a neurodegenerative
   disease that disrupts self-conscious emotion and targets brain regions
   critical for emotional functioning early in the disease course, and in
   33 healthy older controls. Subjects participated in an embarrassing
   karaoke task in which they watched a video clip of themselves singing.
   They also watched a sad film clip; these data were used to control for
   non-self-conscious emotional reactivity in response to audiovisual
   stimuli. Using Freesurfer to quantify regional brain volumes from
   structural magnetic resonance imaging, right pregenual anterior
   cingulate cortex (pACC) gray matter volume was the only brain region
   that was a significant predictor of self-conscious emotion. Smaller pACC
   volume was associated with attenuated physiological and behavioral
   self-conscious emotional reactivity, and this relationship was not
   specific to diagnosis. We argue that these results reflect the
   significant role that right pACC plays in the visceromotor responding
   that accompanies self-conscious emotion and that neurodegeneration in
   this region may underlie the self-conscious emotional decline seen in
   bvFTD.}},

Abstract = {{Although creativity has been called the most important of all human
   resources, its neural basis is still unclear. In the current study, we
   used fMRI to measure neural activity in participants solving a
   visuospatial creativity problem that involves divergent thinking and has
   been considered a canonical right hemisphere task. As hypothesized, both
   the visual creativity task and the control task as compared to rest
   activated a variety of areas including the posterior parietal cortex
   bilaterally and motor regions, which are known to be involved in
   visuospatial rotation of objects. However, directly comparing the two
   tasks indicated that the creative task more strongly activated left
   hemisphere regions including the posterior parietal cortex, the premotor
   cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the medial PFC. These
   results demonstrate that even in a task that is specialized to the right
   hemisphere, robust parallel activity in the left hemisphere supports
   creative processing. Furthermore, the results support the notion that
   higher motor planning may be a general component of creative
   improvisation and that such goal-directed planning of novel solutions
   may be organized top-down by the left DLPFC and by working memory
   processing in the medial prefrontal cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by disorders of visuospatial
   function that can impact everyday functioning. Visuospatial difficulties
   are more prominent in those whose motor symptoms begin on the left body
   side (LPD) than the right body side (RPD) and have mainly been
   attributed to parietal dysfunction. The source of visuospatial
   dysfunction is unclear, as in addition to subcortical-cortical changes,
   there are irregularities of visual scanning and potentially of
   retinal-level vision in PD. To assess these potential contributors,
   performance on a visuospatial task-line bisection-was examined together
   with retinal structure (nerve fiber layer thickness, measured by optical
   coherence tomography {[}OCT]), retinal function (contrast sensitivity,
   measured by frequency-doubling technology {[}FDT]), and visual scanning
   patterns. Participants included 20 nondemented patients (10 LPD, 10 RPD)
   and 11 normal control (NC) adults. Relative to the other groups, LPD
   were expected to show rightward bias on horizontal line bisection,
   especially within the left visual hemispace, and downward bias on
   vertical bisection. LPD relative rightward bias was confirmed, though
   not mainly within the left hemispace and not correlated with retinal
   structure or function. Retinal thinning was seen in LPD relative to RPD.
   Qualitative visualization of eye movements suggested greater LPD
   exploration of the right than left side of the line during horizontal
   bisection, and some overall compression of scanning range in RPD (both
   orientations) and LPD (primarily vertical). Results indicated that
   rightward visuospatial bias in our LPD sample arose not from
   abnormalities at the retinal level but potentially from attentional
   biases, reflected in eye movement patterns.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{127}},

Pages = {{164-174}},

Abstract = {{Unilateral nigrostriatal dopamine depletion in animals induces
   contralateral sensorimotor deficits that are like symptoms associated
   with Parkinson's disease (PD). Unilateral nigrostriatal dopamine
   depletion also causes a contralateral deficit in disengagement behavior
   (e. g., ability to stop an ongoing activity to orient/attend to a new
   stimulus). This disengagement deficit has been shown to be resistant to
   treatments that rescued other motor and somatosensory deficits. Thus,
   disengagement behavior may involve unique sensorimotor information
   integration potentially important for attentional allocation and may
   rely strongly on a mechanism that includes extranigrostriatal circuitry.
   The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and its connections with the
   nigral dopamine system have been reported to modulate cognitive
   processes dependent substantially on attentional allocation. CeA
   dopamine function might be also important for disengagement behavior. In
   Experiment 1, rats received microinfusions of 6-hydroxydopamine
   unilaterally to induce dopamine terminal loss in the CeA and were tested
   for disengagement behavior in addition to several sensorimotor
   functions. These rats showed deficits in contralateral disengagement
   behavior and an asymmetry in adhesive dot removal from the paws, but not
   in forelimb use in a cylinder or amphetamine rotation. In Experiment 2,
   rats received D1 or D2 antagonists into the CeA unilaterally prior to
   behavioral tests. The D1 antagonist disrupted disengagement behavior
   without affecting the other sensorimotor tests examined. The D2
   antagonist had no effects on any of the behaviors tested. Our results
   suggest that CeA dopamine function is involved in modulation of
   disengagement behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is heterogeneous
   in regard to affected domains. Although patterns of cognitive
   performance that may predict later dementia are as yet undetermined,
   posterior-versus frontal-type assessments show promise for differential
   predictive value. The present study included 70 individuals: 42 with
   idiopathic PD without dementia and 28 age-and education-matched healthy
   control adults (HC). Participants completed assessments of cognition
   with emphasis on tests that are sensitive to frontal and posterior
   deficits. PD patients were classified into cognitive subgroups and the
   subgroups were compared on demographic and disease variables. Individual
   performance across neuropsychological tests was evaluated for the PD
   group. Patients with PD performed more poorly than HC on several
   measures of cognition, and they were classified into frontal (12),
   posterior (3), both (10) and neither subgroups (17), the latter two in
   reference to frontal-and posterior-type deficits. The neither subgroup
   was distinguished by less motor impairment than the both subgroup, but
   the four subgroups did not otherwise differ on demographic or disease
   variables. Across patients, the tests most sensitive to cognitive
   impairment included measures of attention and executive functioning
   (frontal-type tests). Examination of individual test performance for PD
   revealed substantial heterogeneity across tests with respect to number
   and severity of deficits. The current study provides insight into which
   commonly used neuropsychological tests are most sensitive to cognitive
   deficits (strictly defined) in a nondemented, well characterized PD
   sample, and into the relation of cognitive subgroups to demographic and
   disease-specific variables.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive impairment is a recognized feature of Parkinson's disease
   (PD), which, even if mild, can impact some aspects of a patient's
   ability to deal with everyday life. The current study examined the
   ability to solve social problems in three groups of participants: PD
   patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI); PD patients with no
   evidence of cognitive impairment (PD-N); and non-PD age-matched
   controls. All participants completed measures examining their ability to
   understand the actions and sarcastic remarks of others; provide a range
   of, and select, optimal solutions to social problems; and their
   self-perception of problem-solving abilities. Deficits emerged in the
   PD-MCI, but not the PD-N, group, suggesting that difficulties related to
   pathophysiological changes are associated with cognitive impairment and
   not PD per se. The findings are discussed with reference to the
   substrate of executive function and social cognition, and their
   implications for social interaction and everyday problem solving for
   people with PD.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately recognizing the emotional states of others is crucial for
   successful social interactions and social relationships. Individuals
   with Parkinson's disease (PD) have shown deficits in emotional
   recognition abilities although findings have been inconsistent. This
   study examined recognition of emotions from prosody and from facial
   emotional expressions with three levels of subtlety, in 30 individuals
   with PD (without dementia) and 30 control participants. The PD group
   were impaired on the prosody task, with no differential impairments in
   specific emotions. PD participants were also impaired at recognizing
   facial expressions of emotion, with a significant association between
   how well they could recognize emotions in the two modalities, even after
   controlling for disease severity. When recognizing facial expressions,
   the PD group had no difficulty identifying prototypical Ekman and
   Friesen (1976) emotional faces, but were poorer than controls at
   recognizing the moderate and difficult levels of subtle expressions.
   They were differentially impaired at recognizing moderately subtle
   expressions of disgust and sad expressions at the difficult level.
   Notably, however, they were impaired at recognizing happy expressions at
   both levels of subtlety. Furthermore how well PD participants identified
   happy expressions conveyed by either face or voice was strongly related
   to accuracy in the other modality. This suggests dysfunction of
   overlapping components of the circuitry processing happy expressions in
   PD. This study demonstrates the usefulness of including subtle
   expressions of emotion, likely to be encountered in everyday life, when
   assessing recognition of facial expressions.}},

Abstract = {{Sequence learning depends on the striatal system, but recent findings
   also implicate the mediotemporal lobe (MTL) system. Schendan, Searl,
   Melrose, and Stern (2003) found higher-order associative,
   learning-related activation in the striatum, dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex, and the MTL during the early acquisition phase of both implicit
   and explicit variants of a serial response time task. This functional
   MRI (fMRI) study capitalized on this task to determine how changes in
   MTL function observed in aging and compromised frontostriatal function
   characteristic of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) impacts
   sequence learning and memory under implicit instructions. Brain activity
   was compared between ``sequence{''} and ``random{''} conditions in 12
   nondemented patients with PD and education-and gender-matched healthy
   control participants of whom 12 were age matched (MC) and 14 were
   younger (YC). Behaviorally, sequence-specific learning of higher-order
   associations was reduced with aging and changed further with PD and
   resulted primarily in implicit knowledge in the older participants. fMRI
   revealed reduced intensity and extent of sequence learning-related
   activation in older relative to younger people in frontostriatal
   circuits and the MTL. This was because signal was greater for the
   sequence than random condition in younger people, whereas older people,
   especially those with PD, showed the opposite pattern. Both older groups
   also showed increased activation to the task itself relative to baseline
   fixation. In addition, right MTL showed hypoactivation and left MTL
   hyperactivation in PD relative to the MC group. The results suggest
   changes in frontostriatal and MTL activity occur during aging that
   affect task-related activity and the initial acquisition phase of
   implicit higher-order sequence learning. In addition, the results
   suggest that Parkinson's disease adversely affects processes in the MTL
   including sequence learning and memory.}},

Abstract = {{The basal ganglia and the cerebellum are anatomically and functionally
   linked to the cerebral cortex through a series of well-established
   circuits. The disruption of dopaminergic projections in Parkinson's
   disease (PD) leads to an imbalance within these circuits, leading to
   motor and cognitive symptoms. The cortico-cerebellar (CC) network has
   often been viewed as a compensatory network, helping the dysfunction of
   the cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuits in PD. However, evidence for
   this compensatory role is scarce; most changes in cerebellar activity
   could equally be attributed to pathophysiological changes underlying PD.
   This paper will review the anatomy, interaction and function of the CBG
   and CC circuits, the pathophysiological, metabolic, and functional
   changes observed in PD, as well as the effect of levodopa and deep brain
   stimulation on these changes. We will use this framework to discuss the
   pathophysiological and compensatory mechanisms behind CBG and CC circuit
   activity in PD.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to evaluate the association of different apathy
   conceptual domains with central fatigue perception in Parkinson's
   disease (PD), taking into consideration other nonmotor symptoms. To this
   end, 90 consecutive PD patients (66.7\% men, mean age 61.44 +/- 13.2
   years) underwent a comprehensive neurological and psychiatric
   examination, including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV,
   Parkinson Fatigue Scale, Lille Apathy Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression
   Scale, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A linear regression model was
   applied to analyze the relationship between apathy and its different
   conceptual domains with fatigue severity. Thirty-seven (41.1\%) patients
   presented fatigue. Its presence was associated with higher apathy total
   scores and with 2 of the 4 apathy conceptual domains (less intellectual
   curiosity and action initiation) with no associations in the emotion and
   self-awareness apathy domains. Patients with fatigue scored higher in
   depression (p < .001), anxiety trait (p < .001), and anxiety state (p =
   .006). Regression analysis identified that Lille Apathy Rating Scale
   total score (p = .008), intellectual curiosity and action initiation
   apathy subscores (p = .001 and p = .003) were associated with fatigue
   severity in patients with right predominant motor symptoms. Sex, age,
   disease duration, clinical stage, motor complications, prior psychiatric
   disorders, and treatment were not significantly associated with presence
   of fatigue. The findings suggest that some apathy-related domains are
   more frequent in fatigued PD and may be related with fatigue severity.}},

Abstract = {{A subset of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develops behavioral
   addictions, which may be due to their dopamine replacement therapy.
   Recently, several groups have been comparing PD patients with and
   without behavioral addictions on tasks that are thought to measure
   aspects of impulsivity. Several of these experiments, including
   information sampling, a bias toward novel stimuli and temporal
   discounting, have shown differences between PD patients with and without
   behavioral addictions. We have developed a unifying theoretical
   framework that allows us to model behavior in all three of these tasks.
   By exploring the performance of the patient groups on the three tasks
   with a single framework, we can ask questions about common mechanisms
   that underlie all three. Our results suggest that the effects seen in
   all three tasks can be accounted for by uncertainty about the ability to
   map future actions into rewards. More specifically, the modeling is
   consistent with the hypothesis that the group with behavioral addictions
   behaves as if they cannot use information provided within the
   experimental context to improve future reward guided actions. Future
   studies will be necessary to more firmly establish (or refute) this
   hypothesis. We discuss this result in light of what is known about the
   pathology that underlies the behavioral addictions in the PD patients.}},

Volume = {{127}},

Abstract = {{The use of high-intensity sweeteners has been proposed as a method to
   combat increasing rates of overweight and obesity in the human
   population. However, previous work with male rats suggests that
   consumption of such sweeteners might contribute to, rather than
   ameliorate, weight gain. The goals of the present experiments were to
   assess whether intake of high-intensity sweeteners is associated with
   increased food intake and body weight gain in female rats; to evaluate
   whether this effect depends on composition of the maintenance diet
   (i.e., standard chow compared with diets high in energy, fat, and sugar
   {[}HE diets]); and to determine whether the phenotype of the rats with
   regard to propensity to gain weight on HE diets affects the consequences
   of consuming high-intensity sweeteners. The data demonstrated that
   female rats fed a low-fat, standard laboratory chow diet did not gain
   extra weight when fed yogurt dietary supplements sweetened with
   saccharin compared with those fed glucose-sweetened dietary supplements.
   However, female rats maintained on a ``Westernized{''} diet high in fat
   and sugar (HE diet) showed significant increases in energy intake,
   weight gain, and adiposity when given saccharin-sweetened compared with
   glucose-sweetened yogurt supplements. These differences were most
   pronounced in female rats known to be prone to obesity prior to the
   introduction of the yogurt diets. Both selectively bred Crl:OP{[}CD]
   rats and outbred Sprague-Dawley rats fed an HE diet showing high levels
   of weight gain (diet-induced obese {[}DIO] rats) had increased weight
   gain in response to consuming saccharin-sweetened compared with
   glucose-sweetened supplements. However, in male rats fed an HE diet,
   saccharin-sweetened supplements produced extra weight gain regardless of
   obesity phenotype. These results suggest that the most negative
   consequences of consuming high-intensity sweeteners may occur in those
   most likely to use them for weight control, females consuming a
   ``Westernized{''} diet and already prone to excess weight gain.}},

Volume = {{127}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that bilateral lesions of the
   gustatory (medial) zone of the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in the pons
   eliminate the salt (sodium chloride; NaCl) appetite induced in rats by
   treatment with the diuretic drug, furosemide. The present studies
   reexamined NaCl intake of rats with PBN lesions induced by ibotenic
   acid, using multiple models of salt appetite. The impairment of a
   conditioned taste aversion, an established consequence of PBN damage,
   was used as an initial screen with which to assess the effectiveness of
   the lesions. Rats with PBN lesions did not drink either 0.3 of a molar
   (M) solution of NaCl or 0.5 M NaCl in response to daily treatment with
   desoxycorticosterone acetate. These findings suggest that the excitatory
   stimulus of salt appetite mediated by mineralocorticoids is abolished by
   PBN lesions. In contrast, rats with PBN lesions drank some 0.5 M NaCl
   and more 0.3 M NaCl, in addition to water, in response to hypovolemia
   induced by subcutaneous injection of 30\% polyethylene glycol solution.
   Those findings suggest that an excitatory stimulus of salt appetite,
   presumably mediated by Angiotensin II, is not abolished by PBN lesions.
   These and other observations indicate that lesions of the gustatory PBN
   in rats may or may not eliminate salt appetite, depending on which model
   is used and which concentration of NaCl solution is available.}},

Abstract = {{Many behavioral studies have suggested that learning induces neocortical
   synaptic modifications. However, neocortical synaptic modifications
   following forebrain-dependent trace associative learning has not been
   closely examined. Acquisition of whisker-trace-eyeblink (WTEB)
   conditioning, a forebrain-dependent trace associative task, has been
   reported to modulate the expression of cytochrome oxidase, a marker for
   metabolic activity, in the conditioned barrels, suggesting that trace
   associative conditioning induces neocortical synaptic plasticity.
   However, neocortical synaptic plasticity has never been directly
   examined following this trace associative task. To assess neocortical
   synaptic modifications, the present study examined synapsin I expression
   following WTEB conditioning. Synapsin I is part of a phosphoprotein
   family involved in neuronal regulation of neurotransmitter release that
   also exhibits an expression pattern closely correlating to synapse
   number. Findings from this study demonstrated that synapsin I expression
   is elevated in primary somatosensory neocortex in
   trace-paired-conditioned mice compared with unpaired-conditioned
   (stimulation-control) mice and naive mice, suggesting that WTEB
   conditioning induces synaptic proliferation. Additional findings from
   the present study examining cytochrome oxidase expression replicated
   previous findings demonstrating that WTEB conditioning induces a
   learning-specific expansion of the cytochrome oxidase staining
   expression for conditioned barrels. Together, these results suggest that
   synaptic proliferation is contributing to the learning-induced metabolic
   augmentation previously observed in conditioned barrels following WTEB
   conditioning. Furthermore, these results suggest that trace associative
   learning facilitates neocortical synaptic modification.}},

Abstract = {{Drugs of abuse exert their effects by exploiting natural neurobiological
   reward mechanisms, especially the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system.
   However, the mesolimbic system does not operate in isolation, and input
   from other reward-relevant structures may play a role in cocaine's
   rewarding effects. The medial preoptic area (mPOA) of the hypothalamus
   is involved in the regulation of two essential and naturally rewarding
   behaviors: sexual and maternal behaviors. It also makes strong
   neuroanatomical connections with areas of the mesolimbic system,
   particularly the ventral tegmental area (VTA). As such, the mPOA is a
   logical candidate for a neuroanatomical locus modulating activity in the
   mesolimbic system and emergent behavioral expressions of drug reward,
   yet the role of this structure is largely unexplored. Here, using a
   female rat model, we show that the mPOA innervates the VTA in a
   region-specific manner, that lesions of the mPOA augment cocaine-induced
   Fos expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and cocaine-induced
   conditioned place preference. We also show that approximately 68\% of
   mPOA-VTA efferents release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), over 75\% are
   sensitive to DA as evidenced by colocalization with DA receptors, and
   nearly 60\% of these contain both DA receptors and GABA, which suggests
   a novel key role for the mPOA in the inhibition of the mesolimbic DA
   circuit. Combined, these results reveal the mPOA as a critical
   modulating structure in cocaine-induced mesolimbic activity and
   behavioral manifestation of reward, at least in part, via GABAergic
   output that is sensitive to DA input.}},

Abstract = {{Nicotine is a widely used addictive drug, with an estimated 73 million
   Americans 12 years of age or older having used a tobacco product in the
   last month, despite documented risks to personal health. Nicotine alters
   cognitive processes, which include effects on attention and impulsivity,
   a mechanism that may contribute to the addictive properties of the drug.
   Individuals with a variety of psychological disorders ranging from
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to schizophrenia smoke
   at a higher rate than the rest of the population and show deficits in
   impulse control. The present studies evaluated the effects of acute,
   chronic, and withdrawal from chronic nicotine on an operant task that
   measured premature and signaled nose pokes, as well as performance
   efficiency in C57BL/6J mice. Results indicate that acute nicotine (0.09
   mg/kg intraperitoneally) does not alter the acquisition of the task, but
   does significantly increase performance efficiency once the behavior has
   been learned. In contrast, chronic nicotine (0, 6.3, 12.6, and 36
   mg/kg/day subcutaneously) and withdrawal from chronic nicotine had no
   effect on performance efficiency. These results suggest that initial
   nicotine use may have beneficial effects on inhibitory control, but
   these effects are not maintained with chronic nicotine consumption as
   tolerance develops. The findings may provide an explanation for higher
   rates of smoking in patients with impulse control issues, as the smoking
   may represent an initial attempt at self-medication.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has suggested that the Wistar-Kyoto Hyperactive (WKHA)
   rat strain may model some of the behavioral features associated with
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We have shown that, in
   cerebellar-dependent eyeblink conditioning, male WKHAs emit eyeblink CRs
   with shortened onset latencies. To further characterize the shortened CR
   onset latencies seen in male WKHA rats, we examined 750-ms delay
   conditioning with either a tone conditional stimulus (CS) or a light CS,
   we extended acquisition training, and we included Wistar rats as an
   additional, outbred control strain. Our results indicated that WKHAs
   learned more quickly and showed a shortened CR onset latency to a tone
   CS compared to both Wistar-Kyoto Hypertensive (WKHT) and Wistars. WKHAs
   and Wistars show a lengthening of CR onset latency over conditioning
   with a tone CS and an increasing confinement of CRs to the later part of
   the tone CS (inhibition of delay). WKHAs learned more quickly to a light
   CS only in comparison to WKHTs, and showed a shortened CR onset latency
   only in comparison to Wistars. Wistars showed an increasing confinement
   of CRs to the late part of the light CS over conditioning. We used
   unbiased stereology to estimate the number of Purkinje and granule cells
   in the cerebellar cortex of the three strains. Our results indicated
   that WKHAs have more granule cells than Wistars and WKHTs and more
   Purkinje cells than Wistars. Results are discussed in terms of CS
   processing and cerebellar cortical contributions to EBC.}},

Abstract = {{Peripheral and spinal hyperpolarization-activated cyclic
   nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels play important roles in
   neuropathic pain by regulating neuronal excitability. However, the

   investigate the role of vlPAG HCN channels in neuropathic pain, the
   authors developed a chronic constriction injury (CCI) model. By using
   western blot analysis, they detected the upregulation of HCN1 and HCN2
   channel expression at vlPAG 14 days post-CCI surgery. Subsequently, the
   function of these upregulated channels was verified by the intravlPAG
   infusion of ZD7288, a specific HCN blocker, which significantly relieved
   mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in CCI animals. These
   results suggest that the upregulation of vlPAG HCN channels plays an
   important role in pain maintenance and might be a target for attenuating
   pain.}},

Abstract = {{Dimensions of psychopathy are theorized to be associated with distinct
   cognitive and emotional abnormalities that may represent unique
   neurobiological risk factors for the disorder. This hypothesis was
   investigated by examining whether the psychopathic personality
   dimensions of fearless-dominance and impulsive-antisociality moderated
   neural activity and behavioral responses associated with selective
   attention and emotional processing during an emotion-word Stroop task in
   49 adults. As predicted, the dimensions evidenced divergent
   selective-attention deficits and sensitivity to emotional distraction.
   Fearless-dominance was associated with disrupted attentional control to
   positive words, and activation in right superior frontal gyrus mediated
   the relationship between fearless-dominance and errors to positive
   words. In contrast, impulsive-antisociality evidenced increased
   behavioral interference to both positive and negative words and
   correlated positively with recruitment of regions associated with
   motivational salience (amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula), emotion
   regulation (temporal cortex, superior frontal gyrus) and attentional
   control (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Individuals high on both
   dimensions had increased recruitment of regions related to attentional
   control (temporal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex), response
   preparation (pre-/post-central gyri) and motivational value
   (orbitofrontal cortex) in response to negative words. These findings
   provide evidence that the psychopathy dimensions represent dual sets of
   risk factors characterized by divergent dysfunction in cognitive and
   affective processes.}},

Abstract = {{A functional polymorphism within the serotonin transporter gene
   (5-HTTLPR) has been reported to modulate emotionality and risk for
   affective disorders. The short (S) allele has less functional efficacy
   than the long (L) allele and has been associated with enhanced emotional
   reactivity. One possible contributing factor to the high emotionality in
   S carriers may be inefficient use of cognitive strategies such as
   reappraisal to regulate emotional responses. The aim of the present
   study was to test whether the 5-HTTLPR genotype modulates the neural
   correlates of emotion regulation. To determine neural differences
   between S and L allele carriers during reappraisal of negative emotions,
   15 homozygous S (S'/S') and 15 homozygous L (L'/L') carriers underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while performing an
   instructed emotion regulation task including downregulation,
   upregulation and passive viewing of negative emotional pictures.
   Compared to L'/L' allele carriers, subjects who carry the S'/S' allele
   responded with lower posterior insula and prefrontal brain activation
   during passive perception of negative emotional information but showed
   greater prefrontal activation and anterior insula activation during
   down- and upregulation of negative emotional responses. The current
   results support and extend previous findings of enhanced emotionality in
   S carriers by providing additional evidence of 5-HTTLPR modulation of
   volitional emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Studies in psychiatry and cognitive neuroscience have reported an
   important relationship between individual interoceptive accuracy and
   anxiety level. This indicates that greater attention to one's bodily
   state may contribute to the development of intense negative emotions and
   anxiety disorders. We hypothesized that reactivity in the anterior
   insular cortex underlies the intensity of interoceptive awareness and
   anxiety. To elucidate this triadic mechanism, we conducted functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and mediation analyses to examine the
   relationship between emotional disposition and activation in the
   anterior insular cortex while participants evaluated their own emotional
   and bodily states. Our results indicated that right anterior insular
   activation was positively correlated with individual levels of social
   anxiety and neuroticism and negatively correlated with agreeableness and
   extraversion. The results of the mediation analyses revealed that
   activity in the right anterior insula mediated the activity of neural
   correlates of interoceptive sensibility and social fear. Our findings
   suggest that attention to interoceptive sensation affects personality
   traits through how we feel emotion subjectively in various situations.}},

Abstract = {{Aversive social learning experiences might play a significant role in
   the aetiology of social anxiety disorder. Therefore, we investigated
   emotional learning and unlearning processes in healthy humans using a
   social conditioning paradigm. Forty-nine healthy subjects participated
   in a 2-day fMRI differential conditioning protocol. Acquisition and
   extinction were conducted on Day 1 and extinction recall on Day 2. BOLD
   responses, ratings and skin conductance responses were collected. Our
   data indicate successful conditioning and extinction on the neural and
   subjective level. As a main result, we observed a positive correlation
   of social anxiety and conditioning responses on the subjective level
   (valence and fear) as well as on the neural level with significant
   CS+/CS- differentiation in the left amygdala and the left hippocampus.
   Further, significant CS+/CS- differentiation in the left amygdala was
   found during extinction and was associated with lower scores in social
   anxiety. During extinction recall, we found a tendentially negative
   correlation of social anxiety and CS+/CS- differentiation in the vmPFC.
   In sum, we were able to show that social anxiety is related to
   conditionability with socially threatening stimuli. This could point to
   an important aspect in the aetiology of social anxiety disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Social expectations play a critical role in everyday decision-making.
   However, their precise neuro-computational role in the decision process
   remains unknown. Here we adopt a decision neuroscience framework by
   combining methods and theories from psychology, economics and
   neuroscience to outline a novel, expectation-based, computational model
   of social preferences. Results demonstrate that this model outperforms
   the standard inequity-aversion model in explaining decision behavior in
   a social interactive bargaining task. This is supported by fMRI findings
   showing that the tracking of social expectation violations is processed
   by anterior cingulate cortex, extending previous computational
   conceptualizations of this region to the social domain. This study
   demonstrates the usefulness of this interdisciplinary approach in better
   characterizing the psychological processes that underlie social
   interactive decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroscience research on the social evaluation of faces has accumulated
   over the last decade, yielding divergent results. We used a
   meta-analytic technique, multi-level kernel density analysis (MKDA), to
   analyze 29 neuroimaging studies on face evaluation. Across negative face
   evaluations, we observed the most consistent activations in bilateral
   amygdala. Across positive face evaluations, we observed the most
   consistent activations in medial prefrontal cortex, pregenual anterior
   cingulate cortex (pgACC), medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), left
   caudate and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Based on additional analyses
   comparing linear and non-linear responses, we propose a ventral/dorsal
   dissociation within the amygdala, wherein separate populations of
   neurons code for face valence and intensity, respectively. Finally, we
   argue that some of the differences between studies are attributable to
   differences in the typicality of face stimuli. Specifically, extremely
   attractive faces are more likely to elicit responses in NAcc/caudate and
   mOFC.}},

Abstract = {{There has been debate over whether disruptions in the mirror neuron
   system (MNS) play a key role in the core social deficits observed in
   autism spectrum disorders (ASD). EEG mu suppression during the
   observation of biological actions is believed to reflect MNS
   functioning, but understanding of the developmental progression of the
   MNS and EEG mu rhythm in both typical and atypical development is
   lacking. To provide a more thorough and direct exploration of the
   development of mu suppression in individuals with ASD, a sample of 66
   individuals with ASD and 51 typically developing individuals of 6-17
   years old were pooled from four previously published studies employing
   similar EEG methodology. We found a significant correlation between age
   and mu suppression in response to the observation of actions, both for
   individuals with ASD and typical individuals. This relationship was not
   seen during the execution of actions. Additionally, the strength of the
   correlation during the observation of actions did not significantly
   differ between groups. The results provide evidence against the argument
   that mirror neuron dysfunction improves with age in individuals with ASD
   and suggest, instead, that a diagnosis-independent developmental change
   may be at the root of the correlation of age and mu suppression.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the distracting effects of emotional stimuli on concurrent task
   performance, humans are able to uphold goal-directed behavior. Here, we
   investigated the hypothesis that this effect is due to the enhanced
   recruitment of task-specific neural resources. In a two-step functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study, we first localized those areas
   involved in mental arithmetics by contrasting arithmetic problems with a
   number detection task. The resulting activation maps were then used as
   masks in a second experiment that compared the effects of neutral and
   emotional distracter images on mental arithmetics. We found increased
   response times in the emotional distracter condition, accompanied by
   enhanced activation in task-specific areas, including superior parietal
   cortex, dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. This activation
   increase correlated with larger behavioral impairment through emotional
   distraction. Similar error rates in both conditions indicate that
   cognitive task performance is preserved through enhanced recruitment of
   task-specific neural resources when emotional distracter stimuli are
   present.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the dominant role of the hormone oxytocin (OT) in social
   behavior, little is known about the role of OT in the perception of
   social relationships. Furthermore, it is unclear whether there are sex
   differences in the way that OT affects social perception. Here, we
   employed a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design to
   investigate the effect of OT on accurate social perception. Following
   treatment, 62 participants completed the Interpersonal Perception Task,
   a method of assessing the accuracy of social judgments that requires
   identification of the relationship between people interacting in real
   life video clips divided into three categories: kinship, intimacy and
   competition. The findings suggest that OT had a general effect on
   improving accurate perception of social interactions. Furthermore, we
   show that OT also involves sex-specific characteristics. An interaction
   between treatment, task category and sex indicated that OT had a
   selective effect on improving kinship recognition in women, but not in
   men, whereas men's performance was improved following OT only for
   competition recognition. It is concluded that the gender-specific
   findings reported here may point to some biosocial differences in the
   effect of OT which may be expressed in women's tendency for communal and
   familial social behavior as opposed to men's tendency for competitive
   social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Fear learning is a crucial process in the pathogeneses of psychiatric
   disorders, which highlights the need to identify specific factors
   contributing to interindividual variation. We hypothesized variation in
   the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and stressful life events
   (SLEs) to be associated with neural correlates of fear conditioning in a
   sample of healthy male adults (n = 47). Subjects were exposed to a
   differential fear conditioning paradigm after being preselected
   regarding 5-HTTLPR genotype and SLEs. Individual differences in brain
   activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   skin conductance responses and preference ratings were assessed. We
   report significant variation in neural correlates of fear conditioning
   as a function of 5-HTTLPR genotype. Specifically, the conditioned
   stimulus (CS+) elicited elevated activity within the fear-network
   (amygdala, insula, thalamus, occipital cortex) in subjects carrying two
   copies of the 5-HTTLPR S' allele. Moreover, our results revealed
   preliminary evidence for a significant gene-by-environment interaction,
   such as homozygous carriers of the 5-HTTLPR S' allele with a history of
   SLEs demonstrated elevated reactivity to the CS+ in the occipital cortex
   and the insula. Our findings contribute to the current debate on
   5-HTTLPR x SLEs interaction by investigating crucial alterations on an
   intermediate phenotype level which may convey an elevated vulnerability
   for the development of psychopathology.}},

   activity at 220-340 ms (the anterior N2) differentiated between one's
   own and friend's faces in both cultural groups. Most remarkably, for
   British participants, priming an interdependent self-construal reduced
   the default anterior N2 to their own faces. For Chinese participants,
   however, priming an independent self-construal suppressed the default
   anterior N2 to their friend's faces. These findings indicate fast

Abstract = {{A great deal of evidence suggests that reminders of mortality increase
   ingroup support and worldview defense, presumably in order to deal with
   the potential for anxiety that roots in the knowledge that death is
   inevitable. Interestingly, these effects are obtained solely when
   thoughts of death are not in the focus of consciousness. When conscious,
   death-related thoughts are usually defended against using proximal
   defenses, which entail distraction or suppression. The present study
   aimed at demonstrating neurophysiological correlates of proximal
   defenses. We focused on the late positive potential (LPP), which is
   thought to reflect an increased allocation of attention toward, and
   processing of, motivationally relevant stimuli. Our prediction was that
   the LPP should be increased for death-related relative to
   death-unrelated, but equally unpleasant stimulus words. In Experiment 1,
   this prediction was confirmed. This finding was replicated in Experiment
   2, which used a target word detection task. In Experiment 2, both
   death-related and pleasant words elicited an enhanced LPP, presumably
   because during the less demanding task, people might have distracted
   themselves from the mortality reminders by focusing on pleasant words.
   To summarize, we were able to identify a plausible neurophysiological
   marker of proximal defenses in the form of an increased LPP to
   death-related words.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation strategies can alter behavioral and physiological
   responses to emotional stimuli and the neural correlates of those
   responses in regions such as the amygdala or striatum. The current study
   investigates the brain systems engaged when using an emotion regulation
   technique during financial decisions. In decision making, regulating
   emotion with reappraisal-focused strategies that encourage taking a
   different perspective has been shown to reduce loss aversion as observed
   both in choices and in the relative arousal responses to actual loss and
   gain outcomes. In the current study, we find using fMRI that behavioral
   loss aversion correlates with amygdala activity in response to losses
   relative to gains. Success in regulating loss aversion also correlates
   with the reduction in amygdala responses to losses but not to gains.
   Furthermore, across both decisions and outcomes, we find the reappraisal
   strategy increases baseline activity in dorsolateral and ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and the striatum. The similarity of the neural
   circuitry observed to that seen in emotion regulation, despite divergent
   tasks, serves as further evidence for a role of emotion in decision
   making, and for the power of reappraisal to change assessments of value
   and thereby choices.}},

Abstract = {{Following the two-stage model of disgust, `core disgust' (e.g. elicited
   by rotten food) is extended to stimuli that remind us of our animal
   nature `AR disgust' (e.g. mutilations, animalistic instincts). There is
   ample evidence that core and AR represent distinct domains of disgust
   elicitors. Moreover, people show large differences in their tendency to
   respond with disgust to potential disgust elicitors (propensity), as
   well as in their appraisal of experiencing disgust (sensitivity). Thus
   these traits may be important moderators of people's response patterns.
   Here, we aimed to find brain mechanisms associated with these distinct
   disgust domains and traits, as well as the interaction between them. The
   right ventrolateral occipitotemporal cortex, which preferentially
   responded to visual AR, was functionally coupled to the middle cingulate
   cortex (MCC), thalamus and prefrontal cortex (medial, dorsolateral), as
   a function of disgust domain. Coupling with the anterior part of MCC was
   modulated by disgust `propensity', which was strongest during AR.
   Coupling with anterior insula and ventral premotor cortex was weaker,
   but relied fully on this domain-trait interaction. Disgust `sensitivity'
   modulated left anterior insula activity irrespective of domain, and did
   not affect functional connectivity. Thus a frontal-posterior network
   that interacts with disgust `propensity' dissects AR and core disgust.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion processing difficulties are observed in antisocial individuals
   exhibiting serious antisocial behavior. This study examined emotion
   processing in 40 male juvenile offenders (JOs) and 52 male controls by
   measuring startle reflex responses to aversive sounds during the passive
   viewing of affective and neutral images. JOs as a group exhibited
   reduced startle-elicited blinks across all slide categories compared to
   normal controls. Moreover, within the offender group those with more
   conduct disorder symptoms and higher levels of psychopathic traits
   displayed reduced startle amplitudes compared to lower-scoring
   offenders. The finding that startle magnitudes were inversely related to
   severity of conduct problems supports a dimensional or continuous
   approach to understanding externalizing disorders. Reductions in
   amygdala activity could lead to blunted startle magnitudes. The current
   findings not only provide further evidence that antisocial children have
   a general defensive motivational system dysfunction and present with
   impairments in neural systems that subserve emotion processing, but also
   show for the first time that those with more severe conduct problems
   have reduced startle responses compared to those who are less severely
   affected. The implications of these findings for interventions with JOs
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that psychopathy may be associated with
   dysfunction in the neural circuitry supporting both threat- and
   reward-related processes. However, these studies have involved small
   samples and often focused on extreme groups. Thus, it is unclear to what
   extent current findings may generalize to psychopathic traits in the
   general population. Furthermore, no studies have systematically and
   simultaneously assessed associations between distinct psychopathy facets
   and both threat- and reward-related brain function in the same sample of
   participants. Here, we examined the relationship between threat-related
   amygdala reactivity and reward-related ventral striatum (VS) reactivity
   and variation in four facets of self-reported psychopathy in a sample of
   200 young adults. Path models indicated that amygdala reactivity to
   fearful facial expressions is negatively associated with the
   interpersonal facet of psychopathy, whereas amygdala reactivity to angry
   facial expressions is positively associated with the lifestyle facet.
   Furthermore, these models revealed that differential VS reactivity to
   positive versus negative feedback is negatively associated with the
   lifestyle facet. There was suggestive evidence for gender-specific
   patterns of association between brain function and psychopathy facets.
   Our findings are the first to document differential associations between
   both threat- and reward-related neural processes and distinct facets of
   psychopathy and thus provide a more comprehensive picture of the pattern
   of neural vulnerabilities that may predispose to maladaptive outcomes
   associated with psychopathy.}},

Abstract = {{Recent approaches suggest that emotional reactivity can be used to
   differentiate between subgroups of individuals who are at risk for
   showing elevated levels of aggression and violence. In this study, we
   examined how emotion governs decision making within two subgroups of
   antisocial criminal offenders with either emotional hypo- or
   hyper-reactivity compared with healthy, noncriminal controls. Offenders
   were recruited from high-security forensic treatment facilities and
   penal institutions and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging
   during a financial decision-making task. In this task, participants were
   required to choose between low-risk (bonds) and high-risk alternatives
   (stocks). Bonds were always the safe choice; stocks could win or lose,
   with a varying degree of uncertainty. We found that emotionally
   hypo-reactive offenders differed most from healthy controls by showing
   diminished neural activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in
   response to uncertainty as well as decreased activity in the prefrontal
   cortex when trying to regulate their behavior accordingly (i.e., when
   consistently choosing safe alternatives). Hence, the data indicate that
   emotionally hypo-reactive offenders (with psychopathic traits)
   constitute a special subgroup within antisocial offenders characterized

   manner to 36 healthy men using a between-subjects design. After drug
   administration, participants performed a competitive reaction time task
   (Taylor Aggression Paradigm, TAP) to elicit reactive aggressive behavior
   while functional magnetic resonance imaging was recorded. Under AVP
   treatment, we found increased activations in the right superior temporal
   sulcus in the decision phase during trials in which participants could
   get punished after losing the reaction time competition. At the
   behavioral level, no differences could be found between AVP treatment
   and placebo condition. The lack of AVP-related behavioral effects is
   discussed in terms of the general aggression model (GAM).}},

Abstract = {{Research with violent offenders and delinquent adolescents suggests that
   endogenous testosterone concentrations have the strongest positive
   correlations with violence among men who have low concentrations of
   cortisol. The present study tested the hypothesis that testosterone and
   cortisol would similarly interact to determine neural activation in
   regions supporting self-regulation in response to anger provocation.
   Nineteen healthy Asian male participants were insulted and asked to
   control their anger during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   When cortisol levels were low, testosterone positively correlated with
   activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and thalamus,
   but not when cortisol levels were high. During induced anger control,
   functional connectivity was increased between the amygdala and a
   top-down prefrontal cortical control network. Moreover, the amygdala-PFC
   connectivity was strongest among those high in testosterone and low in
   cortisol. This research highlights a possible neural mechanism by which
   testosterone and cortisol may influence anger control.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive behavior is aimed at causing damage or pain to another
   individual. Aggression has been associated with structural and
   functional deficits in numerous brain areas, including the dorsolateral
   region of the prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), typically related to inhibition
   and impulse control. In this study, we used inhibitory continuous
   theta-burst magnetic stimulation (cTBS) to explore the role of the right
   and left DLPFC in aggression. Sixteen healthy right-handed volunteers
   underwent two sessions involving random, real and sham, right and left
   DLPFC stimulations. These sessions were followed by the Social
   Orientation Paradigm (SOP), a monetary task that was specially designed
   to assess participants' aggressive tendencies by measuring the patterns
   of their reactive aggression (a response to a perceived provocation) and
   proactive aggression (an aggressive act with goal-oriented purposes).
   Results indicate that using cTBS to target the left DLPFC was associated
   with a greater increase in aggressive responses than right DLPFC
   stimulation. This pattern of results was found for both reactive and
   proactive types of aggressive reactions. It is concluded that DLPFC
   asymmetry is involved in modulating reactive and proactive aggression.
   Our results are in line with recent studies suggesting that the left
   DLPFC plays a major role in aggressive behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on culture-related differences in cognition have shown that
   Westerners attend more to object-related information, whereas East
   Asians attend more to contextual information. Neural correlates of these
   different culture-related visual processing styles have been reported in
   the ventral-visual and fronto-parietal regions. We conducted an fMRI
   study of East Asians and Westerners on a visuospatial judgment task that
   involved relative, contextual judgments, which are typically more
   challenging for Westerners. Participants judged the relative distances
   between a dot and a line in visual stimuli during task blocks and
   alternated finger presses during control blocks. Behaviorally, East
   Asians responded faster than Westerners, reflecting greater ease of the
   task for East Asians. In response to the greater task difficulty,
   Westerners showed greater neural engagement compared to East Asians in
   frontal, parietal, and occipital areas. Moreover, Westerners also showed
   greater suppression of the default network-a brain network that is
   suppressed under condition of high cognitive challenge. This study
   demonstrates for the first time that cultural differences in visual
   attention during a cognitive task are manifested both by differences in
   activation in fronto-parietal regions as well as suppression in default
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Converging behavioral evidence suggests that people respond to
   experiences of social exclusion with both defensive and affiliative
   strategies, allowing them to avoid further distress while also
   encouraging re-establishment of positive social connections. However,
   there are unresolved questions regarding the cognitive mechanisms
   underlying people's responses to social exclusion. Here, we sought to
   gain insight into these behavioral tendencies by using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the impact of social
   exclusion on neural responses to visual scenes that varied on dimensions
   of sociality and emotional valence. Compared to socially included
   participants, socially excluded participants failed to recruit
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), a brain region involved in
   mentalizing, for negative social scenes. Moreover, following social
   exclusion, dmPFC demonstrated a linear effect of valence, with greater
   activity to positive social scenes compared to negative social scenes.
   These results suggest that, following social exclusion, people display a
   preference for mentalizing about positive social information and tend to
   avoid negative aspects of their social world.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the brainstem in mediating social signaling in phylogenetic
   ancestral organisms has been demonstrated. Evidence for its involvement
   in social engagement in human infants may deepen the understanding of
   the evolutionary pathway of humans as social beings. In this
   longitudinal study, neonatal brainstem functioning was measured by
   auditory brainstem-evoked responses (ABRs) in 125 healthy neonates born
   prematurely before 35 weeks gestational age. At 4 months, infants were
   tested in a set of structured vignettes that required varying levels of
   social engagement and cardiac vagal tone was assessed. Data show that
   neonates with a disrupted I-V waveform, evident mostly by delayed wave
   V, exhibit shorter latencies to gaze averts in episodes involving direct
   face-to-face interactions but engage gaze as controls when interacting
   with masked agents or with agents whose faces are partly veiled by toys.
   Analysis of variance of infants-social engagement with ABR, neonatal
   risk, maternal stress and cardiac vagal tone showed a main effect for
   ABR and an ABR by gestational age interaction. The integrity of
   brainstem transmission of sensory information during the final weeks of
   gestation may scaffold the development of social disengagement, thereby
   attesting to the brainstem's preserved evolutionary role in developing
   humans as social organisms prior to engaging in social encounters.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are able to mentally adopt the spatial perspective of others and
   represent the visual world from their point of view. Here, we present
   neuropsychological evidence that information inaccessible from an
   egocentric perspective can be accessed from the perspective of another
   person. Patients affected by left neglect were asked to describe arrays
   of objects from their own egocentric perspective, from an opposite
   perspective (disembodied perspective taking), and from the point of view
   of another person actually seated in front of them (embodied perspective
   taking). Although disembodied perspective-taking ameliorated neglect
   severity, there was an even stronger positive effect of embodied
   perspective-taking: items presented on the left and neglected when
   reported from the egocentric perspective were instead recovered when
   patients assumed the perspective of the other. These findings suggest
   that perspective-taking entails an altercentric remapping of space, i.e.
   remapping of objects and locations coded with reference to the other

Abstract = {{The recognition of threatening faces is important for making social
   judgments. For example, threatening facial features of defendants could
   affect the decisions of jurors during a trial. Previous neuroimaging
   studies using faces of members of the general public have identified a
   pivotal role of the amygdala in perceiving threat. This functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study used face photographs of male prisoners
   who had been convicted of first-degree murder (MUR) as threatening
   facial stimuli. We compared the subjective ratings of MUR faces with
   those of control (CON) faces and examined how they were related to brain
   activation, particularly, the modulation of the functional connectivity
   between the amygdala and other brain regions. The MUR faces were
   perceived to be more threatening than the CON faces. The bilateral
   amygdala was shown to respond to both MUR and CON faces, but subtraction
   analysis revealed no significant difference between the two. Functional
   connectivity analysis indicated that the extent of connectivity between
   the left amygdala and the face-related regions (i.e. the superior
   temporal sulcus, inferior temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus) was
   correlated with the subjective threat rating for the faces. We have
   demonstrated that the functional connectivity is modulated by vigilance
   for threatening facial features.}},

Abstract = {{Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with impaired memory
   performance coupled with functional changes in brain areas involved in
   declarative memory and emotion regulation. It is not yet clear how
   symptom severity and comorbidity affect neurocognitive functioning in
   PTSD. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study
   with an emotional declarative memory task in 28 Complex PTSD patients
   with comorbid depressive and personality disorders, and 21 healthy
   non-trauma-exposed controls. In Complex PTSD patients-compared to
   controls-encoding of later remembered negative words vs baseline was
   associated with increased blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
   response in the left ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal
   ACC extending to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) together with
   a trend for increased left hippocampus activation. Patients tended to
   commit more False Alarms to negative words compared to controls, which
   was associated with enhanced left ventrolateral prefrontal and
   orbitofrontal cortex (vlPFC/OFC) responses. Severity of child abuse was
   positively correlated with left ventral ACC activity and severity of
   depression with (para) hippocampal and ventral ACC activity. Presented
   results demonstrate functional abnormalities in Complex PTSD in the
   frontolimbic brain circuit also implicated in fear conditioning models,
   but generally in the opposite direction, which may be explained by
   severity of the trauma and severity of comorbid depression in Complex
   PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{Empathic decision-making involves making choices on behalf of others in
   order to maximize their well-being. Examples include the choices that
   parents make for their children, as well as the decisions of a

   investigated the neurobiological and computational basis of empathic
   choice using a human fMRI task in which subjects purchased DVDs for
   themselves with their own money, or DVDs for others with the other's
   money. We found that empathic choices engage the same regions of
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex that are known to compute stimulus
   values, and that these value signals were modulated by activity from a
   region of inferior parietal lobule (IPL) known to play a critical role
   in social processes such as empathy. We also found that the stimulus
   value signals used to make empathic choices were computed using a
   mixture of self-simulation and other-simulation processes, and that
   activity in IPL encoded a variable measuring the distance between the
   other's and self preferences, which provides a hint for how the mixture
   of self-and other-simulation might be implemented.}},

Abstract = {{Building on gene-environment interaction (G x E) research, this study
   examines how the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) gene interacts with a
   situational prime of religion to influence prosocial behavior. Some DRD4
   variants tend to be more susceptible to environmental influences,
   whereas other variants are less susceptible. Thus, certain life
   environments may be associated with acts of prosociality for some DRD4
   variants but not others. Given that religion can act as an environmental
   influence that increases prosocial behavior, environmental input in the
   form of religion priming may have G x E effects. Results showed that
   participants with DRD4 susceptibility variants were more prosocial when
   implicitly primed with religion than not primed with religion, whereas
   participants without DRD4 susceptibility variants were not impacted by
   priming. This research has implications for understanding why different
   people may behave prosocially for different reasons and also integrates

Abstract = {{The motives underlying prosocial behavior, like charitable donations,
   can be related either to actions or to outcomes. To address the neural
   basis of outcome orientation in charitable giving, we asked 33 subjects
   to make choices affecting their own payoffs and payoffs to a charity
   organization, while being scanned by functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). We experimentally induced a reward prediction error
   (RPE) by subsequently discarding some of the chosen outcomes.
   Co-localized to a nucleus accumbens BOLD signal corresponding to the RPE
   for the subject's own payoff, we observed an equivalent RPE signal for
   the charity's payoff in those subjects who were willing to donate. This
   unique demonstration of a neuronal RPE signal for outcomes exclusively
   affecting unrelated others indicates common brain processes during
   outcome evaluation for selfish, individual and nonselfish, social
   rewards and strongly suggests the effectiveness of outcome-oriented
   motives in charitable giving.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence indicates that a sexually dimorphic feature of humans,
   the facial width-to-height ratio (FWHR), is positively correlated with
   reactive aggression, particularly in men. Also, predictions about the
   aggressive tendencies of others faithfully map onto FWHR in the absence
   of explicit awareness of this metric. Here, we provide the first
   evidence that amygdala reactivity to social signals of interpersonal
   challenge may underlie the link between aggression and the FWHR.
   Specifically, amygdala reactivity to angry faces was positively
   correlated with aggression, but only among men with relatively large
   FWHRs. The patterns of association were specific to angry facial
   expressions and unique to men. These links may reflect the common
   influence of pubertal testosterone on craniofacial growth and
   development of neural circuitry underlying aggression. Amygdala
   reactivity may also represent a plausible pathway through which FWHR may
   have evolved to represent an honest indicator of conspecific threat,
   namely by reflecting the responsiveness of neural circuitry mediating
   aggressive behavior.}},

Abstract = {{There is a broad discussion concerning the function of new neurons in
   the adult brain. An increasingly accepted hypothesis proposes their
   crucial role in spatial learning. In this work, however, we demonstrate
   adult cyclin D2 knockout (cD2 KO) mice, which lack adult hippocampal
   neurogenesis, are able to learn a spatial version of the Barnes maze.
   Similar to wild type (WT) controls, these mutant mice exhibited several
   indicators of learning during 6 days of training: successively shorter
   latency and distance, higher speed, and decreasing number of errors. WT
   and cD2 KO mice showed improved search strategies, which became
   increasingly spatial. During probe Trial 1, mutant mice attained the
   highest significant number of nose-pokes at the former target hole
   compared with all the other holes. Both WT and cD2 KO mice covered
   shorter distances during probe Trial 2, whereas the mutant mice showed
   higher speed. We also discuss the possibility that some of the observed
   differences displayed by cD2 KO mice during training and at the probe
   trials for example, longer mean distance and more errors are associated
   with a smaller hippocampal formation. Our results suggest that adult
   brain neurogenesis is not obligatory for learning the Barnes maze.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes a novel spatial memory paradigm for monkeys and
   reports the effects of neonatal damage to the hippocampus on performance
   in adulthood. Monkeys were trained to forage in eight boxes hung on the
   walls of a large enclosure. Each box contained a different food item
   that varied in its intrinsic reward value, as determined from food
   preference testing. Monkeys were trained on a spatial and a cued version
   of the task. In the spatial task, the boxes looked identical and
   remained fixed in location whereas in the cued task, the boxes were
   individuated with colored plaques and changed location On each trial.
   Ten adult Rhesus macaques (5 neonatal sham-operated and 5 with neonatal
   neurotoxic hippocampal lesions) were allowed to forage once daily until
   they preferentially visited boxes containing preferred foods. The data
   suggest that all monkeys learned to discriminate preferred from
   nonpreferred food locations, but that monkeys with neonatal hippocampal
   damage committed significantly more working memory errors than controls
   in both tasks. Furthermore, following selective satiation, controls
   altered their foraging pattern to avoid the satiated food, whereas
   lesioned animals did not, suggesting that neonatal hippocampal lesions
   prohibit learning of specific food-place associations. We conclude that
   whereas an intact hippocampus is necessary to form specific
   item-in-place associations, in its absence, cortical areas may support
   more broad distinctions between food types that allow monkeys to
   discriminate places containing highly preferred foods.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability to psychiatric
   illnesses such as addiction, mood disorders, and schizophrenia. Rats
   provide a useful animal model for investigating the differences in
   behavior and biology between adults and adolescents that stem from
   ongoing brain development. We developed the Cued Response Inhibition
   Task, or CRIT, to assess response inhibition and initiation processes by
   measuring the ability of rodents to withhold a response during an
   inhibitory cue and then to respond promptly after cue termination. We
   found no difference between adult and adolescent rats in the ability to
   appropriately inhibit a response during cue presentation. Adolescents,
   however, were unable to initiate a response as quickly as adults after
   cue termination. Further, we observed that this difference in responding
   was abolished after adolescent rats aged to adulthood with no additional
   training. In a separate experiment, adult and adolescent rats were
   trained in CRIT and then trained in another protocol in which the
   response inhibitory cue from CRIT was used as a Pavlovian cue predictive
   of reward. Adolescents demonstrated more reward-seeking behavior during
   the previously inhibitory Pavlovian cue than adults, indicative of
   greater behavioral flexibility. Taken together, these data suggest that,
   compared with adults, adolescent rats (a) are less able to initiate a
   response after response inhibition, (b) equally inhibit behavioral
   responses, and (c) are more adept at flexibly switching behavioral
   patterns. Furthermore, this study characterizes a task that is well
   suited for future pharmacological and electrophysiological
   investigations for assessing neuronal processing differences between
   adolescents and adults.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies in Long-Evans rats demonstrated a significant
   relationship between variation in pup licking/grooming and arched-back
   nursing (LG-ABN) and offspring development. However, maternal care is
   dynamic and exhibits significant temporal variation. In the current
   study, we assessed temporal variation in LG and ABN in lactating rats
   across the circadian cycle and determined the impact of these behaviors
   for the prediction of offspring hypothalamic gene expression,
   anxiety-like behavior, and responsiveness to a high fat diet (HFD). We
   find that distinguishing between dams that engage in stable individual
   differences in maternal behavior (Low, Mid, High) requires assessment
   across the light dark phases of the light cycle and across multiple
   postpartum days. Among juvenile female offspring, we find a positive
   correlation between maternal LG and mRNA levels of estrogen receptor
   alpha and beta and the oxytocin receptor (when LG is assessed across the
   light dark cycle or in the dark phase). In young adults, we find
   sex-specific effects, with female High LG offspring exhibiting increased
   exploration of a novel environment and increased latency to approach
   HFD, and male High LG offspring displaying increased activity in a novel
   environment and reduced HFD consumption. Importantly, these effects on
   behavior were primarily evident when LG was assessed across the light
   dark cycle and ABN was not associated with these measures. Overall, our
   findings illustrate the dissociation between the effects of LG and ABN
   on offspring development and provide critical insights into the temporal
   characteristics of maternal behavior that have methodological
   implications for the study of maternal effects.}},

Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-58}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{High- versus low-novelty exploration predicts a variety of behavioral
   differences. For example, rats selectively bred for high-novelty
   exploration (bred-high responders, bHR) exhibit exaggerated aggression,
   impulsivity, and proclivity to addictive behaviors compared with
   low-novelty reactive rats (bred-low responders, bLRs), which are
   characterized by a high anxiety/depressive-like phenotype. Since bHR/bLR
   rats exhibit differences in dopaminergic circuitry and differential
   response to rewarding stimuli (i.e., psychostimulants, food), the
   present study examined whether they also differ in another key hedonic
   behavior-sex. Thus, adult bHR/bLR males were given five 30-min
   opportunities to engage in sexual activity with a receptive female.
   Sexual behavior and motivation were examined and compared between the
   groups. The bHR/bLR phenotype affected both sexual motivation and
   behavior, with bLR males demonstrating reduced motivation for sex
   compared with bHR males (i.e., fewer animals copulated, longer latency
   to engage in sex). The bHR males required more intromissions at a faster
   pace per ejaculation than did bLR males. Thus, neurobiological
   differences that affect motivation for drugs of abuse, aggression, and
   impulsivity in rats also affect sexual motivation and performance.}},

Abstract = {{Fear extinction can be defined as the weakening of the expression of a
   conditioned response (CR) by extended experience of nonreinforcement.
   Conceptually, two distinct models have been invoked to account for
   extinction. R. A. Rescorla and A. R. Wagner (1972, A theory of Pavlovian
   conditioning: Variations in the effectiveness of reinforcement and
   nonreinforcement, in A. H. B. W. F. Prokasy (Ed.), Classical
   conditioning: II. Current research and theory, pp. 64-99, New York, NY,
   Appleton-Century-Crofts) postulated that the number of exposure trials
   is the primary determinant of CR decrement, whereas C. R. Gallistel and
   J. Gibbon (2000, Time, rate, and conditioning, Psychological Review,
   Vol. 107, pp. 289-344) proposed that the decisive event is the cumulated
   exposure time to the nonreinforced conditioned stimulus (CS) elapsed
   after the last CS reinforcement. We evaluated these two accounts in a
   human differential fear conditioning study in which CR was measured with
   the fear-potentiated startle response. Cumulated duration of
   nonreinforcement falls to explain our findings, whereas the number of
   trials appeared critical. In fact, many CS trials with a duration
   shorter than the acquisition CS duration facilitated within-session
   extinction, but this effect did not predict the recovery of fear.}},

Abstract = {{Research into the neural basis of recognition memory has traditionally
   focused on the remembrance of visual stimuli. The present study examined
   the neural basis of object recognition memory in the dark, with a view
   to determining the extent to which it shares common pathways with
   visual-based object recognition. Experiment 1 assessed the expression of
   the immediate-early gene c-fos in rats that discriminated novel from
   familiar objects in the dark (Group Novel). Comparisons made with a
   control group that explored only familiar objects (Group Familiar)
   showed that Group Novel had higher c-fos activity in the rostral
   perirhinal cortex and the lateral entorhinal cortex. Outside the
   temporal region, Group Novel showed relatively increased c-fos activity
   in the anterior medial thalamic nucleus and the anterior cingulate
   cortex. Both the hippocampal CA fields and the granular retrosplenial
   cortex showed borderline increases in c-fos activity with object
   novelty. The hippocampal findings prompted Experiment 2. Here, rats with
   hippocampal lesions were tested in the dark for object recognition
   memory at different retention delays. Across two replications, no
   evidence was found that hippocampal lesions impair nonvisual object
   recognition. The results indicate that in the dark, as in the light,
   interrelated parahippocampal sites are activated when rats explore novel
   stimuli. These findings reveal a network of linked c-fos activations
   that share superficial features with those associated with visual
   recognition but differ in the fine details; for example, in the locus of
   the perirhinal cortex activation. While there may also be a relative
   increase in c-fos activation in the extended-hippocampal system to
   object recognition in the dark, there was no evidence that this
   recognition memory problem required an intact hippocampus.}},

Abstract = {{The orexin/hypocretin peptide signaling system plays a neuromodulatory
   role in motivation and stress; two critical components of depression.
   Although work has been done to identify links between orexin and
   depression, few specific neuroanatomical associations have been made.
   These studies have not investigated the relationship between orexin and
   orexin receptor expression in specific brain regions associated with
   this disorder. To address this, we examined immobility during the forced
   swim test (FST) in mice, a commonly used measure of depressive behavior.
   We analyzed the variation in FST immobility with the distribution of
   orexin and its receptor mRNA. We found that animals that exhibited more
   robust depressive behavior had greater or lesser orexin system
   expression that depended on the limbic brain region analyzed. In the
   hippocampus there was a negative correlation between orexin expression
   and FST immobility. Animals that displayed relatively more depressive
   behavior had lower hippocampal expression of Orexin A (Orx(A)). In the
   amygdala, there was a curvilinear relationship between Orx(A) and FST
   performance. In addition there was a positive correlation with amygdalar
   Type I orexin receptor (Orx(1)) mRNA and depressive behavior. Despite
   the differences in limbic orexin expression, there was no correlation
   between immobility and hypothalamic orexin neuron activation as measured
   by c-Fos. Overall, more severe depressive behavior was associated with
   reduced hippocampal orexin expression, contrasted with increased orexin
   plus Orx(1) receptor mRNA expression in the amygdala. This divergent
   pattern between the hippocampus and amygdala mirrors a neurobiological
   theme seen in depression resulting from reduced hippocampal, but
   increased amygdalar, size and function.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol use disorders emerge from a complex interaction between
   environmental and genetic factors. Stress and dopamine D2 receptor
   levels (DRD2) have been shown to play a central role in alcoholism. To
   better understand the interactions between DRD2 and stress in ethanol
   intake behavior, we subjected Drd2 wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-),
   and knockout (-/-) mice to 4 weeks of chronic mild stress (CMS) and to
   an ethanol two-bottle choice during CMS weeks 2-4. Prior to and at the
   end of the experiment, the animals were tested in the forced swim and
   open field tests. We measured ethanol intake and preference, immobility
   in the force swim test, and activity in the open field. We show that
   under no CMS, Drd2+/- and Drd2-/- mice had lower ethanol intake and
   preference compared with Drd2+/+. Exposure to CMS decreased ethanol
   intake and preference in Drd2+/+ and increased them in Drd2+/- and
   Drd2-/- mice. At baseline, Drd2+/- and Drd2-/- mice had significantly
   lower activity in the open field than Drd2+/+, whereas no genotype
   differences were observed in the forced swim test. Exposure to CMS
   increased immobility during the forced swim test in Drd2+/- mice, but
   not in Drd2+/+ or Drd2-/- mice, and ethanol intake reversed this
   behavior. No changes were observed in open field test measures. These
   findings suggest that in the presence of a stressful environment, low
   DRD2 levels are associated with increased ethanol intake and preference
   and that under this condition, increased ethanol consumption could be
   used as a strategy to alleviate negative mood.}},

Abstract = {{The authors examined the relationship of corpus callosum (CC) morphology
   and organization to hand preference and performance on a motor skill
   task in chimpanzees. Handedness was assessed using a complex tool use
   task that simulated termite fishing. Chimpanzees were initially allowed
   to perform the task wherein they could choose which hand to use
   (preference measure), then they were required to complete trials using
   each hand (performance measure). Two measures were used to assess the
   CC: midsagittal area obtained from in vivo magnetic resonance images and
   density of transcallosal connections as determined by fractional
   anisotropy values obtained from diffusion tensor imaging. The authors
   hypothesized that chimpanzees would perform better on their preferred
   hand compared to the nonpreferred hand, and that strength of behavioral
   lateralization (rather the direction) on this task would be negatively
   correlated to regions of the CC involved in motor processing. Results
   indicate that the preferred hand was the most adept hand. Performance
   asymmetries correlated with fractional anisotropy measures but not area
   measures of the CC.}},

Abstract = {{Rats are responsive to shock from an early age, but eyeblink
   conditioning to a tone-conditioned stimulus (conditional stimulus; CS)
   paired with a shock-unconditioned stimulus (US) does not emerge until
   postnatal Day 20 (P20). More generalized postural responses such as
   conditioned freezing can occur at P16. Using the same periorbital shock
   as both the CS and US in a US US conditioning paradigm previously shown
   to be effective in adult animals, we found that shock shock pairings
   with a 200-ms trace interval resulted in eyeblink conditioning in
   younger animals than previously thought. Some rat pups showed
   conditioned eyeblink responses as early as P12, and by P18, conditioned
   responses were fully developed in all animals. Unpaired control subjects
   confirmed that responding in paired subjects was associative. Although
   many stimuli can act as a CS in adults, the advantage of using US US
   pairings is that responses to the first US ensure young rat pups are
   capable of detecting the stimulus something that may not be true when
   auditory or visual stimuli are used early in the development of
   altricial animals. The US US pairing paradigm could be used to study the
   ontogeny and neural substrates of learning and memory before other
   sensory systems mature, and evaluate learning and memory in animal
   models of early developmental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{One major issue in the field of vision is how stimulus properties
   contribute to determine where the eyes move. Here, we examined the role
   of local versus global visual features in the computation of saccade
   metrics in the light of the well-known tendency for saccade to vary with
   the size of the stimuli. We used a saccade-target task in which we
   varied the properties of a visual distractor simultaneously displayed
   with the target stimulus. Both the size and the luminance contrast of
   the distractor were varied but the number of elementary features that
   composed the distractor was held constant. Our results showed that under
   such controls mean saccades' landing position remained unaffected by
   stimulus size irrespective of the level of luminance contrast. These
   findings suggest that the local visual features of a stimulus may be
   more critical than global features to specify a particular location to
   look at. These results are consistent with the notion that local
   features contribute to determine the amplitude and the width of the
   neuronal activity patterns associated with the visual stimulation and
   hence the computation of saccade metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Habituation is a basic form of learning that reflects the adaptive
   reduction in responses to a stimulus that is neither threatening nor
   rewarding. Extremely shy, or inhibited individuals, are typically slow
   to acclimate to new people, a behavioral pattern that may reflect slower
   habituation to novelty. To test this hypothesis, we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to examine habituation to neutral faces in 39
   young adults with either an extreme inhibited or extreme uninhibited
   temperament. Our investigation focused on two key brain regions involved
   in response to novelty-the amygdala and the hippocampus. Habituation to
   neutral faces in the amygdala and hippocampus differed significantly by
   temperament group. Individuals with an uninhibited temperament
   demonstrated habituation in both the amygdala and hippocampus, as
   expected. In contrast, in individuals with an inhibited temperament, the
   amygdala and hippocampus failed to habituate across repeated
   presentations of faces. The failure of the amygdala and hippocampus to
   habituate to faces represents a novel neural substrate mediating the
   behavioral differences seen in individuals with an inhibited
   temperament. We propose that this failure to habituate reflects a social
   learning deficit in individuals with an inhibited temperament and
   provides a possible mechanism for increased risk for social anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Mindfulness meditation has been shown to promote emotional stability.
   Moreover, during the processing of aversive and self-referential
   stimuli, mindful awareness is associated with reduced medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) activity, a central default mode network (DMN) component.
   However, it remains unclear whether mindfulness practice influences
   functional connectivity between DMN regions and, if so, whether such
   impact persists beyond a state of meditation. Consequently, this study
   examined the effect of extensive mindfulness training on functional
   connectivity within the DMN during a restful state. Resting-state data
   were collected from 13 experienced meditators (with over 1000 h of
   training) and 11 beginner meditators (with no prior experience, trained
   for 1 week before the study) using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Pairwise correlations and partial correlations were computed
   between DMN seed regions' time courses and were compared between groups
   utilizing a Bayesian sampling scheme. Relative to beginners, experienced
   meditators had weaker functional connectivity between DMN regions
   involved in self-referential processing and emotional appraisal. In
   addition, experienced meditators had increased connectivity between
   certain DMN regions (e.g. dorso-medial PFC and right inferior parietal
   lobule), compared to beginner meditators. These findings suggest that
   meditation training leads to functional connectivity changes between
   core DMN regions possibly reflecting strengthened present-moment
   awareness.}},

Abstract = {{One component of mindfulness training (MT) is the development of
   interoceptive attention (IA) to visceral bodily sensations, facilitated
   through daily practices such as breath monitoring. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined experience-dependent
   functional plasticity in accessing interoceptive representations by
   comparing graduates of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course to a
   waitlisted control group. IA to respiratory sensations was contrasted
   against two visual tasks, controlling for attentional requirements
   non-specific to IA such as maintaining sensation and suppressing
   distraction. In anatomically partitioned analyses of insula activity, MT
   predicted greater IA-related activity in anterior dysgranular insula
   regions, consistent with greater integration of interoceptive sensation
   with external context. MT also predicted decreased recruitment of the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) during IA, and altered functional
   connectivity between the DMPFC and the posterior insula, putative
   primary interoceptive cortex. Furthermore, meditation practice
   compliance predicted greater posterior insula and reduced visual pathway
   recruitment during IA. These findings suggest that interoceptive
   training modulates task-specific cortical recruitment, analogous to
   training-related plasticity observed in the external senses. Further,
   DMPFC modulation of IA networks may be an important mechanism by which
   MT alters information processing in the brain, increasing the
   contribution of interoception to perceptual experience.}},

Abstract = {{A convergent line of neuroscientific evidence suggests that meditation
   alters the functional and structural plasticity of distributed neural
   processes underlying attention and emotion. The purpose of this study
   was to examine the brain structural differences between a well-matched
   sample of long-term meditators and controls. We employed whole-brain
   cortical thickness analysis based on magnetic resonance imaging, and
   diffusion tensor imaging to quantify white matter integrity in the
   brains of 46 experienced meditators compared with 46 matched
   meditation-naive volunteers. Meditators, compared with controls, showed
   significantly greater cortical thickness in the anterior regions of the
   brain, located in frontal and temporal areas, including the medial
   prefrontal cortex, superior frontal cortex, temporal pole and the middle
   and interior temporal cortices. Significantly thinner cortical thickness
   was found in the posterior regions of the brain, located in the parietal
   and occipital areas, including the postcentral cortex, inferior parietal
   cortex, middle occipital cortex and posterior cingulate cortex.
   Moreover, in the region adjacent to the medial prefrontal cortex, both
   higher fractional anisotropy values and greater cortical thickness were
   observed. Our findings suggest that long-term meditators have structural
   differences in both gray and white matter.}},

Abstract = {{Previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies have revealed that
   meditation is associated with structural brain changes in regions
   underlying cognitive processes that are required for attention or
   mindfulness during meditation. This VBM study examined brain changes
   related to the practice of an emotion-oriented meditation:
   loving-kindness meditation (LKM). A 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   scanner captured images of the brain structures of 25 men, 10 of whom
   had practiced LKM in the Theravada tradition for at least 5 years.
   Compared with novices, more gray matter volume was detected in the right
   angular and posterior parahippocampal gyri in LKM experts. The right
   angular gyrus has not been previously reported to have structural
   differences associated with meditation, and its specific role in mind
   and cognitive empathy theory suggests the uniqueness of this finding for
   LKM practice. These regions are important for affective regulation
   associated with empathic response, anxiety and mood. At the same time,
   gray matter volume in the left temporal lobe in the LKM experts appeared
   to be greater, an observation that has also been reported in previous
   MRI meditation studies on meditation styles other than LKM. Overall, the
   findings of our study suggest that experience in LKM may influence brain
   structures associated with affective regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Mindfulness meditation-the practice of attending to present moment
   experience and allowing emotions and thoughts to pass without
   judgment-has shown to be beneficial in clinical populations across
   diverse outcomes. However, the basic neural mechanisms by which
   mindfulness operates and relates to everyday outcomes in novices remain
   unexplored. Focused attention is a common mindfulness induction where
   practitioners focus on specific physical sensations, typically the
   breath. The present study explores the neural mechanisms of this common
   mindfulness induction among novice practitioners. Healthy novice
   participants completed a brief task with both mindful attention
   {[}focused breathing (FB)] and control (unfocused attention) conditions
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Relative to the
   control condition, FB recruited an attention network including parietal
   and prefrontal structures and trait-level mindfulness during this
   comparison also correlated with parietal activation. Results suggest
   that the neural mechanisms of a brief mindfulness induction are related
   to attention processes in novices and that trait mindfulness positively
   moderates this activation.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to accurately infer others' mental states from facial

   fundamentally impaired in social cognitive disorders such as autism.
   While pharmacologic interventions have shown promise for enhancing
   empathic accuracy, little is known about the effects of behavioral
   interventions on empathic accuracy and related brain activity. This
   study employed a randomized, controlled and longitudinal design to
   investigate the effect of a secularized analytical compassion meditation
   program, cognitive-based compassion training (CBCT), on empathic
   accuracy. Twenty-one healthy participants received functional MRI scans
   while completing an empathic accuracy task, the Reading the Mind in the
   Eyes Test (RMET), both prior to and after completion of either CBCT or a
   health discussion control group. Upon completion of the study
   interventions, participants randomized to CBCT and were significantly
   more likely than control subjects to have increased scores on the RMET
   and increased neural activity in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Moreover, changes in dmPFC and
   IFG activity from baseline to the post-intervention assessment were
   associated with changes in empathic accuracy. These findings suggest
   that CBCT may hold promise as a behavioral intervention for enhancing
   empathic accuracy and the neurobiology supporting it.}},

Abstract = {{Mindfulness-based interventions are effective for reducing depressive
   symptoms. However, the psychological and neural mechanisms are unclear.
   This study examined which facets of trait mindfulness offer protection
   against negative bias and rumination, which are key risk factors for
   depression. Nineteen male volunteers completed a 2-day functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study. One day utilized a stress-induction
   task and the other day utilized a mindful breathing task. An emotional
   inhibition task was used to measure neural and behavioral changes
   related to state negative bias, defined by poorer performance in
   inhibiting negative relative to neutral stimuli. Associations among
   trait mindfulness {[}measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness
   Questionnaire (FFMQ)], trait rumination, and negative bias were
   examined. Non-reactivity scores on the FFMQ correlated negatively with
   rumination and negative bias following the stress induction.
   Non-reactivity was inversely correlated with insula activation during
   inhibition to negative stimuli after the mindful breathing task. Our
   results suggest non-reactivity to inner experience is the key facet of
   mindfulness that protects individuals from psychological risk for
   depression. Based on these results, mindfulness could reduce
   vulnerability to depression in at least two ways: (i) by buffering
   against trait rumination and negative bias and (ii) by reducing
   automatic emotional responding via the insula.}},

Abstract = {{Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is thought to reduce emotional
   reactivity and enhance emotion regulation in patients with social
   anxiety disorder (SAD). The goal of this study was to examine the neural
   correlates of deploying attention to regulate responses to negative
   self-beliefs using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants
   were 56 patients with generalized SAD in a randomized controlled trial
   who were assigned to MBSR or a comparison aerobic exercise (AE) stress
   reduction program. Compared to AE, MBSR yielded greater (i) reductions
   in negative emotion when implementing regulation and (ii) increases in
   attention-related parietal cortical regions. Meditation practice was
   associated with decreases in negative emotion and social anxiety symptom
   severity, and increases in attention-related parietal cortex neural
   responses when implementing attention regulation of negative
   self-beliefs. Changes in attention regulation during MBSR may be an
   important psychological factor that helps to explain how mindfulness
   meditation training benefits patients with anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{An emerging body of research suggests that mindfulness-based
   interventions may be beneficial for smoking cessation and the treatment
   of other addictive disorders. One way that mindfulness may facilitate
   smoking cessation is through the reduction of craving to smoking cues.
   The present work considers whether mindful attention can reduce
   self-reported and neural markers of cue-induced craving in treatment
   seeking smokers. Forty-seven (n = 47) meditation-naive treatment-seeking
   smokers (12-h abstinent from smoking) viewed and made ratings of smoking
   and neutral images while undergoing functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). Participants were trained and instructed to view these
   images passively or with mindful attention. Results indicated that
   mindful attention reduced self-reported craving to smoking images, and
   reduced neural activity in a craving-related region of subgenual
   anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Moreover, a psychophysiological
   interaction analysis revealed that mindful attention reduced functional
   connectivity between sgACC and other craving-related regions compared to
   passively viewing smoking images, suggesting that mindfulness may
   decouple craving neurocircuitry when viewing smoking cues. These results
   provide an initial indication that mindful attention may describe a
   `bottom-up' attention to one's present moment experience in ways that
   can help reduce subjective and neural reactivity to smoking cues in
   smokers.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have documented the positive effects of mindfulness
   meditation on executive control. What has been lacking, however, is an
   understanding of the mechanism underlying this effect. Some theorists
   have described mindfulness as embodying two facets-present moment
   awareness and emotional acceptance. Here, we examine how the effect of
   meditation practice on executive control manifests in the brain,
   suggesting that emotional acceptance and performance monitoring play
   important roles. We investigated the effect of meditation practice on
   executive control and measured the neural correlates of performance
   monitoring, specifically, the error-related negativity (ERN), a
   neurophysiological response that occurs within 100 ms of error
   commission. Meditators and controls completed a Stroop task, during
   which we recorded ERN amplitudes with electroencephalography. Meditators
   showed greater executive control (i.e. fewer errors), a higher ERN and
   more emotional acceptance than controls. Finally, mediation pathway
   models further revealed that meditation practice relates to greater
   executive control and that this effect can be accounted for by
   heightened emotional acceptance, and to a lesser extent, increased
   brain-based performance monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable research has disclosed how cognitive reappraisals and the
   modulation of emotional responses promote successful emotion regulation.
   Less research has examined how the early processing of emotion-relevant
   stimuli may create divergent emotional response consequences.
   Mindfulness-a receptive, non-evaluative form of attention-is theorized
   to foster emotion regulation, and the present study examined whether
   individual differences in mindfulness would modulate neural responses
   associated with the early processing of affective stimuli. Focus was on
   the late positive potential (LPP) of the event-related brain potential
   to visual stimuli varying in emotional valence and arousal. This study
   first found, replicating past research, that high arousal images,
   particularly of an unpleasant type, elicited larger LPP responses.
   Second, the study found that more mindful individuals showed lower LPP
   responses to high arousal unpleasant images, even after controlling for
   trait attentional control. Conversely, two traits contrasting with
   mindfulness-neuroticism and negative affectivity-were associated with
   higher LPP responses to high arousal unpleasant images. Finally,
   mindfulness was also associated with lower LPP responses to
   motivationally salient pleasant images (erotica). These findings suggest
   that mindfulness modulates neural responses in an early phase of
   affective processing, and contribute to understanding how this quality
   of attention may promote healthy emotional functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term Vipassana meditators sat in meditation vs. a control
   (instructed mind wandering) states for 25 min, electroencephalography
   (EEG) was recorded and condition order counterbalanced. For the last 4
   min, a three-stimulus auditory oddball series was presented during both
   meditation and control periods through headphones and no task imposed.
   Time-frequency analysis demonstrated that meditation relative to the
   control condition evinced decreased evoked delta (2-4 Hz) power to
   distracter stimuli concomitantly with a greater event-related reduction
   of late (500-900 ms) alpha-1 (8-10 Hz) activity, which indexed altered
   dynamics of attentional engagement to distracters. Additionally,
   standard stimuli were associated with increased early event-related
   alpha phase synchrony (inter-trial coherence) and evoked theta (4-8 Hz)
   phase synchrony, suggesting enhanced processing of the habituated
   standard background stimuli. Finally, during meditation, there was a
   greater differential early-evoked gamma power to the different stimulus
   classes. Correlation analysis indicated that this effect stemmed from a
   meditation state-related increase in early distracter-evoked gamma power
   and phase synchrony specific to longer-term expert practitioners. The
   findings suggest that Vipassana meditation evokes a brain state of
   enhanced perceptual clarity and decreased automated reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive body of research defines the default-mode network (DMN) to

   functional role in processes of internal mentation. Alterations in the

   with reductions associated with functional ramifications for the elderly
   population. This study examined associations between integrity of the
   DMN and trait levels of mindfulness disposition, defined by our ability
   to exert attentional and emotional control in the present moment, and,
   thereby, bring awareness to immediate experiences. Twenty-five older
   adults participated in the study and underwent a brief functional
   magnetic resonance imaging session and filled out questionnaires related
   to their overall health and mindfulness disposition. Mindfulness
   disposition was associated with greater connectivity of the DMN,
   specifically, in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex and the
   precuneus. Mindfulness disposition, thus, explains variance in the
   connectivity of one of the more intrinsic networks of the human brain,
   known to be critical for promoting self-relevant mental explorations and

   activation. Although it is still nascent, the broad impact of merging
   the study of culture with cognitive neuroscience holds mutual
   distributed benefits for multiple related fields. Thus, cultural
   neuroscience may be uniquely poised to provide insights and
   breakthroughs for longstanding questions and problems in the study of
   behavior and thought, and its capacity for integration across multiple
   levels of analysis is especially high. These findings attest to the

Abstract = {{Anxiety plays an important role in social behavior. For instance,
   high-anxious individuals are more likely to avoid such social
   interactions as communicating with strangers. In this study, we
   investigate the impact of anxiety on social decision-making. The classic
   ultimatum game (UG) paradigm was utilized in concert with skin
   conductance recording. Behavioral results reveal that when playing as
   responders, high-trait anxiety (HTA) participants with lower levels of
   self-esteem, as well as low-trait anxiety (LTA) participants with higher
   levels of impulsivity, were more likely to accept human-proposed
   inequitable offers. In addition, the HTA participants rejected more
   computer-proposed inequitable offers than did LTA participants.
   Moreover, the skin conductance response to inequitable offers was
   correlated with levels of anxiety in the HTA group, but not in the LTA
   group. In conclusion, people differing in levels of anxiety showed
   distinct behavior patterns and autonomic neural responses during social
   decision-making, whereas the levels of self-esteem, impulsivity, and
   depression might be additional moderating factors. These findings
   contextualize high-anxious people's avoidance tendency in social
   interaction.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{22-30}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Much research has been carried out to understand how human brains make
   sense of another agent in motion. Current views based on human adult and
   monkey studies assume a matching process in the motor system biased
   toward actions performed by conspecifics and present in the observer's
   motor repertoire. However, little is known about the neural correlates
   of action cognition in early ontogeny. In this study, we examined the
   processes involved in the observation of full body movements in
   4-month-old infants using functional near-infrared spectroscopy to
   measure localized brain activation. In a 2 x 2 design, infants watched
   human or robotic figures moving in a smooth, familiar human-like manner,
   or in a rigid, unfamiliar robot-like manner. We found that infant
   premotor cortex responded more strongly to observe robot-like motion
   compared with human-like motion. Contrary to current views, this
   suggests that the infant motor system is flexibly engaged by novel
   movement patterns. Moreover, temporal cortex responses indicate that
   infants integrate information about form and motion during action
   observation. The response patterns obtained in premotor and temporal
   cortices during action observation in these young infants are very
   similar to those reported for adults. These findings thus suggest that
   the brain processes involved in the analysis of an agent in motion in
   adults become functionally specialized very early in human development.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{31-42}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{It has been postulated that when people engage in joint actions they
   form internal representations not only of their part of the joint task
   but of their co-actors' parts of the task as well. However, empirical
   evidence for this claim is scarce. By means of high-density
   electroencephalography, this study investigated whether one represents
   and simulates the action of an interaction partner when planning to
   perform a joint action. The results showed that joint action planning
   compared with individual action planning resulted in amplitude
   modulations of the frontal P3a and parietal P3b event-related
   potentials, which are associated with stimulus classification, updating
   of representations, and decision-making. Moreover, there was evidence
   for anticipatory motor simulation of the partner's action in the
   amplitude and peak latency of the late, motor part of the Contingent
   Negative Variation, which was correlated with joint action performance.
   Our results provide evidence that when people engage in joint tasks,
   they represent in advance each other's actions in order to facilitate
   coordination.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43-51}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Love of money (LOM) is concerned with the attitude toward money, which
   can be measured by the LOM scale through affective, behavioral, and
   cognitive dimensions. Research has observed that monetary attitude was
   tightly related to reward processing and could affect economic behavior.
   This study examined how monetary attitude modulated risky behavior and
   the underlying neural mechanisms of reward processing using
   event-related potential (ERP) technique. We compared both the risk level
   and brain responses of a high-level LOM (HLOM) group to a low-level LOM
   (LLOM) group using a simple gambling task. The behavioral results showed
   that the HLOM group was more risky than the LLOM group, particularly
   after loss. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) was measured as the
   difference wave (gain-related ERP was subtracted from loss-related ERP).
   The FRN difference wave was larger in the HLOM group than that in the
   LLOM group. The P3 in the HLOM group was more positive than that in the
   LLOM group. These results suggest that monetary attitude can modulate
   both the underlying neural mechanisms and behavioral performance in a
   reward-related task. The HLOM participants are more sensitive to
   gain/loss than the LLOM participants.}},

Abstract = {{East Asians and Asian-Americans tend to allocate relatively greater
   attention to background context compared to European Americans across a
   variety of cognitive and neural measures. We sought to extend these
   findings of cultural differences to affective stimuli using the N400,
   which has been shown to be sensitive to deep processing of affective
   information. The degree to which Asian-Americans and European Americans
   responded to semantic incongruity between emotionally expressive faces
   (i.e., smiling or frowning) and background affective scenes was
   measured. As predicted, Asian-Americans showed a greater N400 to
   incongruent trials than to congruent trials. In contrast, European
   Americans showed no difference in amplitude across the two conditions.
   Furthermore, greater affective N400 incongruity was associated with
   higher interdependent self-construals. These data suggest that
   Asian-Americans and those with interdependent self-construals process
   the relationship between perceived facial emotion and affective
   background context to a greater degree than European Americans and those
   with independent self-construals. Implications for neural and cognitive
   differences in everyday social interactions, and cultural differences in

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Humans are social beings and often have to perceive and perform within
   groups. In conflict situations, this puts them under pressure to either
   adhere to the group opinion or to risk controversy with the group.
   Psychological experiments have demonstrated that study participants
   adapt to erroneous group opinions in visual perception tasks, which they
   can easily solve correctly when performing on their own. Until this
   point, however, it is unclear whether this phenomenon of social
   conformity influences early stages of perception that might not even
   reach awareness or later stages of conscious decision-making. Using
   electroencephalography, this study has revealed that social conformity
   to the wrong group opinion resulted in a decrease of the
   posterior-lateral P1 in line with a decrease of the later
   centro-parietal P3. These results suggest that group pressure situations
   impact early unconscious visual perceptual processing, which results in
   a later diminished stimulus discrimination and an adaptation even to the
   wrong group opinion. These findings might have important implications
   for understanding social behavior in group settings and are discussed
   within the framework of social influence on eyewitness testimony.}},

Abstract = {{Humans work to improve the situation of others through sympathetic
   concern. The empathic joy hypothesis proposes that the urge to help is
   stimulated by enhanced sensitivity to vicarious joy achieved through
   helping a recipient to meet their needs. We further hypothesized that
   the positive feeling-related brain activation that occurs in the
   striatum during sympathetic concern is enhanced by empathy in a
   familiarity-dependent manner. To test this, we conducted behavioral and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments in which two
   participants simultaneously played a virtual ball-toss game where either
   the subjects' partner or an unfamiliar player was isolated by the other
   players. The subjects showed sympathetic behavior by tossing the ball to
   the isolated player and reported enhancement of self-positive feelings
   and anticipation of feeling improvements of the isolated player during
   sympathetic behaviors. Activation in the bilateral dorsal striatum
   became more prominent during the behaviors, supporting the empathic joy
   hypothesis. Dorsal striatal activity when helping a romantic partner
   positively correlated with affective empathic traits toward that
   partner, whereas the activity measured when helping a stranger
   positively correlated with perspective-taking traits. The correlation
   results further revealed a familiarity-dependent empathic enhancement of
   positive feelings. Therefore, sympathetic concern is invoked through
   empathic positive feeling.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation is a crucial skill in adulthood; its acquisition
   represents one of the key developmental tasks in early childhood.
   Difficulties with adaptive emotion regulation increase the risk of
   psychopathology in childhood and adulthood. This is, for instance, shown
   by a relation between emotion regulation and aggressive behavior in
   childhood age, indicating emotion dysregulation as an important risk
   factor of aggressive behavior and potential precursor of
   psychopathology. Based on (1) interrelations between emotion processes
   and social information processing (maladaptive emotion regulation and
   social information processing are associated with higher levels of
   aggression) and (2) recent neuroscientific findings showing that empathy
   deficits might not only result in difficulties labeling others' emotions
   but one's own emotions too, we suggest that empathy deficits might serve
   as potential trigger of emotion dysregulation. Different studies
   investigating the relation between empathy and emotion regulation are
   presented and discussed. Discussions are based on the assumed potential
   of empathy deficits triggering emotion dysregulation. Furthermore,
   developmental neuroscientific findings on empathy and emotion regulation
   are highlighted which provide further insights on how these processes
   might relate. Finally, possible directions for future research are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Animal models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are based on fear
   conditioning where innocuous cues elicit reactions that originally occur
   to traumatic events a core feature of PTSD. Another core feature is
   hyperarousal-exaggerated reactions to stressful events. One limitation
   of animal models of PTSD is that group effects do not model the sporadic
   incidence of PTSD. We developed an animal model of PTSD in which rabbit
   nictitating membrane responses become exaggerated as a function of
   classical conditioning to a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) paired with a
   shock unconditioned stimulus (US). Exaggerated responses to the US are a
   form of hyperarousal termed conditioning-specific reflex modification
   (CRM) and occur in the absence of the CS. Inspecting data across several
   experiments, we determined 25\% of our rabbits exhibit strong CRM
   despite all subjects having high levels of conditioning. To determine
   how prone rabbits were to CRM (susceptibility) or how resistant
   (resilience), we examined data from 135 rabbits analyzing for factors
   during CS-US pairings and during US prescreening that would predict CRM.
   We found the magnitude of CRM was correlated with the onset latency and
   area of conditioned responding during CS-US pairings and with the peak
   latency of a response during US pretesting. In an animal model of PTSD
   that more accurately reflects clinical prevalence, we can begin to
   predict susceptibility not only during responding to a stressful
   conditioning situation but also during a screening process before the
   stressful situation takes place. The results suggest relatively
   innocuous testing may help detect PTSD after trauma and screen for it
   before trauma occurs.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of methylphenidate (MPH), atomoxetine (ATMX), and/or
   physical exercise (EX) on orienting behavior and social interaction were
   examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), a commonly used
   animal model of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). During
   the orienting procedure, rats received repeated presentations of a
   nonreinforced visual stimulus. As observed previously, orienting
   behavior (rearing up on the hind legs) habituated across trials in
   normo-active control rats (Wistars) but not in SHRs, suggesting that
   SHRs have difficulty ignoring irrelevant behavioral stimuli. Treatment
   with MPH (0.125 mg/kg), ATMX (0.125 mg/kg), or EX (3 weeks of access to
   a running wheel), alone or in combination, reduced rearing behavior in
   SHRs to the level observed in the Wistar control group. Similarly, drug
   treatment and/or EX reduced the number of social interactions exhibited
   by SHRs, while having no effects on locomotor activity. It is important
   to note that EX was just as effective as MPH or ATMX in reducing
   orienting behavior and social interaction. In contrast to the SHRs,
   neither MPH nor ATMX affected orienting or social behavior in Wistar
   rats. Together, these findings support the growing literature that EX
   may be useful as an adjunctive or replacement therapy in ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{The prefrontal cortex has been identified as essential for executive
   function, as well as for aspects of rule learning and recognition
   memory. As part of our studies to assess prefrontal cortical function in
   the monkey, we evaluated the effects of damage to the dorsal prefrontal
   cortex (DPFC) on the Category Set Shifting Task (CSST), a test of
   abstraction and set-shifting, and on the Delayed Nonmatching to Sample
   (DNMS) task, a benchmark test of rule learning and recognition memory.
   The DPFC lesions in this study included dorsolateral and dorsomedial
   aspects of the PFC. In a previous report, we published evidence of an
   impairment on the CSST as a consequence of DPFC lesions (Moore,
   Schettler, Killiany, Rosene, \& Moss, 2009). Here we report that monkeys
   with lesions of the DPFC were also markedly impaired relative to
   controls on both the acquisition (rule learning) and performance
   (recognition memory) conditions of trial-unique DNMS. The presence and
   extent of the deficits that we observed were of some surprise and
   support the possibility that the dorsal prefrontal cortex plays a more
   direct role in learning and recognition memory than had been previously
   thought.}},

Volume = {{126}},

Abstract = {{The pattern of visual fixations on an image depends not only on the
   image content but also on the viewer's disposition and on the function
   (or pathology) of underlying neural circuitry. For example, human
   viewers display changes in viewing patterns toward face images that
   differ in gaze direction or in the viewer's familiarity with the face.
   Macaques share many face processing abilities with humans, and their
   neural circuitry is used to understand perception across species, yet
   their viewing responses to gaze and familiarity of faces is poorly
   understood. In this study, rhesus macaques passively viewed faces of
   familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics whose head-and-eye gaze was
   directed either toward or away from the viewing monkey. The eyes of
   faces were viewed more than any other feature; furthermore, familiar
   eyes were viewed more than unfamiliar eyes. In contrast, ears, though
   not as salient as eyes, were viewed about twice as often for unfamiliar
   faces as familiar faces. Directed-gaze eyes were fixated earlier, and
   for a greater proportion of saccades than were the eyes of averted-gaze
   faces, suggesting that mutual gaze attracts a more immediate and
   sustained scanning of the eyes. Ears and external features were more
   salient for averted, as compared with directed gaze. In general, effects
   were more robust (within and across subjects) for the gaze contrast than
   for familiarity, perhaps as a consequence of the greater image-based
   differences for the gaze than the familiarity stimuli used in this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging and studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (rTMS) have shown that a hierarchically organized neural
   network comprising the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the
   prefrontal cortex is involved when discriminating one's own face from
   other faces. Less clear, however, is the role of attention in self-other
   distinction. Accordingly, the present study aimed at investigating the
   role of the right TPJ in self-other and other-other discrimination by
   using low-frequency repetitive TMS while controlling for attention. We
   tested 10 healthy right-handed subjects using a video task, which
   comprised morphings of famous, unfamiliar, and the subjects' own faces
   that gradually transformed into each other. Reaction time (RT) was
   measured by pushing a mouse button once a change of identity was
   recognized. Subjects received rTMS over the right TPJ, sham stimulation,
   or no stimulation, separated by 1 week. rTMS over the right TPJ
   influenced the distinction between one's own and a famous face.
   Specifically, subjects needed more features to identify the famous face
   after rTMS to the right TPJ compared with the control conditions. No
   rTMS effect was observed when subjects had to distinguish between their
   own and unfamiliar faces, nor did rTMS affect attention. This suggests
   that the right TPJ is involved in self-other distinction, specifically
   if the other's face is familiar to the subject.}},

Abstract = {{Auditory streaming describes a percept in which a sequential series of
   sounds either is segregated into different streams or is integrated into
   one stream based on differences in their spectral or temporal
   characteristics. This phenomenon has been analyzed in human subjects
   (psychophysics) and European starlings (neurophysiology), presenting
   harmonic complex (HC) stimuli with different phase relations between
   their frequency components. Such stimuli allow evaluating streaming by
   temporal cues, as these stimuli only vary in the temporal waveform but
   have identical amplitude spectra. The present study applied the commonly
   used ABA- paradigm (van Noorden, 1975) and matched stimulus sets in
   psychophysics and neurophysiology to evaluate the effects of fundamental
   frequency (f(0)), frequency range (f(LowCutoff)). tone duration (TD),
   and tone repetition time (TRT) on streaming by phase relations of the HC
   stimuli. By comparing the percept of humans with rate or temporal
   responses of avian forebrain neurons, a neuronal correlate of perceptual
   streaming of HC stimuli is described. The differences in the pattern of
   the neurons' spike rate responses provide for a better explanation for
   the percept observed in humans than the differences in the temporal
   responses (i.e., the representation of the periodicity in the timing of
   the action potentials). Especially for HC stimuli with a short 40-ms
   duration, the differences in the pattern of the neurons' temporal
   responses failed to represent the patterns of human perception, whereas
   the neurons' rate responses showed a good match. These results suggest
   that differential rate responses are a better predictor for auditory
   streaming by phase relations than temporal responses.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple phases of protein synthesis are necessary for the synaptic
   modifications that consolidate long-term memory. The reconsolidation
   hypothesis supposes that information in long-term memory becomes labile
   and subject to change when retrieved and must be reconsolidated into
   long-term memory. The current study used the protein synthesis inhibitor
   anisomycin to examine memory consolidation in birds and to test the
   reconsolidation hypothesis. Black-capped chickadees store food and
   usually remember which of their caches they have emptied and which they
   have left full. In Experiment 1, anisomycin was injected either
   immediately and 2 hr after food caching, or 4 and 6 hr after food
   caching. Inhibition of protein synthesis impaired memory for cache sites
   24 and 48 hr later. In Experiment 2, it was hypothesized that long-term
   memory for food caches becomes labile as predicted by the
   reconsolidation hypothesis when birds search for caches. Anisotnycin was
   administered immediately after chickadees had searched for their caches.
   Inhibition of protein synthesis should disrupt memory for caches left
   full if these sites are retrieved from long-term memory and require
   reconsolidation. Control birds were later more likely to revisit full
   caches than caches they had emptied. Birds given anisomycin revisited
   both kinds of caches and did not distinguish between them. This result
   shows that reconsolidation of full caches into long-term memory is not
   necessary following search for cache sites, but also shows that protein
   synthesis-dependent consolidation is required for updating the status of
   emptied caches.}},

Abstract = {{Retrieval practice is a powerful memory enhancer. However, in
   educational settings, test taking is often experienced as a stressful
   event. While it is known that stress can impair retrieval processes,
   little is known about the delayed consequences of testing memory for
   educationally relevant material under stressful conditions, which is the
   focus of the present study. Participants (38 women, 37 men) memorized a
   scientific text passage on Day 1. On Day 2, they were either exposed to
   a stressor (cold pressor test; CPS) or a warm water control, and
   immediately afterward, they were asked to recall the text passage (i.e.,
   retrieval under stress vs. control). Salivary cortisol was measured as
   an index of the stress response before, and 20 min after the CPS versus
   control treatment. The delayed effects of testing under stress were
   assessed with a final recall test on Day 3. In comparison to the control
   condition, CPS caused significant increases in salivary cortisol, and,
   surprisingly resulted in enhanced memory in men. Importantly, this
   enhancement was not only observed in the test that immediately followed
   the stressor, but also in the delayed test. In women, CPS caused only
   marginal increases in cortisol concentrations, and retrieval remained
   unaffected. Our study suggests that moderate stress can improve memory
   performance for educationally relevant material in a long-lasting manner
   in healthy young men.}},

Abstract = {{Immediate early genes (IEG) are presumed to be activated in response to
   stress, novelty, and learning. Evidence supports the involvement of
   prefrontal and hippocampal areas in stress and learning, but also in the
   detection of novel events. This study examined whether a previous
   experience with shocks changes the pattern of Fos and Egr-1 expression
   in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the hippocampal cornus ammonis 1
   (CA1), and dentate gyrus (DG) of adult male Wistar rats that learned to
   escape in an operant aversive test. Subjects previously exposed to
   inescapable footshocks that learned to escape from Shocks were assigned
   to the treated group (EXP). Subjects from Group Novelty (NOV) rested
   undisturbed during treatment and also learned to escape in the test. The
   nonshock group (NSH) rested undisturbed in both sessions. Standard
   immunohistochemistry procedures were used to detect the proteins in
   brain sections. The results show that a previous experience with shocks
   changed the pattern of IEG expression, then demonstrating c-fos and
   egr-1 induction as experience-dependent events. Compared with NSH and
   EXP an enhanced Fos expression was detected in the mPFC and CA1 subfield
   of Group NOV, which also exhibited increased Egr-1 expression in the
   mPFC and DG in comparison to NSH. No differences were found in the DG
   for Fos, or in the CA1 for Egr-1. Novelty, and not the operant aversive
   escape learning, seems to have generated IEG induction. The results
   suggest novel stimuli as a possible confounding factor in studies on Fos
   and/or Egr-1 expression in aversive conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Many different species of animals including mole rats, pigeons, and sea
   turtles are thought to use the magnetic field of the earth for
   navigational guidance. While laboratory rats are commonly used for
   navigational research, and brain networks have been described in these
   animals that presumably mediate accurate spatial navigation, little has
   been done to determine the role of the geomagnetic field in these brain
   networks and in the navigational behavior of these animals. In
   Experiment 1, anterior thalamic head direction (HD) cells were recorded
   in female Long-Evans rats while they foraged in an environment subjected
   to an experimentally generated magnetic field of earth-strength
   intensity, the polarity of which could be shifted from one session to
   another. Despite previous work that has shown that the preferred
   direction of HD cells can be controlled by the position of familiar
   landmarks in a recording environment, the directional signal of HD cells
   was not influenced by the polarity of the magnetic field in the
   enclosure. Because this finding could be attributed to the animal being
   insensitive or inattentive to the magnetic field, in Experiment 2, rats
   were trained in a choice maze task dependent on the ability of the
   animals to sense the polarity of the experimentally controlled magnetic
   field. Over the course of 28 days of training, performance failed to
   improve to a level above chance, providing evidence that the spatial
   behavior of laboratory rats (and the associated HD network) is
   insensitive to the polarity of the geomagnetic field.}},

Abstract = {{In humans, hemispheric language dominance is, to some degree, associated
   with handedness. Significant associations have been reported between
   several other lateralized functions. Much less is known about the
   organization of cerebral asymmetries in nonhuman species and, in
   particular, whether the presence of reversed asymmetry of one function
   is associated with a reversal of other lateralized functions or,
   instead, if cognitive functions lateralize independently. In this study,
   we compare four measures of sensory and motor laterality in the same
   individuals in a sample of goldbelly topminnows. A significant
   association was found between two measures of eye preference and two
   measures of motor laterality, but sensory and motor asymmetries were
   uncorrelated. We found interesting that individuals preferring to
   examine a predator with the right eye tended to use the left eye to look
   at a shoal mate and the reverse was true for fish that monitored
   predators with the left eye. This complementarity of functions could be
   adaptively advantageous for a small social fish, because it allows an
   individual to monitor the movements of its shoal mates with one eye as
   the other eye remains free to scan the surroundings for the presence of
   predators.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reports demonstrate that the beneficial effects of voluntary
   exercise may be sensitive to stress prior to and during the wheel access
   period. Here, a variate stress procedure is used with socially isolated
   mice for 7 days prior to the introduction of running wheels to assess
   the impact of prior and concurrent stress on the anxiolytic effect of
   exercise. Following stress exposure, functioning or nonfunctioning
   running wheels were introduced into stressed and unstressed group-housed
   control cages. Following 3 weeks of wheel access, the anxiolytic effect
   of exercise was assessed using acoustic startle, stress-induced
   hyperthermia, and a challenge with the anxiogenic drug
   metachlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP). Variate stress was demonstrated to
   interfere with normal weight gain. Further, exercise was not anxiolytic
   in stressed mice. Consistent with previous reports unstressed exercising
   mice demonstrated reduced acoustic startle, attenuated stress induced
   hyperthermia, and a blunted increase in startle following mCPP
   administration when compared with unstressed sedentary controls.
   Stressed exercising mice were indistinguishable from stressed sedentary
   and unstressed sedentary controls on each anxiety measure. Although
   running distance varied between individual mice, the distance run did
   not predict the level of anxiety on any measure. These findings suggest
   that prior and ongoing stress delays or prevents the anxiolytic effect
   of exercise without affecting exercise itself.}},

Abstract = {{Studies investigating theory of mind (ToM) abilities (i.e. ability to
   understand and predict others' mental states) have revealed that
   affective and cognitive functions play a significant role and that each
   of those functions are associated with distinct neural networks.
   Cognitive facets of ToM have implicated the medial prefrontal cortex,
   temporo-parietal junction and the anterior paracingulate cortex, whereas
   affective facets have implicated the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC). Although the vmPFC has repeatedly shown to be critical for
   affective functions, knowledge regarding the exact role of the left and
   right vmPFC in affective ToM is still obscure. Here, we compared
   performances of 30 patients with left, right and bilateral vmPFC lesions
   to two comparison groups (one without and one with brain injuries) on
   the Faux Pas Recognition task measuring the facets of ToM. We also
   investigated whether any deficits may be associated with other emotional
   measures, namely emotional empathy and emotional intelligence. Our
   results extend earlier findings by showing that the vmPFC is associated
   with abilities in affective ToM. More importantly, our results revealed
   that the left, and not the right vmPFC as indicated previously, is

Abstract = {{When making a decision, humans often have to `coordinate'-reach the same
   conclusion-as another individual without explicitly communicating.
   Relatively, little is known about the neural basis for coordination.
   Moreover, previous fMRI investigations have supported conflicting
   hypotheses. One account proposes that individuals coordinate using a
   `gut feeling' and that this is supported by insula recruitment. Another
   account proposes that individuals recruit strategic decision-making
   mechanisms in prefrontal cortex in order to coordinate. We investigate
   the neural basis for coordination in individuals with behavioral-variant
   frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) who have limitations in social
   decision-making associated with disease in prefrontal cortex. We
   demonstrate that bvFTD are impaired at establishing a focal point in a
   semantic task (e.g. `Tell me any boy's name') that requires coordination
   relative to a similar, control semantic task that does not.
   Additionally, coordination limitations in bvFTD are related to cortical
   thinning in prefrontal cortex. These findings are consistent with
   behavioral economic models proposing that, beyond a `gut feeling',
   strategic decision-making contributes to the coordination process,
   including a probabilistic mechanism that evaluates the salience of a
   response (e.g. is `John' a frequent boy's name), a hierarchical
   mechanism that iteratively models an opponent's likely response and a
   mechanism involved in social perspective taking.}},

Abstract = {{Ordinary people make moral judgments that are consistent with
   philosophical and legal principles. Do those judgments derive from the
   controlled application of principles, or do the principles derive from
   automatic judgments? As a case study, we explore the tendency to judge
   harmful actions morally worse than harmful omissions (the `omission
   effect') using fMRI. Because ordinary people readily and spontaneously
   articulate this moral distinction it has been suggested that principled
   reasoning may drive subsequent judgments. If so, people who exhibit the
   largest omission effect should exhibit the greatest activation in
   regions associated with controlled cognition. Yet, we observed the
   opposite relationship: activation in the frontoparietal control network
   was associated with condemning harmful omissions-that is, with
   overriding the omission effect. These data suggest that the omission
   effect arises automatically, without the application of controlled
   cognition. However, controlled cognition is apparently used to overcome
   automatic judgment processes in order to condemn harmful omissions.}},

Abstract = {{Insecure attachment has been linked to depression and to outcome in
   psychotherapy. The neural mechanisms subserving the relationship between
   attachment security and depression are not well understood. We have
   developed a method to examine attachment-related brain activity in
   depression. Twenty-eight women, half depressed, viewed images of their
   mother, a female friend, and female strangers during fMRI scanning. The
   effects of depression and insecure attachment were determined with
   whole-brain multiple linear regression of blood-oxygen-level-dependent
   response against subjects' Beck Depression Inventory and Adult
   Attachment Interview (AAI) coherence of mind scores. Interaction effects
   were analyzed with ANOVA. Activity associated with depression and with
   insecure attachment was found in the cortico-striato-thalamic circuits
   of affect regulation. For early attachment (mother-friend contrast),
   depression scores correlated with activation of cortical and
   sub-cortical components of these circuits, while attachment insecurity
   correlated with sub-cortical activity in the same circuitry. Depression
   and attachment insecurity correlated with both cortical and sub-cortical
   activities for mother-stranger, and areas of overlap and of enhancing
   interactions between depression and insecure attachment were found. For
   late attachment (friend-stranger contrast), only cortical effects were
   found. Depression and attachment insecurity may be subserved by similar
   but distinct components of affect regulating circuits. Their
   interactions may explain the greater difficulty of treating depression
   in insecurely attached patients and suggest a contributing role for
   insecure attachment in depression. Further, differential sub-cortical vs
   cortical encoding of early vs late attachment suggests a top-down model
   of late attachment, potentially relevant to psychotherapeutic outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The neural bases of empathy have been examined mainly in the context of

   the mechanisms by which we share others' joy. Using functional magnetic

   judgment of the emotional state of the other in response to both
   negative and positive events through empathy-related structures, such as
   the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the insula, the superior temporal
   sulcus (STS) and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, the
   responses of the MPFC, bilateral insula and the right IFG to negative
   experiences occurring to the other (but not to the self) were found to
   be much more intense than the responses to positive experiences,
   indicating that humans have a remarkable ability to share the distress
   of others, but may react less to the joy of others.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging research has demonstrated the involvement of a well-defined
   brain network in the mediation of moral judgment in normal population,
   and has suggested the inappropriate network use in criminal psychopathy.
   We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to prove that
   alterations in the brain network subserving moral judgment in criminal
   psychopaths are not limited to the inadequate network use during moral
   judgment, but that a primary network breakdown would exist with
   dysfunctional alterations outside moral dilemma situations. A total of
   22 criminal psychopathic men and 22 control subjects were assessed and
   fMRI maps were generated to identify (i) brain response to moral
   dilemmas, (ii) task-induced deactivation of the network during a
   conventional cognitive task and (iii) the strength of functional
   connectivity within the network during resting-state. The obtained
   functional brain maps indeed confirmed that the network subserving moral
   judgment is underactive in psychopathic individuals during moral dilemma
   situations, but the data also provided evidence of a baseline network
   alteration outside moral contexts with a functional disconnection
   between emotional and cognitive elements that jointly construct moral
   judgment. The finding may have significant social implications if
   considering psychopathic behavior to be a result of a primary breakdown
   in basic brain systems.}},

   39 participants (20 women) as they were exposed to supraliminal vs
   subliminal sexual stimuli. Supraliminal exposure was associated with
   greater activation in areas that were previously associated with sexual
   arousal (e.g. caudate nucleus and thalamus) as well as areas that were
   previously associated with control (e.g. orbitofrontal cortex and
   cingulate cortex). In contrast, subliminal exposure was mainly related
   to activation in areas previously associated with sexual arousal. Men
   and women exhibited theoretically meaningful differences in patterns of
   activation associated with supra- and subliminal exposure. Findings are
   discussed with regard to sexual arousal and regulatory processes.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the fMRI correlates of observers making trait
   inferences about other people under conflicting social cues.
   Participants were presented with several behavioral descriptions
   involving an agent that implied a particular trait. The last behavior
   was either consistent or inconsistent with the previously implied trait.
   This was done under instructions that elicited either spontaneous trait
   inferences ('read carefully') or intentional trait inferences ('infer a
   trait'). The results revealed that when the behavioral descriptions
   violated earlier trait implications, regardless of instruction, the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was more strongly recruited as well as
   the domain-general conflict network including the posterior medial
   frontal cortex (pmFC) and the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC). These
   latter two areas were more strongly activated under intentional than
   spontaneous instructions. These findings suggest that when
   trait-relevant behavioral information is inconsistent, not only is
   activity increased in the mentalizing network responsible for trait
   processing, but control is also passed to a higher level conflict
   monitoring network in order to detect and resolve the contradiction.}},

Abstract = {{Infant crying can elicit sensitive caregiving as well as hostility and
   harsh parenting responses. In the current study (N = 42 females) with a
   double-blind experimental design, we tested the effect of intranasal
   oxytocin administration on the use of excessive force using a hand-grip
   dynamometer during listening to infant cry sounds. Participants'
   experiences with harsh parental discipline during childhood were found
   to moderate the effect of oxytocin administration on the use of
   excessive force. Participants' whose parents did not discipline them
   harshly used less excessive force in the oxytocin condition, but for
   participants who were disciplined harshly there was no difference
   between the oxytocin and placebo condition. Such effects were not found
   during listening to infant laughter. We conclude that early caregiving
   experiences constitute an important moderator of the prosocial and/or
   stress-reducing effects of oxytocin. Oxytocin administration may
   increase trust and cooperation in individuals with supportive
   backgrounds, but not generate this effect in individuals who as a
   consequence of unfavorable early caregiving experiences may have a bias
   toward negative interpretation of social cues.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathy, a developmental disorder characterized by profound social
   disturbance, is associated with impaired recognition of distress cues.
   Since distress processing and moral socialization are closely linked,
   uncovering techniques to improve distress recognition could have
   positive treatment implications for developmental disorders that feature
   empathy impairments. Previous studies demonstrate that fear-recognition
   deficits can be remedied by redirecting attention to critical cues (the
   eyes for fearful faces). However, it remains unclear whether this
   manipulation increases activity in empathy-related brain regions, or has
   an alternate compensatory effect that may not promote prosocial
   behaviours. In this fMRI study, a community sample of individuals with
   high vs low callous traits completed an emotion recognition task that
   varied whether the most or least socially meaningful facial features
   were visible (the eyes were isolated or occluded). For fearful faces,
   individuals with high callous traits showed significantly less amygdala
   and medial prefrontal cortex activity than those with low callous traits
   when the eyes were occluded, but not when they were isolated. Consistent
   with recent models of the amygdala that emphasize orientation to
   disambiguate stimuli rather than represent distress, individuals with
   low trait empathy showed greater amygdala activity to the least vs most
   socially meaningful features of fearful faces.}},

Abstract = {{This study tested whether mothers with interpersonal violence-related

   children (12-42 months) participated: 11 IPV-PTSD mothers and 9 HC with
   no PTSD. During fMRI, mothers watched epochs of play and separation from
   their own and unfamiliar children. The study focused on comparison of
   PTSD mothers vs HC viewing children in separation vs play, and viewing
   own vs unfamiliar children in separation. Both groups showed distinct
   patterns of brain activation in response to viewing children in
   separation vs play. PTSD mothers showed greater limbic and less
   frontocortical activity (BA10) than HC. PTSD mothers also reported
   feeling more stressed than HC when watching own and unfamiliar children
   during separation. Their self-reported stress was associated with
   greater limbic and less frontocortical activity. Both groups also showed
   distinct patterns of brain activation in response to viewing their own

Abstract = {{Repression designates coping strategies such as avoidance, or denial
   that aim to shield the organism from threatening stimuli. Derakshan et
   al. have proposed the vigilance-avoidance theory of repressive coping.
   It is assumed that repressors have an initial rapid vigilant response
   triggering physiological responses to threat stimuli. In the following
   second stage repressors manifest avoidant cognitive biases. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging at 3T was used to study neural correlates of
   repressive coping during the first stages of perception of threat.
   Pictures of human faces bearing fearful, angry, happy and neutral
   expressions were briefly presented masked by neutral faces. Forty study
   participants (20 repressive and 20 sensitizing individuals) were
   selected from a sample of 150 female students on the basis of their
   scores on the Mainz Coping Inventory. Repressors exhibited stronger
   neural activation than sensitizers primarily in response to masked
   threatening faces (vs neutral baseline) in the frontal, parietal and
   temporal cortex as well as in the cingulate gyrus, basal ganglia and
   insula. There was no brain region in which sensitizers showed increased
   activation to emotion expression compared to repressors. The present
   results are in line with the vigilance-avoidance theory which predicts
   heightened automatic responsivity to threatening stimuli in repression.}},

Abstract = {{Wishful thinking (WT) implies the overestimation of the likelihood of
   desirable events. It occurs for outcomes of personal interest, but also
   for events of interest to others we like. We investigated whether WT is
   grounded on low-level selective attention or on higher level cognitive
   processes including differential weighting of evidence or response
   formation. Participants in our MRI study predicted the likelihood that
   their favorite or least favorite team would win a football game.
   Consistent with expectations, favorite team trials were characterized by
   higher winning odds. Our data demonstrated activity in a cluster
   comprising parts of the left inferior occipital and fusiform gyri to
   distinguish between favorite and least favorite team trials. More
   importantly, functional connectivities of this cluster with the human
   reward system were specifically involved in the type of WT investigated
   in our study, thus supporting the idea of an attention bias generating
   WT. Prefrontal cortex activity also distinguished between the two teams.
   However, activity in this region and its functional connectivities with
   the human reward system were altogether unrelated to the degree of WT
   reflected in the participants' behavior and may rather be related to
   social identification, ensuring the affective context necessary for WT
   to arise.}},

Abstract = {{Classic social psychology studies demonstrate that people can behave in
   ways that contradict their intentions-especially within the moral
   domain. We measured brain activity while subjects decided between
   financial self-benefit (earning money) and preventing physical harm
   (applying an electric shock) to a confederate under both real and
   hypothetical conditions. We found a shared neural network associated
   with empathic concern for both types of decisions. However, hypothetical
   and real moral decisions also recruited distinct neural circuitry:
   hypothetical moral decisions mapped closely onto the imagination
   network, while real moral decisions elicited activity in the bilateral
   amygdala and anterior cingulate-areas essential for social and affective
   processes. Moreover, during real moral decision-making, distinct regions
   of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) determined whether subjects make selfish
   or pro-social moral choices. Together, these results reveal not only
   differential neural mechanisms for real and hypothetical moral decisions
   but also that the nature of real moral decisions can be predicted by
   dissociable networks within the PFC.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural findings have led to proposals that difficulties in
   attention and concentration in depression may have their roots in
   fundamental inhibitory impairments for irrelevant information. These
   impairments may be associated with reduced capacity to actively maintain
   relevant information to facilitate goadirected behaviour. In light of
   mixed data from behavioural studies, the current study using direct
   neural measurement, examines whether dysphoric individuals show poor
   filtering of irrelevant information and reduced working memory (WM)
   capacity for relevant information. Consistent with previous research, a
   sustained evenrelated potential (ERP) asymmetry, termed contralateral
   delay activity (CDA), was observed to be sensitive to WM capacity and
   the efficient filtering of irrelevant information from visual WM. We
   found a strong positive correlation between the efficiency of filtering
   irrelevant items and visual WM capacity. Specifically, dysphoric
   participants were poor at filtering irrelevant information, and showed
   reduced WM capacity relative to high capacity non-dysphoric
   participants. Results support the hypothesis that impaired inhibition is
   a central feature of dysphoria and are discussed within the framework of
   cognitive and neurophysiological models of depression.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic knowledge refers to the information that people have about
   categories of objects and living things. Social psychologists have long
   debated whether the information that perceivers have about categories of
   people-i.e. stereotypes-may be a unique form of semantics. Here, we
   examine this question against well-established findings regarding the
   neural basis of semantics, which suggest that two brain regions-left
   inferior frontal gyrus and inferotemporal cortex-are critical for
   general semantic knowledge. During functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, participants answered questions about their knowledge of both
   non-social and social categories. We reasoned that if stereotypes are a
   typical form of semantic knowledge, then these same regions should
   subserve the activation and retrieval of stereotypes. Inconsistent with
   this possibility, left inferior frontal gyrus and inferotemporal cortex
   were activated only during non-social category judgments. Instead,
   judgments of social categories were associated with regions frequently
   linked to social cognition, including medial prefrontal cortex,
   posterior cingulate, bilateral temporoparietal junction and anterior
   temporal cortex. Together, these results suggest that social stereotypes
   should be considered distinct from other forms of semantic knowledge,
   and may have more in common with representing mental states than
   retrieving semantic knowledge about objects and non-human living things.}},

Abstract = {{Priming negative stereotypes of African Americans can bias perceptions
   toward novel Black targets, but less is known about how these
   perceptions ultimately arise. Examining how neural regions involved in
   arousal, inhibition and control covary when negative stereotypes are
   activated can provide insight into whether individuals attempt to
   downregulate biases. Using fMRI, White egalitarian-motivated
   participants were shown Black and White faces at fast (32 ms) or slow
   (525 ms) presentation speeds. To create a racially negative stereotypic
   context, participants listened to violent and misogynistic rap (VMR) in
   the background. No music (NM) and death metal (DM) were used as control
   conditions in separate blocks. Fast exposure of Black faces elicited
   amygdala activation in the NM and VMR conditions (but not DM), that also
   negatively covaried with activation in prefrontal regions. Only in VMR,
   however, did amygdala activation for Black faces persist during slow
   exposure and positively covary with activation in dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex while negatively covarying with activation in
   orbitofrontal cortex. Findings suggest that contexts that prime negative
   racial stereotypes seem to hinder the downregulation of amygdala
   activation that typically occurs when egalitarian perceivers are exposed
   to Black faces.}},

Abstract = {{Most choices are complex and can be considered from a number of
   different perspectives. For example, someone choosing a snack may have
   taste, health, cost or any number of factors at the forefront of their
   mind. Although previous research has examined neural systems related to
   value and choice, very little is known about how mindset influences
   these systems. In the current study, participants were primed with
   Health or Taste while they made decisions about snack foods. Some neural
   regions showed consistent associations with value and choice across
   Health or Taste mindsets. Regardless of mindset, medial orbitofrontal
   cortex (MOFC) tracked value in terms of taste, regions in left lateral
   prefrontal cortex (LPFC) tracked value in terms of health, and MOFC and
   dorsal anterior cingulate were associated with choice. However, activity
   in other neural regions was modulated by the mindset manipulation. When
   primed with Taste, rostral anterior cingulate tracked value in terms of
   taste whereas left amygdala and left putamen were associated with
   choice. When primed with Health, right LPFC and posterior MOFC tracked
   value in terms of health. The findings contribute to the neural research
   on decision-making by demonstrating that changing perspectives can
   modulate value- and choice-related neural activity.}},

Abstract = {{Prior neuroimaging and electrophysiological evidence suggests that
   potentiated responses in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
   particularly the rostral ACC, may contribute to abnormal responses to
   negative feedback in individuals with elevated negative affect and
   depressive symptoms. The feedback-related negativity (FRN) represents an
   electrophysiological index of ACC-related activation in response to
   performance feedback. The purpose of the present study was to examine
   the FRN and underlying ACC activation using low resolution
   electromagnetic tomography source estimation techniques in relation to
   negative emotionality (a composite index including negative affect and
   subclinical depressive symptoms). To this end, 29 healthy adults
   performed a monetary incentive delay task while 128-channel
   event-related potentials were recorded. We found that enhanced FRNs and
   increased rostral ACC activation in response to negative-but not
   positive-feedback was related to greater negative emotionality. These
   results indicate that individual differences in negative emotionality-a
   putative risk factor for emotional disorders-modulate ACC-related
   processes critically implicated in assessing the motivational impact
   and/or salience of environmental feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Imitation is an important component of human social learning throughout
   life. Theoretical models and empirical data from anthropology and
   psychology suggest that people tend to imitate self-similar individuals,
   and that such imitation biases increase the adaptive value (e.g.,
   self-relevance) of learned information. It is unclear, however, what
   neural mechanisms underlie people's tendency to imitate those similar to
   themselves. We focused on the own-gender imitation bias, a pervasive
   bias thought to be important for gender identity development. While
   undergoing fMRI, participants imitated own- and other-gender actors
   performing novel, meaningless hand signs; as control conditions, they
   also simply observed such actions and viewed still portraits of the same
   actors. Only the ventral and dorsal striatum, orbitofrontal cortex and
   amygdala were more active when imitating own- compared to other-gender
   individuals. A Bayesian analysis of the BrainMap neuroimaging database
   demonstrated that the striatal region preferentially activated by
   own-gender imitation is selectively activated by classical reward tasks
   in the literature. Taken together, these findings reveal a
   neurobiological mechanism associated with the own-gender imitation bias
   and demonstrate a novel role of reward-processing neural structures in
   social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Extraversion is considered one of the core traits of personality. Low
   extraversion has been associated with increased vulnerability to
   affective and anxiety disorders. Brain imaging studies have linked
   extraversion, approach behaviour and the production of positive
   emotional states to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and
   glutamatergic neurotransmission. However, the relationship between
   extraversion and glutamate in the DLPFC has not been investigated so
   far. In order to address this issue, absolute glutamate concentrations
   in the DLPFC and the visual cortex as a control region were measured by
   3-Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in 29 subjects
   with high and low extraversion. We found increased glutamate levels in
   the DLPFC of introverts as compared with extraverts. The increased
   glutamate concentration was specific for the DLPFC and negatively
   associated with state anxiety. Although preliminary, results indicate
   altered top-down control of DLPFC due to reduced glutamate concentration
   as a function of extraversion. Glutamate measurement with 1H-MRS may
   facilitate the understanding of biological underpinnings of personality
   traits and psychiatric diseases associated with dysfunctions in approach
   behaviour and the production of positive emotional states.}},

Abstract = {{In emotional learning tasks, sex differences, stress effects and an
   interaction of these two moderators have often been observed. The sex
   hormones estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) vary over the menstrual
   cycle. We tested groups with different sex hormone status: 39 men, 30
   women in the luteal phase (LU, high E2+P4) and 29 women taking oral
   contraceptives (OC, low E2+P4). They received either 30 mg cortisol or
   placebo prior to instructed differential fear conditioning consisting of
   neutral conditioned stimuli (CS) and an electrical stimulation
   (unconditioned stimulus; UCS). One figure (CS+) was paired with the UCS,
   the other figure (CS-) never. During extinction, no electrical
   stimulation was administered. Regarding fear acquisition, results showed
   higher skin conductance and higher brain responses to the CS+ compared
   to the CS- in several structures that were not modulated by cortisol or
   sex hormones. However, OC women exhibited higher CS+/CS-
   differentiations than men and LU women in the amygdala, thalamus,
   anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during extinction.
   The suppression of endogenous sex hormones by OC seems to alter neuronal
   correlates of extinction. The observation that extinction is influenced
   by the current sex hormone availability is relevant for future studies
   and might also be clinically important.}},

Abstract = {{Caffeine, an adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor antagonist, is the most
   popular psychostimulant drug in the world, but it is also anxiogenic.
   The neural correlates of caffeine-induced anxiety are currently unknown.
   This study investigated the effects of caffeine on brain regions
   implicated in social threat processing and anxiety. Participants were 14
   healthy male non/infrequent caffeine consumers. In a double-blind
   placebo-controlled crossover design, they underwent blood oxygenation
   level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while
   performing an emotional face processing task 1 h after receiving
   caffeine (250 mg) or placebo in two fMRI sessions (counterbalanced,
   1-week washout). They rated anxiety and mental alertness, and their
   blood pressure was measured, before and 2 h after treatment. Results
   showed that caffeine induced threat-related (angry/fearful faces > happy
   faces) midbrain-periaqueductal gray activation and abolished
   threat-related medial prefrontal cortex wall activation. Effects of
   caffeine on extent of threat-related amygdala activation correlated
   negatively with level of dietary caffeine intake. In concurrence with
   these changes in threat-related brain activation, caffeine increased
   self-rated anxiety and diastolic blood pressure. Caffeine did not affect
   primary visual cortex activation. These results are the first to
   demonstrate potential neural correlates of the anxiogenic effect of
   caffeine, and they implicate the amygdala as a key site for caffeine
   tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{It has long been argued that attitudes prepare the body to act. While
   early evidence suggested that evaluations (positive or negative) are
   rigidly linked to specific motor behaviors (approach or avoidant),
   recent behavioral evidence suggests that this linkage is context
   dependent. Here, we report that the neural circuitry mediating the
   relationship between evaluations and motor responses promotes
   flexibility in our embodiment of attitudes. In a behavioral study,
   stimulus-response relationships between evaluations and actions were
   rapidly conditioned. In a neuroimaging (functional magnetic resonance
   imaging) study, repetition suppression demonstrated that these
   relationships are formed in neural systems traditionally implicated in
   arbitrary sensorimotor mappings (i.e. the dorsal premotor cortex and
   posterior superior parietal lobule). These data provide the first
   neurophysiological evidence for attitude embodiment and demonstrate that
   relationships between evaluation and action are inherently malleable.}},

Abstract = {{Asymmetrical patterns of frontal cortical activity have been implicated
   in the development and expression of aggressive behavior. Along with
   individual motivational tendencies, the ability to restrain one's
   impulses might be a factor in aggressive behavior. Recently, a role for
   the inhibitory cortical beta rhythm was suggested. The present study
   investigated whether individual differences in resting state asymmetries
   in the beta frequency band were associated with trait aggression and
   behavioral inhibition. In addition, the selective contributions of the
   prefrontal and motor cortex areas to these associations were examined.
   Results showed that relative dominant right frontal beta frequency
   activity was associated with both heightened trait aggression,
   especially hostility, and reduced response inhibition. Moreover,
   asymmetries over the anterior electrode locations proved to be related
   most closely to trait aggression, while asymmetries over the central
   electrode locations were associated with response inhibition. Together
   these findings show that right-dominant frontal beta activity is
   positively associated with aggressive tendencies and reduced behavioral
   inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of personality on the neural correlates of emotional
   processing is still not well characterized. We investigated the
   relationship between extraversion and neuroticism and emotional
   perception using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a group
   of 23 young, healthy women. Using a parametric modulation approach, we
   examined how the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal varied
   with the participants' ratings of arousal and valence, and whether
   levels of extraversion and neuroticism were related to these
   modulations. In particular, we wished to test Eysenck's biological
   theory of personality, which links high extraversion to lower levels of
   reticulothalamic-cortical arousal, and neuroticism to increased
   reactivity of the limbic system and stronger reactions to emotional
   arousal. Individuals high in neuroticism demonstrated reduced sustained
   activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and attenuated valence
   processing in the right temporal lobe while viewing emotional images,
   but an increased BOLD response to emotional arousal in the right medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These results support Eysenck's theory, as
   well as our hypothesis that high levels of neuroticism are associated
   with attenuated reward processing. Extraversion was inversely related to
   arousal processing in the right cerebellum, but positively associated
   with arousal processing in the right insula, indicating that the
   relationship between extraversion and arousal is not as simple as that
   proposed by Eysenck.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic stress leads to neurochemical and structural alterations in the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) that correspond to deficits in PFC-mediated
   behaviors. The present study examined the effects of chronic restraint
   stress on response inhibition (using a response-withholding task, the
   fixed-minimum interval schedule of reinforcement, or FMI), and working
   memory (using a radial arm water maze, RAWM). Adult male Sprague Dawley
   rats were first trained on the RAWM and subsequently trained on FMI.
   After acquisition of FMI, rats were assigned to a restraint stress
   (6h/d/28d in wire mesh restrainers) or control condition. Immediately
   after chronic stress, rats were tested on FMI and subsequently on RAWM.
   FMI results suggest that chronic stress reduces response inhibition
   capacity and motivation to initiate the task on selective conditions
   when sucrose reward was not obtained on the preceding trial. RAWM
   results suggest that chronic stress produces transient deficits in
   working memory without altering previously consolidated reference
   memory. Behavioral measures from FMI failed to correlate with metrics
   from RAWM except for one in which changes in FMI timing imprecision
   negatively correlated with changes in RAWM working memory errors for the
   controls, a finding that was not observed following chronic stress.
   Fisher's r-to-z transformation revealed no significant differences
   between control and stress groups with correlation coefficients. These
   findings are the first to show that chronic stress impairs both response
   inhibition and working memory, two behaviors that have never been
   directly compared within the same animals after chronic stress, using
   FMI, an appetitive task, and RAWM, a nonappetitive task.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{620-639}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{An inverted-U mechanism has been proposed to explain findings that both
   under- and overstimulation of dopamine (DA) receptors in medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) result in working memory impairments. Dopamine
   release in the mPFC is also associated with the mediation of other
   behavioral processes such as affective regulation, reward, and
   nociception. The present studies investigated mPFC DA dose-dependent
   effects on the performance of tasks that tap these other processes,
   including delayed alternation in the T maze for working memory, a water
   maze task for escape, the elevated plus maze for anxiolytic/anxiogenic
   effects, place preference conditioning for reward effects, the tail
   flick test for nociception, and a measure of locomotor activity for
   general arousal. Injection of 5 mu g of DA improved working memory, was
   anxiolytic in the plus maze, and increased pain sensitivity, but did not
   have any effects on water maze escape, place preference or locomotor
   activity. Doses of 10 mu g and 20 mu g impaired working memory and
   substantially decreased pain sensitivity, but did not affect plus maze
   behavior or locomotor activity. The 20-mu g dose also enhanced water
   maze escape. Taken together, these findings suggest a profile of two
   distinct behavioral states induced by low or high levels of mPFC DA: a
   low level facilitates foraging functions such as working memory and
   exploratory behaviors, with increased pain sensitivity, while higher
   levels facilitate stress-related adaptations, such as escape from threat
   and reduced pain sensitivity. These findings are concordant with
   behavioral flexibility views of mPFC DA functions.}},

Title = {{Repeated Fluoxetine Administration During Adolescence Stimulates
   Aggressive Behavior and Alters Serotonin and Vasopressin Neural

Abstract = {{Fluoxetine is the only selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor registered
   for the treatment of major depressive disorder in pediatric populations,
   despite reports that it is disproportionately associated with an array
   of adverse side effects that include agitation, hostility, and overt
   acts of pathological aggression and violence in youth. This study
   examined the effects of repeated adolescent fluoxetine administration on
   offensive aggression and the development of the serotonin (5HT) and
   vasopressin (AVP) neural systems modulating this behavior using pubertal
   Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) as an adolescent-animal model.
   Adolescent hamsters administered fluoxetine were tested for offensive
   aggression using the resident/intruder test, sacrificed the following
   day, and, using immunohistochemistry, examined for 5HT and AVP afferent
   innervation/development to areas of the brain implicated in aggression
   control. Repeated exposure to a low dose (0.3 mg/kg/day) of fluoxetine
   during adolescence increased nearly all measures of offensive aggression
   (i.e., upright offensive attacks, lateral attacks, flank/rump bites,
   pursuits, flank marks), whereas measures of social interest (i.e.,
   olfactory investigation, contact time), comfort (i.e., grooming), and
   locomotion (i.e., contact time, cage climbing) remained constant.
   Fluoxetine exposure also increased 5HT and AVP afferent development to
   brain areas implicated in aggressive behavior, most notably the
   latero-anterior hypothalamus (LAH)-an area of convergence for
   developmental and neuroplastic changes correlated with offensive
   aggression in hamsters. These data indicate that repeated administration
   of clinically relevant doses of fluoxetine during adolescent development
   directly stimulates aggressive behavior and alters LAH 5HT and AVP
   development, yet only alterations in AVP afferent development within the
   LAH correlate with the fluoxetine-induced aggressive behavioral
   phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic exposure to light at night (LAN) is a circadian disruptor and
   may be linked to various health risks, including mood disorders. We
   recently demonstrated that chronic exposure to dim (5 lux) LAN provokes
   depressive-like behaviors and reduced hippocampal CA1 dendritic spine
   density in female hamsters. Whether this model is responsive to
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors remains unspecified. In this
   study, we exposed hamsters to 5 lux LAN and treated with citalopram to
   determine effects on depressive-like behavior and CA1 dendritic spine
   density. Female hamsters were ovariectomized at adulthood and housed in
   either a standard light dark cycle (LD) or dim LAN (dLAN). After 4 weeks
   exposure, treatment with either citalopram or vehicle was administered
   for 2 weeks while hamsters remained in experimental lighting conditions.
   Depressive-like behavior was assayed using the forced swim test and
   brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining and analyzed for dendritic
   spine density. Treatment with citalopram rescued behavior in the forced
   swim test in hamsters housed in dLAN, but had no effect on hamsters
   housed in LD. Dendritic spine density in CA1 was moderately improved by
   citalopram treatment, but not fully restored. These results validate our
   LAN paradigm as a depression model by showing citalopram selectively
   improves depressive-like behavior in dLAN conditions, but not in LD
   conditions. These data also suggest standard SSRI therapy may be
   effective for individuals experiencing depression related to circadian
   disruption and LAN exposure, such as shift workers.}},

Title = {{Evidence That the Rat Hippocampus Has Contrasting Roles in Object

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Adult rats with extensive, bilateral neurotoxic lesions of the
   hippocampus showed normal forgetting curves for object recognition
   memory, yet were impaired on closely related tests of object recency
   memory. The present findings point to specific mechanisms for temporal
   order information (recency) that are dependent on the hippocampus and do
   not involve object recognition memory. The object recognition tests
   measured rats exploring simultaneously presented objects, one novel and
   the other familiar. Task difficulty was varied by altering the retention
   delays after presentation of the familiar object, so creating a
   forgetting curve. Hippocampal lesions had no apparent effect, despite
   using an apparatus (bow-tie maze) where it was possible to give lists of
   objects that might be expected to increase stimulus interference. In
   contrast, the same hippocampal lesions impaired the normal preference
   for an older (less recent) familiar object over a more recent, familiar
   object. A correlation was found between the loss of septal hippocampal
   tissue and this impairment in recency memory. The dissociation in the
   present study between recognition memory (spared) and recency memory
   (impaired) was unusually compelling, because it was possible to test the
   same objects for both forms of memory within the same session and within
   the same apparatus. The object recency deficit is of additional interest
   as it provides an example of a nonspatial memory deficit following
   hippocampal damage.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{670-680}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Consistent with a popular theory of associative learning, the
   Pearce-Hall (1980) model, the surprising omission of expected events
   enhances cue associability (the ease with which a cue may enter into new
   associations), across a wide variety of behavioral training procedures.
   Furthermore, previous experiments from this laboratory showed that these
   enhancements are absent in rats with impaired function of the amygdala
   central nucleus (CeA). A notable exception to these assertions is found
   in feature negative (FN) discrimination learning, in which a
   ``target{''} stimulus is reinforced when it is presented alone but
   nonreinforced when it is presented in compound with another,
   ``feature{''} stimulus. According to the Pearce-Hall model, reinforcer
   omission on compound trials should enhance the associability of the
   feature relative to control training conditions. However, prior
   experiments have shown no evidence that CeA lesions affect FN
   discrimination learning. Here we explored this apparent contradiction by
   evaluating the hypothesis that the surprising omission of an event
   confers enhanced associability on a cue only if that cue itself
   generates the disconfirmed prediction. Thus, in a FN discrimination, the
   surprising omission of the reinforcer on compound trials would enhance
   the associability of the target stimulus but not that of the feature.
   Our data confirmed this hypothesis and showed this enhancement to depend
   on intact CeA function, as in other procedures. The results are
   consistent with modern reformulations of both cue and reward processing
   theories that assign roles for both individual and aggregate error terms
   in associative learning.}},

Abstract = {{Drug-associated cues are believed to be important mediators of addiction
   and drug relapse. Although such cues may influence drug-seeking behavior
   through multiple routes, it is their putative incentive motivational
   properties-their ability to elicit ``craving{''}-that interests many
   addiction researchers. The Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer paradigm
   is commonly used to assay cue-evoked incentive motivation in situations
   involving natural rewards, but has not been widely applied to the study
   of drug self-administration. We used this paradigm to determine whether
   cues paired with intravenous cocaine could promote performance of an
   independently trained task in which rats self-administered cocaine by
   completing a chain of two different lever press actions, a procedure
   used to parse behavior into cocaine seeking (first action) and cocaine
   taking (second action). Rats showed significant transfer, increasing
   task performance during cocaine-paired cues. This effect was observed
   for both seeking and taking actions, although a trend toward greater
   cocaine taking was observed, a result that is consistent with studies
   using natural rewards. Our results demonstrate that cocaine-paired cues
   can provoke the pursuit of cocaine through a Pavlovian motivational
   process. This phenomenon may provide a useful new tool for modeling drug
   relapse, particularly as a method for targeting the
   response-invigorating effects of stimulus-drug learning.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work has demonstrated that injections of the gamma-aminobutyric
   acid(A) (GABA(A)) agonist muscimol into the nucleus accumbens shell
   (AcbSh) induce pronounced increases in the intake of solid foods and
   sucrose solutions, but do not potentiate water intake. In order to
   clarify the range of situations in which inactivation of the AcbSh
   potentiates ingestive behavior, we examined the effects of muscimol
   injections on the intake of a 3\% NaCl solution in sodium-depleted
   animals. Although sodium-depleted subjects avidly consumed this
   solution, muscimol injections had no effect either on the volume
   consumed or on a variety of microstructural licking parameters. In
   contrast, in these same animals, muscimol injections significantly
   increased licking of a 10\% sucrose solution. These results suggest that
   inactivation of the AcbSh may selectively increase the intake of foods,
   but not that of other homeostatically relevant ingestates. Examination
   of microstructural parameters suggested that the effect of muscimol on
   sucrose intake was not mediated by alterations in the ``palatability{''}
   of the sucrose solution. We also observed that sodium-depleted subjects
   displayed significantly larger salt intakes after their second
   experience with sodium depletion than their first, and microstructural
   analysis in this case indicated that this sensitization effect was
   produced in a manner consistent with the animals showing increased
   ``hedonic responsiveness{''} to the salt solution.}},

Abstract = {{The anterior thalamus (AT) is anatomically interconnected with the
   hippocampus and other structures known to be involved in memory, and the
   AT is involved in many of the same learning and memory functions as the
   hippocampus. For example, like the hippocampus, the AT is involved in
   spatial cognition and episodic memory. The hippocampus also has a
   well-documented role in contextual memory processes, but it is not known
   whether the AT is similarly involved in contextual memory. In the
   present study, we assessed the role of the AT in contextual memory
   processes by temporarily inactivating the AT and training rats on a
   recently developed context-based olfactory list learning task, which was
   designed to assess the use of contextual information to resolve
   interference. Rats were trained on one list of odor discrimination
   problems, followed by training on a second list in either the same
   context or a different context. In order to induce interference, some of
   the odors appeared on both lists with their predictive value reversed.
   Control rats that learned the two lists in different contexts performed
   significantly better than rats that learned the two lists in the same
   context. However, AT lesions completely abolished this contextual
   learning advantage, a result that is very similar to the effects of
   hippocampal inactivation. These findings demonstrate that the AT, like
   the hippocampus, is involved in contextual memory and suggest that the
   hippocampus and AT are part of a functional circuit involved in
   contextual memory.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromodulatory systems such as noradrenaline (NE), acetylcholine (ACh),
   and serotonin (5HT) serve important functions in sensory perception. We
   use the olfactory bulb (OB) as a model system to study the roles of
   individual neuromodulators in sensory perception. Using a spontaneous,
   nonreward motivated detection task, as well as a reward-motivated task,
   we show that rats can easily respond to odorants at very low
   concentrations when motivated to do so in a food-rewarded task, despite
   not showing spontaneous responses to these low concentration odorants.
   Using the same tasks paired with local bulbar infusions of noradrenergic
   and cholinergic drugs, we then show that rats engage their
   noradrenergic, but not their cholinergic system, to better respond to
   near threshold odorants. These results suggest that while cholinergic
   modulation of OB function is mostly important for odor decorrelation and
   discrimination, noradrenergic modulation is important for
   signal-to-noise modulation.}},

Abstract = {{Memory persistence in the inhibitory avoidance (IA) task has been
   recently shown to require a new event of consolidation 12 hr after
   acquisition. The immobilization stress (IS) model is largely used to
   study the effects of stress on memory. In this study we investigated the
   interactions between stress by immobilization and its effect on the
   persistence of memory, and also a possible effect mediated by
   beta-adrenergic modulation of stress on memory persistence. An
   enhancement of long-term memory (LTM) persistence caused by stress
   through immobilization applied 12 hr after IA training was observed when
   the animals were submitted to 15 min or I hr of IS, but not to 3 hr. The
   reversal of this memory enhancement caused by IS was observed when the
   beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol was infused intraperitoneally
   prior to stress, which implies that beta-adrenergic receptors are
   involved in stress enhancement of LTM persistence.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{735-741}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Adolescence is an ontogenetic period characterized by numerous hormonal,
   neural, and behavioral changes. In animal models, adolescents exhibit
   greater levels of novelty-seeking behavior and risk-taking relative to
   adults, behaviors associated in humans with increases in impulsivity and
   elevated propensities to engage in drug and alcohol seeking behaviors.
   The current series of experiments sought to explore possible age-related
   differences in impulsivity when indexed using delay discounting in
   adolescent (postnatal day {[}P] 25-27) and adult (P68-71) female
   (Experiment 1) and male (Experiment 2) Sprague-Dawley rats. In both
   experiments, adolescents exhibited significantly greater levels of
   impulsive-like behavior in this test relative to adults-even when data
   were adjusted to account for baseline differences in activity levels
   (i.e., general nose-poking behavior) across age. Taken together, these
   results extend to both sexes previous findings of adolescent-associated
   elevations in impulsivity observed among male mice using delay
   discounting, as well as among male rats using other procedures to index
   impulsivity. That these age differences were observed among both male
   and female rats suggests that impulsivity may be a pervasive feature of
   adolescence, and contributes to the expression of risky behaviors during
   this ontogenetic period.}},

Abstract = {{Recent event-related brain potential studies revealed the selective
   processing of emotional and threatening pictures. Integrating the
   picture viewing and threat-of-shock paradigm, the present study examined
   the processing of emotional pictures while they were explicitly
   instructed to cue threat of real world danger (i.e. electric shocks).
   Toward this end, 60 pleasant, neutral and unpleasant IAPS-pictures were
   presented (1s) as a continuous random stream while high-density EEG and
   self-reported threat were assessed. In three experimental runs, each
   picture category was used once as a threat-cue, whereas in the other
   conditions the same category served as safety-cue. An additional passive
   viewing run served as a no-threat condition, thus, establishing a
   threat-safety continuum (threat-cue-safety-cue-no-threat) for each
   picture category. Threat-of-shock modulated P1, P2 and parieto-occipital
   LPP amplitudes. While the P1 component differentiated among threat-and
   no-threat conditions, the P2 and LPP effects were specific to pictures
   signaling threat-of-shock. Thus, stimulus processing progressively
   gained more accurate information about environmental threat conditions.
   Interestingly, the finding of increased EPN and centro-parietal LPP
   amplitudes to emotional pictures was independent from threat-of-shock
   manipulation. Accordingly, the results indicate distinct effects
   associated with the intrinsic significance of emotional pictures and
   explicitly instructed threat contingencies.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that healthy participants learn to control
   local brain activity with operant training by using real-time functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI). Very little data exist, however,
   on the dynamics of interaction between critical brain regions during
   rt-fMRI-based training. Here, we examined self-regulation of
   stimulus-elicited insula activation and performed a psychophysiological
   interaction (PPI) analysis of real-time self-regulation data. During
   voluntary up-regulation of the left anterior insula in the presence of
   threat-related pictures, differential activations were observed in the
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the frontal operculum, the middle
   cingulate cortex and the right insula. Down-regulation in comparison to
   no-regulation revealed additional activations in right superior temporal
   cortex, right inferior parietal cortex and right middle frontal cortex.
   There was a significant learning effect over sessions during
   up-regulation, documented by a significant improvement of anterior
   insula control over time. Connectivity analysis revealed that successful
   up-regulation of the activity in left anterior insula while viewing
   aversive pictures was directly modulated by dorsomedial and
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Down-regulation of activity was more
   difficult to achieve and no learning effect was observed. More extensive
   training might be necessary for successful down-regulation. These
   findings illustrate the functional interactions between different brain
   areas during regulation of anterior insula activity in the presence of
   threat-related stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined neural activation during the experience of
   compassion, an emotion that orients people toward vulnerable others and
   prompts caregiving, and pride, a self-focused emotion that signals
   individual strength and heightened status. Functional magnetic resonance
   images (fMRI) were acquired as participants viewed 55 s continuous
   sequences of slides to induce either compassion or pride, presented in
   alternation with sequences of neutral slides. Emotion self-report data
   were collected after each slide condition within the fMRI scanner.
   Compassion induction was associated with activation in the midbrain
   periaqueductal gray (PAG), a region that is activated during pain and
   the perception of others' pain, and that has been implicated in parental
   nurturance behaviors. Pride induction engaged the posterior medial
   cortex, a region that has been associated with self-referent processing.
   Self-reports of compassion experience were correlated with increased
   activation in a region near the PAG, and in the right inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG). Self-reports of pride experience, in contrast, were
   correlated with reduced activation in the IFG and the anterior insula.
   These results provide preliminary evidence towards understanding the
   neural correlates of important interpersonal dimensions of compassion
   and pride. Caring (compassion) and self-focus (pride) may represent core
   appraisals that differentiate the response profiles of many emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is well established that prior experience with faces
   determines their subsequent social-emotional evaluation, recent work
   shows that top-down inhibitory mechanisms, including response
   inhibition, can lead to social devaluation after even a single, brief
   exposure. These rapidly induced effects indicate interplay among
   perceptual, attentional, response-selection and social-emotional
   networks; yet, the brain mechanisms underlying this are not well
   understood. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   to investigate the neural mechanism mediating the relationship between
   inhibitory control and emotional devaluation. Participants performed two
   tasks: (i) a Go/No-Go task in response to faces and (ii) a
   trustworthiness rating task involving the previously seen faces. No-Go
   faces were rated as significantly less trustworthy than Go faces. By
   examining brain activations during Task 1, behavioral measures and brain
   activations obtained in Task 2 could be predicted. Specifically,
   activity in brain areas during Task 1 associated with (i) executive
   control and response suppression (i.e. lateral prefrontal cortex) and
   (ii) affective responses and value representation (i.e. orbitofrontal
   cortex), systematically covaried with behavioral ratings and amygdala
   activity obtained during Task 2. The present findings offer insights
   into the neural mechanisms linking inhibitory processes to affective
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Alexithymia is a trait characterized by a diminished capacity to
   describe and distinguish emotions and to fantasize; it is associated
   with reduced introspection and problems in emotion processing. The
   default mode network (DMN) is a network of brain areas that is normally
   active during rest and involved in emotion processing and
   self-referential mental activity, including introspection. We
   hypothesized that connectivity of the DMN might be altered in
   alexithymia. Twenty alexithymic and 18 non-alexithymic healthy
   volunteers underwent a resting state fMRI scan. Independent component
   analysis was used to identify the DMN. Differences in connectivity
   strength were compared between groups. Within the DMN, alexithymic
   participants showed lower connectivity within areas of the DMN (medial
   frontal and temporal areas) as compared to non-alexithymic participants.
   In contrast, connectivity in the high-alexithymic participants was
   higher for the sensorimotor cortex, occipital areas and right lateral
   frontal cortex than in the low-alexithymic participants. These results
   suggest a diminished connectivity within the DMN of alexithymic
   participants, in brain areas that may also be involved in emotional
   awareness and self-referential processing. On the other hand,
   alexithymia was associated with stronger functional connections of the
   DMN with brain areas involved in sensory input and control of emotion.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{667-676}},

Abstract = {{Research indicates that many people do not use condoms consistently but
   rather rely on illusory control strategies for avoiding an infection
   with HIV. Preliminary evidence suggests that people form impressions of
   a partner's HIV risk based on his or her physical appearance. To examine
   the neural correlates of such appearance-based HIV risk impressions,
   event-related potentials were recorded while participants viewed
   portraits of unacquainted persons. Participants' explicit HIV risk
   ratings for each of the presented unacquainted persons were used to form
   categories of low and high HIV risk persons. Results showed that risky,
   compared to safe persons elicited distinct event-related potential (ERP)
   modulations. Viewing risky persons was associated with an increased
   positivity over right frontal regions between 180 and 240 ms. This
   suggests that impressions related to HIV risk occur rapidly, presumably
   reflecting automatic person evaluations eluding introspection. In a time
   window between 450 and 600 ms, risky persons elicited an increased late
   positive potential. Consistent with previous findings reporting
   augmented late positive potentials (LPP) amplitudes to affectively
   significant stimuli, the results support the assumption that risky faces
   draw more attention resources. These findings are in accordance with the
   `risk as feeling' notion.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{677-688}},

Abstract = {{Previous research suggests that performance-monitoring processes are
   related to personality traits; relationships with affective states,
   however, remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to replicate and
   extend previous findings that induced state negative affect alters
   electrophysiological reflections of performance monitoring. High-density
   event-related potentials (ERPs) were obtained from 69 healthy
   individuals (41 female, 28 male) who completed an Eriksen flanker task
   and received either encouraging or derogatory feedback based on mean
   reaction times (RTs) for 30-trial sub-blocks. Affective state,
   behavioral measures (i.e. error rates, RTs) and ERP measures {[}i.e.
   error-related negativity (ERN), post-error positivity (Pe) and N2] were
   assessed. Reaction times did not differ between feedback groups.
   Participants who received derogatory feedback committed more errors over
   time. Despite changes in affect, no significant group differences were
   demonstrated for behavioral or ERP measures of performance monitoring.
   Increases in vigilance were associated with more negative N2 amplitudes;
   no other changes in affective state were associated with changes in ERP
   measures. Results are consistent with findings suggesting
   performance-monitoring processes are only slightly affected by changes
   in affective state and fail to replicate previous studies suggesting the
   ERN is related to state changes in affect-supporting the possibility of
   the ERN as an endophenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a chromosomal condition (47, XXY) that may
   help us to unravel gene-brain behavior pathways to psychopathology. The
   phenotype includes social cognitive impairments and increased risk for
   autism traits. We used functional MRI to study neural mechanisms
   underlying social information processing. Eighteen nonclinical controls
   and thirteen men with XXY were scanned during judgments of faces with
   regard to trustworthiness and age. While judging faces as untrustworthy
   in comparison to trustworthy, men with XXY displayed less activation
   than controls in (i) the amygdala, which plays a key role in screening
   information for socio-emotional significance, (ii) the insula, which
   plays a role in subjective emotional experience, as well as (iii) the
   fusiform gyrus and (iv) the superior temporal sulcus, which are both
   involved in the perceptual processing of faces and which were also less
   involved during age judgments in men with XXY. This is the first study
   showing that KS can be associated with reduced involvement of the neural
   network subserving social cognition. Studying KS may increase our
   understanding of the genetic and hormonal basis of neural dysfunctions
   contributing to abnormalities in social cognition and behavior, which
   are considered core abnormalities in psychiatric disorders such as
   autism and schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Comparing pain is done in daily life and involves short-term memorizing
   and attention focusing. This event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging study investigated the short-term brain activations associated
   with the comparison of pain stimuli using a delayed discrimination
   paradigm. Fourteen healthy young volunteers compared two successive pain
   stimuli administered at a 10 s interval to the same location at the
   nasal mucosa. Fourteen age- and sex-matched subjects received similar
   pain stimuli without performing the comparison task. With the comparison
   task, the activations associated with the second pain stimulus were
   significantly greater than with the first stimulus in the anterior
   insular cortex and the primary somatosensory area. This was observed on
   the background of a generally increased stimulus-associated brain
   activation in the presence of the comparison task that included regions
   of the pain matrix (insular cortex, primary and secondary somatosensory
   area, midcingulate cortex, supplemental motor area) and regions
   associated with attention, decision making, working memory and body
   recognition (frontal and temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobule,
   precuneus, lingual cortices). This data provides a cerebral correlate
   for the role of pain as a biological alerting system that gains the

Abstract = {{Psychopathic behavior is characteristically amoral, but to date research
   studies have largely failed to identify any systematic differences in
   moral judgment capability between psychopaths and non-psychopaths. In
   this study, we investigate whether significant differences in moral
   judgment emerge when taking into account the phenotypic heterogeneity of
   the disorder through a well-validated distinction between psychopathic
   subtypes. Three groups of incarcerated participants {[} low-anxious
   psychopaths (n = 12), high-anxious psychopaths (n = 12) and
   non-psychopaths (n = 24)] completed a moral judgment test involving
   hypothetical dilemmas. The moral dilemmas featured `personal' (i.e.
   involving direct physical harm) or `impersonal' (i.e. involving indirect
   or remote harm) actions. Compared to non-psychopaths, both groups of
   psychopaths were significantly more likely to endorse the impersonal
   actions. However, only the low-anxious psychopaths were significantly
   more likely to endorse the personal harms when commission of the harm
   would maximize aggregate welfare-the `utilitarian' choice. High-anxious
   psychopaths and non-psychopaths did not significantly differ in their
   personal moral judgments. These results provide novel laboratory
   evidence of abnormal moral judgment in psychopaths, as well as
   additional support for the importance of considering psychopathic

Abstract = {{The current study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   examine whether regulating negative bias to stigmatized individuals has
   a unique neural activity profile from general emotion regulation.
   Participants were presented with images of stigmatized (e.g. homeless
   people) or non-stigmatized (e.g. a man holding a gun) social targets
   while undergoing fMRI and were asked either to maintain or regulate
   their emotional response. Their implicit bias toward these stigmatized
   group members was also measured. Analyses were conducted in both, an
   event-related fashion, considering the event to be the onset of
   regulation, and in a blocked-design fashion, considering the sustained
   activity throughout the 8-s regulatory period. In the event-related
   (onset) analyses, participants showed more activity throughout the
   prefrontal cortex when initiating a regulatory response to stigmatized
   as compared with non-stigmatized images. This neural activity was
   positively correlated with their implicit bias. Interestingly, in the
   block (sustained) analyses, general emotion regulation elicited a more
   widespread pattern of neural activity as compared with stigma
   regulation. This activity was largely posterior, suggesting that general
   emotion regulation may engage more visuo-spatial processing as compared
   with stigma regulation. These findings suggest that regulating negative
   affect toward stigmatized targets may occur relatively more quickly than
   regulating negative affect toward non-stigmatized targets.}},

Abstract = {{Affective empathy (AE) is distinguished clinically and neurally from
   cognitive empathy (CE). While AE is selectively disrupted in
   psychopathy, autism is associated with deficits in CE. Despite such
   dissociations, AE and CE together contribute to normal human empathic
   experience. A dimensional measure of individual differences in AE
   `relative to' CE captures this interaction and may reveal brain-behavior
   relationships beyond those detectable with AE and CE separately. Using
   resting-state fMRI and measures of empathy in healthy adults, we show
   that relative empathic ability (REA) is reflected in the brain's
   intrinsic functional dynamics. Dominance of AE was associated with
   stronger functional connectivity among social-emotional regions (ventral
   anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, perigenual anterior
   cingulate). Dominance of CE was related to stronger connectivity among
   areas implicated in interoception, autonomic monitoring and
   social-cognitive processing (brainstem, superior temporal sulcus,
   ventral anterior insula). These patterns were distinct from those
   observed with AE and CE separately. Finally, REA and the strength of
   several functional connections were associated with symptoms of
   psychopathology. These findings suggest that REA provides a dimensional
   index of empathic function and pathological tendencies in healthy
   adults, which are reflected in the intrinsic functional dynamics of
   neural systems associated with social and emotional cognition.}},

Abstract = {{The delta opioid receptor (DOR) agonist DPDPE decreases ethanol (EtOH)
   consumption when injected into the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We
   previously showed that DPDPE inhibition of GABA(A) receptor-mediated
   inhibitory postsynaptic currents (GABA(A)R IPSCs) is associated with
   reduced EtOH consumption. To determine whether self-administration of
   EtOH is required to change VTA DOR function, we compared the effects of
   passively administered (gavaged) and self-administered (two-bottle
   choice) EtOH. Because rats showed variability in DOR regulation of
   drinking and inhibition of GABA(A)R IPSCs, we examined whether these
   changes can be predicted before EtOH exposure by behavioral measures of
   anxiety or intoxication. Functional DORs were seen with both gavaged and
   self-administered EtOH, although the magnitude of DPDPE-induced in
   correlated with behavioral measures only when EtOH was
   self-administered. Specifically, DPDPE-induced inhibition correlated
   with predrinking measures of open arm time in the plus maze (n = 19, R =
   .69. p = .001), with change in maximum fall latency on the rotarod (n =
   17, R = .89, p = .000001), and with blood corticosterone (n = 17, R =
   .66, p = .004) in drinking animals. This DOR-mediated inhibition
   persisted for at least 14 days after EtOH access was terminated.
   Together, these findings indicate that anxious animals and those with
   the greatest EtOH-induced motor impairment have the most robust
   DPDPE-induced inhibition of GABA(A)R IPSCs in VTA neurons. These data
   also extend our understanding of the possible therapeutic value of the
   DOR for treatment of alcoholism by showing that its relevant synaptic
   action persists during abstinence.}},

Abstract = {{The medial preoptic area (MPOA) is an integral site for male sexual
   behavior. Dopamine is released in the MPOA before and during copulation
   and facilitates male rat sexual behavior. Repeated sexual experience and
   noncopulatory exposures to an estrous female facilitate subsequent
   copulation. However, the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate such
   enhancement remain unclear. Here, we examined the role of dopamine D-1
   receptors in the MPOA in experience-induced enhancement of male sexual
   behavior in rats. In Experiment 1, microinjections of the D-1 antagonist
   SCH-23390 into the MPOA before each of seven daily 30-min noncopulatory
   exposures to a receptive female impaired copulation on a drug-free test
   on Day 8, compared to vehicle-treated female-exposed animals. Copulatory
   performance in drug-treated animals was similar to that of
   vehicle-treated males that had not been preexposed to females. This
   effect was site specific. There were no group differences in locomotor
   activity in an open field on the copulation test day. In Experiment 2, a
   separate cohort of animals was used to examine phosphorylation of
   dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) in the MPOA of
   animals with acute and/or chronic sexual experience. DARPP-32 is a
   downstream marker of D-1 receptor signaling and substrate of
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Western immunoblot analysis
   revealed that p-DARPP-32 expression was greatest in the MPOA of males
   that received both acute and chronic sexual experience, compared to all
   other mated conditions and naive controls. These data suggest that D-1
   receptors in the MPOA contribute to experience-induced enhancement of
   male sexual behavior, perhaps through a PKA regulated mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research indicates that serotonin enhances the development of
   stress-induced changes in behavior, although it is unclear which
   serotonin receptors mediate this effect. 5-HT2 receptors are potential
   candidates because activation at these receptors is associated with
   increased fear and anxiety. In this study, we investigated whether
   pharmacological treatments targeting 5-HT2 receptors would alter the
   acquisition and expression of conditioned defeat. Conditioned defeat is
   a social defeat model in Syrian hamsters in which individuals display
   increased submissive and defensive behavior and a loss of territorial
   aggression when tested with a novel intruder 24 hours after an acute
   social defeat. The nonselective 5-HT2 receptor agonist mCPP (0.0, 0.3,
   1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg) was injected either prior to social defeat training
   or prior to conditioned defeat testing. Also, the 5-HT2A receptor
   antagonist MDL 11,939 (0.0, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/kg) was injected either prior
   to social defeat training or prior to conditioned defeat testing.
   Injection of mCPP prior to testing increased the expression of
   conditioned defeat, but injection of mCPP prior to training did not
   alter the acquisition of conditioned defeat. Conversely, injection of
   MDL 11,939 prior to training reduced the acquisition of conditioned
   defeat, but injection of MDL 11,939 prior to testing did not alter the
   expression of conditioned defeat. Our data suggest that mCPP activates
   5-HT2C receptors during testing to enhance the display of submissive and
   defensive behavior, whereas MDL 11,939 blocks 5-HT2A receptors during
   social defeat to disrupt the development of the conditioned defeat
   response. In sum, these results suggest that serotonin acts at separate
   5-HT2 receptors to facilitate the acquisition and expression of
   defeat-induced changes in social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Substance abuse and addiction are associated with an apparent
   devaluation of, and inattention to, natural rewards. This consequence of
   addiction can be modeled using a reward comparison paradigm where rats
   avoid intake of a palatable taste cue that comes to predict access to a
   drug of abuse. Evidence suggests rats avoid intake following such
   pairings, at least in part, because the taste cue pales in comparison to
   the highly rewarding drug expected in the near future. In accordance,
   lesions of the gustatory thalamus or cortex eliminate avoidance of a
   taste cue when paired with either a drug of abuse or a rewarding sucrose
   solution, but not when paired with the aversive agent, LiCl. The present
   study used bilateral ibotenic acid lesions to evaluate the role of a
   neighboring thalamic structure, the trigeminal orosensory area (TOA), in
   avoidance of a gustatory cue when paired with sucrose (Experiment 1),
   morphine (Experiment 2), cocaine (Experiment 3), or LiCl (Experiment 4).
   The results show that the TOA lesion disrupts, but does not eliminate
   avoidance of a taste cue that predicts access to a preferred sucrose
   solution and leaves intact the development of a LiCl-induced conditioned
   taste aversion. The lesion does, however, eliminate the suppression of
   intake of a taste cue when paired with experimenter-administered
   morphine or cocaine using our standard parameters. As such, this is the
   first manipulation found to dissociate avoidance of a taste cue when
   mediated by a sweet or by a drug of abuse.}},

Abstract = {{Effort-based decision making occurs when subjects are given a choice
   between a reward available at a high response cost and a reward
   available at a low response cost and is altered in individuals with
   disorders such as autism or particular patterns of brain injury. The
   current study explored the relationship between effort-based decision
   making and reinforcement characteristics in the T maze. This was done
   using both normal animals and animals with bilateral inactivation of the
   cerebellar dentate nuclei. Rats chose between alternatives in which one
   arm contained high-density reinforcement (HR) and the other arm
   contained low-density reinforcement (LR). During training, the HR arm
   was obstructed and the point at which the animal no longer worked for
   reinforcement (breaking point) was determined. The cerebellar dentate
   nuclei were then transiently inactivated and once again breaking points
   were assessed. The results indicated that inactivation of the dentate
   nucleus disrupted effort-based decision making. Additionally, altering
   both the palatability and the magnitude of the reinforcement were
   assessed in an attempt to reestablish the original preinactivation
   breaking point. It was hypothesized that an increase in the strength or
   magnitude of the reinforcement would promote an increase in the breaking
   point of the animal even when the cerebellum was inactivated. The
   results indicated that with both strategies animals effectively
   reestablished original breaking points. The results of this study will
   inform the current literature regarding the modification of behavior
   after brain injury and further the understanding of the behavioral
   deficits associated with cerebellar dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Basolateral amygdala (BLA) function is critical for flexible,
   goal-directed behavior, including performance on reinforcer devaluation
   tasks. Here we tested, in rats, the hypothesis that BLA is critical for
   conditioned reinforcer devaluation during the period when the primary
   reinforcer (food) is being devalued (by feeding it to satiety), but not
   thereafter for guiding behavioral choices. We used a spatially
   independent task that used two visual cues, each predicting one of two
   foods. An instrumental action (lever press) was required for reinforcer
   delivery. After training, rats received BLA or sham lesions, or cannulae
   implanted in BLA. Under control conditions (sham lesions, saline
   infusions), devaluation of one food significantly decreased responding
   to the cue associated with that food, when both cues were presented
   simultaneously during extinction. BLA lesions impaired this devaluation
   effect. Transient inactivation of BLA by microinfusion of the
   gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A agonist muscimol resulted in an
   impairment only when BLA was inactivated during satiation. When muscimol
   was infused after satiation and therefore, BLA was inactivated only
   during the choice test, rats showed no impairment. Thus, BLA is
   necessary for registering or updating cues to reflect updated reinforcer
   values, but not for guiding choices once the value has been updated. Our
   results are the first to describe the contribution of rat BLA to
   specific components of reinforcer devaluation and are the first to show
   impairment in reinforcer devaluation following transient inactivation in
   the rat.}},

Abstract = {{``Predictive coding{''} models posit a key role for associative learning
   in visual cognition, viewing perceptual inference as a process of
   matching (learned) top-down predictions (or expectations) against
   bottom-up sensory evidence. At the neural level, these models propose
   that each region along the visual processing hierarchy entails one set
   of processing units encoding predictions of bottom-up input, and another
   set computing mismatches (prediction error or surprise) between
   predictions and evidence. This contrasts with traditional views of
   visual neurons operating purely as bottom-up feature detectors. In
   support of the predictive coding hypothesis, a recent human neuroimaging
   study (Egner, Monti, \& Summerfield, 2010) showed that neural population
   responses to expected and unexpected face and house stimuli in the
   ``fusiform face area{''} (FFA) could be well-described as a summation of
   hypothetical face-expectation and -surprise signals, but not by feature
   detector responses. Here, we used computer simulations to test whether
   these imaging data could be formally explained within the broader
   framework of a mathematical neural network model of associative learning
   (Schmajuk, Gray, \& Lam, 1996). Results show that FFA responses could be
   fit very closely by model variables coding for conditional predictions
   (and their violations) of stimuli that unconditionally activate the FFA.
   These data document that neural population signals in the ventral visual
   stream that deviate from classic feature detection responses can
   formally be explained by associative prediction and surprise signals.}},

Abstract = {{Physical exercise has mood-enhancing and antidepressant properties
   although the mechanisms underlying these effects are not known. The
   present experiment investigated the effects of prolonged access to a
   running wheel on electrical self-stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus
   (LHSS), a measure of hedonic state, in rats. Rats with continuous
   voluntary access to a running wheel for either 2 or 5 weeks exhibited
   dramatic leftward shifts in the effective current 50 (ECu50; current
   value that supports half of maximum responding) of their LHSS
   current-response functions compared to their baselines, indicating a
   decrease in reward threshold, whereas control rats current-response
   functions after 2 or 5 weeks were not significantly different from
   baseline. An inverse correlation existed between the change in ECu50
   from baseline and the amount an animal had run in the day prior to LHSS
   testing, indicating that animals that exhibited higher levels of running
   showed a more robust decrease in LHSS threshold. We conclude that
   long-term voluntary exercise increases sensitivity to rewarding stimuli,
   which may contribute to its antidepressant properties.}},

Volume = {{126}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, many animal models of memory have focused on one or
   more of the various components of episodic memory. For example, the odor
   sequence memory task requires subjects to remember individual items and
   events (the odors) and the temporal aspects of the experience (the
   sequence of odor presentation). The well-known spatial context coding
   function of the hippocampus, as exemplified by place cell firing, may
   reflect the ``where{''} component of episodic memory. In the present
   study, we added a contextual component to the odor sequence memory task
   by training rats to choose the earlier odor in one context and the later
   odor in another context and we compared the effects of temporary
   hippocampal lesions on performance of the original single context task
   and the new dual context task. Temporary lesions significantly impaired
   the single context task, although performance remained significantly
   above chance levels. In contrast, performance dropped all the way to
   chance when temporary lesions were used in the dual context task. These
   results demonstrate that rats can learn a dual context version of the
   odor sequence learning task that requires the use of contextual
   information along with the requirement to remember the ``what{''} and
   ``when{''} components of the odor sequence. Moreover, the addition of
   the contextual component made the task fully dependent on the
   hippocampus.}},

Abstract = {{Supplemental choline during early stages of development can result in
   long-lasting improvements to memory function. In addition, pre- or
   postnatal choline has been shown to be protective against some of the
   adverse effects of early alcohol exposure. The present experiment
   examined whether supplemental choline given to rats would protect
   against the effects of posttraining alcohol administration on trace fear
   conditioning. Posttraining alcohol exposure in adolescent rats results
   in poor performance in this hippocampus-dependent task, although delay
   conditioning is unaffected. Here, rats were given an s.c. injection of
   either saline or choline chloride daily on postnatal days (PD) 15-26. On
   PD 30 subjects were trained in a trace fear conditioning procedure. For
   the next 3 days animals were administered 2.5 g/kg ethanol or water
   control, and conditional stimulus (CS)-elicited freezing was measured on
   PD 34. Results indicated that posttraining alcohol disrupted the
   expression of trace conditioning and that supplemental choline on PD
   15-26 was protective against this effect. That is, choline-treated
   animals subsequently given posttraining ethanol performed as well as
   animals not given ethanol. These results indicate that supplemental
   choline given during the periweaning period protects against
   ethanol-induced impairments in a hippocampus-dependent learning task.
   Findings contribute to the growing literature showing improvements in
   learning and memory in subjects given extra dietary choline during
   critical periods of brain development.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroeconomic research has delineated neural regions involved in the
   computation of value, referring to a currency for concrete choices and
   decisions ('economic value'). Research in psychology and sociology, on
   the other hand, uses the term `value' to describe motivational
   constructs that guide choices and behaviors across situations ('core
   value'). As a first step towards an integration of these literatures, we
   compared the neural regions computing economic value and core value.
   Replicating previous work, economic value computations activated a
   network centered on medial orbitofrontal cortex. Core value computations
   activated medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in the processing
   of self-relevant information and dorsal striatum, involved in action
   selection. Core value ratings correlated with activity in precuneus and
   anterior prefrontal cortex, potentially reflecting the degree to which a
   core value is perceived as internalized part of one's self-concept.
   Distributed activation pattern in insula and ACC allowed differentiating
   individual core value types. These patterns may represent evaluation
   profiles reflecting prototypical fundamental concerns expressed in the
   core value types. Our findings suggest mechanisms by which core values,
   as motivationally important long-term goals anchored in the self-schema,
   may have the behavioral power to drive decisions and behaviors in the
   absence of immediately rewarding behavioral options.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research on potential applications of fMRI in the detection of
   concealed knowledge primarily ascribed the reported differences in
   hemodynamic response patterns to deception. This interpretation is
   challenged by the results of the present study. Participants were
   required to memorize probe and target items (a banknote and a playing
   card, each). Subsequently, these items were repeatedly presented along
   with eight irrelevant items in a modified Guilty Knowledge Test design
   and participants were instructed to simply acknowledge item presentation
   by pressing one button after each stimulus. Despite the absence of
   response monitoring demands and thus overt response conflicts, the
   experiment revealed a differential physiological response pattern as a
   function of item type. First, probes elicited the largest skin
   conductance responses. Second, differential hemodynamic responses were
   observed in bilateral inferior frontal regions, the right supramarginal
   gyrus and the supplementary motor area as a function of item type.
   Probes and targets were accompanied by a larger signal increase than
   irrelevant items in these regions. Moreover, the responses to probes
   differed substantially from targets. The observed neural response
   pattern seems to rely on retrieval processes that depend on the depth of
   processing in the encoding situation.}},

Abstract = {{It has been argued that power activates a general tendency to approach
   whereas powerlessness activates a tendency to inhibit. The assumption is
   that elevated power involves reward-rich environments, freedom and, as a
   consequence, triggers an approach-related motivational orientation and
   attention to rewards. In contrast, reduced power is associated with
   increased threat, punishment and social constraint and thereby activates
   inhibition-related motivation. Moreover, approach motivation has been
   found to be associated with increased relative left-sided frontal brain
   activity, while withdrawal motivation has been associated with increased
   right sided activations. We measured EEG activity while subjects engaged
   in a task priming either high or low social power. Results show that
   high social power is indeed associated with greater left-frontal brain
   activity compared to low social power, providing the first neural
   evidence for the theory that high power is associated with
   approach-related motivation. We propose a framework accounting for
   differences in both approach motivation and goal-directed behaviour
   associated with different levels of power.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Brain mechanisms underlying explicit evaluation of emotion have been
   explored using different tasks including `stimulus-focused evaluation',
   `evaluation of one's own emotion' and `evaluation of others' emotions'.
   Yet the extent to which similar brain mechanisms underlie different
   evaluation tasks is unclear. A meta-analysis of published neuroimaging
   studies of explicit emotional evaluation was conducted to examine common
   and distinct regions underlying these different evaluation tasks. This
   study revealed regions common to all three tasks: The amygdala and LPFC
   as common regions may be involved in emotion-cognition interactions, and
   the DMPFC may possibly play integrative roles in explicit emotional
   evaluation. Distinct regions were also identified: (i) the sensory
   cortex and VLPFC were specifically associated with `stimulus
   evaluation', possibly involved in perceptual and conceptual processing;
   (ii) the insula and rACC were specifically associated with `evaluation
   of one's own emotion', potentially associated with interoceptive and
   experiential processing; and (iii) the STS and TPJ were specifically
   associated with `evaluation of others' emotions', potentially reflecting
   their roles in TOM and empathy. These findings suggest that different
   types of explicit emotional evaluation may involve common and distinct
   networks and provide new insights on multiple mechanisms underlying
   explicit emotional evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{There is evidence that both early experience and genetic variation play
   a role in influencing sensitivity to social rejection. In this study, we
   aimed at ascertaining if the A118G polymorphism of the mu-opioid
   receptor gene (OPRM1) moderates the impact of early maternal care on
   fearful attachment, a personality trait strongly related to rejection
   sensitivity. In 112 psychiatric patients, early maternal care and
   fearful attachment were measured using the Parental Bonding Inventory
   and the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ), respectively. The pattern
   emerging from the RQ data was a crossover interaction between genotype
   and maternal caregiving. Participants expressing the minor 118 G allele
   had similar and relatively high scores on fearful attachment regardless
   of the quality of maternal care. By contrast, early experience made a
   major difference for participants carrying the A/A genotype. Those who
   recalled higher levels of maternal care reported the lowest levels of
   fearful attachment whereas those who recalled lower levels of maternal
   care scored highest on fearful attachment. Our data fit well with the
   differential susceptibility model which stipulates that plasticity genes
   would make some individuals more responsive than others to the negative
   consequences of adversity and to the benefits of environmental support
   and enrichment.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined whether middle-aged adults exposed to poverty in
   childhood or current financial hardship have detectable brain
   differences from those who have not experienced such adversity.
   Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted as one aspect
   of the Personality and Total Health (PATH) through life study: a large
   longitudinal community survey measuring the health and well-being of
   three cohorts from south-eastern Australia. This analysis considers data
   from 431 middle-aged adults in the aged 44-48 years at the time of the
   interview. Volumetric segmentation was performed with the Freesurfer
   image analysis suite. Data on socio-demographic circumstances, mental
   health and cognitive performance were collected through the survey
   interview. Results showed that, after controlling for well-established
   risk factors for atrophy, adults who reported financial hardship had
   smaller left and right hippocampal and amygdalar volumes than those who
   did not report hardship. In contrast, there was no reliable association
   between hardship and intra-cranial volume or between childhood poverty
   and any of the volumetric measures. Financial hardship may be considered
   a potent stressor and the observed results are consistent with the view
   that hardship influences hippocampal and amygdalar volumes through
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and other stress-related

Abstract = {{We investigated behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms by which
   risk-averse advice, provided by an expert, affected risky decisions
   across three developmental groups {[}early adolescents (12-14 years),
   late adolescents (15-17 years), adults (18+ years)]. Using cumulative
   prospect theory, we modeled choice behavior during a risky-choice task.
   Results indicate that advice had a significantly greater impact on risky
   choice in both adolescent groups than in adults. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural correlates of
   this behavioral effect. Developmental effects on correlations between
   brain activity and valuation parameters were obtained in regions that
   can be classified into (i) cognitive control regions, such as
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and ventrolateral PFC; (ii)
   social cognition regions, such as posterior temporoparietal junction;
   and (iii) reward-related regions, such as ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) and
   ventral striatum. Within these regions, differential effects of advice
   on neural correlates of valuation were observed across development.
   Specifically, advice increased the correlation strength between brain
   activity and parameters reflective of safe choice options in adolescent
   DLPFC and decreased correlation strength between activity and parameters
   reflective of risky choice options in adult vmPFC. Taken together,
   results indicate that, across development, distinct brain systems
   involved in cognitive control and valuation mediate the risk-reducing
   effect of advice during decision making under risk via specific
   enhancements and reductions of the correlation strength between brain
   activity and valuation parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have documented
   deficits in face processing, face memory and abnormal activation of the
   neural circuitry that supports these functions. To examine speed of
   processing of faces in ASD, high density event-related brain potentials
   were recorded to images of faces, inverted faces and non-face objects
   from 32 high-functioning adults with ASD and controls. Participants were
   instructed to focus on a cross hair prior to stimulus onset; the
   cross-hair location directed the participant's eye gaze to the eye
   region at stimulus onset. Although the ASD group preformed more poorly
   on behavioral tests of face and object memory, both groups demonstrated
   similar ERP responses, characterized by greater (positive) P1 and
   (negative) N170 amplitude to faces vs houses. N170 speed of processing
   to faces did not differ between groups. However, only the control group
   demonstrated differential responses to upright vs inverted faces. For
   the ASD group, the differential response to inverted vs upright faces
   was associated with better performance on face memory and self-reported
   social skills. It is possible that the use of attention cues may
   facilitate face processing in high-functioning adults with ASD,
   suggesting that the underlying neural circuitry can be activated in
   adults with ASD under specific demands.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala's contribution to emotion, cognition and behavior depends
   on its interactions with subcortical and cortical regions. Amygdala
   lesions result in altered functional activity in connected regions, but
   it is not known whether there might be long-term structural sequelae as
   well. We hypothesized that developmental bilateral amygdala lesions
   would be associated with specific gray matter morphometric abnormalities
   in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) and the ventral visual stream. We conducted regions of interest
   and vertex-based analyses of structural MRI data acquired in two
   patients with long-standing focal bilateral amygdala lesions (S.M. and
   A.P.), compared to gender- and age-matched healthy comparison subjects.
   Both patients showed significant proportional increases in gray matter
   volume of the vmPFC. Cortical thickness was increased in the vmPFC and
   ACC and decreased in the ventral visual stream. There were no
   morphometric changes in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or dorsal visual
   stream cortices. These findings support the hypothesis that cortical
   regions strongly connected with the amygdala undergo morphometric
   changes with long-standing amygdala damage. This is the first evidence
   in humans of the remote alteration of brain morphology in association
   with amygdala lesions, and will help in interpreting the structural and
   functional consequences of amygdala pathology in neuropsychiatric
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyms plays an important
   role in learning and memory. However, the precise contribution of the
   new neurons to hippocampal function remains controversial. Emerging
   evidence suggests that neurogenesis is important for pattern separation
   and for mitigating interference when similar items must be learned at
   different times. In the present study, we directly test this prediction
   using a recently developed olfactory memory task that has those specific
   features. In this task, rats learn two highly interfering lists of odor
   pairs, one after the other, in either the same or in different contexts.
   Consistent with our hypothesis, focal cranial irradiation, resulting in
   selective reduction of neurogenesis within the dentate gyms,
   significantly impaired the ability to overcome interference during
   learning of the second list. The ability to learn a single odor list was
   unimpaired. We also show that irradiation had no effect on learning in a
   hippocampal-dependent spatial alternation task. Although both tasks
   involved learning interfering responses, the time course for learning
   the interfering items differed. Learning the interfering odor lists took
   place sequentially, over the course of several sessions, whereas
   learning the interfering spatial locations took place concurrently,
   within each session. Thus, the gradual addition of new neurons may have
   provided a pattern separation mechanism for the olfactory task but not
   for the maze task. These findings demonstrate a role for neurogenesis in
   resolving interference and they are consistent with models suggesting a
   critical role for neurogenesis in pattern separation.}},

Abstract = {{Fear conditioning studies have demonstrated the critical role played by
   the amygdala in emotion processing. Although all lesion studies until
   now investigated the effect of adult-onset damage on fear conditioning,
   the current study assessed fear-learning abilities, as measured by
   fear-potentiated startle, in adult monkeys that had received neonatal
   neurotoxic amygdala damage or sham-operations. After fear acquisition,
   their abilities to learn and use a safety cue to modulate their fear to
   the conditioned cue, and, finally, to extinguish their response to the
   fear conditioned cue were measured with the AX+/BX- Paradigm. Neonatal
   amygdala damage retarded, but did not completely abolish, the
   acquisition of a learned fear. After acquisition of the fear signal,
   four of the six animals with neonatal amygdala lesions discriminated
   between the fear and safety cues and were also able to use the safety
   signal to reduce the potentiated-startle response and to extinguish the
   fear response when the air-blast was absent. In conclusion, the present
   results support the critical contribution of the amygdala during the
   early phases of fear conditioning that leads to quick, robust responses
   to potentially threatening stimuli, a highly adaptive process across all
   species and likely to be present in early infancy. The neonatal amygdala
   lesions also indicated the presence of amygdala-independent alternate
   pathways that are capable to support fear learning in the absence of a
   functional amygdala. This parallel processing of fear responses within
   these alternate pathways was also sufficient to support the ability to
   flexibly modulate the magnitude of the fear responses.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{404-422}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The existence of value coding and salience coding neurons in the
   mammalian brain, including in habenula and ventral tegmental area, has
   sparked considerable interest in the interactions that occur between
   Pavlovian appetitive and aversive conditioning. Here we studied these
   appetitive aversive interactions at the behavioral level by assessing
   the learning that occurs when a Pavlovian appetitive conditioned
   stimulus (conditional stimulus, CS) serves as a CS for shock in
   Pavlovian fear conditioning. A Pavlovian appetitive CS was retarded in
   the rate at which it could be transformed into a fear CS
   (counterconditioning), but the presence of the appetitive CS augmented
   fear learning to a concurrently presented neutral CS
   (superconditioning). Retardation of fear learning was not alleviated by
   manipulations designed to restore the associability of the appetitive CS
   before fear conditioning but was alleviated by manipulations designed to
   increase the aversive quality of the shock unconditioned stimulus (US).
   These findings are consistent with opponent interactions between the
   appetitive and aversive motivational systems and provide a behavioral
   approach for assessing the neural correlates of these appetitive
   aversive interactions.}},

Volume = {{126}},

Abstract = {{The underlying molecular mechanisms of drug abuse and addiction
   behaviors are poorly understood. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)
   provide a simple, whole animal model with conserved molecular pathways
   well suited for studying the foundations of complex diseases.
   Historically, chemotaxis has been a measure used to examine sensory
   approach and avoidance behavior in worms. Chemotaxis can be modulated by
   previous experience, and cue-dependent conditioned learning has been
   demonstrated in C. elegans, but such conditioning with drugs of abuse
   has not been reported. Here we show that pairing a distinctive salt cue
   with a drug (cocaine or methamphetamine) results in a
   concentration-dependent change in preference for the cue that was paired
   with the drug during conditioning. Further, we demonstrate that pairing
   of either drug with a distinctive food type can also increase preference
   for the drug-paired food in the absence of the drug. Dopamine-deficient
   mutants did not develop drug-paired, cue-conditioned responses. The
   findings suggest that, like vertebrates, C. elegans display a
   conditioned preference for environments containing cues previously
   associated with drugs of abuse, and this response is dependent on
   dopamine neurotransmission. This model provides a new and powerful
   method to study the genetic and molecular mechanisms that mediate drug
   preference.}},

Abstract = {{Male rodents typically display an advantage over female conspecifics in
   tasks that assess memory for the identity or location of objects.
   However, the performance of female rodents on object recognition and
   object location tasks often is enhanced by elevated levels of ovarian
   steroids. The novel object-in-place task, combines elements of object
   recognition and object location tasks used to assess rodent object
   memory. Until now, only male rats have been tested on the
   object-in-place task, therefore, a study was conducted to compare the
   performance of males to females under different hormone conditions. Rats
   were given a sample phase to study the locations of four objects in an
   open field. After various delays, a test phase was administered with the
   locations of two objects reversed. Increased investigation of moved
   objects indicates memory for these objects and their original locations.
   Rats were able to discriminate moved from unmoved objects after a brief
   5-min delay, regardless of biological sex or hormone status. However,
   gonadally intact males, but not diestrous females, were able to
   discriminate object locations after a 30-min delay. In contrast,
   ovariectomized females treated with estradiol and progesterone
   discriminated moved from unmoved objects after a 60-min delay while
   ovariectomized vehicle-treated females and gonadally intact males did
   not. Results indicate that female rats outperform males on a memory task
   that combines object recognition and location but only when circulating
   levels of the ovarian steroids, estradiol and progesterone, are elevated
   and only when memory is challenged by an extended retention interval.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable evidence indicates that males navigate large-scale space
   better than females, and some have previously attributed this difference
   to a greater ability of males to select or use an allocentric (cognitive
   mapping) navigational strategy. We directly tested this proposal by
   having males and females navigate in an ``ambiguous{''} virtual Morris
   water maze environment that permitted participants to choose and use
   either an allocentric or an egocentric strategy. A novel probe trial at
   the end of training revealed which strategy each participant had been
   using and showed that the strategy selected by the greatest number of
   males and females was allocentric, and that this bias was even greater
   for females. Traditional measures of navigational performance (distance,
   latency, probe dwell time) indicated that overall, males were more
   efficient than females. However, this gender difference was not related
   to strategy choice: males were better than females regardless of
   strategy, though the difference was significant only in those navigating
   allocentrically. These data indicate that while males may navigate
   allocentrically more efficiently than females, this does not account for
   the male advantage in navigation. The data also indicate that under
   specific circumstances, females may also prefer and use an allocentric
   strategy to navigate. These findings have implications for theories
   regarding the differential use of the hippocampus by men and women.}},

Abstract = {{Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in humans
   caused by an expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that produces
   choreic movements, which are preceded by cognitive deficits. The HD
   transgenic rat (tgHD), which contains the human HD mutation with a 51
   CAG repeat allele, exhibits motor deficits that begin when these rats
   are 12 months of age. However, there are no reports of cognitive
   dysfunction occurring prior to this. To assess whether cognitive
   dysfunction might precede motor deficits in tgHD rats, one group of
   9-month-old male rats with homozygotic mutated genes and one group of
   wild-type (WT) rats underwent three testing phases in a unique Spatial
   Operant Reversal Test (SORT) paradigm, as well as assessment of
   spontaneous motor activity. After testing, morphological and
   histological examination of the brains were made. Results indicated that
   tgHD rats acquired the cued-response (Phase 1) portion of the SORT, but
   made significantly more errors during the reversal (Phase 2) and during
   the pseudorandomized reversals (Phase 3) portion of the study, when
   compared to WT rats. Analysis of the data using mathematical principles
   of reinforcement revealed no memory, motor, or motivational deficits.
   These results indicate that early cognitive dysfunction, as measured by

Abstract = {{Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by lack of paternally derived gene
   expression from the imprinted gene cluster on human chromosome
   15q11-q13. PWS is characterized by severe hypotonia, a failure to thrive
   in infancy and, on emerging from infancy, evidence of learning
   disabilities and overeating behavior due to an abnormal satiety response
   and increased motivation by food. We have previously shown that an
   imprinting center deletion mouse model (PWS-IC) is quicker to acquire a
   preference for, and consume more of a palatable food. Here we examined
   how the use of this palatable food as a reinforcer influences learning
   in PWS-IC mice performing a simple appetitive learning task. On a
   nonspatial maze-based task, PWS-IC mice acquired criteria much quicker,
   making fewer errors during initial acquisition and also reversal
   learning. A manipulation where the reinforcer was devalued impaired
   wild-type performance but had no effect on PWS-IC mice. This suggests
   that increased motivation for the reinforcer in PWS-IC mice may underlie
   their enhanced learning. This supports previous findings in PWS patients
   and is the first behavioral study of an animal model of PWS in which the
   motivation of behavior by food rewards has been examined.}},

Abstract = {{Diets high in saturated fats are linked to health problems and
   impairments in cognitive function in humans. Recent evidence suggests
   that exposure to a high-fat diet can impair rats' ability to
   appropriately inhibit responding to stimuli that are reinforced in some
   circumstances but not in others. Here, we examined the effects of
   exposure to a high-fat diet on the context-specific renewal of
   extinguished responding. Rats first received pairings of a noise
   stimulus with a food reinforcer. After 14 days of exclusive access to
   either a high-fat or a matched control diet, rats received nonreinforced
   presentations (extinction) of the noise in either the same context in
   which they were trained or a different context. Finally, responding to
   the noise was evaluated in the original training context in all rats. In
   control rats, substantial renewal was observed; that is, responding was
   greater if extinction was conducted in a context different from that of
   training and testing. Renewal was significantly less robust in rats fed
   the high-fat diet despite evidence that they were at least as sensitive
   to context change as control rats. Implications of these results for
   models of relapse and treatments for phobias, addiction, and overeating
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between
   movement preparation and excitability of subcortical motor circuits, as
   measured by the reflexive response to a startling acoustic stimulus. We
   compared the size and incidence of activation in the sternocleidomastoid
   (startle indicator) from participants completing either a simple or
   choice reaction time (RT) task. Consistent with predictions, results
   indicated that the startle reflex habituated after several presentations
   of the SAS for the choice RT group but not for the simple RT group,
   which we attributed to advance motor preparatory processes involved in a
   simple RI task. Additionally, when participants from the choice RT group
   were put into a simple RT condition, the startle reflex response
   returned to nonhabituated levels. We conclude that the increased
   corticospinal activation associated with advance preparation may also
   result in increased subcortical activation, accounting for the observed
   lack of habituation to a startling stimulus in simple RT.}},

Abstract = {{Our two closest living primate relatives, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)
   and bonobos (Pan paniscus), exhibit significant behavioral differences
   despite belonging to the same genus and sharing a very recent common
   ancestor. Differences have been reported in multiple aspects of social
   behavior, including aggression, sex, play and cooperation. However, the
   neurobiological basis of these differences has only been minimally
   investigated and remains uncertain. Here, we present the first ever
   comparison of chimpanzee and bonobo brains using diffusion tensor
   imaging, supplemented with a voxel-wise analysis of T1-weighted images
   to specifically compare neural circuitry implicated in social cognition.
   We find that bonobos have more gray matter in brain regions involved in
   perceiving distress in both oneself and others, including the right
   dorsal amygdala and right anterior insula. Bonobos also have a larger
   pathway linking the amygdala with the ventral anterior cingulate cortex,
   a pathway implicated in both top-down control of aggressive impulses as
   well as bottom-up biases against harming others. We suggest that this
   neural system not only supports increased empathic sensitivity in
   bonobos, but also behaviors like sex and play that serve to dissipate
   tension, thereby limiting distress and anxiety to levels conducive with
   prosocial behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The brain's default network (DN) is comprised of several cortical
   regions demonstrating robust intrinsic connectivity at rest. The authors
   sought to examine the differential effects of emotional reasoning and
   reasoning under certainty upon the DN through the employment of an
   event-related fMRI design in healthy participants. Participants were
   presented with syllogistic arguments which were organized into a 2 x 2
   factorial design in which the first factor was emotional salience and
   the second factor was certainty/uncertainty. We demonstrate that regions
   of the DN were activated both during reasoning that is emotionally
   salient and during reasoning which is more certain, suggesting that
   these processes are neurally instantiated on a network level. In
   addition, we present evidence that emotional reasoning preferentially
   activates the dorsomedial (dMPFC) subsystem of the DN, whereas reasoning
   in the context of certainty activates areas specific to the DN's medial
   temporal (MTL) subsystem. We postulate that emotional reasoning
   mobilizes the dMPFC subsystem of the DN because this type of reasoning
   relies upon the recruitment of introspective and self-relevant data such
   as personal bias and temperament. In contrast, activation of the MTL
   subsystem during certainty argues that this form of reasoning involves
   the recruitment of mnemonic and semantic associations to derive
   conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies on moral decision-making have thus far largely
   focused on differences between moral judgments with opposing utilitarian
   (well-being maximizing) and deontological (duty-based) content. However,
   these studies have investigated moral dilemmas involving extreme
   situations, and did not control for two distinct dimensions of moral
   judgment: whether or not it is intuitive (immediately compelling to most
   people) and whether it is utilitarian or deontological in content. By
   contrasting dilemmas where utilitarian judgments are counterintuitive
   with dilemmas in which they are intuitive, we were able to use
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural correlates
   of intuitive and counterintuitive judgments across a range of moral
   situations. Irrespective of content (utilitarian/deontological),
   counterintuitive moral judgments were associated with greater difficulty
   and with activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting
   that such judgments may involve emotional conflict; intuitive judgments
   were linked to activation in the visual and premotor cortex. In
   addition, we obtained evidence that neural differences in moral judgment
   in such dilemmas are largely due to whether they are intuitive and not,
   as previously assumed, to differences between utilitarian and
   deontological judgments. Our findings therefore do not support theories
   that have generally associated utilitarian and deontological judgments
   with distinct neural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Acute stress has been shown to impair working memory (WM), and to
   decrease prefrontal activation during WM in healthy humans. Stress also
   enhances amygdala responses towards emotional stimuli. Stress might thus
   be specifically detrimental to WM when one is distracted by emotional
   stimuli. Usually, emotional stimuli presented as distracters in a WM
   task slow down performance, while evoking more activation in ventral
   `affective' brain areas, and a relative deactivation in dorsal
   `executive' areas. We hypothesized that after acute social stress, this
   reciprocal dorsal-ventral pattern would be shifted towards greater
   increase of ventral `affective' activation during emotional distraction,
   while impairing WM performance. To investigate this, 34 healthy men,
   randomly assigned to a social stress or control condition, performed a
   Sternberg WM task with emotional and neutral distracters inside an MRI
   scanner. Results showed that WM performance after stress tended to be
   slower during emotional distraction. Brain activations during emotional
   distraction was enhanced in ventral affective areas, while dorsal
   executive areas tended to show less deactivation after stress. These
   results suggest that acute stress shifts priority towards processing of
   emotionally significant stimuli, at the cost of WM performance.}},

Abstract = {{The reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) relates individual
   differences in reward sensitivity to the activation of the behavioral
   approach system (BAS). Dopamine-related brain structures have been
   repeatedly associated with reward processing, but also with cognitive
   processes such as task switching. In the present study, we examined the
   association between reward sensitivity and the event-related fMRI BOLD
   response with set switching in 31 males. As expected, the right inferior
   frontal cortex (rIFG) and the striatum (i.e. the left putamen) were
   involved in set-switching activity for the overall sample.
   Interindividual differences in Gray's reward sensitivity were related to
   stronger activity in the rIFG and the ventral striatum. Thus, trait
   reward sensitivity contributed to the modulation of brain responsiveness
   in set-switching tasks. Having considered previous research, we propose
   that higher BAS activity is associated with a stronger reward to process
   a better implementation of goal-directed tasks and the diminished
   processing of secondary cues.}},

Abstract = {{Affective priming effects denote faster responses when two successively
   presented affective stimuli match in valence than when they mismatch.
   Two mechanisms have been proposed for their explanation: (i) Priming of
   affective information within a semantic network or distributed memory
   system (semantic priming). (ii) Automatic activation of the evaluative
   response through the affective prime (response priming). In this
   experiment, we sought more direct evidence for prime-induced response
   activations with measurement of the lateralized readiness potential
   (LRP). Onset of the stimulus-locked LRP was earlier in affectively
   congruent trials than in incongruent trials. In addition, priming
   modulated the LRP-amplitude of slow responses, indicating greater
   activation of the incorrect response hand in affectively incongruent
   trials. Onset of the response-locked LRP and peak latency of the P300
   component were not modulated by priming but the amplitude of the N400
   component was. In combination, these results suggest that both, semantic
   priming and response priming constitute affective priming effects in the
   evaluative categorization task.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately reading the body language of others may be vital for
   navigating the social world, and this ability may be influenced by
   factors, such as our gender, personality characteristics and
   neurocognitive processes. This fMRI study examined the brain activation
   of 26 healthy individuals (14 women and 12 men) while they judged the
   action performed or the emotion felt by stick figure characters
   appearing in different postures. In both tasks, participants activated
   areas associated with visual representation of the body, motion
   processing and emotion recognition. Behaviorally, participants
   demonstrated greater ease in judging the physical actions of the
   characters compared to judging their emotional states, and participants
   showed more activation in areas associated with emotion processing in
   the emotion detection task, whereas they showed more activation in
   visual, spatial and action-related areas in the physical action task.
   Gender differences emerged in brain responses, such that men showed
   greater activation than women in the left dorsal premotor cortex in both
   tasks. Finally, participants higher in self-reported empathy
   demonstrated greater activation in areas associated with
   self-referential processing and emotion interpretation. These results

Abstract = {{Little is known about the time course of the mechanisms involved in the
   on-line processing of socio-emotional information. We used event-related
   brain potentials (ERPs) to investigate this issue using vignettes that
   described prototypical, social scenarios. An initial sentence
   established the social context and the following target sentence ended
   with a critical word that informed the reader of the character's
   socio-emotional response to the situation. Critical words that
   mismatched rather than matched with a character's expected feelings
   elicited a larger ERP negativity (N400) similar to 200-500 ms after word
   onset, followed by a larger frontal positivity. Dipole source modeling
   results indicated that an anterior temporal lobe source accounted for
   the N400-like effect, which we attribute to the increased demands of
   integrating general knowledge about social situations (e.g. scripts)
   with personal- and context-specific information. An additional
   mediofrontal source contributed to the later ERP effect and presumably
   reflects high-level mindreading functions. Together, these findings

Abstract = {{Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) analyses have
   identified intrinsic neural networks supporting domain-general cognitive
   functions including language, attention, executive control and memory.
   The brain, however, also has a domain-specific organization, including
   regions that contribute to perceiving and knowing about others (the
   `social' system) or manipulable objects designed to perform specific
   functions (the `tool' system). These `social' and `tool' systems,
   however, might not constitute intrinsic neural networks per se, but
   rather only come online as needed to support retrieval of
   domain-specific information during social- or tool-related cognitive
   tasks. To address this issue, we functionally localized two regions in
   lateral temporal cortex activated when subjects perform social- and tool
   conceptual tasks. We then compared the strength of the correlations with
   these seed regions during rs-fcMRI. Here, we show that the `social' and
   `tool' neural networks are maintained even when subjects are not engaged
   in social- and tool-related information processing, and so constitute

   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine whether
   induced stress resulted in gender-specific patterns of brain activation

   manipulated physiological stress levels using a cold pressor task, prior
   to a risky decision making task. Healthy men (n = 24, 12 stressed) and
   women (n = 23, 11 stressed) completed the decision task after either
   cold pressor stress or a control task during the period of cortisol
   response to the cold pressor. Gender differences in behavior were
   present in stressed participants but not controls, such that stress led
   to greater reward collection and faster decision speed in males but less
   reward collection and slower decision speed in females. A
   gender-by-stress interaction was observed for the dorsal striatum and
   anterior insula. With cold stress, activation in these regions was
   increased in males but decreased in females. The findings of this study

Abstract = {{Video games are an exciting part of new media. Although game play has
   been intensively studied, the underlying neurobiology is still poorly
   understood. Flow theory is a well-established model developed to
   describe subjective game experience. In 13 healthy male subjects, we
   acquired fMRI data during free play of a video game and analyzed brain
   activity based on the game content. In accordance with flow theory, we
   extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance
   between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii)
   direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control
   over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by
   specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be
   assessed-at least partially-by content factors contributing to the
   emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by
   specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing
   reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and
   sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in
   the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for
   flow experience. Flow factors can be validated with functional brain
   imaging which can improve the understanding of human emotions and
   motivational processes during media entertainment.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Studies have shown that in adult animals the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) is a critical brain region involved in fear regulation, with the
   prelimbic (PL) subregion being important for fear expression. However,
   few studies have examined whether the PL cortex is also involved in fear
   expression in infant animals. Five experiments, using
   immunohistochemical and temporary inactivation procedures, assessed the
   role of the PL in the expression of learned fear in postnatal day (PND)
   18 (infant) and PND25 (juvenile) rats. We found that in juvenile rats
   expressing fear (measured through freezing) there was an increase in the
   number of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase
   (pMAPK)-labeled neurons in the PL; this increase was not observed in the
   infralimbic cortex. Furthermore, inactivation of the PL at test, using
   muscimol, decreased freezing in the juvenile rat. In contrast,
   expression of learned fear in infant rats did not require the PL, as
   there was neither an increase in the number of pMAPK-labeled cells in
   the PL nor was there any effect of PL inactivation on freezing levels.
   Taken together, these experiments suggest that a different neural
   circuitry underlies fear regulation early in life and that the lack of
   mPFC involvement may reflect a less flexible emotional regulation system
   in infant animals.}},

Abstract = {{Although the thalamus and/or mammillary bodies are the primary sites of
   neuropathology in cases of diencephalic amnesia such as Wernicke
   Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS), there is also functional deactivation of
   certain cortical regions that contribute to the cognitive dysfunction.
   Acetylcholine (ACh) is a key neurotransmitter that modulates neural
   processing within the cortex and between the thalamus and cortex. In the
   pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD) rat model of WKS, there
   are significant reductions in cholinergic innervation and behaviorally
   stimulated ACh efflux in the frontal (FC) and retrosplenial (RSC)
   cortices. In the present study. ACh released levels were
   site-specifically amplified with physostigmine (0.5 mu g, 1.0 mu g) in
   the FC and the RSC, which was confirmed with in vivo microdialysis.
   Although physostigmine sustained high ACh levels in both cortical
   regions, the effects on spatial memory, assessed by spontaneous
   alternation, were different as a function of region (FC, RSC) and
   treatment (PTD, pair-fed {[}PF]). Higher ACh levels in the FC recovered
   the rate of alternation in PTD rats as well as reduced arm-reentry
   perseverative errors. However, higher ACh levels within the FC of PF
   rats exacerbated arm-reentry perseverative errors without significantly
   affecting alternation rates. Maintaining high ACh levels in the RSC had
   no procognitive effects in PTD rats, but rather impaired alternation
   behavior in PF rats. These results demonstrate that diverse cortical
   regions respond differently to intensified ACh levels-and the effects
   are dependent on thalamic pathology. Thus, pharmacotherapeutics aimed at
   enhancing cognitive functions must account for the unique features of
   cortical ACh stimulation and the connective circuitry with the thalamus.}},

Abstract = {{The postsubiculum is a structure of interest because it projects to the
   hippocampal formation and contains head direction cells, grid cells, and

   trained on a homing task on a large circular platform. After exhibiting
   stable homing, one group of animals (n = 6) received ibotenic acid
   lesions of the postsubiculum, and a second (n = 5) underwent a control
   surgery. After recovery, animals with postsubiculum lesions homed as
   accurately as the control animals. Subsequent testing on a delayed
   alternation T maze task showed that the lesioned animals were
   significantly worse than the control animals at delays of 5-, 30-, and
   60-s. These findings suggest that the postsubiculum is necessary for
   memory and avoidance of previously visited locations but is not
   necessary for homing.}},

Abstract = {{DBA/2 mice have altered hippocampal structure and perform poorly in
   several hippocampus-dependent contextual/spatial learning tasks. The
   performance of this strain in higher cognitive tasks is less studied.
   Transitive inference is a hippocampus-dependent task that requires an
   abstraction to be made from prior rules to form a new decision matrix;
   performance of DBA/2 mice in this task is unknown, whereas contextual
   fear conditioning is a hippocampus-dependent task in which DBA/2 mice
   have deficits. The present study compared DBA/2J and C57BL/6J inbred
   mice in two different contextual fear conditioning paradigms and
   transitive inference to test whether similar deficits are seen across
   these hippocampus-dependent tasks. For background fear conditioning,
   mice were trained with two paired presentations of an auditory
   conditioned stimulus (CS, 30 seconds, 85 dB white noise) paired with an
   unconditioned stimulus (US, 2 seconds, 0.57 mA footshock), the context
   was a continuous background CS. Mice were tested for contextual learning
   24 hours later. Foreground fear conditioning differed in that no
   auditory CS was presented. For transitive inference, separate mice were
   trained to acquire a series of overlapping odor discrimination problems
   and tested with novel odor pairings that either did or did not require
   the use of transitive inference. DBA/2 mice performed significantly
   worse than the C57BL/6 in both foreground and background fear
   conditioning and transitive inference. These results demonstrate that
   the DBA/2 mice have deficits in higher-cognitive processes and suggest
   that similar substrates may underlie deficits in contextual learning and
   transitive inference.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{258-269}},

Abstract = {{Involvement of the dorsal hippocampus (DHPC) in acquisition of Pavlovian
   trace conditioning and interval timing was examined in an appetitive
   preparation in which presentations of one conditioned stimulus (CS) were
   immediately followed by food (delay conditioning), and presentations of
   another CS were followed by food 15 seconds after its termination (trace
   conditioning). DHPC lesions did not disrupt acquisition of trace
   conditioning, but they selectively affected the distribution of
   conditioned responding over the course of the trace CS in the early
   stage of acquisition. In addition, lesions disrupted accuracy of timing
   the conditioned response (CR) for both delay and trace CSs: The control
   subjects showed maximum CR at the time of food delivery, but in the
   DHPC-lesioned subjects, the maximum CR was at an earlier time point.
   This timing deficit did not seem to be due to impulsive responding or
   deficits in response inhibition because, when the early portion of the
   delay CS was interrupted shortly by an empty interval, the difference in
   the time of maximum responding between the lesioned and control subjects
   was eliminated. Thus, although the involvement of the DHPC in appetitive
   trace conditioning was not found when a gross measure of conditioning
   was employed, it was revealed when the temporal distribution of
   conditioned responding was examined on a moment-by-moment basis as in
   eyeblink trace conditioning studies.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the involvement of the amygdala in a task in which object
   choices were guided by internal context. Rhesus monkeys were trained on
   a biconditional discrimination whereby objects associated with food (but

   associated with water (but not food) were baited when the monkey was
   thirsty. To solve this task, monkeys were required to choose objects
   yielding the reward congruent with their internal motivational state.
   Lesions of the amygdala did not disrupt learning or performance of this
   task. We conclude that the involvement of the amygdala in
   selective-satiation tasks, which depends in part on a change in internal
   context, is not due to the amygdala playing a general role in
   representing, or using, internal context.}},

Abstract = {{Prior reinforcement of a neutral stimulus often blocks subsequent
   conditioning of a new stimulus if a compound of the original and new
   cues is paired with the same reinforcer. However, if the value of the
   reinforcer is altered when the compound is presented, the new cue
   typically acquires conditioning, a result called unblocking. Blocking,
   unblocking, and related phenomena have been attributed to variations in
   processing of either the reinforcer, for example, the Rescorla-Wagner
   (1972) model, or cues, for example, the Pearce-Hall (1980) model. Here,
   we examined the effects of lesions of the basolateral amygdala on the
   occurrence of unblocking when the food reinforcer was increased in
   quantity at the time of introduction of the new cue. The lesions had no
   effects on unblocking in a simple design (Experiment 1), which did not
   distinguish between unblocking produced by variations in reward or cue
   processing. However, in a procedure that distinguished between
   unblocking due to direct conditioning by the added reinforcer,
   consistent with the Rescorla-Wagner (1972) model, and that due to
   increases in conditioning to the original reinforcer, consistent with
   the Pearce-Hall (1980) and other models of learning, the lesions
   prevented unblocking of the latter type. These results were discussed in
   the context of roles of the basolateral amygdala in coding and using
   reward prediction error information in associative learning.}},

Abstract = {{Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is an operational measure of sensorimotor
   gating. It is defined as a reduction in magnitude of a startle response
   when a startling stimulus is preceded by a weaker ``prepulse.{''} PPI
   has been found to be altered in patients with schizophrenia, autism
   spectrum disorders, and other neuropsychiatric illnesses. As such, the
   neural substrates regulating PPI are of particular interest. Previous
   studies using lesions, selective blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
   receptors, and pharmacological disinhibition have demonstrated that
   impairment of the function of the basolateral and lateral nuclei of the
   amygdala (BLA) disrupts PPI. However, transient gamma aminobutyric
   acid-mediated (GABA-mediated) inactivation of BLA has not been evaluated
   for effects on PPI. Furthermore, the downstream projection targets that
   mediate BLA-evoked disruptions of PPI have not been elucidated. Thus, in
   the present study, we evaluated the effect on PPI of bilateral and
   unilateral inactivation of BLA, by microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor
   agonist, muscimol. We found that either bilateral or unilateral
   inactivation impaired PPI. Because unilateral inactivation was
   sufficient to impair PPI, we hypothesized that this was due to an
   indirect activation of a downstream target of BLA, the ventral pallidum
   (VP). Because VP inhibition normalizes PPI deficits evoked from nucleus
   accumbens (Kodsi \& Swerdlow, 1994), we next tested the degree to which
   VP inhibition would normalize PPI deficits evoked from BLA. We
   unilaterally inactivated BLA with concurrent inactivation of VP and
   found that VP inactivation blocked BLA-evoked deficits in PPI. We
   suggest that BLA inactivation disrupts PPI through disinhibition of VP.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the multisensory input into the balance system, the loss of one
   input, such as an ear, can generally be compensated for. However, when a
   mismatch or incomplete loss of inputs occurs, the ability to compensate
   for the stimulus misrepresentation may be compromised. The inner ear and
   cerebellum are important input and processing centers for balance but no
   genetic models have been generated to assess balance or compensation in
   the abnormal development of both these organs/brain areas. Important to
   their formation is regulation of proliferation mediated by the
   proto-oncogene N-Myc. Conditional knockouts (CKOs) of N-Myc using
   Tg(Pax2-Cre) have a misshapen and smaller ear with a fused utricle,
   saccule, and cochlea and absent horizontal canal, aberrant cochlear and
   vestibular innervations, and a size reduction in the cerebellum. CKOs
   are viable with obvious behavioral deficits, including circling behavior
   and unstable gait. To test the degree of ataxia and possible
   compensation of vestibular defects in these mutant mice, we use the
   Noldus Catwalk System to assess the gait of Tg(Pax2-Cre) N-Myc CKOs over
   five months. N-Myc CKOs perform worse than control littermates, in
   particular, in step regularity. We show that disrupting one member of
   the Myc family during embryonic development coincides with a
   differential loss of function in the cochlea compared to the vestibular
   apparatus. In addition, we show that the distortion in the ear
   morphology combined with a reduction of the cerebellum, rather than a
   complete loss of the vestibular-cerebellar pathway, leads to partial
   behavioral compensation that remains unchanged over time.}},

Title = {{Pure-Tone Auditory Thresholds Are Not Chronically Elevated in Multiple

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that acute cases of multiple sclerosis (MS)-related
   pure-tone hearing loss have been reported in the literature, consensus
   is lacking as to the chronic influences of MS on pure-tone thresholds.
   Most studies examining such influences have been limited by small sample
   sizes, lack of statistical comparisons between patients and controls,
   and confounding of the hearing measure with influences from sex and age.
   To date, associations between pure-tone thresholds and central
   MS-related brain lesions have not been assessed. In this study,
   pure-tone thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 8 kHz were measured in 73 MS
   patients and 73 individually age- and gender-matched normal controls. In
   63 MS patients, correlations were computed between the threshold values
   and MRI-determined lesion activity in 26 central brain regions. Although
   thresholds were strongly influenced by sex, age, and tonal frequency, no
   meaningful influences of MS were discerned. Moreover, no significant
   association between the threshold values and central MS-related lesion
   activity was evident in any brain region evaluated. This study, the
   largest on this topic to use carefully matched control subjects and the
   sole study to assess relationships between auditory thresholds and
   central MS-related lesions, strongly suggests that (a) MS is not
   chronically associated with pure-tone hearing loss and (b) pure-tone
   thresholds are unrelated to MS lesion activity in higher brain regions.
   These findings, along with general reports from the literature, support
   the concept that when MS-related hearing threshold deficits are found,
   they are episodic and primarily dependent on lesions within the eighth
   nerve or brainstem.}},

Abstract = {{In rhesus monkeys, the magnitude of the cochlear response to auditory
   stimuli (click-evoked otoacoustic emissions, {[}CEOAEs]) is correlated

   study investigated the association between circulating testosterone and

   and saliva was analyzed to quantify bioavailable testosterone. A sex
   difference in CEOAE response amplitude was found, confirming previous
   reports. In agreement with the monkey work, seasonal variation in the
   CEOAE response amplitude also was identified. CEOAEs were greater in
   summer and fall, the seasons that showed the lowest levels of
   circulating testosterone. On an individual basis, men who had higher
   levels of testosterone at the time of assessment exhibited smaller CEOAE
   response amplitudes. These findings support previous data from rhesus
   macaques and are consistent with the prospect of an activational effect

Abstract = {{Regulation of dopamine neurotransmission is essential for cognitive
   processes. In humans and rodents, the relationship between dopamine
   signaling and cognitive performance is described as a dose-dependent,
   inverted-U curve whereby excess or insufficiency of dopamine in
   prefrontal cortex has detrimental effects. Previous studies have
   indicated that prefrontal dopamine levels are associated with genetic
   variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a regulatory enzyme
   that controls dopamine availability. Furthermore, smokers who carry the
   high-activity COMT-Val allele are more prone to cognitive deficits and
   have an increased risk of smoking relapse. The present study employed
   transgenic mice expressing the human COMT-Val variant to determine the
   effects of the high-activity COMT allele on electrophysiological
   markers, including the P20, N40, and P80 components of the auditory
   event-related potential, as well as baseline and auditory event-related
   power and phase-synchrony in theta and gamma ranges. We also examined
   the effects of nicotine on these measures to investigate the potential
   effects of smoking on COMT-mediated electrophysiological activity.
   COMT-Val-tg mice displayed increased N40 latency and decreased P80
   amplitude as well as reduced baseline theta and gamma power. Nicotine
   increased P20 and P80 amplitudes, decreased N40 amplitude, increased P20
   and N40 latencies, and reduced P80 latency. Nicotine also increased the
   event-related power and phase synchrony, yielding an increase in
   signal-to-noise ratio across theta and gamma ranges. COMT activity
   specifically alters long-latency components of the event-related
   response. Nicotine restored normal event-related activity among
   COMT-Val-tg mice, suggesting one mechanism through which nicotine may
   normalize cognitive function among people with the high-activity allele.}},

   stress decreased rats' open-arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze in
   both male and female rats. Early adolescent stress also increased the
   duration of time rats spent burying in the shock-probe test and the
   duration of time they spent immobile in the forced swim test, but these
   effects were only seen in males. Stress in mid-adolescence did not
   increase rats' anxiety-related responding in adulthood. Instead, we
   observed paradoxical increases in open-arm exploration and only modest
   increases in shock-probe burying that failed to reach significance.
   Mid-adolescent stress also tended to increase depression-related
   immobility in the swim test. Thus, the current findings underscore the
   importance of timing of adolescent adversity to long-term outcomes. It
   appears that stress in early adolescence leads to a broader range of
   outcomes in adulthood, at least in male rats. By contrast, stress in
   mid-adolescence might have more predominant effects on risk-taking
   behavior (indexed by increases in open-arm activity), a possibility that
   merits further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Dietary essential fatty acids have been shown to regulate behavioral and
   cognitive functions in rodents. However, the long-term effect on
   behavior, besides memory and learning, of essential fatty acid
   deficiency (EFAD), i.e., lack of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, during the
   perinatal period has not been investigated. Therefore, pregnant C57B1/6
   mice were given either an EFAD or an isoenergetic control diet from
   gestational day 16 and throughout lactation. The female offspring were
   given standard chow from 3 weeks of age, and at 12 to 14 weeks of age,
   open-field, object recognition, light-dark transition, elevated plus
   maze, and social interaction tests were performed. The brain
   glycerophospholipid fatty acid composition was investigated in
   3-week-old and adult offspring by gas chromatography. The differences
   observed in behavior were indicative of lower anxiety in the EFAD mice
   compared to controls illustrated by more time spent in the open arms of
   the elevated plus maze (+ 41\%, p < .05) and in the light compartment in
   the light-dark transition test (+ 63\%, p < .05). The proportion of
   total n-3 fatty acids, especially 22:6n-3 in the brain, was lower with a
   compensatory increase in the proportion of total n-6 fatty acids,
   foremost 22:5n-6, in the EFAD mice compared to controls at 3 weeks of
   age. In the adult brains the fatty acid composition was normalized. In
   conclusion, our data show that EFAD during the perinatal period results
   in short-term alterations of fatty acid composition in brain and
   decreased anxiety in adult life.}},

   distinctive responses were found to the mismatch between appearance and

   to each other, they were stronger for the android, notably in bilateral
   anterior intraparietal sulcus, a key node in the APS. These results

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation plays a crucial role in adaptive functioning and
   mounting evidence suggests that some emotion regulation strategies are
   often more effective than others. However, little attention has been
   paid to the different ways emotions can be generated: from the
   `bottom-up' (in response to inherently emotional perceptual properties
   of the stimulus) or `top-down' (in response to cognitive evaluations).
   Based on a process priming principle, we hypothesized that mode of
   emotion generation would interact with subsequent emotion regulation.
   Specifically, we predicted that top-down emotions would be more
   successfully regulated by a top-down regulation strategy than bottom-up
   emotions. To test this hypothesis, we induced bottom-up and top-down
   emotions, and asked participants to decrease the negative impact of
   these emotions using cognitive reappraisal. We observed the predicted
   interaction between generation and regulation in two measures of
   emotional responding. As measured by self-reported affect, cognitive
   reappraisal was more successful on top-down generated emotions than
   bottom-up generated emotions. Neurally, reappraisal of bottom-up
   generated emotions resulted in a paradoxical increase of amygdala
   activity. This interaction between mode of emotion generation and
   subsequent regulation should be taken into account when comparing of the
   efficacy of different types of emotion regulation, as well as when
   reappraisal is used to treat different types of clinical disorders.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{263-273}},

Abstract = {{Emotional processing is influenced by cognitive processes and vice
   versa, indicating a profound interaction of these domains. The
   investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying this interaction is
   not only highly relevant for understanding the organization of human
   brain function. Rather, it may also help in understanding dysregulated
   emotions in affective disorders and in elucidating the neurobiology of
   cognitive behavioural therapy (e. g. in borderline personality
   disorder), which aims at modulating dysfunctional emotion processes by
   cognitive techniques, such as restructuring. In the majority of earlier
   studies investigating the interaction of emotions and cognition, the
   main focus has been on the investigation of the effects of emotional
   stimuli or, more general, emotional processing, e. g. instituted by
   emotional material that needed to be processed, on cognitive performance
   and neural activation patterns. Here we pursued the opposite approach
   and investigated the modulation of implicit processing of emotional
   stimuli by cognitive demands using an event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging-study on a motor short-term memory paradigm with
   emotional interferences. Subjects were visually presented a
   finger-sequence consisting either of four (easy condition) or six
   (difficult condition) items, which they had to memorize. After a short
   pause positive, negative or neutral International affective picture
   system pictures or a green dot (as control condition) were presented.
   Subjects were instructed to reproduce the memorized sequence manually as
   soon as the picture disappeared. Analysis showed that with increasing
   cognitive demand (long relative to short sequences), neural responses to
   emotional pictures were significantly reduced in amygdala and
   orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, the more difficult task evoked
   stronger activation in a widespread frontoparietal network. As stimuli
   were task-relevant go-cues and hence had to be processed perceptually,
   we would interpret this as a specific attenuation of affective responses
   by concurrent cognitive processing-potentially reflecting a relocation
   of resources mediated by the frontoparietal network.}},

Abstract = {{Learning to make choices that yield rewarding outcomes requires the
   computation of three distinct signals: stimulus values that are used to
   guide choices at the time of decision making, experienced utility
   signals that are used to evaluate the outcomes of those decisions and
   prediction errors that are used to update the values assigned to stimuli
   during reward learning. Here we investigated whether monetary and social
   rewards involve overlapping neural substrates during these computations.
   Subjects engaged in two probabilistic reward learning tasks that were
   identical except that rewards were either social (pictures of smiling or
   angry people) or monetary (gaining or losing money). We found
   substantial overlap between the two types of rewards for all components
   of the learning process: a common area of ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC) correlated with stimulus value at the time of choice and another
   common area of vmPFC correlated with reward magnitude and common areas
   in the striatum correlated with prediction errors. Taken together, the
   findings support the hypothesis that shared anatomical substrates are
   involved in the computation of both monetary and social rewards.}},

Abstract = {{Humans daily face social situations involving conflicts between
   competing moral decision. Despite a substantial amount of studies
   published over the past 10 years, the respective role of emotions and
   reason, their possible interaction, and their behavioural expression
   during moral evaluation remains an unresolved issue. A dualistic
   approach to moral evaluation proposes that the right dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (rDLPFc) controls emotional impulses. However, recent
   findings raise the possibility that the right DLPFc processes emotional
   information during moral decision making. We used repetitive
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to transiently disrupt rDLPFc
   activity before measuring decision making in the context of moral
   dilemmas. Results reveal an increase of the probability of utilitarian
   responses during objective evaluation of moral dilemmas in the rTMS
   group (compared to a SHAM one). This suggests that the right DLPFc
   function not only participates to a rational cognitive control process,
   but also integrates emotions generated by contextual information
   appraisal, which are decisive for response selection in moral
   judgements.}},

Abstract = {{The error-related negativity (ERN) is an event-related potential (ERP)
   that indexes error monitoring. Research suggests that the ERN is
   increased in internalizing disorders, such as depression and anxiety.
   Although studies indicate that the ERN is insensitive to state-related
   fluctuations in anxiety, few studies have carefully examined the effect
   of state-related changes in sadness on the ERN. In the current study, we
   sought to determine whether the ERN would be altered by a sad mood
   induction using a between-subjects design. Additionally, we explored if
   this relationship would be moderated by individual differences in
   neuroticism-a personality trait related to both anxiety and depression.
   Forty-seven undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to either
   a sad or neutral mood induction prior to performing an arrow version of
   the flanker task. Participants reported greater sadness following the
   sad than neutral mood induction; there were no significant group
   differences on behavioral or ERP measures. Across the entire sample,
   however, participants with a larger increase in sad mood from baseline
   to post-induction had a larger (i.e. more negative) ERN. Furthermore,
   this effect was larger among individuals reporting higher neuroticism.
   These data indicate that neuroticism moderates the relationship between
   the ERN and changes in sad mood.}},

Abstract = {{Since people with low status are more likely to experience social
   evaluative threat and are therefore more inclined to monitor for these
   threats and inhibit approach behaviour, we expected that low-status
   subjects would be more engaged in evaluating their own performance,
   compared with high-status subjects. We created a highly salient social
   hierarchy based on the performance of a simple time estimation task.
   Subjects could achieve high, middle or low status while performing this
   task simultaneously with other two players who were either higher or
   lower in status. Subjects received feedback on their own performance, as
   well as on the performance of the other two players simultaneously.
   Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from all three participants.
   The results showed that medial frontal negativity (an event-related
   potential reflecting performance evaluation) was significantly enhanced
   for low-status subjects. Implications for status-related differences in

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{322-331}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with low self-esteem have been found to react more
   negatively to signs of interpersonal rejection than those with high
   self-esteem. However, previous research has found that individual
   differences in attentional control can attenuate negative reactions to
   social rejection among vulnerable, low self-esteem individuals. The
   current fMRI study sought to elucidate the neurobiological substrate of
   this buffering effect. We hypothesized and found that while looking at
   scenes of social rejection (vs negative scenes) low self-esteem high
   attentional control individuals engaged the rostral anterior cingulate
   cortex (rACC), an area of the brain associated with emotional control,
   more than their low self-esteem low attentional control peers.
   Furthermore, we found that low self-esteem high attentional control
   individuals evaluated social rejection as less arousing and less
   rejecting in a separate behavioral task. Importantly, activation in the
   rACC fully mediated the relationship between the interaction of
   self-esteem and attentional control and emotional evaluations,
   suggesting that the rACC activation underlies the buffering effects of
   attentional control. Results are discussed in terms of individual
   differences in emotional vulnerability and protection and by
   highlighting the role of rACC in emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Among a range of cognitive functions of the amygdala, recent studies
   suggest its involvement in identification of the pupil size. To further
   address its role, we investigated the response of the amygdala to human
   and cat faces with varied pupil size, taking into account the effect of
   the gender and subjective attractiveness ratings. Twenty-seven subjects
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing faces with
   large and small pupils. Large pupil faces induced increased activation
   in the amygdala, without interactions with either subject or stimuli
   gender, although no equivalent activation differences were seen for cat
   face stimuli. The activation differences were irrespective of the
   perceived attractiveness, and without explicit knowledge about the
   manipulation of the pupil size. These data support the idea that the
   amygdala is responsive not only to explicit or implicit fear, abhorrence
   or preference, but also to other elements that might suggest heightened
   vigilance of biologically relevant stimuli, which does not necessarily
   require subjective awareness.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between anger and aggression is imperfect. Based on
   work on the neuroscience of anger, we predicted that anger associated
   with greater relative left frontal cortical activation would be more
   likely to result in aggression. To test this hypothesis, we combined
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the frontal cortex
   with interpersonal provocation. Participants received insulting feedback
   after 15 min of tDCS and were able to aggress by administering noise
   blasts to the insulting participant. Individuals who received tDCS to
   increase relative left frontal cortical activity behaved more
   aggressively when they were angry. No relation between anger and
   aggression was observed in the increase relative right frontal cortical
   activity or sham condition. These results concur with the motivational
   direction model of frontal asymmetry, in which left frontal activity is
   associated with anger. We propose that anger with approach motivational
   tendencies is more likely to result in aggression.}},

Abstract = {{The current study takes a new approach to understand the neural systems
   that support emotion-congruent judgment. The bulk of previous neural
   research has inferred emotional influences on judgment from
   disadvantageous judgments or non-random individual differences. The
   current study manipulated the influence of emotional information on
   judgments of stimuli that were equivocally composed of positive and
   negative attributes. Emotion-congruent processing was operationalized in
   two ways: neural activation significantly associated with primes that
   lead to emotionally congruent judgments and neural activation
   significantly associated with judgments that were preceded by
   emotionally congruent primes. Distinct regions of medial orbitofrontal
   cortex were associated with these patterns of emotion-congruent
   processing. Judgments that were incongruent with preceding primes were
   associated with dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex and lateral orbitofrontal cortex activity. The current study
   demonstrates a new approach to investigate the neural systems associated
   with emotion-congruent judgment. The findings suggest that medial OFC
   may support attentional processes that underlie emotion-congruent
   judgment.}},

Abstract = {{There are increasing reports of people experiencing pain when observing
   pain in another. This describes the phenomenon of synaesthetic pain
   which, until recently, had been primarily reported in amputees with
   phantom pain. In the current study, we used electroencephalography (EEG)
   to investigate how amputees who experience synaesthetic pain process
   pain observed in another. Participants were grouped according to
   amputees who experience phantom and synaesthetic pain (n=8), amputees
   who experience phantom pain but not synaesthetic pain (n=10) and healthy
   controls (n=10). Participants underwent EEG as they observed still
   images of hands and feet in potentially painful and non-painful
   situations. We found that pain synaesthetes showed some reduced
   event-related potential (ERP) components at certain electrode sites, and
   reduced theta- and alpha band power amplitude at a central electrode.
   The finding of reduced ERP amplitude and theta band power may reflect
   inhibition of the processing of observed pain (e.g. avoidance/guarding
   as a protective strategy), and reduced alpha band power may indicate a
   disinhibition in control processes that may result in synaesthetic pain.
   These results provide the first documentation of atypical
   neurophysiological activity in amputees who experience synaesthetic pain
   when processing pain in another.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated depression-related differences in primiparous
   mothers' neural response to their own infant's distress cues. Mothers
   diagnosed with major depressive disorder (n = 11) and comparison mothers
   with no diagnosable psychopathology (n = 11) were exposed to their own
   18-months-old infant's cry sound, as well as unfamiliar infant's cry and
   control sound, during functional neuroimaging. Depressed mothers'
   response to own infant cry greater than other sounds was compared to
   non-depressed mothers' response in the whole brain {[}false discovery
   rate (FDR) corrected]. A continuous measure of self-reported depressive
   symptoms (CESD) was also tested as a predictor of maternal response.
   Non-depressed mothers activated to their own infant's cry greater than
   control sound in a distributed network of para/limbic and prefrontal
   regions, whereas depressed mothers as a group failed to show activation.
   Non-depressed compared to depressed mothers showed significantly greater
   striatal (caudate, nucleus accumbens) and medial thalamic activation.
   Additionally, mothers with lower depressive symptoms activated more
   strongly in left orbitofrontal, dorsal anterior cingulate and medial
   superior frontal regions. Non-depressed compared to depressed mothers
   activated uniquely to own infant greater than other infant cry in
   occipital fusiform areas. Disturbance of these neural networks involved
   in emotional response and regulation may help to explain parenting
   deficits in depressed mothers.}},

Abstract = {{Although empathic responses to stimuli with emotional contents may occur
   automatically, humans are capable to intentionally empathize with other
   individuals. Intentional empathy for others is even possible when they
   do not show emotional expressions. However, little is known about the
   neuronal mechanisms of this intentionally controlled empathic process.
   To investigate the neuronal substrates underlying intentional empathy,
   we scanned 20 healthy Chinese subjects, using fMRI, when they tried to
   feel inside the emotional states of neutral or angry faces of familiar
   (Asian) and unfamiliar (Caucasian) models. Skin color evaluation of the
   same stimuli served as a control task. Compared to a baseline condition,
   the empathy task revealed a network of established empathy regions,
   including the anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral inferior frontal
   cortex and bilateral anterior insula. The contrast of intentional
   empathy vs skin color evaluation, however, revealed three regions: the
   bilateral inferior frontal cortex, whose hemodynamic responses were
   independent of perceived emotion and familiarity and the right-middle
   temporal gyrus, whose activity was modulated by emotion but not by
   familiarity. These findings extend our understanding of the role of the
   inferior frontal cortex and the middle temporal gyrus in empathy by
   demonstrating their involvement in intentional empathy.}},
