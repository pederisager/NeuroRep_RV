Title = {{Lower sexual interest in postpartum women: Relationship to amygdala

Abstract = {{During the postpartum period, women experience significant changes in
   their neuroendocrine profiles and social behavior compared to before
   pregnancy. A common experience with motherhood is a decrease in sexual
   desire. Although the lifestyle and peripheral physiological changes
   associated with parturition might decrease a woman's sexual interest, we
   hypothesized that there are also hormone-mediated changes in women's
   neural response to sexual and infant stimuli with altered reproductive
   priorities. We predicted that amygdala activation to sexually arousing
   stimuli would be suppressed in postpartum versus nulliparous women, and
   altered with intranasal oxytocin administration. To test this, we
   measured amygdala activation using fMRI in response to sexually arousing
   pictures, infant pictures, and neutral pictures in 29 postpartum and 30
   nulliparous women. Half of the women received a dose of exogenous
   oxytocin before scanning. As predicted, nulliparous women subjectively
   rated sexual pictures to be more arousing, and infant pictures to be
   less arousing, than did postpartum women. However, nulliparous women
   receiving the nasal oxytocin spray rated the infant photos as arousing
   as did postpartum women. Right amygdala activation was lower in
   postpartum versus nulliparous women in response to sexual, infant, and
   neutral images, suggesting a generalized decrease in right amygdala
   responsiveness to arousing images with parturition. There was no
   difference in right amygdala activation with nasal spray application.
   Postpartum women therefore appear to experience a decrease in sexual
   interest possibly as a feature of a more generalized decrease in
   amygdala responsiveness to arousing stimuli. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Mindfulness meditation has been shown to promote emotional stability.
   Moreover, during the processing of aversive and self-referential
   stimuli, mindful awareness is associated with reduced medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) activity, a central default mode network (DMN) component.
   However, it remains unclear whether mindfulness practice influences
   functional connectivity between DMN regions and, if so, whether such
   impact persists beyond a state of meditation. Consequently, this study
   examined the effect of extensive mindfulness training on functional
   connectivity within the DMN during a restful state. Resting-state data
   were collected from 13 experienced meditators (with over 1000 h of
   training) and 11 beginner meditators (with no prior experience, trained
   for 1 week before the study) using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Pairwise correlations and partial correlations were computed
   between DMN seed regions' time courses and were compared between groups
   utilizing a Bayesian sampling scheme. Relative to beginners, experienced
   meditators had weaker functional connectivity between DMN regions
   involved in self-referential processing and emotional appraisal. In
   addition, experienced meditators had increased connectivity between
   certain DMN regions (e.g. dorso-medial PFC and right inferior parietal
   lobule), compared to beginner meditators. These findings suggest that
   meditation training leads to functional connectivity changes between
   core DMN regions possibly reflecting strengthened present-moment
   awareness.}},

Pages = {{15-26}},

Abstract = {{One component of mindfulness training (MT) is the development of
   interoceptive attention (IA) to visceral bodily sensations, facilitated
   through daily practices such as breath monitoring. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined experience-dependent
   functional plasticity in accessing interoceptive representations by
   comparing graduates of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course to a
   waitlisted control group. IA to respiratory sensations was contrasted
   against two visual tasks, controlling for attentional requirements
   non-specific to IA such as maintaining sensation and suppressing
   distraction. In anatomically partitioned analyses of insula activity, MT
   predicted greater IA-related activity in anterior dysgranular insula
   regions, consistent with greater integration of interoceptive sensation
   with external context. MT also predicted decreased recruitment of the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) during IA, and altered functional
   connectivity between the DMPFC and the posterior insula, putative
   primary interoceptive cortex. Furthermore, meditation practice
   compliance predicted greater posterior insula and reduced visual pathway
   recruitment during IA. These findings suggest that interoceptive
   training modulates task-specific cortical recruitment, analogous to
   training-related plasticity observed in the external senses. Further,
   DMPFC modulation of IA networks may be an important mechanism by which
   MT alters information processing in the brain, increasing the
   contribution of interoception to perceptual experience.}},

Abstract = {{A convergent line of neuroscientific evidence suggests that meditation

   processes underlying attention and emotion. The purpose of this study
   was to examine the brain structural differences between a well-matched
   sample of long-term meditators and controls. We employed whole-brain
   cortical thickness analysis based on magnetic resonance imaging, and
   diffusion tensor imaging to quantify white matter integrity in the
   brains of 46 experienced meditators compared with 46 matched
   meditation-naive volunteers. Meditators, compared with controls, showed
   significantly greater cortical thickness in the anterior regions of the
   brain, located in frontal and temporal areas, including the medial
   prefrontal cortex, superior frontal cortex, temporal pole and the middle
   and interior temporal cortices. Significantly thinner cortical thickness
   was found in the posterior regions of the brain, located in the parietal
   and occipital areas, including the postcentral cortex, inferior parietal
   cortex, middle occipital cortex and posterior cingulate cortex.
   Moreover, in the region adjacent to the medial prefrontal cortex, both
   higher fractional anisotropy values and greater cortical thickness were
   observed. Our findings suggest that long-term meditators have structural
   differences in both gray and white matter.}},

Abstract = {{Mindfulness meditation-the practice of attending to present moment
   experience and allowing emotions and thoughts to pass without

   unexplored. Focused attention is a common mindfulness induction where
   practitioners focus on specific physical sensations, typically the
   breath. The present study explores the neural mechanisms of this common
   mindfulness induction among novice practitioners. Healthy novice
   participants completed a brief task with both mindful attention
   {[}focused breathing (FB)] and control (unfocused attention) conditions
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Relative to the
   control condition, FB recruited an attention network including parietal
   and prefrontal structures and trait-level mindfulness during this
   comparison also correlated with parietal activation. Results suggest
   that the neural mechanisms of a brief mindfulness induction are related
   to attention processes in novices and that trait mindfulness positively
   moderates this activation.}},

Abstract = {{Mindfulness-based interventions are effective for reducing depressive
   symptoms. However, the psychological and neural mechanisms are unclear.
   This study examined which facets of trait mindfulness offer protection
   against negative bias and rumination, which are key risk factors for
   depression. Nineteen male volunteers completed a 2-day functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study. One day utilized a stress-induction
   task and the other day utilized a mindful breathing task. An emotional
   inhibition task was used to measure neural and behavioral changes
   related to state negative bias, defined by poorer performance in
   inhibiting negative relative to neutral stimuli. Associations among
   trait mindfulness {[}measured by the Five Facet Mindfulness
   Questionnaire (FFMQ)], trait rumination, and negative bias were
   examined. Non-reactivity scores on the FFMQ correlated negatively with
   rumination and negative bias following the stress induction.
   Non-reactivity was inversely correlated with insula activation during
   inhibition to negative stimuli after the mindful breathing task. Our
   results suggest non-reactivity to inner experience is the key facet of
   mindfulness that protects individuals from psychological risk for
   depression. Based on these results, mindfulness could reduce
   vulnerability to depression in at least two ways: (i) by buffering
   against trait rumination and negative bias and (ii) by reducing
   automatic emotional responding via the insula.}},

   self-beliefs using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants
   were 56 patients with generalized SAD in a randomized controlled trial
   who were assigned to MBSR or a comparison aerobic exercise (AE) stress
   reduction program. Compared to AE, MBSR yielded greater (i) reductions
   in negative emotion when implementing regulation and (ii) increases in
   attention-related parietal cortical regions. Meditation practice was
   associated with decreases in negative emotion and social anxiety symptom
   severity, and increases in attention-related parietal cortex neural
   responses when implementing attention regulation of negative
   self-beliefs. Changes in attention regulation during MBSR may be an
   important psychological factor that helps to explain how mindfulness
   meditation training benefits patients with anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{An emerging body of research suggests that mindfulness-based
   interventions may be beneficial for smoking cessation and the treatment
   of other addictive disorders. One way that mindfulness may facilitate
   smoking cessation is through the reduction of craving to smoking cues.
   The present work considers whether mindful attention can reduce
   self-reported and neural markers of cue-induced craving in treatment
   seeking smokers. Forty-seven (n = 47) meditation-naive treatment-seeking
   smokers (12-h abstinent from smoking) viewed and made ratings of smoking
   and neutral images while undergoing functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). Participants were trained and instructed to view these
   images passively or with mindful attention. Results indicated that
   mindful attention reduced self-reported craving to smoking images, and
   reduced neural activity in a craving-related region of subgenual
   anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC). Moreover, a psychophysiological
   interaction analysis revealed that mindful attention reduced functional
   connectivity between sgACC and other craving-related regions compared to
   passively viewing smoking images, suggesting that mindfulness may
   decouple craving neurocircuitry when viewing smoking cues. These results
   provide an initial indication that mindful attention may describe a
   `bottom-up' attention to one's present moment experience in ways that
   can help reduce subjective and neural reactivity to smoking cues in
   smokers.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive body of research defines the default-mode network (DMN) to
   be one of the critical networks of the human brain, playing a pivotal
   functional role in processes of internal mentation. Alterations in the
   connectivity of this network as a function of aging have been found,
   with reductions associated with functional ramifications for the elderly
   population. This study examined associations between integrity of the
   DMN and trait levels of mindfulness disposition, defined by our ability
   to exert attentional and emotional control in the present moment, and,
   thereby, bring awareness to immediate experiences. Twenty-five older
   adults participated in the study and underwent a brief functional
   magnetic resonance imaging session and filled out questionnaires related
   to their overall health and mindfulness disposition. Mindfulness
   disposition was associated with greater connectivity of the DMN,
   specifically, in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex and the
   precuneus. Mindfulness disposition, thus, explains variance in the
   connectivity of one of the more intrinsic networks of the human brain,
   known to be critical for promoting self-relevant mental explorations and
   building cognitive and affective control.}},

   the study of culture with cognitive neuroscience holds mutual

   participants more often made a self-serving offer when dealing with an
   angry recipient than when dealing with a happy or disappointed
   recipient. Compared to disappointment, expressions of anger increased
   activation in regions associated with self-referential thinking
   (anterior medial prefrontal cortex, aMPFC) and (emotional) conflict
   (anterior cingulate cortex). We found increased activation in
   temporoparietal junction for receiving happy reactions in comparison

Abstract = {{Humans work to improve the situation of others through sympathetic
   concern. The empathic joy hypothesis proposes that the urge to help is
   stimulated by enhanced sensitivity to vicarious joy achieved through
   helping a recipient to meet their needs. We further hypothesized that
   the positive feeling-related brain activation that occurs in the
   striatum during sympathetic concern is enhanced by empathy in a
   familiarity-dependent manner. To test this, we conducted behavioral and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments in which two
   participants simultaneously played a virtual ball-toss game where either
   the subjects' partner or an unfamiliar player was isolated by the other
   players. The subjects showed sympathetic behavior by tossing the ball to
   the isolated player and reported enhancement of self-positive feelings
   and anticipation of feeling improvements of the isolated player during
   sympathetic behaviors. Activation in the bilateral dorsal striatum
   became more prominent during the behaviors, supporting the empathic joy
   hypothesis. Dorsal striatal activity when helping a romantic partner
   positively correlated with affective empathic traits toward that
   partner, whereas the activity measured when helping a stranger
   positively correlated with perspective-taking traits. The correlation
   results further revealed a familiarity-dependent empathic enhancement of
   positive feelings. Therefore, sympathetic concern is invoked through
   empathic positive feeling.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation is a crucial skill in adulthood; its acquisition
   represents one of the key developmental tasks in early childhood.
   Difficulties with adaptive emotion regulation increase the risk of
   psychopathology in childhood and adulthood. This is, for instance, shown
   by a relation between emotion regulation and aggressive behavior in
   childhood age, indicating emotion dysregulation as an important risk
   factor of aggressive behavior and potential precursor of
   psychopathology. Based on (1) interrelations between emotion processes
   and social information processing (maladaptive emotion regulation and
   social information processing are associated with higher levels of
   aggression) and (2) recent neuroscientific findings showing that empathy
   deficits might not only result in difficulties labeling others' emotions
   but one's own emotions too, we suggest that empathy deficits might serve
   as potential trigger of emotion dysregulation. Different studies
   investigating the relation between empathy and emotion regulation are
   presented and discussed. Discussions are based on the assumed potential
   of empathy deficits triggering emotion dysregulation. Furthermore,
   developmental neuroscientific findings on empathy and emotion regulation
   are highlighted which provide further insights on how these processes
   might relate. Finally, possible directions for future research are
   presented.}},

   response to PRT in two young children with ASD. Baseline measures of
   social communication, adaptive behavior, eye tracking and neural
   response to social stimuli were taken prior to treatment and after 4
   months of PRT. Both children showed striking gains on behavioral
   measures and also showed increased activation to social stimuli in brain
   regions utilized by typically developing children. These results suggest
   that neural systems supporting social perception are malleable through
   implementation of PRT.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of alcoholism (ALC) or alcohol dependence on the neural
   mechanisms underlying cognitive and affective empathy (i.e. the
   different routes to understanding other people's minds) in schizophrenic
   patients and non-schizophrenic subjects is still poorly understood. We
   therefore aimed at determining the extent to which the ability to infer
   other people's mental states and underlying neural mechanisms were
   affected by ALC. We examined 48 men, who suffered either from ALC,
   schizophrenia, both disorders or none of these disorders, using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing on a mind reading
   task that involves both cognitive and affective aspects of empathy.
   Using voxel-based morphometry, we additionally examined whether
   between-group differences in functional activity were associated with
   deficits in brain structural integrity. During mental state attribution,
   all clinical groups as compared with healthy controls exhibited poor
   performance as well as reduced right-hemispheric insular function with
   the highest error rate and insular dysfunction seen in the schizophrenic
   patients without ALC. Accordingly, both behavioral performance and
   insular functioning revealed schizophrenia x ALC interaction effects. In
   addition, schizophrenic patients relative to non-schizophrenic subjects
   (regardless of ALC) exhibited deficits in structural integrity and
   task-related recruitment of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   (vlPFC). Our data suggest that ALC-related impairment in the ability to
   infer other people's mental states is limited to insular dysfunction and
   thus deficits in affective empathy. By contrast, mentalizing in
   schizophrenia (regardless of ALC) may be associated with insular
   dysfunction as well as a combination of structural and functional
   deficits in the left vlPFC.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a rising social relevance of pathological computer game playing,
   it remains unclear whether the neurobiological basis of this
   addiction-like behavioral disorder and substance-related addiction are
   comparable. In substance-related addiction, attentional bias and cue
   reactivity are often observed. We conducted a functional magnetic
   resonance study using a dot probe paradigm with short-presentation
   (attentional bias) and long-presentation (cue reactivity) trials in
   eight male pathological computer game players (PCGPs) and nine healthy
   controls (HCs). Computer game-related and neutral computer-generated
   pictures, as well as pictures from the International Affective Picture
   System with positive and neutral valence, served as stimuli. PCGPs
   showed an attentional bias toward both game-related and affective
   stimuli with positive valence. In contrast, HCs showed no attentional
   bias effect at all. PCGPs showed stronger brain responses in
   short-presentation trials compared with HCs in medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC) and anterior cingulate gyrus and in long-presentation trials in
   lingual gyrus. In an exploratory post hoc functional connectivity
   analyses, for long-presentation trials, connectivity strength was higher
   between right inferior frontal gyrus, which was associated with
   inhibition processing in previous studies, and cue reactivity-related
   regions (left orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum) in PCGPs. We
   observed behavioral and neural effects in PCGPs, which are comparable
   with those found in substance-related addiction. However, cue-related
   brain responses were depending on duration of cue presentation. Together
   with the connectivity result, these findings suggest that top-down
   inhibitory processes might suppress the cue reactivity-related neural
   activity in long-presentation trials.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The ability to recognise that another's belief is false is a hallmark of
   our capacity to understand others' mental states. It has been suggested
   that the computational and neural mechanisms that underpin learning
   about others' mental states may be similar to those that underpin
   first-person Reinforcement Learning (RL). In RL unexpected
   decision-making outcomes constitute prediction errors (PE), which are
   coded for by neurons in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC). Does the
   ACC signal the PEs (false beliefs) of others about the outcomes of their
   decisions? We scanned subjects using fMRI while they monitored a
   third-person's decisions and similar responses made by a computer. The
   outcomes of the trials were manipulated, such that the actual outcome
   was unexpectedly different from the predicted outcome on 1/3 of trials.
   We examined activity time-locked to privileged information which
   indicated the actual outcomes only to subjects. Activity in the gyral
   ACC was found when the outcomes of the third-person's decisions were
   unexpectedly positive. Activity in the sulcal ACC was found when the
   third-person's or computer's outcomes were unexpectedly positive. We
   suggest that a property of the ACC is that it codes PEs, with a portion
   of the gyral ACC specialised for processing the PEs of others. (C) 2012

Title = {{The neural correlates of velocity processing during the observation of a
   biological effector in the parietal and premotor cortex}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{425-436}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{While there have been several studies investigating the neural
   correlates of action observation associated with hand grasping
   movements, comparatively little is known about the neural bases of
   observation of reaching movements. In two experiments, using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we defined the cortical areas
   encoding reaching movements and assessed their sensitivity to biological
   motion and to movement velocity. In the first experiment, participants
   observed video-clips showing either a biological effector (an arm) or a
   non-biological object (rolling cylinder) reaching toward a target with a
   biological and a non-biological motion, respectively. In the second
   experiment, participants observed video-clips showing either a
   biological effector (an arm) or a non-biological object (an arrow)
   reaching toward a target with the same biological motion profiles. The
   results of the two experiments revealed activation of superior parietal
   and dorsal premotor sites during observation of the biological motion
   only, independent of whether it was performed by a biological effector
   (reaching arm) or a non-biological object (reaching arrow). These areas
   were not activated when participants observed the non-biological
   movement (rolling cylinder). To assess the responsiveness of parietal
   and frontal sites to movement velocity, the fMRI repetition-suppression
   (RS) technique was used, in which movement was shown with same or
   different velocities between consecutive videos, and observation of
   identical stimuli was contrasted with observation of different stimuli.
   Regions of interest were defined in the parietal and frontal cortices,
   and their response to stimulus repetition was analyzed (same vs.
   different velocities). The results showed an RS effect for velocity only
   during the observation of movements performed by the biological effector
   and not by the non-biological object. These data indicate that dorsal
   premotor and superior parietal areas represent a neural substrate
   involved in the encoding of reaching movements and that their
   responsiveness to movement velocity of a biological effector could be
   instrumental to the discrimination of movements performed by others. (C)

Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) comprises a set of brain regions with
   ``increased{''} activity during rest relative to cognitive processing.
   Activity in the DMN is associated with functional connections with the
   striatum and dopamine (DA) levels in this brain region. A functional
   single-nucleotide polymorphism within the dopamine D2 receptor gene
   (DRD2, rs1076560 G > T) shifts splicing of the 2 D2 isoforms, D2 short
   and D2 long, and has been associated with striatal DA signaling as well
   as with cognitive processing. However, the effects of this polymorphism
   on DMN have not been explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   effects of rs1076560 on DMN and striatal connectivity and on their
   relationship with striatal DA signaling. Twenty-eight subjects genotyped
   for rs1076560 underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during a
   working memory task and 123 55
   I-Fluoropropyl-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta(4-iodophenyl) nortropan Single
   Photon Emission Computed Tomography ({[}I-123]-FP-CIT SPECT) imaging (a
   measure of dopamine transporter {[}DAT] binding). Spatial
   group-independent component (IC) analysis was used to identify DMN and
   striatal ICs. Within the anterior DMN IC, GG subjects had relatively
   greater connectivity in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), which was
   directly correlated with striatal DAT binding. Within the posterior DMN
   IC, GG subjects had reduced connectivity in posterior cingulate relative
   to T carriers. Additionally, rs1076560 genotype predicted connectivity
   differences within a striatal network, and these changes were correlated
   with connectivity in MPFC and posterior cingulate within the DMN. These
   results suggest that genetically determined D2 receptor signaling is
   associated with DMN connectivity and that these changes are correlated
   with striatal function and presynaptic DA signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have reported that moderate physical activity in daily
   life contributes to maintenance of a proper state of cognitive function
   in elderly individuals. The present study investigated the validity of
   correlations between moderate physical activity and cognitive function
   using more objective and detailed assessments of both physical activity
   and neurocognitive function. Participants comprised 72 healthy elderly
   individuals who wore an electronic accelerometer during waking hours for
   3 months. This device recorded the number of steps per day as well as
   the duration of each intensity level in daily life; levels 1-3 were the
   equivalent of easy-paced walking (light activity), while levels 4-6
   corresponded to brisk walking (moderate activity). To estimate executive
   cognitive ability in healthy elderly individuals, performance
   variability of executive control was examined with a task-switching
   reaction time (RT) test measuring intra-individual variability (IIV) in
   RTs. In 43 consenting participants, functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) during the task-switching RT trial was analyzed to assess
   differences in brain activity patterns as a function of daily physical
   activity. Daily duration of level 4 physical activity correlated
   negatively with and significantly predicted IIV. Moreover, fMRI analysis
   confirmed that the higher physical activity group (duration of level 4
   activity >= 26.4 min/day) showed significantly reduced age-related
   functional attenuation of prefrontal activations during the
   task-switching RT trial. The study discusses the possibility that
   enhancing the moderate daily physical activity could be helpful for
   lowering the rate of neurocognitive degradations in healthy elderly
   individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Transfer function between EEG and BOLD signals of epileptic activity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG)-functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (fMRI) recordings have seen growing application in the
   evaluation of epilepsy, namely in the characterization of brain networks
   related to epileptic activity. In EEG-correlated fMRI studies, epileptic
   events are usually described as boxcar signals based on the timing
   information retrieved from the EEG, and subsequently convolved with a
   hemodynamic response function to model the associated Blood Oxygen Level
   Dependent (BOLD) changes. Although more flexible approaches may allow a
   higher degree of complexity for the hemodynamics, the issue of how to
   model these dynamics based on the EEG remains an open question. In this
   work, a new methodology for the integration of simultaneous EEG-fMRI
   data in epilepsy is proposed, which incorporates a transfer function
   from the EEG to the BOLD signal. Independent component analysis of the
   EEG is performed, and a number of metrics expressing different models of
   the EEG-BOLD transfer function are extracted from the resulting time
   courses. These metrics are then used to predict the fMRI data and to
   identify brain areas associated with the EEG epileptic activity. The
   methodology was tested on both ictal and interictal EEG-fMRI recordings
   from one patient with a hypothalamic hamartoma. When compared to the
   conventional analysis approach, plausible, consistent, and more
   significant activations were obtained. Importantly, frequency-weighted
   EEG metrics yielded superior results than those weighted solely on the
   EEG power, which comes in agreement with previous literature.
   Reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity should be addressed in an
   extended group of patients in order to further validate the proposed
   methodology and generalize the presented proof of concept.}},

Title = {{Dissociable neural processes underlying risky decisions for self versus
   other}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{Previous neuroimaging studies on decision making have mainly focused on
   decisions on behalf of oneself. Considering that people often make
   decisions on behalf of others, it is intriguing that there is little
   neurobiological evidence on how decisions for others differ from those
   for oneself. The present study directly compared risky decisions for
   self with those for another person using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). Participants were asked to perform a gambling task on
   behalf of themselves (decision-for-self condition) or another person
   (decision-for-other condition) while in the scanner. Their task was to
   choose between a low-risk option (i.e., win or lose 10 points) and a
   high-risk option (i.e., win or lose 90 points) with variable levels of
   winning probability. Compared with choices regarding others, those
   regarding oneself were more risk-averse at lower winning probabilities
   and more risk-seeking at higher winning probabilities, perhaps due to
   stronger affective process during risky decisions for oneself compared
   with those for other. The brain-activation pattern changed according to
   the target, such that reward-related regions were more active in the
   decision-for-self condition than in the decision-for-other condition,
   whereas brain regions related to the theory of mind (ToM) showed greater
   activation in the decision-for-other condition than in the
   decision-for-self condition. Parametric modulation analysis using
   individual decision models revealed that activation of the amygdala and
   the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) were associated with value
   computations for oneself and for another, respectively, during risky
   financial decisions. The results of the present study suggest that
   decisions for oneself and for other may recruit fundamentally distinct
   neural processes, which can be mainly characterized as dominant
   affective/impulsive and cognitive/regulatory processes, respectively.}},

Title = {{Imaging oxytocin x dopamine interactions: an epistasis effect of CD38
   and COMT gene variants influences the impact of oxytocin on annygdala
   activation to social stimuli}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{Although oxytocin (OT) has become a major target for the investigation
   of positive social processes, it can be assumed that it exerts its
   effects in concert with other neurotransmitters. One candidate for such
   an interaction is dopamine (DA). For both systems, genetic variants have
   been identified that influence the availability of the particular
   substance. A variant of the gene coding for the transmembrane protein
   CD38 (rs3796863), which is engaged in OT secretion, has been associated
   with OT plasma level. The common catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)
   val158met polymorphism is known to influence COMT activity and therefore
   the degradation of DA. The present study aimed to investigate OT x DA
   interactions in the context of an OT challenge study. Hence, we tested
   the influence of the above mentioned genetic variants and their
   interaction on the activation of different brain regions (amygdala, VTA,
   ventral striatum and fusiform gyrus) during the presentation of social
   stimuli. In a pharmacological cross-over design 55 participants were
   investigated under OT and placebo (PLA) by means of fMRI. Brain imaging
   results revealed no significant effects for VTA or ventral striatum.
   Regarding the fusiform gyrus, we could not find any effects apart from
   those already described in Saner et al. (2012). Analyses of amygdala
   activation resulted in no gene main effect, no gene x substance
   interaction but a significant gene x gene x substance interaction. While
   under PLA the effect of CD38 on bilateral amygdala activation to social
   stimuli was modulated by the COMT genotype, no such epistasis effect was
   found under OT. Our results provide evidence for an OT x DA interaction
   during responses to social stimuli. We postulate that the effect of
   central OT secretion on amygdala response is modulated by the
   availability of DA. Therefore, for an understanding of the effect of
   social hormones on social behavior, interactions of OT with other
   transmitter systems have to be taken into account.}},

Title = {{Intrinsic Default Mode Network Connectivity Predicts Spontaneous Verbal
   Descriptions of Autobiographical Memories during Social Processing}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Neural systems activated in a coordinated way during rest, known as the
   default mode network (DMN), also support autobiographical memory (AM)
   retrieval and social processing/mentalizing. However, little is known
   about how individual variability in reliance on personal memories during
   social processing relates to individual differences in DMN functioning
   during rest (intrinsic functional connectivity). Here we examined 18
   participants' spontaneous descriptions of autobiographical memories
   during a 2h, private, open-ended interview in which they reacted to a
   series of true stories about real people's social situations and
   responded to the prompt, ``how does this person's story make you
   feel?{''} We classified these descriptions as either containing factual
   information ({''}semantic{''} AMs) or more elaborate descriptions of
   emotionally meaningful events ({''}episodic{''} AMs). We also collected
   resting state fMRI scans from the participants and related individual
   differences in frequency of described AMs to participants' intrinsic
   functional connectivity within regions of the DMN. We found that
   producing more descriptions of either memory type correlated with
   stronger intrinsic connectivity in the parahippocampal and middle
   temporal gyri. Additionally, episodic AM descriptions correlated with
   connectivity in the bilateral hippocampi and medial prefrontal cortex,
   and semantic memory descriptions correlated with connectivity in right
   inferior lateral parietal cortex. These findings suggest that in
   individuals who naturally invoke more memories during social processing,
   brain regions involved in memory retrieval and self/social processing
   are more strongly coupled to the DMN during rest.}},

Abstract = {{Binge drinking is now considered a central public health issue and is
   associated with emotional and interpersonal problems, but the neural
   implications of these deficits remain unexplored. The present study
   aimed at offering the first insights into the effects of binge drinking

   activation of bilateral superior temporal gyrus; and (3) increased
   activation of right middle frontal gyrus. These results constitute the
   first evidence of altered cerebral processing of emotional stimuli in
   binge drinking and confirm that binge drinking leads to marked cerebral

Title = {{Mentalizing and motivation neural function during social interactions in
   autism spectrum disorders}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{321-331}},
Abstract = {{Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are characterized by core deficits in
   social functions. Two theories have been suggested to explain these
   deficits: mind-blindness theory posits impaired mentalizing processes
   (i.e. decreased ability for establishing a representation of others'
   state of mind), while social motivation theory proposes that diminished
   reward value for social information leads to reduced social attention,
   social interactions, and social learning. Mentalizing andmotivation are
   integral to typical social interactions, and neuroimaging evidence
   points to independent brain networks that support these processes in
   healthy individuals. However, the simultaneous function of these
   networks has not been explored in individuals with ASDs. We used a
   social, interactive fMRI task, the Domino game, to explore mentalizing-
   and motivation-related brain activation during a well-defined interval
   where participants respond to rewards or punishments (i.e. motivation)
   and concurrently process information about their opponent's potential
   next actions (i.e. mentalizing). Thirteen individuals with
   high-functioning ASDs, ages 12-24, and 14 healthy controls played fMRI
   Domino games against a computer-opponent and separately, what they were
   led to believe was a human-opponent. Results showed that while
   individuals with ASDs understood the game rules and played similarly to
   controls, they showed diminished neural activity during the
   human-opponent runs only (i.e. in a social context) in bilateral middle
   temporal gyrus (MTG) during mentalizing and right Nucleus Accumbens
   (NAcc) during reward-related motivation (P-cluster < 0.05 FWE).
   Importantly, deficits were not observed in these areas when playing
   against a computer-opponent or in areas related to motor and visual
   processes. These results demonstrate that while MTG and NAcc, which are
   critical structures in the mentalizing and motivation networks,
   respectively, activate normally in a non-social context, they fail to
   respond in an otherwise identical social context in ASD compared to
   controls. We discuss implications to both the mind-blindness and social
   motivation theories of ASD and the importance of social context in

Title = {{Neural correlates of ``social gaze{''} processing in high-functioning
   autism under systematic variation of gaze duration}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{340-351}},
Abstract = {{Direct gaze is a salient nonverbal signal for social interest and the
   intention to communicate. In particular, the duration of another's
   direct gaze can modulate our perception of the social meaning of gaze
   cues. However, both poor eye contact and deficits in social cognitive
   processing of gaze are specific diagnostic features of autism.
   Therefore, investigating neuralmechanisms of gaze may provide key
   insights into the neural mechanisms related to autistic symptoms.
   Employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a parametric
   design, we investigated the neural correlates of the influence of gaze
   direction and gaze duration on person perception in individuals with
   high-functioning autism (HFA) and a matched control group. For this
   purpose, dynamically animated faces of virtual characters, displaying
   averted or direct gaze of different durations (1 s, 2.5 s and 4 s) were
   evaluated on a four-point likeability scale. Behavioral results revealed
   that HFA participants showed no significant difference in likeability
   ratings depending on gaze duration, while the control group rated the
   virtual characters as increasingly likeable with increasing gaze
   duration. On the neural level, direct gaze and increasing direct gaze
   duration recruit regions of the social neural network (SNN) in control
   participants, indicating the processing of social salience and a
   perceived communicative intent. In participants with HFA however,
   regions of the social neural network were more engaged by averted and
   decreasing amounts of gaze, while the neural response for processing
   direct gaze in HFA was not suggestive of any social information
   processing. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. Open access

Title = {{The brains of high functioning autistic individuals do not synchronize

Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{489-497}},
Abstract = {{Multifaceted and idiosyncratic aberrancies in social cognition
   characterize autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). To advance understanding
   of underlying neural mechanisms, we measured brain hemodynamic activity
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in individuals with
   ASD and matched-pair neurotypical (NT) controls while they were viewing
   a feature film portraying social interactions. Pearson's correlation
   coefficient was used as a measure of voxelwise similarity of brain
   activity (InterSubject Correlations-ISCs). Individuals with ASD showed
   lower ISC than NT controls in brain regions implicated in processing
   social information including the insula, posterior and anterior
   cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, precuneus, lateral occipital cortex,
   and supramarginal gyrus. Curiously, also within NT group,
   autism-quotient scores predicted ISC in overlapping areas, including,
   e.g., supramarginal gyrus and precuneus. In ASD participants, functional
   connectivity was decreased between the frontal pole and the superior
   frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, precentral
   gyrus, precuneus, and anterior/posterior cingulate gyrus. Taken together
   these results suggest that ISC and functional connectivity measure
   distinct features of atypical brain function in high-functioning
   autistic individuals during free viewing of acted social interactions.
   Our ISC results suggest that the minds of ASD individuals do not `tick
   together' with others while perceiving identical dynamic social
   interactions. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. Open

Title = {{The impact of serotonin transporter genotype on default network
   connectivity in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{17-24}},
Abstract = {{Compared to healthy controls, individuals with autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD) have weaker posterioranterior connectivity that strengthens less
   with age within the default network, a set of brain structures connected
   in the absence of a task and likely involved in social function. The
   serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotypes
   that result in lowered serotonin transporter expression are associated
   with social impairment in ASD. Additionally, in healthy controls, low
   expressing 5-HTTLPR genotypes are associated with weaker default network
   connectivity. However, in ASD, the effect of 5-HTTLPR on the default
   network is unknown. We hypothesized that 5-HTTLPR's influence on
   posterior-anterior default network connectivity strength as well as on
   age-related changes in connectivity differs in the ASD group versus
   controls. Youth with ASD and healthy controls, ages 8-19, underwent a
   resting fMRI acquisition. Connectivity was calculated by correlating the
   posterior hub of the default network with all voxels. Triallelic
   genotype was assessed via PCR and Sanger sequencing. A
   genotype-by-diagnosis interaction significantly predicted
   posterior-anterior connectivity, such that low expressing genotypes
   (S/S, S/LG, LG/LG) were associated with stronger connectivity than high
   expressing genotypes (LA/LA, S/LA, LA/LG) in the ASD group, but the
   converse was true for controls. Also, youth with ASD and low expressing
   genotypes had greater age-related increases in connectivity values
   compared to those with high expressing genotypes and controls in either
   genotype group. Our findings suggest that the cascade of events from
   genetic variation to brain function differs in ASD. Also, low expressing
   genotypes may represent a subtype within ASD. (C) 2012 The Authors.

Title = {{A quantitative link between face discrimination deficits and neuronal
   selectivity for faces in autism}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{320-331}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) appear to show a general
   face discrimination deficit across a range of tasks including
   social-emotional judgments as well as identification and discrimination.
   However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies probing
   the neural bases of these behavioral differences have produced
   conflicting results: while some studies have reported reduced or no
   activity to faces in ASD in the Fusiform Face Area (FFA), a key region
   in human face processing, others have suggested more typical activation
   levels, possibly reflecting limitations of conventional fMRI techniques
   to characterize neuron-level processing. Here, we test the hypotheses
   that face discrimination abilities are highly heterogeneous in ASD and
   are mediated by FFA neurons, with differences in face discrimination
   abilities being quantitatively linked to variations in the estimated
   selectivity of face neurons in the FFA. Behavioral results revealed a
   wide distribution of face discrimination performance in ASD, ranging
   from typical performance to chance level performance. Despite this
   heterogeneity in perceptual abilities, individual face discrimination
   performance was well predicted by neural selectivity to faces in the
   FFA, estimated via both a novel analysis of local voxel-wise
   correlations, and the more commonly used fMRI rapid adaptation
   technique. Thus, face processing in ASD appears to rely on the FFA as in
   typical individuals, differing quantitatively but not qualitatively.
   These results for the first time mechanistically link variations in the
   ASD phenotype to specific differences in the typical face processing
   circuit, identifying promising targets for interventions. (C) 2013 The

Title = {{Pattern classification of valence in depression}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{675-683}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging biomarkers of depression have potential to aid diagnosis,
   identify individuals at risk and predict treatment response or course of
   illness. Nevertheless none have been identified so far, potentially
   because no single brain parameter captures the complexity of the
   pathophysiology of depression. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) may
   overcome this issue as it can identify patterns of voxels that are
   spatially distributed across the brain. Here we present the results of
   an MVPA to investigate the neuronal patterns underlying passive viewing
   of positive, negative and neutral pictures in depressed patients. A
   linear support vector machine (SVM) was trained to discriminate
   different valence conditions based on the functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data of nine unipolar depressed patients. A similar
   dataset obtained in nine healthy individuals was included to conduct a
   group classification analysis via linear discriminant analysis (LDA).
   Accuracy scores of 86\% or higher were obtained for each valence
   contrast via patterns that included limbic areas such as the amygdala
   and frontal areas such as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The LDA
   identified two areas (the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and caudate
   nucleus) that allowed group classification with 72.2\% accuracy. Our
   preliminary findings suggest that MVPA can identify stable valence
   patterns, with more sensitivity than univariate analysis, in depressed
   participants and that it may be possible to discriminate between healthy
   and depressed individuals based on differences in the brain's response
   to emotional cues. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of handedness suggest a relationship between hemispheric
   specialisation and emotional processing. Recently measures of
   lateralised tympanic membrane temperature (TMT) have identified similar
   relationships (i.e., the left hemisphere is involved in approach
   behaviour and the right hemisphere avoidance behaviour). In the present
   study we examined lateralised changes in TMT in response to social
   interaction in 10 Garnett's bushbabies. Additionally, we examined
   whether handedness could be used as a predictor of approachavoidance
   tendencies. We found a positive association between temperature change
   and both allogrooming and affiliative approach. Social behaviour did not
   differ between right- and left-handed bushbabies. These findings are
   discussed in terms of existing theories of asymmetric emotional
   processing. Overall, the data suggest that there is a left hemisphere
   specialisation for processing approach-related behaviours, which is
   consistent with existing models of lateralised emotional processing. Our
   data also indicate that TMT is a reliable, cost-effective measure of
   cerebral activation that is less invasive and more practical than
   alternative measures such as EEG, PET, and fMRI.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral studies have shown that, at a population level, women perform
   better on tests of social cognition and empathy than men. Furthermore
   Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), which are characterized by impairments
   in social functioning and empathy, occur more commonly in males than
   females. These findings have led to the hypothesis that differences in
   the functioning of the social brain between males and females contribute
   to the greater vulnerability of males to ASD and the suggestion that ASD
   may represent an extreme form of the male brain. Here we sought to
   investigate this hypothesis by determining: (i) whether males and
   females differ in social brain function, and (ii) whether any sex
   differences in social brain function are exaggerated in individuals with
   ASD. Using fMRI we show that males and females differ markedly in social
   brain function when making social decisions from faces (compared to
   simple sex judgements) especially when making decisions of an affective
   nature, with the greatest sex differences in social brain activation
   being in the inferior frontal cortex (IFC). We also demonstrate that
   this difference is exaggerated in individuals with ASD, who show an
   extreme male pattern of IFC function. These results show that males and
   females differ significantly in social brain function and support the
   view that sex differences in the social brain contribute to the greater
   vulnerability of males to ASDs.}},

Abstract = {{Human cognition has usually been approached on the level of individual
   minds and brains, but social interaction is a challenging case. Is it
   best thought of as a self-contained individual cognitive process aiming
   at an ``understanding of the other,{''} or should it rather be
   approached as an collective, inter-personal process where individual
   cognitive components interact on a moment-to-moment basis to form
   coupled dynamics? In a combined fMRI and eye-tracking study we directly
   contrasted these models of social cognition. We found that the
   perception of situations affording social contingent responsiveness
   (e.g., someone offering or showing you an object) elicited activation in
   regions of the right posterior temporal sulcus and yielded greater pupil
   dilation corresponding to a model of coupled dynamics (joint action). In
   contrast, the social-cognitive perception of someone ``privately{''}
   manipulating an object elicited activation in medial prefrontal cortex,
   the right inferior frontal gyrus and right inferior parietal lobus,
   regions normally associated with Theory of Mind and with the mirror
   neuron system. Our findings support a distinction in social cognition
   between social observation and social interaction, and demonstrate that
   simple ostensive cues may shift participants' experience, behavior, and
   brain activity between these modes. The identification of a distinct,
   interactive mode has implications for research on social cognition, both
   in everyday life and in clinical conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The detection and appreciation of humor is a complex cognitive process
   that remains poorly understood. Although functional neuroimaging studies
   have begun to map the brain systems involved in humor appreciation,
   there are virtually no data on the structural correlates between gray
   matter volume and this capacity. Using voxel-based morphometry, the
   present study examined the association between gray matter volume and
   the ability to detect and appreciate humor. Fifty-nine healthy adults
   aged 18-45 years (30 men) underwent structural MRI and completed the
   University of Pennsylvania Humor Appreciation Test (HAT). After
   controlling for age and sex, gray matter volume of the left inferior
   frontal gyrus, left temporal pole, and left insula correlated positively
   with the appreciation of visual and verbal humor on the HAT, whereas the
   gray matter volume of the right inferior frontal gyrus correlated only
   with verbal humor appreciation scores. There were no negative
   correlations between gray matter volume and HAT performance. These data
   support a neurobiological basis for humor appreciation, particularly
   involving left-hemispheric cortical systems, and further suggest that
   individual differences in humor appreciation may be related to
   differences in regional gray matter volume. NeuroReport 23:1059-1064 (C)

Abstract = {{Whether the brain represents facial expressions as perceptual continua
   or as emotion categories remains controversial. Here, we measured the
   neural response to morphed images to directly address how facial
   expressions of emotion are represented in the brain. We found that
   face-selective regions in the posterior superior temporal sulcus and the
   amygdala responded selectively to changes in facial expression,
   independent of changes in identity. We then asked whether the responses
   in these regions reflected categorical or continuous neural
   representations of facial expression. Participants viewed images from
   continua generated by morphing between faces posing different
   expressions such that the expression could be the same, could involve a
   physical change but convey the same emotion, or could differ by the same
   physical amount but be perceived as two different emotions. We found
   that the posterior superior temporal sulcus was equally sensitive to all
   changes in facial expression, consistent with a continuous
   representation. In contrast, the amygdala was only sensitive to changes
   in expression that altered the perceived emotion, demonstrating a more
   categorical representation. These results offer a resolution to the
   controversy about how facial expression is processed in the brain by
   showing that both continuous and categorical representations underlie
   our ability to extract this important social cue.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was designed to investigate patterns of fractional

   Methods: Thirty patients (17 females, 13 males, age: 47.70 +/- 10.69
   years old) and twenty healthy controls (10 females, 10 males, age: 41.40
   +/- 13.94 years old) received 3-Tesla resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (RFMRI) scanning and the rating of clinical scales.
   RFMRI data was processed and analyzed by the REST toolbox (resting-state
   functional MRI data analysis toolbox) to calculate fALFF. fALFF were
   compared between patients and controls to detect endophenotype of fALFF

Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with psychopathy have an increased tendency
   toward certain types of aggression. We hypothesized that successful
   psychopaths, who have no criminal convictions but can be diagnosed with
   psychopathy in terms of personality characteristics, are skilled at
   regulating aggressive impulses, compared to incarcerated unsuccessful
   psychopaths.
   Methods: In this block-designed functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study, we sought to clarify the neural mechanisms underlying
   differences in frustration-induced aggression as a function of
   psychopathy in non-criminal populations. Twenty male undergraduate
   students who completed a self-report psychopathy questionnaire were
   scanned while they completed a task in which they either could or could
   not punish other individuals who made unfair offers of monetary
   distribution.
   Results: Individuals with high psychopathic tendencies were less likely
   to make a decision to inflict costly punishment on people proposing
   unfair offers. During this decision-making, psychopathy was associated
   with less amygdala activity in response to the unfairness of offers.
   Moreover, the amygdala dysfunction in psychopathic individuals was
   associated with reduced functional connectivity with
   dopaminergic-related areas, including the striatum, when punishment was
   available compared to when it was unavailable.
   Limitations: The possibility that levels of psychopathic traits in a
   regular population were milder than in incarcerated populations cannot
   be ruled out.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that amygdala dysfunction underlies
   affective deficits of psychopathy. We propose that the insensitivity of
   the amygdala to the affective significance of social stimuli contributes
   to an increased risk of violation of social norms, but enhances the
   ability to attenuate impulses toward maladaptive aggression in
   successful psychopaths. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) has generally not
   been associated with impulsive behavior. However, some studies suggest
   that women with PMDD have higher impulsivity scores than healthy
   controls and that brain activity during response inhibition may vary
   across the menstrual cycle. Therefore, our aim was to unravel
   potentially important cognitive aspects of PMDD by investigating brain
   activity during response inhibition in women with PMDD and healthy
   controls in relation to menstrual cycle phase.
   Methods: Fourteen PMDD patients and 13 healthy controls performed a
   Go/NoGo task to measure brain activity during response inhibition by use
   of event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: Women with PMDD displayed decreased activity during both
   menstrual cycle phases compared to healthy controls in several
   task-related parietal areas. A significant group by phase interactions
   was found in the left insula, driven by enhanced activity among healthy
   controls in the follicular phase and by enhanced insula activity during
   the luteal phase among PMDD patients.
   Limitations: The limitations of the present study are the relatively
   limited sample size, the relatively small number of NoGo trials and the
   lack of a baseline contrast for the NoGo trials.
   Conclusions: During response inhibition women with PMDD have reduced
   activity in areas associated with attention and motor function which is
   unrelated to menstrual cycle phase. Insular cortex activity, involved in
   both affective and cognitive processing, was significantly activated
   during the luteal phase among PMDD women. These findings are relevant
   for the understanding of how ovarian steroids influence mood symptoms in
   women. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{fMRI Evidence of `Mirror' Responses to Geometric Shapes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Mirror neurons may be a genetic adaptation for social interaction {[}1].
   Alternatively, the associative hypothesis {[}2,3] proposes that the
   development of mirror neurons is driven by sensorimotor learning, and
   that, given suitable experience, mirror neurons will respond to any
   stimulus. This hypothesis was tested using fMRI adaptation to index
   populations of cells with mirror properties. After sensorimotor
   training, where geometric shapes were paired with hand actions, BOLD
   response was measured while human participants experienced runs of
   events in which shape observation alternated with action execution or
   observation. Adaptation from shapes to action execution, and critically,
   observation, occurred in ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and inferior
   parietal lobule (IPL). Adaptation from shapes to execution indicates
   that neuronal populations responding to the shapes had motor properties,
   while adaptation to observation demonstrates that these populations had
   mirror properties. These results indicate that sensorimotor training
   induced populations of cells with mirror properties in PMv and IPL to
   respond to the observation of arbitrary shapes. They suggest that the
   mirror system has not been shaped by evolution to respond in a mirror
   fashion to biological actions; instead, its development is mediated by
   stimulus-general processes of learning within a system adapted for
   visuomotor control.}},

Title = {{SHORT-TERM RETROSPECTIVE VERSUS PROSPECTIVE MEMORY PROCESSING AS
   EMERGENT PROPERTIES OF THE MIND AND BRAIN: HUMAN FMRI EVIDENCE}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{226}},
Pages = {{236-252}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{The functional-neuroanatomical substrates for short-term retrospective
   versus prospective memory processing were examined in a delay task, in
   which associative choices were made conditionally based on the
   presenting discriminative/cue stimulus. Delay-period prospection could
   be of the intended choice and/or the expected response outcome, whereas
   delay-period retrospection would be of the just-presented cue stimulus.
   Previous results have shown that the spontaneous process of unique
   outcome prospection did not implicate the lateral prefrontal cortex
   (PFC) but instead implicated the lateral posterior parietal cortex
   (LPPC) in a modality-independent fashion (Mok et al., 2009). Spontaneous
   retrospection was more dependent on the medial temporal lobe (MTL).
   Nevertheless, it was anticipated that the more explicit process of
   prospecting an intended choice would implicate the lateral PFC. To
   verify this, Mok et al.'s data were further analyzed, with new control
   data. Healthy, young adults performed delayed discriminative choices
   under procedures that biased them toward different degrees of
   delay-period prospection: higher-using cue-unique, differential outcomes
   (DO); versus lower-using a non-unique, common outcome (CO), or
   unpredictable, non-differential outcomes (NDO). Experimental
   participants performed the DO versus CO procedures concurrently, while
   undergoing event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Separately, control participants provided data for: the NDO condition;
   related comparison tasks, which biased them toward different degrees of
   delay-period retrospection; and null-event trials. Expectedly, the more
   explicit process of prospecting an intended associative choice
   implicated the lateral PFC, as part of and together with other
   components of the multiple-demand network. Comparisons against
   null-event trials indicated that the sustained delay activity observed
   in MTL and LPPC, respectively, was part of default brain activity. These
   results demonstrated that short-term retrospection and prospection may
   emerge without necessarily relying on working memory-specific brain
   networks. Furthermore, attention may not necessarily be recruited to
   realize working memory. When cognitive processes are spontaneously
   experienced, they may be facilitated by the default brain network. (c)

Abstract = {{One may have experienced his or her footsteps unconsciously synchronize
   with the footsteps of a friend while walking together, or heard an
   audience's clapping hands naturally synchronize into a steady rhythm.
   However, the mechanisms of body movement synchrony and the role of this
   phenomenon in implicit interpersonal interactions remain unclear. We
   aimed to evaluate unconscious body movement synchrony changes as an
   index of implicit interpersonal interaction between the participants,
   and also to assess the underlying neural correlates and functional
   connectivity among and within the brain regions. We found that synchrony
   of both fingertip movement and neural activity between the two
   participants increased after cooperative interaction. These results
   suggest that the increase of interpersonal body movement synchrony via
   interpersonal interaction can be a measurable basis of implicit social
   interaction. The paradigm provides a tool for identifying the behavioral
   and the neural correlates of implicit social interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Emotional awareness deficit may play a critical role in the
   production and maintenance of obsessive-compulsive symptoms and social
   dysfunction in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The
   aim of this study was to investigate characteristics of emotional
   awareness such as empathy and alexithymia in OCD patients. In addition,
   we examined whether impaired emotional awareness measured by
   self-assessment questionnaires was associated with emotional facial
   recognition ability in OCD patients.
   Methods: Study participants included 107 patients with OCD and 130
   healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers. The Interpersonal Reactivity
   Index (IRI) and Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 were applied as measures of
   empathy and alexithymia. A subset of 56 patients with OCD additionally
   performed the emotional perception task of face expression.
   Results: Patients with OCD scored significantly lower for perspective
   taking, and significantly higher for personal distress of IRI, and
   significantly higher for alexithymia compared to normal controls.
   Impaired emotional awareness such as lower perspective taking and
   fantasy seeking had a perception bias towards disgust in response to
   ambiguous facial expressions in OCD patients.
   Limitations: The OCD group consisted of patients in different stages of
   the illness and with different degrees of severity.
   Conclusions: OCD involves the impairment of emotional awareness and
   perception and it may relate to social dysfunction and to impairments in
   the ability to shift naturally from obsessive thoughts to other thoughts
   in response to social situations in patients with OCD. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The ability to distinguish posed from genuine facial displays of emotion
   and to act accordingly is a fundamental social skill. To investigate the
   neural correlates underpinning this sensitivity, we compared changes in
   brain activity associated with judging posed and genuine facial displays
   of happiness and sadness using fMRI. Photographs of displays were
   presented to 7 right-handed females who judged whether the person was
   feeling the target emotion and made yes/no responses. Results showed
   activity increases during the observation of genuine compared to posed
   happy displays in the left medial superior frontal gyrus (BA 9) and the
   middle cingulate cortex bilaterally (BAs 24 and 31). The same comparison
   for sad displays showed increased activity in the left medial superior
   frontal gyrus (BA 8), and in the right middle and triangular inferior
   frontal gyri (both BA 46). Participants who exhibited higher sensitivity
   to sad displays showed larger activity difference in the left medial
   superior frontal gyrus (BA 8). The present study provides evidence of
   differential neural activity when judging posed versus genuine facial
   displays of emotions. Further research is required to elucidate how this
   might impact social affective neuroscience and in what ways genuine
   facial displays can enhance our understanding of emotion perception. (C)

   shown to attenuate threat-related activity in limbic regions such as the
   hypothalamus in healthy individuals. We hypothesized that such features
   might be similarly attenuated by proximity during a potentially
   stressful situation in a clinically anxious population of youths.
   Confirmation of this hypothesis could support the role of attachment
   figures in the management of anxiety among children and adolescents.
   Three groups were analyzed: anxious children and adolescents who
   requested that their caregiver accompany them in the scanner room,
   anxious children and adolescents without their caregiver in the scanner
   room and healthy controls (each of N = 10). The groups were matched for
   age and, among the two anxious groups, for diagnosis (mean age 9.5). The
   children and adolescents were exposed to physical threat words during an
   fMRI assessment. Results indicate that activity in the hypothalamus,
   ventromedial, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex were significantly
   reduced in anxious children and adolescents who requested that their
   caregiver accompany them in the scanner room compared to those without
   their caregiver in the scanner room. Mean activity in these regions in
   anxious children and adolescents with their caregiver in the scanner
   room was comparable to that of healthy controls. These data suggest
   links between social contact and neural mechanisms of emotional
   reactivity; specifically, presence of caregivers moderates the increase
   in anxiety seen with stressful stimuli. Capitalizing on the ability of
   anxious youths to manifest low levels of anxiety-like information
   processing in the presence of a caregiver could help in modeling
   adaptive function in behavioral treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer goods' brands have become a major driver of consumers' choice:
   they have got symbolic, relational and even social properties that add
   substantial cultural and affective value to goods and services.
   Therefore, measuring the role of brands in consumers' cognitive and
   affective processes would be very helpful to better understand economic
   decision making. This work aimed at finding the neural correlates of
   automatic, spontaneous emotional response to brands, showing how deeply
   integrated are consumption symbols within the cognitive and affective
   processes of individuals. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   was measured during a visual oddball paradigm consisting in the
   presentation of scrambled pictures as frequent stimuli, colored squares
   as targets, and brands and emotional pictures (selected from the
   International Affective Picture System {[}IAPS]) as emotionally-salient
   distractors. Affective rating of brands was assessed individually after
   scanning by a validated questionnaire. Results showed that, similarly to
   IAPS pictures, brands activated a well-defined emotional network,
   including amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, highly specific
   of affective valence. In conclusion, this work identified the neural
   correlates of brands within cognitive and affective processes of
   consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Grapheme-color synesthesia is a condition in which letters are perceived
   with an additional color dimension. To identify brain regions involved
   in this type of synesthesia and to analyze functional connectivity of
   these areas, 18 grapheme-color synesthetes and 18 matched controls were
   stimulated with letters and pseudo-letters presented in black and color
   in an event-related fMRI experiment. Based on the activation-differences
   between synesthetes and non-synesthetic controls regions of interest
   were defined. In a second analysis step functional connectivity was
   calculated using beta series correlation analysis for these seed
   regions. First we identified one seed region in the left inferior
   parietal (IPL) cortex (BA7) showing activation differences between
   grapheme-color synesthetes and controls. Furthermore, we found
   activation differences in brain areas involved in processing of letters
   and pseudo-letters, in particular the right IPL cortex (BA7), but also
   two more clusters in the right hemispheric BA 18 and BA 40. Functional
   connectivity analysis revealed an increased connectivity between the
   left IPL seed region and primary/secondary visual areas (BA 18) in
   synesthetes. Also the right BA 7 showed a stronger connectivity with
   primary/secondary visual areas (BA 18) in grapheme-color synesthetes.
   The results of this study support the idea that the parietal lobe plays
   an important role in synesthetic experience. The data suggest
   furthermore that the information flow in grapheme-color synesthetes was
   already modulated at the level of the primary visual cortex which is
   different than previously thought. Therefore, the current models of
   grapheme-color synesthesia have to be refined as the unusual
   communication flow in synesthetes is not restricted to V4, fusiform
   cortex and the parietal lobe but rather involves a more extended
   network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Language, believed to have originated from actions, not only functions
   as a medium to access other minds, but it also helps us commit actions
   and enriches our social life. This fMRI study investigated the semantic
   and neural representations of actions and mental states. We focused
   mainly on language semantics (comprehending sentences with action words
   versus those with mental state words). While in an fMRI scanner,
   twenty-four healthy, right-handed adult volunteers read a series of
   sentences with a verb depicting either a mental state (e.g., deceive,
   persuade) or an action (e.g., punch, kick), and answered a comprehension
   question that followed. Overall, this task showed brain activation in
   the left inferior frontal gyrus and in the left posterior superior
   temporal sulci. While comprehending sentences with mental state terms,
   participants showed greater activation in left orbitofrontal, and in
   left precuneus areas. On the other hand, the action sentences recruited
   more primary motor, left inferior parietal, bilateral occipital, right
   superior temporal, and right inferior frontal areas. The findings of
   this study underscore the role of motor and visuospatial involvement in
   action word representation in the human brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Neural mechanisms of encoding social and non-social context information

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often fail to attach
   context to their memories and are specifically impaired in processing
   social aspects of contextual information. The aim of the present study
   was to investigate the modulatory influence of social vs. non-social
   context on neural mechanisms during encoding in ASD. Using event-related
   fMRI, 13 boys with ASD and 13 typically developing boys comparable for
   age and IQ were investigated during encoding of neutral objects
   presented either with a social (faces) or a non-social (houses) context.
   A memory paradigm was then applied to identify brain activation patterns
   associated with encoding of subsequently recollected versus
   non-recollected objects.
   On the behavioural level, no significant between-group differences
   emerged. In particular, no differential effects of context on memory
   performance were observed. Neurally, however, context-specific group
   differences were observed in several brain regions. During encoding of
   subsequently recollected objects presented with a face. ASD subjects
   (compared to controls) showed reduced neural activation in the bilateral
   inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral middle frontal gyrus and right
   inferior parietal lobule. Neural activation in the right inferior
   frontal gyrus was positively correlated with memory performance in
   controls, but negatively in ASD individuals. During encoding of
   subsequently non-recollected objects presented in the non-social
   context, ASD subjects showed increased activation in the dorsal MPFC.
   Our findings suggest that in ASD subjects, fronto-parietal brain regions
   subserving memory formation and the association of contextual
   information are activated atypically when a social context is presented
   at encoding. The data add to findings from related research fields
   indicating that in ASD, socioemotional impairment extends into domains
   beyond social cognition. Increased activation in the dorsal MPFC in ASD
   individuals might reflect supervisory cognitive processes related to the
   suppression of a distracting non-social context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{When interacting with someone from another social group, one's responses
   may be influenced by both stereotypes and evaluations. Given behavioral
   results suggesting that stereotypes and evaluative associations operate
   independently, we used fMRI to test whether these biases are mediated by
   distinct brain systems. White participants viewed pairs of Black or
   White faces and judged them based on an evaluation (who would you
   befriend?) or a stereotype-relevant trait (who is more likely to enjoy
   athletic activities?). Multi-voxel pattern analysis revealed that a
   predominantly occipital network represented race in a context-invariant
   manner. However, lateral orbitofrontal cortex preferentially represented
   race during friendship judgments, whereas anterior medial prefrontal
   cortex preferentially represented race during trait judgments.
   Furthermore, representation of race in left temporal pole correlated
   with a behavioral measure of evaluative bias during friendship judgments
   and, independently, a measure of stereotyping during trait judgments.
   Whereas early sensory regions represent race in an apparently invariant
   manner, representations in higher-level regions are multi-componential
   and context-dependent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses a gap in the attachment literature by investigating
   maternal neural response to cry related to infant attachment
   classifications and behaviors. Twenty-two primiparous mothers and their
   18-month old infants completed the Strange Situation (SS) procedure to
   elicit attachment behaviors. During a separate functional MRI session,
   mothers were exposed to their own infant's cry sound, as well as an
   unfamiliar infant's cry and control sound. Maternal neural response to
   own infant cry related to both overall attachment security and specific
   infant behaviors. Mothers of less secure infants maintained greater
   activation to their cry in left parahippocampal and amygdala regions and
   the right posterior insula consistent with a negative schematic response
   bias. Mothers of infants exhibiting more avoidant or contact maintaining
   behaviors during the SS showed diminished response across left
   prefrontal, parietal, and cerebellar areas involved in attentional
   processing and cognitive control. Mothers of infants exhibiting more
   disorganized behavior showed reduced response in bilateral temporal and
   subcallosal areas relevant to social cognition and emotion regulation.

Abstract = {{The current study compared the effects of reward anticipation on task
   performance in children and adolescents (816 years old) using monetary
   and various social rewards. Eighty-five typically developing children
   undertook the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task. Of these 44 also
   undertook the Social Incentive Delay (SID-basic) task where social
   reward was operationalized as a smiling face and spoken compliments.
   Forty-one children participated in the SID-plus where points were added
   to a pictogram with written compliments. In a preparatory validation
   study participants were asked howmuch they liked the SID-basic
   rewards.Results showed that there was an effect of reward size on
   accuracy and RT in both the MID task and SID-plus, but not SID-basic.
   Subjective value of the SID-basic rewards was rated higher with
   hypothesized increasing reward intensity. In conclusion, although the
   social rewards in SID-basic were liked by children andadolescents in the
   validation study, they had no effect on the behaviour. Only when points
   were added (SID-plus), anticipated social reward affected task
   performance. Thus our results highlight (i) the difference between
   likeability andreinforcing quality and (ii) the need for a quantifiable
   element to rewards for themto be reinforcing for children. Copyright (C)

   10.1152/jn.01171.2011.-Neuroimaging studies have revealed a number of
   regions in the human brain that respond to faces. However, the way these
   regions interact is a matter of current debate. The aim of this study
   was to use functional MRI to define faceselective regions in the human
   brain and then determine how these regions interact in a large
   population of subjects (n = 72). We found consistent face selectivity in
   the core face regions of the occipital and temporal lobes: the fusiform
   face area (FFA), occipital face area (OFA), and superior temporal sulcus
   (STS). Face selectivity extended into the intraparietal sulcus (IPS),
   precuneus (PCu), superior colliculus (SC), amygdala (AMG), and inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG). We found evidence for significant functional
   connectivity between the core face-selective regions, particularly
   between the OFA and FFA. However, we found that the covariation in
   activity between corresponding face regions in different hemispheres (e.
   g., right and left FFA) was higher than between different face regions
   in the same hemisphere (e. g., right OFA and right FFA). Although
   functional connectivity was evident between regions in the core and
   extended network, there were significant differences in the magnitude of
   the connectivity between regions. Activity in the OFA and FFA were most
   correlated with the IPS, PCu, and SC. In contrast, activity in the STS
   was most correlated with the AMG and IFG. Correlations between the
   extended regions suggest strong functional connectivity between the IPS,
   PCu, and SC. In contrast, the IFG was only correlated with the AMG. This
   study reveals that interhemispheric as well as intrahemispheric
   connections play an important role in face perception.}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{600-614}},

Abstract = {{Reactions of neural, psychological, and social systems are rarely, if
   ever, independent of previous inputs and states. The potential for
   serial order carryover effects from one condition to the next in
   a,sequence of experimental trials makes counterbalancing of condition
   order an essential part of experimental design. Here, a method is
   proposed for generating counterbalanced sequences for repeated-measures
   designs including those with multiple observations of each condition on
   one participant and self-adjacencies of conditions. Condition ordering
   is reframed as a graph theory problem. Experimental conditions are
   represented as vertices in a graph and directed edges between them
   represent temporal relationships between conditions. A counterbalanced
   trial order results from traversing an Euler circuit through such a
   graph in which each edge is traversed exactly once. This method can be
   generalized to counterbalance for higher order serial order carryover
   effects as well as to create intentional serial order biases. Modern
   graph theory provides tools for finding other types of paths through
   such graph representations, providing a tool for generating experimental
   condition sequences with useful properties.}},

Abstract = {{Adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCHT) improves survival of patients with
   locally advanced gastric cancer. Conventional three-dimensional
   conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) results in ablative doses to a
   significant amount of the left kidney, while image-guided
   intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT) provides excellent target
   coverage with improved kidney sparing. Few long-term results on IMRT for
   gastric cancer, however, have been published. Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3.0 T including blood oxygenation-level
   dependent (BOLD) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and, for the
   first time, Na-23 imaging was used to evaluate renal status after
   radiotherapy with 3D-CRT or IG-IMRT.
   Four disease-free patients (2 after 3D-CRT and 2 after IMRT; FU for all
   patients > 5 years) were included in this feasibility study.
   Morphological sequences, axial DWI images, 2D-gradient echo (GRE)-BOLD
   images, and Na-23 images were acquired. Mean values/standard deviations
   for (Na-23), the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and R2{*} values
   were calculated for the upper/middle/lower parts of both kidneys.
   Corticomedullary Na-23-concentration gradients were determined.
   Surprisingly, IG-IMRT patients showed no morphological alterations and
   no statistically significant differences of ADC and R2{*} values in all
   renal parts. Values for mean corticomedullary Na-23-concentration
   matched those for healthy volunteers. Results were similar in 3D-CRT
   patients, except for the cranial part of the left kidney. This was
   atrophic and presented significantly reduced functional parameters (p =
   0.001-p = 0.033). Reduced ADC values indicated reduced cell density and
   reduced extracellular space. Cortical and medullary R2{*} values of the
   left cranial kidney in the 3D-CRT group were higher, indicating more
   deoxygenated hemoglobin due to reduced blood flow/oxygenation. (Na-23)
   of the renal cranial parts in the 3D-CRT group was significantly
   reduced, while the expected corticomedullary Na-23-concentration
   gradient was partially conserved.
   Functional MRI can assess postradiotherapeutic renal changes. As
   expected, marked morphological/functional effects were observed in
   high-dose areas (3D-CRT), while, unexpectedly, no alteration in kidney
   function was observed in IG-IMRT patients, supporting the hypothesis
   that reducing total/fractional dose to the renal parenchyma by IMRT is
   clinically beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Patients with schizophrenia speak with blunted vocal affect
   but little is known regarding the prosody of persons with schizotypal
   personality disorder (SPD). This work examined expressive prosody in
   SPD, its relationship to brain structure, and outlined a framework for
   measuring elements of prosody in clinical populations.
   Methods: Twenty-eight antipsychotic-naive SPD subjects were matched with
   27 healthy comparison (HC) subjects. Subjects read aloud short sentences
   and responded to probes to record both predetermined and self-generated
   speech samples. Samples were analyzed acoustically (pause proportion,
   duration, attack, and pitch variability) and subjectively by raters
   (amount of pauses, degree of emotion portrayed, and how much they wanted
   to hear more from the subjects) on paragraph, sentence, word,
   word-fragment, and syllable levels. Alexithymia and ability to
   self-monitor behavior were compared between groups. The pars opercularis
   was manually traced on structural MRI data.
   Results: SPD subjects' speech had significantly more pauses, was slower,
   had less pitch variability, and expressed less emotion than HC subjects.
   Pitch variability correlated with socio-economic status achievement.
   There was no difference between groups in left or right pars opercularis
   volumes. A statistically significant correlation suggested that smaller
   left pars opercularis volumes in SPD subjects correlated with more
   pauses and less emotion. SPD subjects reported more alexithymia and
   difficulty self-monitoring their behavior compared with controls. In SPD
   subjects the high alexithymia correlated with raters not wanting to hear
   more from them and SPD subjects' inability to modulate their social
   behavior correlated with their having fewer friends. Thus, the SPD
   subjects exhibited insight.
   Conclusions: SPD subjects displayed significant prosodic deficits that
   were measurable in speech samples as brief as a word-fragment. The
   determinants of these deficits are not known although these may include
   a dysfunctional pars opercularis. These data add to the nascent
   literature describing social cognition deficits in SPD. Published by

Abstract = {{The default-mode network (DMN) of the brain shows highly coherent
   intrinsic activity in healthy subjects and is implicated in
   self-referential processing important for social cognitive functioning.
   Schizophrenia patients show abnormal resting-state connectivity within
   the DMN and this aberrant connectivity is thought to contribute to
   difficulties in self-referential and introspective processing. Subjects
   at increased genetic risk of developing schizophrenia, including
   unaffected siblings of patients, also exhibit brain abnormalities and
   impaired social cognitive processing. However, it is unclear whether
   resting-state connectivity within the DMN is abnormal in these subjects.
   Here, we investigate resting-state DMN connectivity in siblings and
   whether this is related to the functioning of the network during
   self-referential processing. Brain activity was measured using
   functional MRI in 25 unaffected siblings of patients with schizophrenia
   and 25 healthy controls during an 8-minute resting-state period and
   during a self-referential processing task in which the subjects had to
   indicate whether a trait adjective (e.g. ``lazy{''}) described their
   personality (self-referential condition) or whether the trait was
   socially desirable (non-referential condition). Compared with controls,
   siblings showed exaggerated connectivity during resting-state between
   the midline areas of the DMN. Moreover, they failed to adequately
   modulate connectivity between these areas during self-referential
   processing. No abnormalities in activation during self-referential
   processing were observed. These findings suggest that subjects at
   increased genetic risk of developing schizophrenia exhibit abnormal
   intrinsic connectivity within the midline DMN and that this is
   associated with aberrant interactions between these regions during
   self-referential processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   cluster corrected). Compared to controls, BPD patients exhibited
   decreased blood flow in the medial OFC, whereas increased blood flow was
   found in the left and right lateral OFC. Correlation analyses revealed a
   positive relationship between medial and lateral orbitofrontal blood
   flow and impulsivity scores, whereas measures of dissociation tension
   and depression did not exhibit a significant correlation with OFC
   perfusion. These data suggest that dysfunction of medial and lateral
   regions of the OFC could specifically mediate symptoms of impulsivity in
   BPD.}},

Abstract = {{Effective social interactions require the ability to evaluate other
   people's actions and intentions, sometimes only on the basis of such
   subtle factors as body language, and these evaluative judgments may lead
   to powerful impressions. However, little is known about the impact of
   affective body language on evaluative responses in social settings and
   the associated neural correlates. This study investigated the neural
   correlates of observing social interactions in a business setting, in
   which whole-body dynamic stimuli displayed approach and avoidance
   behaviors that were preceded or not by a handshake and were followed by
   participants' ratings of these behaviors. First, approach was associated
   with more positive evaluations than avoidance behaviors, and a handshake
   preceding social interaction enhanced the positive impact of approach
   and diminished the negative impact of avoidance behavior on the
   evaluation of social interaction. Second, increased sensitivity to
   approach than to avoidance behavior in the amygdala and STS was linked
   to a positive evaluation of approach behavior and a positive impact of
   handshake. Third, linked to the positive effect of handshake on social
   evaluation, nucleus accumbens showed greater activity for Handshake than
   for No-handshake conditions. These findings shed light on the neural
   correlates of observing and evaluating nonverbal social interactions and
   on the role of handshake as a way of formal greeting.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives - People with Huntington's disease (HD) can exhibit
   interpersonal difficulties and deficits in recognizing emotional facial
   expressions. We investigated whether individuals with HD exhibit
   impairments in the understanding of other people's mental states, an
   aspect of Theory of Mind (ToM). Materials and methods - Sixteen patients
   with HD and sixteen healthy controls completed two ToM tasks. One task
   involved recognising socially inappropriate behaviour and the other task
   required participants to judge complex mental states from photographs of
   people's eyes alone. To assess relationships between executive function
   and ToM, participants completed measures of verbal fluency, working
   memory and inhibition. The Problem Behaviours Assessment-short form
   (Neuropsychiatry Neuropsychol Behav Neurol, 14, 2001and 219) was
   completed twice using information from patients and their close
   relatives (where possible) to identify relationships between ToM
   impairment and behavioural problems. Results - Patients with HD made
   significantly more errors on ToM tasks than controls, exhibiting
   difficulties in judging the social appropriateness of story character's
   behaviour and problems inferring complex mental states from photographs
   of people's eyes. Patients with HD also exhibited executive dysfunction.
   However, there was little evidence that executive impairments were
   related to ToM deficits. No correlations were apparent between problem
   behaviours and ToM errors. Conclusions - HD is associated with deficits
   in ToM. Furthermore, some of patients' ToM difficulties appear
   independent of executive dysfunction.}},

Title = {{Mirroring versus simulation: on the representational function of
   simulation}},
Journal = {{SYNTHESE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{189}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{483-513}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Mirror neurons and systems are often appealed to as mechanisms enabling
   mindreading, i.e., understanding other people's mental states. Such
   neural mirroring processes are often treated as instances of mental
   simulation rather than folk psychological theorizing. I will call into
   question this assumed connection between mirroring and simulation,
   arguing that mirroring does not necessarily constitute mental simulation
   as specified by the simulation theory of mindreading. I begin by more
   precisely characterizing ``mirroring{''} (Sect. 2) and ``simulation{''}
   (Sect. 3). Mirroring results in a neural process in an observer that
   resembles a neural process of the same type in the observed agent.
   Although simulation is often characterized in terms of resemblance
   (Goldman, Simulating minds: The philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience
   of mindreading, 2006), I argue that simulation requires more than mere
   interpersonal mental resemblance: A simulation must have the purpose or
   function of resembling its target (Sect. 3.1). Given that mirroring
   processes are generated automatically, I focus on what is required for a
   simulation to possess the function of resembling its target. In Sect.
   3.2 I argue that this resemblance function, at least in the case of
   simulation-based mindreading, requires that a simulation serve as a
   representation or stand-in of what it resembles. With this revised
   account of simulation in hand, in Sect. 4 I show that the mirroring
   processes do not necessarily possess the representational function
   required of simulation. To do so I describe an account of goal
   attribution involving a motor mirroring process that should not be
   characterized as interpersonal mental simulation. I end in Sect. 5 by
   defending the conceptual distinction between mirroring and simulation,
   and discussing the implications of this argument for the kind of
   neuroscientific evidence required by simulation theory.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{A characterizing symptom of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is increased
   emotional reactivity towards potential social threat in combination with
   impaired emotion and stress regulation. While several neuroimaging
   studies have linked SAD with hyperreactivity in limbic brain regions
   when exposed to emotional faces, little is known about habituation in
   both the amygdala and neocortical regulation areas. 15 untreated SAD
   patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging during repeated blocks of facial
   emotion (EDT) and object discrimination tasks (ODT). Emotion processing
   networks were defined by a task-related contrast (EDT > ODT). Linear
   regression was employed for assessing habituation effects in these
   regions. In both groups, the employed paradigm robustly activated the
   emotion processing and regulation network, including the amygdalae and
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Statistically significant habituation
   effects were found in the amygdalae, OFC, and pulvinar thalamus of SAD
   patients. No such habituation was found in healthy controls. Concurrent
   habituation in the medial OFC and the amygdalae of SAD patients as shown
   in this study suggests intact functional integrity and successful
   short-term down-regulation of neural activation in brain areas
   responsible for emotion processing. Initial hyperactivation may be
   explained by an insufficient habituation to new stimuli during the first
   seconds of exposure. In addition, our results highlight the relevance of
   the orbitofrontal cortex in social anxiety disorders. Citation: Sladky

Abstract = {{Watching someone scratch himself can induce feelings of itchiness in the
   perceiver. This provides a unique opportunity to characterize the neural
   basis of subjective experiences of itch, independent of changes in
   peripheral inputs. In this study, we first established that the social
   contagion of itch is essentially a normative response (experienced by
   most people), and that the degree of contagion is related to trait
   differences in neuroticism (i.e., the tendency to experience negative
   emotions), but not to empathy. Watching video clips of someone
   scratching (relative to control videos of tapping) activated, as
   indicated by functional neuroimaging, many of the neural regions linked
   to the physical perception of itch, including anterior insular, primary
   somatosensory, and prefrontal (BA44) and premotor cortices. Moreover,
   activity in the left BA44, BA6, and primary somatosensory cortex was
   correlated with subjective ratings of itchiness, and the responsivity of
   the left BA44 reflected individual differences in neuroticism. Our
   findings high-light the central neural generation of the subjective
   experience of somatosensory perception in the absence of somatosensory
   stimulation. We speculate that the habitual activation of this central
   ``itch matrix{''} may give rise to psychogenic itch disorders.}},

Title = {{Getting the word out: neural correlates of enthusiastic message
   propagation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{What happens in the mind of a person who first hears a potentially
   exciting idea? We examined the neural precursors of sprreading ideas
   with enthusiasm, and dissected enthusiasm into component processes that
   can be identified through automated linguistic analysis, gestalt human
   ratings of combined linguistic and non-verbal cues, and points of
   convergence/divergence between the two. We combined tools from natural
   language processing (NLP) with data gathered using fMRI to link the
   neurocognitive mechanisms that are set in motion during initial exposure
   to ideas and subsequent behaviours of these message communicators
   outside of the scanner. Participants' language from video-taped
   interviews collected post-scan was transcribed and given to an automated
   linguistic sentiment analysis (SA) classifier, which returned ratings
   for evaluative language (evaluative vs. descriptive) and valence
   (positive vs. negative). Separately, human coders rated the enthusiasm
   with which participants transmitted each idea. More positive sentiment
   ratings by the automated classifier were associated with activation in
   neural regions including medial prefrontal cortex; MPFC,
   precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex; PC/PCC, and medial temporal lobe;
   MTL. More evaluative, positive, descriptions were associated exclusively
   with neural activity in temporal-parietal junction (TPJ). Finally, human
   ratings indicative of more enthusiastic sentiment were associated with
   activation across these regions (MPFC, PC/PCC, DMPFC, TPJ, and MTL) as
   well as in ventral striatum (VS), inferior parietal lobule and premotor
   cortex. Taken together, these data demonstrate novel links between
   neural activity during initial idea encoding and the enthusiasm with
   which the ideas are subsequently delivered. This research lays the
   groundwork to use machine learning and neuroimaging data to study word
   of mouth communication and the spread of ideas in both traditional and
   new media environments.}},

   both of which process changes of facial age. By means of probabilistic
   tractography, we compare their patterns of functional activation and
   structural connectivity. The ventral portion of Wernicke's understudied
   perpendicular association fasciculus is shown to interconnect the two
   areas, and activation within these clusters is related to the
   probability of fiber connectivity between them. In addition, post-hoc
   age-rating competence is found to be associated with high response
   magnitudes in the left angular gyrus. Our results provide the first
   evidence that facial age has a distinct representation pattern in the
   posterior human brain. We propose that particular face-sensitive nodes
   interact with additional object-unselective quantification modules to
   obtain individual estimates of facial age. This brain network processing
   the age of faces differs from the cortical areas that have previously
   been linked to less developmental but instantly changeable face aspects.
   Our probabilistic method of associating activations with connectivity
   patterns reveals an exemplary link that can be used to further study,
   assess and quantify structure-function relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) is a collection of brain areas found to
   be consistently deactivated during task performance. Previous
   neuroimaging studies of resting state have revealed reduced task-related
   deactivation of this network in autism. We investigated the DMN in 13
   high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 14
   typically developing control participants during three fMRI studies (two
   language tasks and a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) task). Each study had separate
   blocks of fixation/resting baseline. The data from the task blocks and
   fixation blocks were collated to examine deactivation and functional
   connectivity. Deficits in the deactivation of the DMN in individuals
   with ASD were specific only to the ToM task, with no group differences
   in deactivation during the language tasks or a combined language and
   self-other discrimination task. During rest blocks following the ToM
   task, the ASD group showed less deactivation than the control group in a
   number of DMN regions, including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC),
   anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus. In
   addition, we found weaker functional connectivity of the MPFC in
   individuals with ASD compared to controls. Furthermore, we were able to
   reliably classify participants into ASD or typically developing control
   groups based on both the whole-brain and seed-based connectivity
   patterns with accuracy up to 96.3\%. These findings indicate that
   deactivation and connectivity of the DMN were altered in individuals
   with ASD. In addition, these findings suggest that the deficits in DMN
   connectivity could be a neural signature that can be used for
   classifying an individual as belonging to the ASD group.}},

Abstract = {{Pain is known to comprise sensory, cognitive, and affective aspects.
   Despite numerous previous fMRI studies, however, it remains open which
   spatial distribution of activity is sufficient to encode whether a
   stimulus is perceived as painful or not. In this study, we analyzed fMRI
   data from a perceptual decision-making task in which participants were
   exposed to near-threshold laser pulses. Using multivariate analyses on
   different spatial scales, we investigated the predictive capacity of
   fMRI data for decoding whether a stimulus had been perceived as painful.
   Our analysis yielded a rank order of brain regions: during pain
   anticipation, activity in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) afforded the most accurate trial-by-trial
   discrimination between painful and non-painful experiences; whereas
   during the actual stimulation, primary and secondary somatosensory
   cortex, anterior insula, dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex, and OFC were most discriminative. The most accurate prediction
   of pain perception from the stimulation period, however, was enabled by
   the combined activity in pain regions commonly referred to as the `pain
   matrix'. Our results demonstrate that the neural representation of
   (near-threshold) pain is spatially distributed and can be best described
   at an intermediate spatial scale. In addition to its utility in
   establishing structure-function mappings, our approach affords
   trial-by-trial predictions and thus represents a step towards the goal
   of establishing an objective neuronal marker of pain perception. (C)

Abstract = {{Greater expertise for faces in adults than in children may be achieved
   by a dynamic interplay of functional segregation and integration of
   brain regions throughout development The present study examined
   developmental changes in face network functional connectivity in
   children (5-12 years) and adults (18-43 years) during face-viewing using
   a graph-theory approach. A face-specific developmental change involved
   connectivity of the right occipital face area. During childhood, this
   node increased in strength and within-module clustering based on
   positive connectivity. These changes reflect an important role of the
   ROFA in segregation of function during childhood. In addition, strength
   and diversity of connections within a module that included primary
   visual areas (left and right calcarine) and limbic regions (left
   hippocampus and right inferior orbitofrontal cortex) increased from
   childhood to adulthood, reflecting increased visuo-limbic integration.
   This integration was pronounced for faces but also emerged for natural
   objects. Taken together, the primary face-specific developmental changes
   involved segregation of a posterior visual module during childhood,
   possibly implicated in early stage perceptual face processing, and
   greater integration of visuo-limbic connections from childhood to
   adulthood, which may reflect processing related to development of
   perceptual expertise for individuation of faces and other visually
   homogenous categories. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Animated movements of simple geometric shapes can readily be interpreted
   as depicting social events in which animate agents are engaged in
   intentional activity. However, the brain regions associated with such
   intention have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, intentional
   bias was manipulated using shape and pattern animations while measuring
   associated brain activity using event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-five higher-intention involved and
   twenty-five lower-intention involved animations were presented to
   participants. Behavioral results showed that the degree of agency
   attribution of the mental state increased as intentional involvement
   increased. fMRI results revealed that the posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (STS), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), inferior frontal gyrus
   (IFG), premotor, temporal pole, supramarginal gyrus, and superior
   parietal lobule (SPL) were activated while participants viewed the
   high-intention animations. In contrast, occipital, lingual, and middle
   frontal gyri were activated while the participants viewed the
   low-intention animations. These findings suggest that as agent
   attribution increases, the visual brain changes its functional role to
   the intentional brain and becomes a flexible network for processing
   information about social interaction.}},

Abstract = {{The lateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices have both been
   implicated in emotion regulation, but their distinct roles in regulation
   of negative emotion remain poorly understood. To address this issue we
   enrolled 58 participants in an fMRI study in which participants were
   instructed to reappraise both negative and neutral stimuli. This design
   allowed us to separately study activations reflecting cognitive
   processes associated with reappraisal in general and activations
   specifically related to reappraisal of negative emotion. Our results
   confirmed that both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the
   lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contribute to emotion regulation
   through reappraisal. However, activity in the DLPFC was related to
   reappraisal independently of whether negative or neutral stimuli were
   reappraised, whereas the lateral OFC was uniquely related to reappraisal
   of negative stimuli. We suggest that relative to the lateral OFC, the
   DLPFC serves a more general role in emotion regulation, perhaps by
   reflecting the cognitive demand that is inherent to the regulation task.}},

Abstract = {{Humans frequently make real-world decisions based on rapid evaluations
   of minimal information; for example, should we talk to an attractive

   rapid evaluations with real and immediate social consequences. To
   address this question, we scanned participants with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) while they viewed photos of individuals that
   they subsequently met at real-life ``speed-dating{''} events. Neural
   activity in two areas of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC),
   paracingulate cortex, and rostromedial prefrontal cortex (RMPFC) was
   predictive of whether each individual would be ultimately pursued for a
   romantic relationship or rejected. Activity in these areas was
   attributable to two distinct components of romantic evaluation: either
   consensus judgments about physical beauty (paracingulate cortex) or
   individualized preferences based on a partner's perceived personality
   (RMPFC). These data identify novel computational roles for these regions
   of the DMPFC in even very rapid social evaluations. Even a first glance,
   then, can accurately predict romantic desire, but that glance involves a
   mix of physical and psychological judgments that depend on specific
   regions of DMPFC.}},

Abstract = {{Humans adeptly use visual motion to recognize socially relevant facial
   information. The macaque provides a model visual system for studying
   neural coding of expression movements, as its superior temporal sulcus
   (STS) possesses brain areas selective for faces and areas sensitive to
   visual motion. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and facial
   stimuli to localize motion-sensitive areas {[}motion in faces (Mf)
   areas], which responded more to dynamic faces compared with static
   faces, and face-selective areas, which responded selectively to faces
   compared with objects and places. Using multivariate analysis, we found
   that information about both dynamic and static facial expressions could
   be robustly decoded from Mf areas. By contrast, face-selective areas
   exhibited relatively less facial expression information. Classifiers
   trained with expressions from one motion type (dynamic or static) showed
   poor generalization to the other motion type, suggesting that Mf areas
   employ separate and nonconfusable neural codes for dynamic and static
   presentations of the same expressions. We also show that some of the
   motion sensitivity elicited by facial stimuli was not specific to faces
   but could also be elicited by moving dots, particularly in fundus of the
   superior temporal and middle superior temporal polysensory/lower
   superior temporal areas, confirming their already well established
   low-level motion sensitivity. A different pattern was found in anterior
   STS, which responded more to dynamic than to static faces but was not
   sensitive to dot motion. Overall, we show that emotional expressions are
   mostly represented outside of face-selective cortex, in areas sensitive
   to motion. These regions may play a fundamental role in enhancing
   recognition of facial expression despite the complex stimulus changes
   associated with motion.}},

Title = {{Randomized controlled trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction versus
   aerobic exercise: effects on the self-referential brain network in
   social anxiety disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by distorted
   self-views. The goal of this study was to examine whether
   mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) alters behavioral and brain
   measures of negative and positive self-views. Methods: Fifty-six adult
   patients with generalized SAD were randomly assigned to MBSR or a
   comparison aerobic exercise (AE) program. A self-referential encoding
   task was administered at baseline and post-intervention to examine
   changes in behavioral and neural responses in the self-referential brain
   network during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were cued
   to decide whether positive and negative social trait adjectives were
   self-descriptive or in upper case font. Results: Behaviorally, compared
   to AE, MBSR produced greater decreases in negative self-views, and
   equivalent increases in positive self-views. Neurally, during negative
   self versus case, compared to AE, MBSR led to increased brain responses
   in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). There were no differential
   changes for positive self versus case. Secondary analyses showed that
   changes in endorsement of negative and positive self-views were
   associated with decreased social anxiety symptom severity for MBSR, but
   not AE. Additionally, MBSR-related increases in dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex (DMPFC) activity during negative self-view versus case were
   associated with decreased social anxiety related disability and
   increased mindfulness. Analysis of neural temporal dynamics revealed
   MBSR-related changes in the timing of neural responses in the DMPFC and
   PCC for negative self-view versus case. Conclusion: These findings
   suggest that MBSR attenuates maladaptive habitual self-views by
   facilitating automatic (i.e., uninstructed) recruitment of cognitive and
   attention regulation neural networks. This highlights potentially
   important links between self-referential and cognitive-attention
   regulation systems and suggests that MBSR may enhance more adaptive
   social self-referential processes in patients with SAD.}},

Title = {{Maternal interpersonal affiliation is associated with adolescents' brain

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Considerable animal and human research has been dedicated to the effects
   of parenting on structural brain development, focusing on hippocampal
   and prefrontal areas. Conversely, although functional imaging studies
   suggest that the neural reward circuitry is involved in parental
   affection, little is known about mothers' interpersonal qualities in
   relation to their children's brain structure and function. Moreover,
   gender differences concerning the effect of maternal qualities have
   rarely been investigated systematically. In 63 adolescents, we assessed
   structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as
   interpersonal affiliation in their mothers. This allowed us to associate
   maternal affiliation with gray matter density and neural responses
   during different phases of the well-established Monetary Incentive Delay
   task. Maternal affiliation was positively associated with hippocampal
   and orbitofrontal gray matter density. Moreover, in the feedback of
   reward hit as compared with reward miss, an association with caudate
   activation was found. Although no significant gender effects were
   observed in these associations, during reward feedback as compared with
   baseline, maternal affiliation was significantly associated with ventral
   striatal and caudate activation only in females. Our findings
   demonstrate that maternal interpersonal affiliation is related to
   alterations in both the brain structure and reward-related activation in
   healthy adolescents. Importantly, the pattern is in line with typical
   findings in depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, suggesting
   that a lack of maternal affiliation might have a role in the genesis of
   mental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Thinking about other people's thoughts recruits a specific group of
   brain regions, including the temporo-parietal junctions (TPJ), precuneus
   (PC), and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). The same brain regions were
   recruited when children (N = 20, 5-11 years) and adults (N = 8) listened
   to descriptions of characters' mental states, compared to descriptions
   of physical events. Between ages 5 and 11 years, responses in the
   bilateral TPJ became increasingly specific to stories describing mental
   states as opposed to people's appearance and social relationships.
   Functional activity in the right TPJ was related to children's
   performance on a high level theory of mind task. These findings provide
   insights into the origin of neural mechanisms of theory of mind, and how
   behavioral and neural changes can be related in development.}},

Title = {{Bayesian Mixed-Effects Inference on Classification Performance in
   Hierarchical Data Sets}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{3133-3176}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Classification algorithms are frequently used on data with a natural
   hierarchical structure. For instance, classifiers are often trained and
   tested on trial-wise measurements, separately for each subject within a
   group. One important question is how classification outcomes observed in
   individual subjects can be generalized to the population from which the
   group was sampled. To address this question, this paper introduces novel
   statistical models that are guided by three desiderata. First, all
   models explicitly respect the hierarchical nature of the data, that is,
   they are mixed-effects models that simultaneously account for
   within-subjects (fixed-effects) and across-subjects (random-effects)
   variance components. Second, maximum-likelihood estimation is replaced
   by full Bayesian inference in order to enable natural regularization of
   the estimation problem and to afford conclusions in terms of posterior
   probability statements. Third, inference on classification accuracy is
   complemented by inference on the balanced accuracy, which avoids
   inflated accuracy estimates for imbalanced data sets. We introduce
   hierarchical models that satisfy these criteria and demonstrate their
   advantages over conventional methods using MCMC implementations for
   model inversion and model selection on both synthetic and empirical
   data. We envisage that our approach will improve the sensitivity and
   validity of statistical inference in future hierarchical classification
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) has been mostly investigated using
   positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and has received mixed support in electroencephalographic (EEG)
   studies. In this study, after sLORETA transformation of EEG data, we
   applied group spatial independent component analysis which is routinely
   used in fMRI research. In three large and diverse samples coming from
   two different cultures (Russian and Taiwanese), spontaneous EEG data and
   retrospective questionnaire measures of subject's state, thoughts, and
   feelings during the EEG registration were collected. Regression analyses
   showed that appearance of spontaneous self-referential thoughts was best
   predicted by enhanced alpha activity within the DMN. Diminished theta
   and delta activity in the superior frontal gyrus and enhanced beta
   activity in the postcentral gyrus added to the prediction. The enhanced
   alpha activity prevailed in the posterior DMN hub in Russian, but in the
   anterior DMN hub in Taiwanese participants. Possible cross-cultural
   differences in personality and attitudes underlying this difference are
   discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atypical activation during the Embedded Figures Task has been
   demonstrated in autism, but has not been investigated in siblings or
   related to measures of clinical severity. We identified atypical
   activation during the Embedded Figures Task in participants with autism
   and unaffected siblings compared with control subjects in a number of
   temporal and frontal brain regions. Autism and sibling groups, however,
   did not differ in terms of activation during this task. This suggests
   that the pattern of atypical activation identified may represent a
   functional endophenotype of autism, related to familial risk for the
   condition shared between individuals with autism and their siblings. We
   also found that reduced activation in autism relative to control
   subjects in regions including associative visual and face processing
   areas was strongly correlated with the clinical severity of impairments
   in reciprocal social interaction. Behavioural performance was intact in
   autism and sibling groups. Results are discussed in terms of atypical
   information processing styles or of increased activation in temporal and
   frontal regions in autism and the broader phenotype. By separating the
   aspects of atypical activation as markers of familial risk for the
   condition from those that are autism-specific, our findings offer new
   insight into the factors that might cause the expression of autism in
   families, affecting some children but not others.}},

Abstract = {{When making a decision, humans often have to `coordinate'-reach the same
   conclusion-as another individual without explicitly communicating.
   Relatively, little is known about the neural basis for coordination.
   Moreover, previous fMRI investigations have supported conflicting
   hypotheses. One account proposes that individuals coordinate using a
   `gut feeling' and that this is supported by insula recruitment. Another
   account proposes that individuals recruit strategic decision-making
   mechanisms in prefrontal cortex in order to coordinate. We investigate
   the neural basis for coordination in individuals with behavioral-variant
   frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) who have limitations in social
   decision-making associated with disease in prefrontal cortex. We
   demonstrate that bvFTD are impaired at establishing a focal point in a
   semantic task (e.g. `Tell me any boy's name') that requires coordination
   relative to a similar, control semantic task that does not.
   Additionally, coordination limitations in bvFTD are related to cortical
   thinning in prefrontal cortex. These findings are consistent with
   behavioral economic models proposing that, beyond a `gut feeling',
   strategic decision-making contributes to the coordination process,
   including a probabilistic mechanism that evaluates the salience of a
   response (e.g. is `John' a frequent boy's name), a hierarchical
   mechanism that iteratively models an opponent's likely response and a
   mechanism involved in social perspective taking.}},

Abstract = {{Ordinary people make moral judgments that are consistent with
   philosophical and legal principles. Do those judgments derive from the
   controlled application of principles, or do the principles derive from
   automatic judgments? As a case study, we explore the tendency to judge
   harmful actions morally worse than harmful omissions (the `omission
   effect') using fMRI. Because ordinary people readily and spontaneously
   articulate this moral distinction it has been suggested that principled
   reasoning may drive subsequent judgments. If so, people who exhibit the
   largest omission effect should exhibit the greatest activation in
   regions associated with controlled cognition. Yet, we observed the
   opposite relationship: activation in the frontoparietal control network
   was associated with condemning harmful omissions-that is, with
   overriding the omission effect. These data suggest that the omission
   effect arises automatically, without the application of controlled
   cognition. However, controlled cognition is apparently used to overcome
   automatic judgment processes in order to condemn harmful omissions.}},

Abstract = {{Insecure attachment has been linked to depression and to outcome in
   psychotherapy. The neural mechanisms subserving the relationship between
   attachment security and depression are not well understood. We have
   developed a method to examine attachment-related brain activity in
   depression. Twenty-eight women, half depressed, viewed images of their
   mother, a female friend, and female strangers during fMRI scanning. The
   effects of depression and insecure attachment were determined with
   whole-brain multiple linear regression of blood-oxygen-level-dependent
   response against subjects' Beck Depression Inventory and Adult
   Attachment Interview (AAI) coherence of mind scores. Interaction effects
   were analyzed with ANOVA. Activity associated with depression and with
   insecure attachment was found in the cortico-striato-thalamic circuits
   of affect regulation. For early attachment (mother-friend contrast),
   depression scores correlated with activation of cortical and
   sub-cortical components of these circuits, while attachment insecurity
   correlated with sub-cortical activity in the same circuitry. Depression
   and attachment insecurity correlated with both cortical and sub-cortical
   activities for mother-stranger, and areas of overlap and of enhancing
   interactions between depression and insecure attachment were found. For
   late attachment (friend-stranger contrast), only cortical effects were
   found. Depression and attachment insecurity may be subserved by similar
   but distinct components of affect regulating circuits. Their
   interactions may explain the greater difficulty of treating depression
   in insecurely attached patients and suggest a contributing role for
   insecure attachment in depression. Further, differential sub-cortical vs
   cortical encoding of early vs late attachment suggests a top-down model
   of late attachment, potentially relevant to psychotherapeutic outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The neural bases of empathy have been examined mainly in the context of

   the mechanisms by which we share others' joy. Using functional magnetic

   judgment of the emotional state of the other in response to both
   negative and positive events through empathy-related structures, such as
   the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the insula, the superior temporal
   sulcus (STS) and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, the
   responses of the MPFC, bilateral insula and the right IFG to negative
   experiences occurring to the other (but not to the self) were found to
   be much more intense than the responses to positive experiences,
   indicating that humans have a remarkable ability to share the distress
   of others, but may react less to the joy of others.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging research has demonstrated the involvement of a well-defined
   brain network in the mediation of moral judgment in normal population,
   and has suggested the inappropriate network use in criminal psychopathy.
   We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to prove that
   alterations in the brain network subserving moral judgment in criminal
   psychopaths are not limited to the inadequate network use during moral
   judgment, but that a primary network breakdown would exist with
   dysfunctional alterations outside moral dilemma situations. A total of
   22 criminal psychopathic men and 22 control subjects were assessed and
   fMRI maps were generated to identify (i) brain response to moral
   dilemmas, (ii) task-induced deactivation of the network during a
   conventional cognitive task and (iii) the strength of functional
   connectivity within the network during resting-state. The obtained
   functional brain maps indeed confirmed that the network subserving moral
   judgment is underactive in psychopathic individuals during moral dilemma
   situations, but the data also provided evidence of a baseline network
   alteration outside moral contexts with a functional disconnection
   between emotional and cognitive elements that jointly construct moral
   judgment. The finding may have significant social implications if
   considering psychopathic behavior to be a result of a primary breakdown
   in basic brain systems.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual arousal is thought to be the result of two levels of processing:
   conscious and unconscious. Whereas some research exists on the neural
   correlates related with conscious exposure to sexual stimuli, there are
   no parallel data regarding unconscious or subliminal exposure to such
   stimuli. In the present study, we therefore compared brain activation of
   39 participants (20 women) as they were exposed to supraliminal vs
   subliminal sexual stimuli. Supraliminal exposure was associated with
   greater activation in areas that were previously associated with sexual
   arousal (e.g. caudate nucleus and thalamus) as well as areas that were
   previously associated with control (e.g. orbitofrontal cortex and
   cingulate cortex). In contrast, subliminal exposure was mainly related
   to activation in areas previously associated with sexual arousal. Men
   and women exhibited theoretically meaningful differences in patterns of
   activation associated with supra- and subliminal exposure. Findings are
   discussed with regard to sexual arousal and regulatory processes.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the fMRI correlates of observers making trait
   inferences about other people under conflicting social cues.
   Participants were presented with several behavioral descriptions
   involving an agent that implied a particular trait. The last behavior
   was either consistent or inconsistent with the previously implied trait.
   This was done under instructions that elicited either spontaneous trait
   inferences ('read carefully') or intentional trait inferences ('infer a
   trait'). The results revealed that when the behavioral descriptions
   violated earlier trait implications, regardless of instruction, the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was more strongly recruited as well as
   the domain-general conflict network including the posterior medial
   frontal cortex (pmFC) and the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC). These
   latter two areas were more strongly activated under intentional than
   spontaneous instructions. These findings suggest that when
   trait-relevant behavioral information is inconsistent, not only is
   activity increased in the mentalizing network responsible for trait
   processing, but control is also passed to a higher level conflict
   monitoring network in order to detect and resolve the contradiction.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathy, a developmental disorder characterized by profound social
   disturbance, is associated with impaired recognition of distress cues.
   Since distress processing and moral socialization are closely linked,
   uncovering techniques to improve distress recognition could have
   positive treatment implications for developmental disorders that feature
   empathy impairments. Previous studies demonstrate that fear-recognition
   deficits can be remedied by redirecting attention to critical cues (the
   eyes for fearful faces). However, it remains unclear whether this
   manipulation increases activity in empathy-related brain regions, or has
   an alternate compensatory effect that may not promote prosocial
   behaviours. In this fMRI study, a community sample of individuals with
   high vs low callous traits completed an emotion recognition task that
   varied whether the most or least socially meaningful facial features
   were visible (the eyes were isolated or occluded). For fearful faces,
   individuals with high callous traits showed significantly less amygdala
   and medial prefrontal cortex activity than those with low callous traits
   when the eyes were occluded, but not when they were isolated. Consistent
   with recent models of the amygdala that emphasize orientation to
   disambiguate stimuli rather than represent distress, individuals with
   low trait empathy showed greater amygdala activity to the least vs most
   socially meaningful features of fearful faces.}},

Abstract = {{This study tested whether mothers with interpersonal violence-related
   posttraumatic stress disorder (IPV-PTSD) vs healthy controls (HC) would
   show greater limbic and less frontocortical activity when viewing young
   children during separation compared to quiet play. Mothers of 20
   children (12-42 months) participated: 11 IPV-PTSD mothers and 9 HC with
   no PTSD. During fMRI, mothers watched epochs of play and separation from
   their own and unfamiliar children. The study focused on comparison of
   PTSD mothers vs HC viewing children in separation vs play, and viewing
   own vs unfamiliar children in separation. Both groups showed distinct
   patterns of brain activation in response to viewing children in
   separation vs play. PTSD mothers showed greater limbic and less
   frontocortical activity (BA10) than HC. PTSD mothers also reported
   feeling more stressed than HC when watching own and unfamiliar children
   during separation. Their self-reported stress was associated with
   greater limbic and less frontocortical activity. Both groups also showed
   distinct patterns of brain activation in response to viewing their own
   vs unfamiliar children during separation. PTSD mothers' may not have
   access to frontocortical regulation of limbic response upon seeing own

   reported associations of maternal IPV-PTSD and atypical caregiving
   behavior following separation.}},

Abstract = {{Repression designates coping strategies such as avoidance, or denial
   that aim to shield the organism from threatening stimuli. Derakshan et
   al. have proposed the vigilance-avoidance theory of repressive coping.
   It is assumed that repressors have an initial rapid vigilant response
   triggering physiological responses to threat stimuli. In the following
   second stage repressors manifest avoidant cognitive biases. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging at 3T was used to study neural correlates of
   repressive coping during the first stages of perception of threat.
   Pictures of human faces bearing fearful, angry, happy and neutral
   expressions were briefly presented masked by neutral faces. Forty study
   participants (20 repressive and 20 sensitizing individuals) were
   selected from a sample of 150 female students on the basis of their
   scores on the Mainz Coping Inventory. Repressors exhibited stronger
   neural activation than sensitizers primarily in response to masked
   threatening faces (vs neutral baseline) in the frontal, parietal and
   temporal cortex as well as in the cingulate gyrus, basal ganglia and
   insula. There was no brain region in which sensitizers showed increased
   activation to emotion expression compared to repressors. The present
   results are in line with the vigilance-avoidance theory which predicts
   heightened automatic responsivity to threatening stimuli in repression.}},

Abstract = {{Wishful thinking (WT) implies the overestimation of the likelihood of
   desirable events. It occurs for outcomes of personal interest, but also
   for events of interest to others we like. We investigated whether WT is
   grounded on low-level selective attention or on higher level cognitive
   processes including differential weighting of evidence or response
   formation. Participants in our MRI study predicted the likelihood that
   their favorite or least favorite team would win a football game.
   Consistent with expectations, favorite team trials were characterized by
   higher winning odds. Our data demonstrated activity in a cluster
   comprising parts of the left inferior occipital and fusiform gyri to
   distinguish between favorite and least favorite team trials. More
   importantly, functional connectivities of this cluster with the human
   reward system were specifically involved in the type of WT investigated
   in our study, thus supporting the idea of an attention bias generating
   WT. Prefrontal cortex activity also distinguished between the two teams.
   However, activity in this region and its functional connectivities with
   the human reward system were altogether unrelated to the degree of WT
   reflected in the participants' behavior and may rather be related to
   social identification, ensuring the affective context necessary for WT
   to arise.}},

Abstract = {{We outline general theoretical and practical implication of what we
   promote as enactive cinema for the neuroscientific study of online
   socio-emotional interaction. In a real-time functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) setting, participants are immersed in
   cinematic experiences that simulate social situations. While viewing,
   their physiological reactions-including brain responses-are tracked,
   representing implicit and unconscious experiences of the on-going social
   situations. These reactions, in turn, are analyzed in real-time and fed
   back to modify the cinematic sequences they are viewing while being
   scanned. Due to the engaging cinematic content, the proposed setting
   focuses on living-by in terms of shared psycho-physiological
   epiphenomena of experience rather than active coping in terms of
   goal-oriented motor actions. It constitues a means to parametrically
   modify stimuli that depict social situations and their broader
   environmental contexts. As an alternative to studying the variation of
   brain responses as a function of a priori fixed stimuli, this method can
   be applied to survey the range of stimuli that evoke similar responses
   across participants at particular brain regions of interest.}},

Abstract = {{The social brain undergoes developmental change during adolescence, and
   pubertal hormones are hypothesized to contribute to this development. We
   used fMRI to explore how pubertal indicators (salivary concentrations of
   testosterone, oestradiol and DHEA; pubertal stage; menarcheal status)
   relate to brain activity during a social emotion task. Forty-two females
   aged 11.1 to 13.7 years underwent fMRI scanning while reading scenarios
   pertaining either to social emotions, which require the representation
   of another person's mental states, or to basic emotions, which do not.
   Pubertal stage and menarcheal status were used to assign girls to early
   or late puberty groups. Across the entire sample, the contrast between
   social versus basic emotion resulted in activity within the social brain
   network, including dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), the posterior
   superior temporal sulcus, and the anterior temporal cortex (ATC) in both
   hemispheres. Increased hormone levels (independent of age) were
   associated with higher left ATC activity during social emotion
   processing. More advanced age (independent of hormone levels) was
   associated with lower DMPFC activity during social emotion processing.
   Our results suggest functionally dissociable effects of pubertal
   hormones and age on the adolescent social brain.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a transition period that is assumed to be characterized
   by increased sensitivity to reward. While there is growing research on
   reward processing in adolescents, investigations into the engagement of
   brain regions under different reward-related conditions in one sample of
   healthy adolescents, especially in a target age group, are missing. We
   aimed to identify brain regions preferentially activated in a reaction
   time task (monetary incentive delay (MID) task) and a simple guessing
   task (SGT) in a sample of 14-year-old adolescents (N = 54) using two
   commonly used reward paradigms. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
   was employed during the MID with big versus small versus no win
   conditions and the SGT with big versus small win and big versus small
   loss conditions. Analyses focused on changes in blood oxygen
   level-dependent contrasts during reward and punishment processing in
   anticipation and feedback phases. We found clear magnitude-sensitive
   response in reward-related brain regions such as the ventral striatum
   during anticipation in the MID task, but not in the SGT. This was also
   true for reaction times. The feedback phase showed clear reward-related,
   but magnitude-independent, response patterns, for example in the
   anterior cingulate cortex, in both tasks. Our findings highlight neural
   and behavioral response patterns engaged in two different reward
   paradigms in one sample of 14-year-old healthy adolescents and might be
   important for reference in future studies investigating reward and
   punishment processing in a target age group.}},

Abstract = {{Somatoform disorder patients suffer from impaired emotion recognition
   and other emotional deficits. Emotional empathy refers to the
   understanding and sharing of emotions of others in social contexts. It
   is likely that the emotional deficits of somatoform disorder patients
   are linked to disturbed empathic abilities; however, little is known so
   far about empathic deficits of somatoform patients and the underlying
   neural mechanisms. We used fMRI and an empathy paradigm to investigate
   20 somatoform disorder patients and 20 healthy controls. The empathy
   paradigm contained facial pictures expressing anger, joy, disgust, and a
   neutral emotional state; a control condition contained unrecognizable
   stimuli. In addition, questionnaires testing for somatization,
   alexithymia, depression, empathy, and emotion recognition were applied.
   Behavioral results confirmed impaired emotion recognition in somatoform
   disorder and indicated a rather distinct pattern of empathic deficits of
   somatoform patients with specific difficulties in empathic distress. In
   addition, somatoform patients revealed brain areas with diminished
   activity in the contrasts all emotionscontrol, angercontrol, and
   joycontrol, whereas we did not find brain areas with altered activity in
   the contrasts disgustcontrol and neutralcontrol. Significant clusters
   with less activity in somatoform patients included the bilateral
   parahippocampal gyrus, the left amygdala, the left postcentral gyrus,
   the left superior temporal gyrus, the left posterior insula, and the
   bilateral cerebellum. These findings indicate that disturbed emotional
   empathy of somatoform disorder patients is linked to impaired emotion
   recognition and abnormal activity of brain regions responsible for
   emotional evaluation, emotional memory, and emotion generation. Hum

Abstract = {{Recognition of objects and their relations is necessary for orienting in
   real life. We examined cognitive processes related to recognition of
   objects, their relations, and the patterns they form by using the game
   of chess. Chess enables us to compare experts with novices and thus gain
   insight in the nature of development of recognition skills. Eye movement
   recordings showed that experts were generally faster than novices on a
   task that required enumeration of relations between chess objects
   because their extensive knowledge enabled them to immediately focus on
   the objects of interest. The advantage was less pronounced on random
   positions where the location of chess objects, and thus typical
   relations between them, was randomized. Neuroimaging data related
   experts' superior performance to the areas along the dorsal
   streambilateral posterior temporal areas and left inferior parietal lobe
   were related to recognition of object and their functions. The bilateral
   collateral sulci, together with bilateral retrosplenial cortex, were
   also more sensitive to normal than random positions among experts
   indicating their involvement in pattern recognition. The pattern of
   activations suggests experts engage the same regions as novices, but
   also that they employ novel additional regions. Expert processing, as
   the final stage of development, is qualitatively different than novice
   processing, which can be viewed as the starting stage. Since we are all
   experts in real life and dealing with meaningful stimuli in typical
   contexts, our results underline the importance of expert-like cognitive
   processing on generalization of laboratory results to everyday life. Hum

Abstract = {{We report and compare results from the Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT) in
   three languages in a multilingual individual with a fluent primary
   progressive aphasia (PPA): Greek, English, and Czech. Our participant,
   SG, is a 60-year-old male who shows focal atrophy of the left temporal
   and parietal lobes typical of PPA. He is highly educated and holds a
   full-time job in computer maintenance. He has relative preservation of
   memory and appropriate social behavior, and he carries out most
   activities of daily living, including driving, without assistance. Prior
   to his illness he was highly proficient, in speaking/hearing as well as
   reading/writing, in Greek (both the local, sociolinguistically `low'
   variety of Cypriot Greek and the `high' Standard Modern Greek), English,
   and Czech. All languages were used on a daily basis for different
   environments (such as home, work, and travel). Assessment on the BAT
   across languages reveals difficulties with auditory comprehension for
   complex items, semantic interpretation, and (morpho)syntactic
   operations, but generally preserved repetition, reading, and writing.

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of treatment in the second language
   (12) for a previously proficient French-English bilingual with aphasia,
   at 5 years post-stroke. Assessment on the Bilingual Aphasia Test (BAT)
   enabled objective measurement of language skills in each language, and
   comparison across languages, before and after treatment in 12 (English).
   Previous therapy had been provided exclusively in L1 (French).
   Pre-treatment assessment on the BAT revealed greater impairment in L2
   than L1, indicating differential recovery and limited transfer from
   previous L1 intervention. Following treatment, re-assessment on the BAT
   in French and English showed significant gains in spoken expression and
   syntactic comprehension in L2 but not L1. Translation in both directions
   was unchanged. Gains in 12 did not exceed L1 pre-treatment scores. These
   results demonstrate language-specific improvement following treatment in
   12, and indicate caution in assuming therapy transfer will occur in
   proficient, highly motivated late bilinguals. The use of the BAT as a
   cross-linguistically valid assessment tool is recommended for future
   bilingual aphasia research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aging is related to cognitive decline, and it has been reported that
   aging disrupts some resting state brain networks. However, most studies
   have focused on the default mode network and ignored other resting state
   networks. In this study, we measured resting state activity using fMRI
   and explored whether cognitive decline with aging is related to
   disrupted resting state networks. Independent component analysis was
   used to evaluate functional connectivity. Notably, the connectivity
   within the salience network that consisted of the bilateral insula and
   the anterior cingulated cortex decreased with aging; the impairment of
   functional connectivity was correlated with measured decreases in
   individual cognitive abilities. Furthermore, certain internetwork
   connectivities (salience to auditory, default mode to visual, etc.) also
   decreased with aging. These results suggest that (1) aging affects not
   only the default mode network but also other networks, specifically the
   salience network; (2) aging affects internetwork connectivity; and (3)
   disruption of the salience network is related to cognitive decline in
   elderly people.}},

Abstract = {{Research from the past decade has shown that understanding the meaning
   of words and utterances (i.e., abstracted symbols) engages the same
   systems we used to perceive and interact with the physical world in a
   content-specific manner. For example, understanding the word ``grasp{''}
   elicits activation in the cortical motor network, that is, part of the
   neural substrate involved in planned and executing a grasping action. In
   the embodied literature, cortical motor activation during language
   comprehension is thought to reflect motor simulation underlying
   conceptual knowledge {[}note that outside the embodied framework, other
   explanations for the link between action and language are offered, e.g.,
   Mahon, B. Z., \& Caramazza, A. A critical look at the embodied cognition
   hypothesis and a new proposal for grouding conceptual content. Journal
   of Physiology, 102, 59-70, 2008; Hagoort, P. On Broca, brain, and
   binding: A new framework. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9, 416-423,
   2005]. Previous research has supported the view that the coupling
   between language and action is flexible, and reading an action-related
   word form is not sufficient for cortical motor activation {[}Van Dam, W.
   O., van Dijk, M., Bekkering, H., \& Rueschemeyer, S.-A. Flexibility in
   embodied lexical-semantic representations. Human Brain Mapping, doi:
   10.1002/hbm.21365, 2011]. The current study goes one step further by
   addressing the necessity of action-related word forms for motor
   activation during language comprehension. Subjects listened to indirect
   requests (IRs) for action during an fMRI session. IRs for action are
   speech acts in which access to an action concept is required, although
   it is not explicitly encoded in the language. For example, the utterance
   ``It is hot here!{''} in a room with a window is likely to be
   interpreted as a request to open the window. However, the same utterance
   in a desert will be interpreted as a statement. The results indicate (1)
   that comprehension of IR sentences activates cortical motor areas
   reliably more than comprehension of sentences devoid of any implicit
   motor information. This is true despite the fact that IR sentences
   contain no lexical reference to action. (2) Comprehension of IR
   sentences also reliably activates substantial portions of the theory of
   mind network, known to be involved in making inferences about mental
   states of others. The implications of these findings for embodied
   theories of language are discussed.}},

   graph-theoretical-based approach that was previously developed to detect
   clusters among social networks, in detecting the functional clusters
   among the biological neural network of human brain extracted from
   resting-state functional MRI data. Unlike traditional clustering or
   modularity methods, CIS allows for overlapping among the detected
   clusters. CIS was tested on a simulation dataset as well as a biological
   dataset. CIS was able to detect the overlaps designed in the simulation
   dataset; CIS was also able to detect the designed overlap in the
   simulation dataset, and it also detected the overlap between the two
   networks in the biological dataset, which provided new knowledge about
   the architecture of the biological neural network. In conclusion, CIS is
   shown to be useful for revealing the delicate structures among the
   functional clusters in the biological neural network.}},

Abstract = {{This study used fMRI to measure brain activity during adult processing
   of cries of infants with autistic disorder (AD) compared to cries of
   typically developing (TD) infants. Using whole brain analysis, we found
   that cries of infants with AD compared to those of TD infants elicited
   enhanced activity in brain regions associated with verbal and prosodic
   processing, perhaps because altered acoustic patterns of AD cries render
   them especially difficult to interpret, and increased activity in brain
   regions associated with emotional processing, indicating that AD cries
   also elicit more negative feelings and may be perceived as more aversive
   and/or arousing. Perceived distress engendered by AD cries related to
   increased activation in brain regions associated with emotional
   processing. This study supports the hypothesis that cry is an early and
   meaningful anomaly displayed by children with AD. It could be that cries
   associated with AD alter parent-child interactions much earlier than the
   time that reliable AD diagnosis normally occurs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Decision making (DM) in the context of others often entails complex
   cognition-emotion interaction. While the literature suggests that the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and amygdala are
   involved in valuation-based DM and hippocampus in context processing,
   how these neural mechanisms subserve the integration of cognitive and
   emotional values in a social context remains unclear. In this study we
   addressed this gap by systematically manipulating cognition-emotion
   interaction in a social DM context, when the participants played a card
   game with a hypothetical opponent in a behavioral study (n=73) and a
   functional magnetic-resonance-imaging study (n = 16). We observed that
   payoff-based behavioral choices were influenced by emotional values
   carried by face pictures and identified neurocircuits involved in
   cognitive valuation, emotional valuation, and concurrent
   cognition-emotion value integration. Specifically, while the vmPFC,
   amygdala, and ventral striatum were all involved in both cognitive and
   emotional domains of valuation, these regions played dissociable roles
   in social DM. The payoff-dependent responses in vmPFC and amygdala, but
   not ventral striatum, were moderated by the social context. Furthermore,
   the vmPFC, but not amygdala, not only encoded the opponent's gains as if
   self's losses, but also represented a ``final common currency{''} during
   valuation-based decisions. The extent to which emotional input
   influenced choices was associated with the functional connectivity
   between the value-signaling amygdala and value integrating vmPFC, and
   also with the functional connectivity between the context-setting
   hippocampus and value-signaling amygdala and ventral striatum. These
   results identify brain pathways through which emotion shapes subjective
   values in a social DM context. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The perception of causal relationships is crucial to understanding and
   interacting with our physical and social environment. However, whether
   the same or different neural processes are involved in perceiving
   physical and social causality is unknown. Therefore, this study is
   focused on commonalities and differences in the neural correlates of
   causality perception in both contexts.
   During fMRI data-acquisition, participants judged causal relationships
   of objects in two types of animated video clips (physical/social) with
   similar manipulations of temporal and spatial stimulus characteristics.
   Four conditions were analyzed in a two-factorial design {[}physical
   causal (PC), physical non-causal (PNC), social causal (SC), social
   non-causal (SNC)].
   We found that higher angles and longer time delays led to decreasing
   judgments of causality in the physical context, whereas the same
   manipulations led to increasing judgments in the social context.
   Instead of a common network for causal judgments (PC>PNC boolean AND
   SC>SNC), we found a reversed activation pattern for the factors context
   and judgment. PC and SNC {[}(PC>PNC) > (SC>SNC)] produced activations in
   the bilateral insula, the right angular and inferior frontal gyrus and
   the medial supplementary motor area. PNC and SC {[}(PC>PNC) < (SC>SNC)]
   produced activity in medial frontal, left superior temporal and anterior
   cingulate brain regions.
   Our data suggest, that the same brain regions contribute to the
   impression of physical and social causality. However, they demonstrate a
   reversed activation pattern that reflects the stimulus characteristics
   of the respective conditions. Thus, specific stimulus characteristics
   are crucial for the perception of causality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Alcohol Affects the Brain's Resting-State Network in Social Drinkers}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Acute alcohol intake is known to enhance inhibition through facilitation
   of GABA(A) receptors, which are present in 40\% of the synapses all over
   the brain. Evidence suggests that enhanced GABAergic transmission leads
   to increased large-scale brain connectivity. Our hypothesis is that
   acute alcohol intake would increase the functional connectivity of the
   human brain resting-state network (RSN). To test our hypothesis,
   electroencephalographic (EEG) measurements were recorded from healthy
   social drinkers at rest, during eyes-open and eyes-closed sessions,
   after administering to them an alcoholic beverage or placebo
   respectively. Salivary alcohol and cortisol served to measure the
   inebriation and stress levels. By calculating Magnitude Square Coherence
   (MSC) on standardized Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography
   (sLORETA) solutions, we formed cortical networks over several frequency
   bands, which were then analyzed in the context of functional
   connectivity and graph theory. MSC was increased (p < 0.05, corrected
   with False Discovery Rate, FDR corrected) in alpha, beta (eyes-open) and
   theta bands (eyes-closed) following acute alcohol intake. Graph
   parameters were accordingly altered in these bands quantifying the
   effect of alcohol on the structure of brain networks; global efficiency
   and density were higher and path length was lower during alcohol (vs.
   placebo, p < 0.05). Salivary alcohol concentration was positively
   correlated with the density of the network in beta band. The degree of
   specific nodes was elevated following alcohol (vs. placebo). Our
   findings support the hypothesis that short-term inebriation considerably
   increases large-scale connectivity in the RSN. The increased baseline
   functional connectivity can -at least partially-be attributed to the
   alcohol-induced disruption of the delicate balance between inhibitory
   and excitatory neurotransmission in favor of inhibitory influences.
   Thus, it is suggested that short-term inebriation is associated, as
   expected, to increased GABA transmission and functional connectivity,
   while long-term alcohol consumption may be linked to exactly the
   opposite effect.}},

Title = {{When Math Hurts: Math Anxiety Predicts Pain Network Activation in
   Anticipation of Doing Math}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{Math can be difficult, and for those with high levels of
   mathematics-anxiety (HMAs), math is associated with tension,
   apprehension, and fear. But what underlies the feelings of dread
   effected by math anxiety? Are HMAs' feelings about math merely
   psychological epiphenomena, or is their anxiety grounded in simulation
   of a concrete, visceral sensation - such as pain - about which they have
   every right to feel anxious? We show that, when anticipating an upcoming
   math-task, the higher one's math anxiety, the more one increases
   activity in regions associated with visceral threat detection, and often
   the experience of pain itself (bilateral dorso-posterior insula).
   Interestingly, this relation was not seen during math performance,
   suggesting that it is not that math itself hurts; rather, the
   anticipation of math is painful. Our data suggest that pain network
   activation underlies the intuition that simply anticipating a dreaded
   event can feel painful. These results may also provide a potential
   neural mechanism to explain why HMAs tend to avoid math and math-related
   situations, which in turn can bias HMAs away from taking math classes or
   even entire math-related career paths.}},

Title = {{The Temporal Lobes Differentiate between the Voices of Famous and
   Unknown People: An Event-Related fMRI Study on Speaker Recognition}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that the perception of human voices is supported
   by neural structures located along the superior temporal sulci. However,
   there is an ongoing discussion to what extent the activations found in
   fMRI studies are evoked by the vocal features themselves or are the
   result of phonetic processing. To show that the temporal lobes are
   indeed engaged in voice processing, short utterances spoken by famous
   and unknown people were presented to healthy young participants whose
   task it was to identify the familiar speakers. In two event-related fMRI
   experiments, the temporal lobes were found to differentiate between
   familiar and unfamiliar voices such that named voices elicited higher
   BOLD signal intensities than unfamiliar voices. Yet, the temporal
   cortices did not only discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar
   voices. Experiment 2, which required overtly spoken responses and
   allowed to distinguish between four familiarity grades, revealed that
   there was a fine-grained differentiation between all of these
   familiarity levels with higher familiarity being associated with larger
   BOLD signal amplitudes. Finally, we observed a gradual response change
   such that the BOLD signal differences between unfamiliar and highly
   familiar voices increased with the distance of an area from the
   transverse temporal gyri, especially towards the anterior temporal
   cortex and the middle temporal gyri. Therefore, the results suggest that
   (the anterior and non-superior portions of) the temporal lobes
   participate in voice-specific processing independent from phonetic
   components also involved in spoken speech material.}},

Title = {{Is He Being Bad? Social and Language Brain Networks during Social
   Judgment in Children with Autism}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with autism often violate social rules and have lower
   accuracy in identifying and explaining inappropriate social behavior.
   Twelve children with autism (AD) and thirteen children with typical
   development (TD) participated in this fMRI study of the neurofunctional
   basis of social judgment. Participants indicated in which of two
   pictures a boy was being bad (Social condition) or which of two pictures
   was outdoors (Physical condition). In the within-group Social-Physical
   comparison, TD children used components of mentalizing and language
   networks {[}bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), bilateral medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and bilateral posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (pSTS)], whereas AD children used a network that was primarily
   right IFG and bilateral pSTS, suggesting reduced use of social and
   language networks during this social judgment task. A direct group
   comparison on the Social-Physical contrast showed that the TD group had
   greater mPFC, bilateral IFG, and left superior temporal pole activity
   than the AD group. No regions were more active in the AD group than in
   the group with TD in this comparison. Both groups successfully performed
   the task, which required minimal language. The groups also performed
   similarly on eyetracking measures, indicating that the activation
   results probably reflect the use of a more basic strategy by the autism
   group rather than performance disparities. Even though language was
   unnecessary, the children with TD recruited language areas during the
   social task, suggesting automatic encoding of their knowledge into
   language; however, this was not the case for the children with autism.
   These findings support behavioral research indicating that, whereas
   children with autism may recognize socially inappropriate behavior, they
   have difficulty using spoken language to explain why it is
   inappropriate. The fMRI results indicate that AD children may not
   automatically use language to encode their social understanding, making
   expression and generalization of this knowledge more difficult.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{The extent to which people regard others as full-blown individuals with
   mental states ({''}humanization'') seems crucial for their prosocial
   motivation towards them. Previous research has shown that decisions
   about moral dilemmas in which one person can be sacrificed to save
   multiple others do not consistently follow utilitarian principles. We
   hypothesized that this behavior can be explained by the potential
   victim's perceived humanness and an ensuing increase in vicarious
   emotions and emotional conflict during decision making. Using fMRI, we
   assessed neural activity underlying moral decisions that affected
   fictitious persons that had or had not been experimentally humanized. In
   implicit priming trials, participants either engaged in mentalizing
   about these persons (HUMANIZED condition) or not (NEUTRAL condition). In
   subsequent moral dilemmas, participants had to decide about sacrificing
   these persons' lives in order to save the lives of numerous others.
   Humanized persons were sacrificed less often, and the activation pattern
   during decisions about them indicated increased negative affect,
   emotional conflict, vicarious emotions, and behavioral control
   (pgACC/mOFC, anterior insula/IFG, aMCC and precuneus/PCC). Besides, we
   found enhanced effective connectivity between aMCC and anterior insula,
   which suggests increased emotion regulation during decisions affecting
   humanized victims. These findings highlight the importance of others'
   perceived humanness for prosocial behavior - with aversive affect and
   other-related concern when imagining harming more ``human-like'' persons
   acting against purely utilitarian decisions.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-39}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{It is now well established that communicators interpret others' mental
   states through what has been called ``Theory of Mind{''} (ToM). From a
   linguistic-pragmatics perspective, this mentalizing ability is
   considered critical because it is assumed that the linguistic code in
   all utterances underdetermines the speaker's meaning, leaving a vital
   role for ToM to fill the gap. From a neuroscience perspective,
   understanding others' intentions has been shown to activate a neural ToM
   network that includes the right and left temporal parietal junction
   (rTPJ, ITPJ), the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the precuneus
   (PC). Surprisingly, however, there are no studies - to our knowledge -
   that aim to uncover a direct, on-line link between language processing
   and ToM through neuroimaging. This is why we focus on verbal irony, an
   obviously pragmatic phenomenon that compels a listener to detect the
   speaker's (dissociated, mocking) attitude (Wilson, 2009). In the present
   fMRI investigation, we compare participants' comprehension of 18 target
   sentences as contexts make them either ironic or literal. Consider an
   opera singer who tells her interlocutor: ``Tonight we gave a superb
   performance!{''} when the performance in question was clearly awful
   (making the statement ironic) or very good (making the statement
   literal). We demonstrate that the ToM network becomes active while a
   participant is understanding verbal irony. Moreover, we demonstrate -
   through Psychophysiological Interactions (PPI) analyses - that ToM
   activity is directly linked with language comprehension processes. The
   paradigm, its predictions, and the reported results contrast
   dramatically with those from seven prior fMRI studies on irony. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In analogy to visual object recognition, proposals have been made that
   auditory object recognition is organized by sound class (e.g.,
   vocal/non-vocal, linguistic/non-linguistic) and linked to several
   pathways or processing streams with specific functions. To test these
   proposals, we analyzed temporal lobe activations from 297 neuroimaging
   studies on vocal, musical and environmental sound processing. We found
   that all sound classes elicited activations anteriorly, posteriorly and
   ventrally of primary auditory cortex. However, rather than being sound
   class (e.g., voice) or attribute (e.g., complexity) specific, these
   processing streams correlated with sound knowledge or experience.
   Specifically, an anterior stream seemed to support general, sound class
   independent sound recognition and discourse-level semantic processing. A
   posterior stream could be best explained as supporting the embodiment of
   sound associated actions and a ventral stream as supporting multimodal
   conceptual representations. Vocalizations and music engaged these
   streams evenly in the left and right hemispheres, whereas environmental
   sounds produced a left-lateralized pattern. Together, these results both
   challenge and confirm existing proposal of temporal lobe specialization.
   Moreover, they suggest that the temporal lobe maintains the
   neuroanatomical building blocks for an all-purpose sound comprehension
   system that, instead of being preset for a particular sound class, is
   shaped in interaction with an individual's sonic environment. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Resting state functional connectivity, which is defined as temporal
   correlation of spontaneous activity between diverse brain regions, has
   been reported to form resting state networks (RSNs), consisting of a
   specific set of brain regions, based on functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). Recently, studies using near-infrared spectroscopy
   (NIRS) reported that NIRS signals also show temporal correlation between
   different brain regions. The local relationship between NIRS and fMRI
   signals has been examined by simultaneously recording these signals when
   participants perform tasks or respond to stimuli. However, the NIRS-fMRI
   signal relationship during the resting state has been reported only
   between NIRS signals obtained within limited regions and whole brain
   fMRI signals. Therefore, it remains unclear whether NIRS signals
   obtained at diverse regions correlate with regional fMRI signals close
   to the NIRS measurement channels, especially in relation to the RSNs. In
   this study, we tested whether the signals measured by these different
   modalities during the resting state have the consistent characteristics
   of the RSNs. Specifically, NIRS signals during the resting state were
   acquired over the frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices while whole
   brain fMRI data was simultaneously recorded. First, by projecting the
   NIRS channel positions over the cerebral cortical surface, we identified
   the most likely anatomical locations of all NIRS channels used in the
   study. Next, to investigate the regional signal relationship between
   NIRS and fMRI, we calculated the cross-correlation between NIRS signals
   and fMRI signals in the brain regions adjacent to each NIRS channel. For
   each NIRS channel, we observed the local maxima of correlation
   coefficients between NIRS and fMRI signals within a radius of 2 voxels
   from the projection point. Furthermore, we also found that highly
   correlated voxels with the NIRS signal were mainly localized within
   brain tissues for all NIRS channels, with the exception of 2 frontal
   channels. Finally, by calculating the correlation between NIRS signals
   at a channel and whole brain fMRI signals, we observed that NIRS signals
   correlate with fMRI signals not only within brain regions adjacent to
   NIRS channels but also within distant brain regions constituting RSNs,
   such as the dorsal attention, fronto-parietal control, and default mode
   networks. These results support the idea that NIRS signals obtained at
   several cortical regions during the resting state mainly reflect
   regional spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations that originate from
   spontaneous cortical activity, and include information that
   characterizes the RSNs. Because NIRS is relatively easy to use and a
   less physically demanding neuroimaging technique, our findings should
   facilitate a broad application of this technique to examine RSNs,
   especially for clinical populations and conditions unsuitable for fMRI.

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to step into two-person neuroscience by
   investigating the hemodynamic correlates of between-brain connectivity
   involved in imitation and its dependency on pacing stimuli. To test this
   approach, we used wireless functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
   to record simultaneously during imitation performance of a paced
   finger-tapping task (PFT) in two subjects over premotor cortices (PMC).
   During the imitation (IM) condition, a model and an imitator were
   recorded while tapping in synchrony with auditory stimuli separated by a
   constant interval (stimulus-paced mode, St-P), followed by tapping
   without the pacing stimulus (self-paced mode, Se-P). During the control
   (CO) condition, each subject (single 1 and 2) performed the PFT task
   with the same pacing mode pattern, but alone without reference to each
   other.
   Using wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analysis evaluating functional
   connectivity between brains, we found (1) that IM revealed a larger
   coherence increase between the model and the imitator as compared to the
   CO condition. (2) Within the IM condition, a larger coherence increase
   was found during Se-P as compared to St-P mode. Using Granger-causality
   (G-causality) analysis evaluating effective connectivity between brains,
   we found (3) that IM revealed larger G-causality as compared to the CO
   condition and (4) that within the IM condition, the signal of the model
   G-caused that of the imitator to a greater extent as compared to vice
   versa.
   Our findings designate fNIRS as suitable tool for monitoring
   between-brain connectivity during dynamic interactions between two
   subjects and that those measurements might thereby provide insight into
   activation patterns not detectable using typical single-person
   experiments. Overall, the results of the present study demonstrate the
   potential of simultaneously assessing brain hemodynamics in interacting
   subjects in several research areas where social interactions are
   involved. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An important human capacity is the ability to imagine performing an
   action, and its consequences, without actually executing it. Here we
   seek neural representations of specific manual actions that are common
   across visuo-motor performance and imagery.
   Participants were scanned with fMRI while they performed and observed
   themselves performing two different manual actions during some trials,
   and imagined performing and observing themselves performing the same
   actions during other trials. We used multi-variate pattern analysis to
   identify areas where representations of specific actions generalize
   across imagined and performed actions. The left anterior parietal cortex
   showed this property. In this region, we also found that activity
   patterns for imagined actions generalize better to performed actions
   than vice versa, and we provide simulation results that can explain this
   asymmetry. The present results are the first demonstration of
   action-specific representations that are similar irrespective of whether
   actions are actively performed or covertly imagined. Further, they
   demonstrate concretely how the apparent cross-modal visuo-motor coding
   of actions identified in studies of a human ``mirror neuron system{''}
   could, at least partially, reflect imagery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A growing body of neuroimaging evidence has shown that Chinese character
   processing recruits differential activation from alphabetic languages
   due to its unique linguistic features. As more investigations on Chinese
   character processing have recently become available, we applied a
   meta-analytic approach to summarize previous findings and examined the
   neural networks for orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing
   of Chinese characters independently. The activation likelihood
   estimation (ALE) method was used to analyze eight studies in the
   orthographic task category, eleven in the phonological and fifteen in
   the semantic task categories. Converging activation among three
   language-processing components was found in the left middle frontal
   gyrus, the left superior parietal lobule and the left mid-fusiform
   gyrus, suggesting a common sub-network underlying the character
   recognition process regardless of the task nature. With increasing task
   demands, the left inferior parietal lobule and the right superior
   temporal gyrus were specialized for phonological processing, while the
   left middle temporal gyrus was involved in semantic processing.
   Functional dissociation was identified in the left inferior frontal
   gyrus, with the posterior dorsal part for phonological processing and
   the anterior ventral part for semantic processing. Moreover, bilateral
   involvement of the ventral occipito-temporal regions was found for both
   phonological and semantic processing. The results provide better
   understanding of the neural networks underlying Chinese orthographic,
   phonological, and semantic processing, and consolidate the findings of
   additional recruitment of the left middle frontal gyrus and the right
   fusiform gyrus for Chinese character processing as compared with the
   universal language network that has been based on alphabetic languages.

Abstract = {{People suppressing their emotions while facing an emotional event
   typically remember it less well. However, the neural mechanisms
   underlying the impairing effect of emotion suppression on successful
   memory encoding are not well understood. Because successful memory
   encoding relies on the hippocampus and the amygdala, we hypothesized
   that memory impairments due to emotion suppression are associated with
   down-regulated activity in these brain areas. 59 healthy females were
   instructed either to simply watch the pictures or to down-regulate their
   emotions by using a response-focused emotion suppression strategy. Brain
   activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI), and free recall of pictures was tested afterwards. As expected,
   suppressing one's emotions resulted in impaired recall of the pictures.
   On the neural level, the memory impairments were associated with reduced
   activity in the right hippocampus during successful encoding. No
   significant effects were observed in the amygdala. In addition,
   functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was strongly reduced during emotion
   suppression, and these reductions predicted free-recall performance. Our
   results indicate that emotion suppression interferes with memory
   encoding on the hippocampal level, possibly by decoupling hippocampal
   and prefrontal encoding processes, suggesting that response-focused
   emotion suppression might be an adaptive strategy for impairing
   hippocampal memory formation in highly arousing situations. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A growing literature indicates that visual cortex areas viewed as
   primarily responsive to exogenous stimuli are susceptible to top-down
   modulation by selective attention. The present study examines whether
   brain areas involved in biological motion perception are among these
   areas-particularly with respect to selective attention towards human
   movement goals. Fifteen participants completed a point-light biological
   motion study following a two-by-two factorial design, with one factor
   representing an exogenous manipulation of human movement goals
   (goal-directed versus random movement), and the other an endogenous
   manipulation (a goal identification task versus an ancillary
   color-change task). Both manipulations yielded increased activation in
   the human homologue of motion-sensitive area MT+ (hMT+) as well as the
   extrastriate body area (ERA). The endogenous manipulation was associated
   with increased right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS)
   activation, whereas the exogenous manipulation was associated with
   increased activation in left posterior STS. Selective attention towards
   goals activated a portion of left hMT+/EBA only during the perception of
   purposeful movement-consistent with emerging theories associating this
   area with the matching of visual motion input to known goal-directed
   actions. The overall pattern of results indicates that attention towards
   the goals of human movement activates biological motion areas.
   Ultimately, selective attention may explain why some studies examining
   biological motion show activation in hMT+ and EBA, even when using
   control stimuli with comparable motion properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies have investigated non-literal language,
   including metaphors, idioms, metonymy, or irony, with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, key questions regarding its
   neuroanatomy remain controversial. In this work, we used
   coordinate-based activation-likelihood estimations to merge available
   fMRI data on non-literal language.
   A literature search identified 38 fMRI studies on non-literal language
   (24 metaphor studies, 14 non-salient stimuli studies, 7 idiom studies, 8
   irony studies, and 1 metonymy study). Twenty-eight studies with direct
   comparisons of non-literal and literal studies were included in the main
   meta-analysis. Sub-analyses for metaphors, idioms, irony, salient
   metaphors, and non-salient metaphors as well as studies on sentence
   level were conducted.
   Studies reported 409 activation foci, of which 129 (32\%) were in the
   right hemisphere. These meta-analyses indicate that a predominantly left
   lateralised network, including the left and right inferior frontal
   gyrus; the left, middle, and superior temporal gyrus; and medial
   prefrontal, superior frontal, cerebellar, parahippocampal, precentral,
   and inferior parietal regions, is important for non-literal expressions.

Title = {{Understanding and Imitating Unfamiliar Actions: Distinct Underlying
   Mechanisms}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{The human ``mirror neuron system'' has been proposed to be the neural
   substrate that underlies understanding and, possibly, imitating actions.
   However, since the brain activity with mirror properties seems
   insufficient to provide a good description for imitation of actions
   outside one's own repertoire, the existence of supplementary processes
   has been proposed. Moreover, it is unclear whether action observation
   requires the same neural mechanisms as the explicit access to their
   meaning. The aim of this study was two-fold as we investigated whether
   action observation requires different processes depending on 1) whether
   the ultimate goal is to imitate or understand the presented actions and
   2) whether the to-be-imitated actions are familiar or unfamiliar to the
   subject. Participants were presented with both meaningful familiar
   actions and meaningless unfamiliar actions that they had to either
   imitate or discriminate later. Event-related Potentials were used as
   differences in brain activity could have been masked by the use of other
   techniques with lower temporal resolution. In the imitation task, a
   sustained left frontal negativity was more pronounced for meaningless
   actions than for meaningful ones, starting from an early time-window.
   Conversely, observing unfamiliar versus familiar actions with the
   intention of discriminating them led to marked differences over right
   centro-posterior scalp regions, in both middle and latest time-windows.
   These findings suggest that action imitation and action understanding
   may be sustained by dissociable mechanisms: while imitation of
   unfamiliar actions activates left frontal processes, that are likely to
   be related to learning mechanisms, action understanding involves
   dedicated operations which probably require right posterior regions,
   consistent with their involvement in social interactions.}},

Title = {{DNA methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene predicts neural response
   to ambiguous social stimuli}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Oxytocin and its receptor (OXTR) play an important role in a variety of
   social perceptual and affiliative processes. Individual variability in
   social information processing likely has a strong heritable component,
   and as such, many investigations have established an association between
   common genetic variants of OXTR and variability in the social phenotype.
   However, to date, these investigations have primarily focused only on
   changes in the sequence of DNA without considering the role of
   epigenetic factors. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism by which
   cells control transcription through modification of chromatin structure.
   DNA methylation of OXTR decreases expression of the gene and high levels
   of methylation have been associated with autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD). This link between epigenetic variability and social phenotype
   allows for the possibility that social processes are under epigenetic
   control. We hypothesized that the level of DNA methylation of OXTR would
   predict individual variability in social perception. Using the brain's
   sensitivity to displays of animacy as a neural endophenotype of social
   perception, we found significant associations between the degree of OXTR
   methylation and brain activity evoked by the perception of animacy. Our
   results suggest that consideration of DNA methylation may substantially
   improve our ability to explain individual differences in imaging genetic
   association studies.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Observing someone perform an action engages brain regions involved in
   motor planning, such as the inferior frontal, premotor, and inferior
   parietal cortices. Recent research suggests that during action
   observation, activity in these neural regions can be modulated by
   membership in an ethnic group defined by physical differences. In this
   study we expanded upon previous research by matching physical similarity
   of two different social groups and investigating whether likability of
   an outgroup member modulates activity in neural regions involved in
   action observation. Seventeen Jewish subjects were familiarized with
   biographies of eight individuals, half of the individuals belonged to
   Neo-Nazi groups (dislikable) and half of which did not (likable). All
   subjects and actors in the stimuli were Caucasian and physically
   similar. The subjects then viewed videos of actors portraying the
   characters performing simple motor actions (e. g. grasping a water
   bottle and raising it to the lips), while undergoing fMRI. Using
   multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we found that a classifier trained
   on brain activation patterns successfully discriminated between the
   likable and dislikable action observation conditions within the right
   ventral premotor cortex. These data indicate that the spatial pattern of
   activity in action observation related neural regions is modulated by
   likability even when watching a simple action such as reaching for a
   cup. These findings lend further support for the notion that social
   factors such as interpersonal liking modulate perceptual processing in
   motor-related cortices.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new method of structural equation modeling (SEM) for
   longitudinal and time series data, named Dynamic GSCA (Generalized
   Structured Component Analysis). The proposed method extends the original
   GSCA by incorporating a multivariate autoregressive model to account for
   the dynamic nature of data taken over time. Dynamic GSCA also
   incorporates direct and modulating effects of input variables on
   specific latent variables and on connections between latent variables,
   respectively. An alternating least square (ALS) algorithm is developed
   for parameter estimation. An improved bootstrap method called a modified
   moving block bootstrap method is used to assess reliability of parameter
   estimates, which deals with time dependence between consecutive
   observations effectively. We analyze synthetic and real data to
   illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Classic social psychology studies demonstrate that people can behave in
   ways that contradict their intentions-especially within the moral
   domain. We measured brain activity while subjects decided between
   financial self-benefit (earning money) and preventing physical harm
   (applying an electric shock) to a confederate under both real and
   hypothetical conditions. We found a shared neural network associated
   with empathic concern for both types of decisions. However, hypothetical
   and real moral decisions also recruited distinct neural circuitry:
   hypothetical moral decisions mapped closely onto the imagination
   network, while real moral decisions elicited activity in the bilateral
   amygdala and anterior cingulate-areas essential for social and affective
   processes. Moreover, during real moral decision-making, distinct regions
   of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) determined whether subjects make selfish
   or pro-social moral choices. Together, these results reveal not only
   differential neural mechanisms for real and hypothetical moral decisions
   but also that the nature of real moral decisions can be predicted by
   dissociable networks within the PFC.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic knowledge refers to the information that people have about
   categories of objects and living things. Social psychologists have long
   debated whether the information that perceivers have about categories of
   people-i.e. stereotypes-may be a unique form of semantics. Here, we
   examine this question against well-established findings regarding the
   neural basis of semantics, which suggest that two brain regions-left
   inferior frontal gyrus and inferotemporal cortex-are critical for
   general semantic knowledge. During functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, participants answered questions about their knowledge of both
   non-social and social categories. We reasoned that if stereotypes are a
   typical form of semantic knowledge, then these same regions should
   subserve the activation and retrieval of stereotypes. Inconsistent with
   this possibility, left inferior frontal gyrus and inferotemporal cortex
   were activated only during non-social category judgments. Instead,
   judgments of social categories were associated with regions frequently
   linked to social cognition, including medial prefrontal cortex,
   posterior cingulate, bilateral temporoparietal junction and anterior
   temporal cortex. Together, these results suggest that social stereotypes
   should be considered distinct from other forms of semantic knowledge,
   and may have more in common with representing mental states than
   retrieving semantic knowledge about objects and non-human living things.}},

Abstract = {{Priming negative stereotypes of African Americans can bias perceptions
   toward novel Black targets, but less is known about how these
   perceptions ultimately arise. Examining how neural regions involved in
   arousal, inhibition and control covary when negative stereotypes are
   activated can provide insight into whether individuals attempt to
   downregulate biases. Using fMRI, White egalitarian-motivated
   participants were shown Black and White faces at fast (32 ms) or slow
   (525 ms) presentation speeds. To create a racially negative stereotypic
   context, participants listened to violent and misogynistic rap (VMR) in
   the background. No music (NM) and death metal (DM) were used as control
   conditions in separate blocks. Fast exposure of Black faces elicited
   amygdala activation in the NM and VMR conditions (but not DM), that also
   negatively covaried with activation in prefrontal regions. Only in VMR,
   however, did amygdala activation for Black faces persist during slow
   exposure and positively covary with activation in dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex while negatively covarying with activation in
   orbitofrontal cortex. Findings suggest that contexts that prime negative
   racial stereotypes seem to hinder the downregulation of amygdala
   activation that typically occurs when egalitarian perceivers are exposed
   to Black faces.}},

Abstract = {{Most choices are complex and can be considered from a number of
   different perspectives. For example, someone choosing a snack may have
   taste, health, cost or any number of factors at the forefront of their
   mind. Although previous research has examined neural systems related to
   value and choice, very little is known about how mindset influences
   these systems. In the current study, participants were primed with
   Health or Taste while they made decisions about snack foods. Some neural
   regions showed consistent associations with value and choice across
   Health or Taste mindsets. Regardless of mindset, medial orbitofrontal
   cortex (MOFC) tracked value in terms of taste, regions in left lateral
   prefrontal cortex (LPFC) tracked value in terms of health, and MOFC and
   dorsal anterior cingulate were associated with choice. However, activity
   in other neural regions was modulated by the mindset manipulation. When
   primed with Taste, rostral anterior cingulate tracked value in terms of
   taste whereas left amygdala and left putamen were associated with
   choice. When primed with Health, right LPFC and posterior MOFC tracked
   value in terms of health. The findings contribute to the neural research
   on decision-making by demonstrating that changing perspectives can
   modulate value- and choice-related neural activity.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{804-810}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Imitation is an important component of human social learning throughout
   life. Theoretical models and empirical data from anthropology and
   psychology suggest that people tend to imitate self-similar individuals,
   and that such imitation biases increase the adaptive value (e.g.,
   self-relevance) of learned information. It is unclear, however, what
   neural mechanisms underlie people's tendency to imitate those similar to
   themselves. We focused on the own-gender imitation bias, a pervasive
   bias thought to be important for gender identity development. While
   undergoing fMRI, participants imitated own- and other-gender actors
   performing novel, meaningless hand signs; as control conditions, they
   also simply observed such actions and viewed still portraits of the same
   actors. Only the ventral and dorsal striatum, orbitofrontal cortex and
   amygdala were more active when imitating own- compared to other-gender
   individuals. A Bayesian analysis of the BrainMap neuroimaging database
   demonstrated that the striatal region preferentially activated by
   own-gender imitation is selectively activated by classical reward tasks
   in the literature. Taken together, these findings reveal a
   neurobiological mechanism associated with the own-gender imitation bias
   and demonstrate a novel role of reward-processing neural structures in
   social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In emotional learning tasks, sex differences, stress effects and an
   interaction of these two moderators have often been observed. The sex
   hormones estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) vary over the menstrual
   cycle. We tested groups with different sex hormone status: 39 men, 30
   women in the luteal phase (LU, high E2+P4) and 29 women taking oral
   contraceptives (OC, low E2+P4). They received either 30 mg cortisol or
   placebo prior to instructed differential fear conditioning consisting of
   neutral conditioned stimuli (CS) and an electrical stimulation
   (unconditioned stimulus; UCS). One figure (CS+) was paired with the UCS,
   the other figure (CS-) never. During extinction, no electrical
   stimulation was administered. Regarding fear acquisition, results showed
   higher skin conductance and higher brain responses to the CS+ compared
   to the CS- in several structures that were not modulated by cortisol or
   sex hormones. However, OC women exhibited higher CS+/CS-
   differentiations than men and LU women in the amygdala, thalamus,
   anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during extinction.
   The suppression of endogenous sex hormones by OC seems to alter neuronal
   correlates of extinction. The observation that extinction is influenced
   by the current sex hormone availability is relevant for future studies
   and might also be clinically important.}},

   implicated in social threat processing and anxiety. Participants were 14
   healthy male non/infrequent caffeine consumers. In a double-blind
   placebo-controlled crossover design, they underwent blood oxygenation
   level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while
   performing an emotional face processing task 1 h after receiving
   caffeine (250 mg) or placebo in two fMRI sessions (counterbalanced,
   1-week washout). They rated anxiety and mental alertness, and their
   blood pressure was measured, before and 2 h after treatment. Results
   showed that caffeine induced threat-related (angry/fearful faces > happy
   faces) midbrain-periaqueductal gray activation and abolished
   threat-related medial prefrontal cortex wall activation. Effects of
   caffeine on extent of threat-related amygdala activation correlated
   negatively with level of dietary caffeine intake. In concurrence with
   these changes in threat-related brain activation, caffeine increased
   self-rated anxiety and diastolic blood pressure. Caffeine did not affect
   primary visual cortex activation. These results are the first to
   demonstrate potential neural correlates of the anxiogenic effect of
   caffeine, and they implicate the amygdala as a key site for caffeine
   tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of personality on the neural correlates of emotional
   processing is still not well characterized. We investigated the
   relationship between extraversion and neuroticism and emotional
   perception using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a group
   of 23 young, healthy women. Using a parametric modulation approach, we
   examined how the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal varied
   with the participants' ratings of arousal and valence, and whether
   levels of extraversion and neuroticism were related to these
   modulations. In particular, we wished to test Eysenck's biological
   theory of personality, which links high extraversion to lower levels of
   reticulothalamic-cortical arousal, and neuroticism to increased
   reactivity of the limbic system and stronger reactions to emotional
   arousal. Individuals high in neuroticism demonstrated reduced sustained
   activation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and attenuated valence
   processing in the right temporal lobe while viewing emotional images,
   but an increased BOLD response to emotional arousal in the right medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These results support Eysenck's theory, as
   well as our hypothesis that high levels of neuroticism are associated
   with attenuated reward processing. Extraversion was inversely related to
   arousal processing in the right cerebellum, but positively associated
   with arousal processing in the right insula, indicating that the
   relationship between extraversion and arousal is not as simple as that
   proposed by Eysenck.}},

Abstract = {{Context: People with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have lifelong
   deficits in social behavior and differences in behavioral as well as
   neural responses to facial expressions of emotion. The biological basis
   to this is incompletely understood, but it may include differences in
   the role of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which modulate facial
   emotion processing in health. While some individuals with ASD have
   significant differences in the serotonin system, to our knowledge, no
   one has investigated its role during facial emotion processing in adults
   with ASD and control subjects using acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Objective: To compare the effects of ATD on brain responses to primary
   facial expressions of emotion in men with ASD and healthy control
   subjects.
   Design: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of ATD and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during
   incidental processing of disgust, fearful, happy, and sad facial
   expressions.
   Setting: Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, and South
   London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, England.
   Participants: Fourteen men of normal intelligence with autism and 14
   control subjects who did not significantly differ in sex, age, or
   overall intelligence.
   Main Outcome Measures: Blood oxygenation level-dependent response to
   facial expressions of emotion.
   Results: Brain activation was differentially modulated by ATD depending
   on diagnostic group and emotion type within regions of the social brain
   network. For example, processing of disgust faces was associated with
   interactions in medial frontal and lingual gyri, whereas processing of
   happy faces was associated with interactions in middle frontal gyrus and
   putamen.
   Conclusions: Modulation of the processing of facial expressions of
   emotion by serotonin significantly differs in people with ASD compared
   with control subjects. The differences vary with emotion type and occur
   in social brain regions that have been shown to be associated with group
   differences in serotonin synthesis/receptor or transporter density.

Abstract = {{Context: Proneness to overgeneralization of self-blame is a core part of
   cognitive vulnerability to major depressive disorder (MDD) and remains
   dormant after remission of symptoms. Current neuroanatomical models of
   MDD, however, assume general increases of negative emotions and are
   unable to explain biases toward emotions entailing self-blame (eg,
   guilt) relative to those associated with blaming others (eg,
   indignation). Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   studies in healthy participants have shown that moral feelings such as
   guilt activate representations of social meaning within the right
   superior anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Furthermore, this area was
   selectively coupled with the subgenual cingulate cortex and adjacent
   septal region (SCSR) during the experience of guilt compared with
   indignation. Despite its psychopathological importance, the functional
   neuroanatomy of guilt in MDD is unknown.
   Objective: To use fMRI to test the hypothesis that, in comparison with
   control individuals, participants with remitted MDD exhibit
   guilt-selective SCSR-ATL decoupling as a marker of deficient functional
   integration.
   Design: Case-control study from May 1, 2008, to June 1, 2010.
   Setting: Clinical research facility.
   Participants: Twenty-five patients with remitted MDD (no medication in
   16 patients) with no current comorbid Axis I disorders and 22 controls
   with no personal or family history of MDD.
   Main Outcome Measures: Between-group difference of ATL coupling with a
   priori SCSR region of interest for guilt vs indignation.
   Results: We corroborated the prediction of a guilt-selective reduction
   in ATL-SCSR coupling in MDD vs controls (familywise error-corrected
   P=.001 over the region of interest) and revealed additional medial
   frontopolar, right hippocampal, and lateral hypothalamic areas of
   decoupling while controlling for medication status and intensity of
   negative emotions. Lower levels of ATL-SCSR coupling were associated
   with higher scores on a validated measure of overgeneralized self-blame
   (67-item Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire).
   Conclusions: Vulnerability to MDD is associated with
   temporofrontolimbicdecouplingthat is selective forself-blaming feelings.
   This provides the first neural mechanism of MDD vulnerability that
   accounts for self-blaming biases.

Abstract = {{It is well known that the fusiform gyrus is engaged in face perception,
   such as the processes of face familiarity and identity. However, the
   functional role of the fusiform gyrus in face processing related to
   high-level social cognition remains unclear. The current study assessed
   the functional role of individually defined fusiform face area (FFA) in
   the processing of self-face physical properties and self-face identity.
   We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor neural
   responses to rapidly presented face stimuli drawn from morph continua
   between self-face (Morph 100\%) and a gender-matched friend's face
   (Morph 0\%) in a face recognition task. Contrasting Morph 100\% versus
   Morph 60\% that differed in self-face physical properties but were both
   recognized as the self uncovered neural activity sensitive to self-face
   physical properties in the left FFA. Contrasting Morphs 50\% that were
   recognized as the self versus a friend on different trials revealed
   neural modulations associated with self-face identity in the right FFA.
   Moreover, the right FFA activity correlated with the frequency of
   recognizing Morphs 50\% as the self. Our results provide evidence for
   functional dissociations of the left and right FFAs in the
   representations of self-face physical properties and self-face identity.

   her/his identity. Here, we tested the specificity of this effect and its
   underlying brain processes. We manipulated three social cues displayed
   by an agent: Gaze Direction (Direct/Averted), Emotional Expression
   (Anger/Neutral), and Pointing gesture (Presence/Absence). Our behavioral
   experiment showed that direct as compared with averted gaze perception
   enhanced subsequent retrieval of face identity. Similar effect of
   enhanced retrieval was found when pointing finger was absent as compared
   with present but not for anger as compared with neutral expression. The
   fMRI results revealed amygdala activity for both Anger and Direct gaze
   conditions, suggesting emotional arousal. Yet, the right hippocampus,
   known to play a role in self-relevant memory processes, was only
   revealed during direct gaze perception. Further investigations suggest
   that right hippocampal activity was maximal for the most self-relevant
   social event (i.e. actor expressing anger and pointing toward the
   participant with direct gaze). Altogether, our results suggest that the
   perception of self-relevant social cues such as direct gaze
   automatically prompts self-relevant memory processes. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{There has been much debate recently over the functional role played by
   the planum temporale (PT) within the context of the dorsal auditory
   processing stream. Some studies indicate that regions in the PT support
   spatial hearing and other auditory functions, whereas others demonstrate
   sensory-motor response properties. This multifunctionality has led to
   the claim that the PT is performing a common computational pattern
   matching operation, then routing the signals (spatial, object,
   sensory-motor) into an appropriate processing stream. An alternative
   possibility is that the PT is functionally subdivided with separate
   regions supporting various functions. We assess this possibility using a
   within subject fMRI block design. DTI data were also collected to
   examine connectivity. There were four auditory conditions: stationary
   noise, moving noise, listening to pseudowords, and shadowing pseudowords
   (covert repetition). Contrasting the shadow and listen conditions should
   activate regions specific to sensory-motor processes, while contrasting
   the stationary and moving noise conditions should activate regions
   involved in spatial hearing. Subjects (N = 16) showed greater activation
   for shadowing in left posterior PT, area Spt, when the shadow and listen
   conditions were contrasted. The motion vs. stationary noise contrast
   revealed greater activation in a more medial and anterior portion of
   left PT. Seeds from these two contrasts were then used to guide the DTI
   analysis in an examination of connectivity via streamline tractography,
   which revealed different patterns of connectivity. Findings support a
   heterogeneous model of the PT, with functionally distinct regions for
   sensory-motor integration and processes involved in auditory spatial
   perception. Hum Brain Mapp 33:24532463, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate
   brain processes underlying control of emotional responses towards a
   person in distress by cognitive social distance modulation. fMRI and
   peripheral physiological responses (startle response and electrodermal
   activity) were recorded from 24 women while they watched victimoffender
   scenes and modulated their social distance to the victim by cognitive
   reappraisal. We found that emotional responses, including startle
   eyeblink and amygdala responses, can effectively be modulated by social
   distance modulation. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that
   activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior
   paracingulate cortex (aPCC), two brain regions that have previously been
   associated with brain processes related to distant and close others, is
   differentially modulated by intentional social distance modulation:
   activity in the dmPFC increased with increasing disengagement from the
   victim and activity in the aPCC increased with increasing engagement
   with the victim. We suggest that these two regions play opposing roles
   in cognitive modulation of social distance and affective responses
   towards persons in distress that enable the adaptive and flexible social
   behavior observed in humans. Hum Brain Mapp 33:24642476, 2012. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to improve fMRI Granger Causality Analysis (GCA)
   by proposing and comparing two strategies for defining the topology of
   the networks among which cerebral connectivity is measured and to apply
   fMRI GCA for studying epileptic seizure propagation. The first proposed
   method is based on information derived from anatomical atlas only; the
   other one is based on functional information and employs an algorithm of
   hierarchical clustering applied to fMRI data directly. Both methods were
   applied to signals recorded during seizures on a group of epileptic
   subjects and two connectivity matrices were obtained for each patient.
   The performances of the different parcellation strategies were evaluated
   in terms of their capability to recover information about the source and
   the sink of the network (i.e., the starting and the ending point of the
   seizure propagation). The first method allows to clearly identify the
   seizure onset in all patients, whereas the network sources are not so
   immediately recognizable when the second method was used. Nevertheless,
   results obtained using functional clustering do not contradict those
   obtained with the anatomical atlas and are able to individuate the main
   pattern of propagation. In conclusion, the way nodes are defined can
   influence the easiness of identification of the epileptogenic focus but
   does not produce contradictory results showing the effectiveness of
   proposed approach to formulate hypothesis about seizure propagation at
   least in the early phase of investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Although previous studies investigated the relationship between general
   cognitive abilities and decision making, few have characterized specific
   cognitive abilities underlying decision-making competence. In this
   paper, we focus on executive functionscontrol processes involved in the
   regulation of cognition. Specifically, we report on an
   individual-differences study that investigated the relationship of
   executive functioning (EF) and general cognitive abilities (fluid
   intelligence and numeracy) with different aspects of decision-making
   competence. Individual differences in EF components explained aspects of
   decision-making competence even after controlling for fluid intelligence
   and numeracy. However, different aspects of decision-making competence
   varied in the extent to which they relied on different executive
   functions. In particular, resistance to framing effects, the ability to
   apply decision rules, and successful engagement in cognitive reflection
   partially depend on individual differences on the monitoring/inhibition
   dimension of EF. The ability to provide consistent judgments in risk
   perception is related to the shifting aspect of EF. The ability to
   recognize social norms and resistance to sunk costs were not
   significantly related to EF, thus supporting the idea that executive
   control is not a major determinant of these aspects of decision-making
   competence. Finally, substantial variance in some of the decision-making
   tasks remained unexplained, suggesting that other cognitive or
   non-cognitive abilities need to be considered in future studies.

Abstract = {{There is growing recognition that emotional context may play an
   important role in emotion perception and severe mental illness (SMI).
   Limited instruments directly assess and adequately account for emotional
   context processing. To measure this construct in schizophrenia research,
   this study aimed to develop and validate the Emotional Context
   Processing Scale (ECOS) using cartoon portrayals originally developed by
   Masuda et al. (2008). In Study 1, we piloted the measure with 99 college
   students and selected 20 cartoon portrayals (4 simple emotions only+16
   simple emotions with contextual emotions). In Study 2, we confirmed the
   emotion-specificity and factor structure of the measure by administering
   it to 73 individuals with SMI. Item response theory (IRT) modeling
   confirmed a 4-factor structure of the ECOS, providing evidence that
   emotional context processing is specific to particular emotions.
   Internal consistency of the ECOS subscales ranged from 0.61 to 0.83. In
   Study 3, we examined the convergent and divergent validity of the ECOS
   in a separate sample of 36 individuals with SMI. Even after controlling
   for facial affect perception. the ECOS is uniquely related to
   multi-modal emotion perception and executive functioning measures. (C)

Abstract = {{Persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are known to have
   difficulty in eye contact (EC). This may make it difficult for their
   partners during face to face communication with them. To elucidate the
   neural substrates of live inter-subject interaction of ASD patients and
   normal subjects, we conducted hyper-scanning functional MRI with 21
   subjects with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) paired with
   typically-developed (normal) subjects, and with 19 pairs of normal
   subjects as a control. Baseline EC was maintained while subjects
   performed real-time joint-attention task. The task-related effects were
   modeled out, and inter-individual correlation analysis was performed on
   the residual time-course data. ASD-Normal pairs were less accurate at
   detecting gaze direction than Normal-Normal pairs. Performance was
   impaired both in ASD subjects and in their normal partners. The left
   occipital pole (OP) activation by gaze processing was reduced in ASD
   subjects, suggesting that deterioration of eye-cue detection in ASD is
   related to impairment of early visual processing of gaze. On the other
   hand, their normal partners showed greater activity in the bilateral
   occipital cortex and the right prefrontal area, indicating a
   compensatory workload. Inter-brain coherence in the right IFG that was
   observed in the Normal-Normal pairs (Saito et al., 2010) during EC
   diminished in ASD-Normal pairs. Intra-brain functional connectivity
   between the right IFG and right superior temporal sulcus (STS) in normal
   subjects paired with ASD subjects was reduced compared within
   Normal-Normal pairs. This functional connectivity was positively
   correlated with performance of the normal partners on the eye-cue
   detection. Considering the integrative role of the right STS in gaze
   processing, inter-subject synchronization during EC may be a
   prerequisite for eye cue detection by the normal partner.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive regulation is often used to influence behavioral outcomes.
   However, the computational and neurobiological mechanisms by which it
   affects behavior remain unknown. We studied this issue using an fMRI
   task in which human participants used cognitive regulation to upregulate
   and downregulate their cravings for foods at the time of choice. We
   found that activity in both ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) correlated with value. We also
   found evidence that two distinct regulatory mechanisms were at work:
   value modulation, which operates by changing the values assigned to
   foods in vmPFC and dlPFC at the time of choice, and behavioral control
   modulation, which operates by changing the relative influence of the
   vmPFC and dlPFC value signals on the action selection process used to
   make choices. In particular, during downregulation, activation decreased
   in the value-sensitive region of dlPFC (indicating value modulation) but
   not in vmPFC, and the relative contribution of the two value signals to
   behavior shifted toward the dlPFC (indicating behavioral control
   modulation). The opposite pattern was observed during upregulation:
   activation increased in vmPFC but not dlPFC, and the relative
   contribution to behavior shifted toward the vmPFC. Finally,
   ventrolateral PFC and posterior parietal cortex were more active during
   both upregulation and downregulation, and were functionally connected
   with vmPFC and dlPFC during cognitive regulation, which suggests that
   they help to implement the changes to the decision-making circuitry
   generated by cognitive regulation.}},

Title = {{Social and monetary reward processing in autism spectrum disorders}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Social motivation theory suggests that deficits in social
   reward processing underlie social impairments in autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD). However, the extent to which abnormalities in reward
   processing generalize to other classes of stimuli remains unresolved.
   The aim of the current study was to examine if reward processing
   abnormalities in ASD are specific to social stimuli or can be
   generalized to other classes of reward. Additionally, we sought to
   examine the results in the light of behavioral impairments in ASD.
   Methods: Participants performed adapted versions of the social and
   monetary incentive delay tasks. Data from 21 unmedicated right-handed
   male participants with ASD and 21 age- and IQ-matched controls were
   analyzed using a factorial design to examine the
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response during the anticipation and
   receipt of both reward types.
   Results: Behaviorally, the ASD group showed less of a reduction in
   reaction time (RT) for rewarded compared to unrewarded trials than the
   control group. In terms of the fMRI results, there were no significant
   group differences in reward circuitry during reward anticipation. During
   the receipt of rewards, there was a significant interaction between
   group and reward type in the left dorsal striatum (DS). The ASD group
   showed reduced activity in the DS compared to controls for social
   rewards but not monetary rewards and decreased activation for social
   rewards compared to monetary rewards. Controls showed no significant
   difference between the two reward types. Increased activation in the DS
   during social reward processing was associated with faster response
   times for rewarded trials, compared to unrewarded trials, in both
   groups. This is in line with behavioral results indicating that the ASD
   group showed less of a reduction in RT for rewarded compared to
   unrewarded trials. Additionally, de-activation to social rewards was
   associated with increased repetitive behavior in ASD.
   Conclusions: In line with social motivation theory, the ASD group showed
   reduced activation, compared to controls, during the receipt of social
   rewards in the DS. Groups did not differ significantly during the
   processing of monetary rewards. BOLD activation in the DS, during social
   reward processing, was associated with behavioral impairments in ASD.}},

Title = {{Are Autobiographical Memories Inherently Social? Evidence from an fMRI
   Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{The story of our lifetime - our narrative self - is constructed from our
   autobiographical memories. A central claim of social psychology is that
   this narrative self is inherently social: When we construct our lives,
   we do so in a real or imagined interaction. This predicts that
   self-referential processes which are involved in recall of
   autobiographical memories overlap with processes involved in social
   interactions. Indeed, previous functional MRI studies indicate that
   regions in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are activated during
   autobiographical memory recall and virtual communication. However, no
   fMRI study has investigated recall of autobiographical memories in a
   real-life interaction. We developed a novel paradigm in which
   participants overtly reported self-related and other-related memories to
   an experimenter, whose non-verbal reactions were being filmed and online
   displayed to the participants in the scanner. We found that recall of
   autobiographical vs. non-autobiographical memories was associated with
   activation of the mPFC, as was recall in the social as compared to a
   non-social control condition; however, both contrasts involved different
   non-overlapping regions within the mPFC. These results indicate that
   self-referential processes involved in autobiographical memory recall
   are different from processes supporting social interactions, and argue
   against the hypothesis that autobiographical memories are inherently
   social.}},

Title = {{Altered Brain Activity during Reward Anticipation in Pathological
   Gambling and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pathological gambling (PG) and obsessive-compulsive disorder
   (OCD) are conceptualized as a behavioral addiction, with a dependency on
   repetitive gambling behavior and rewarding effects following compulsive
   behavior, respectively. However, no neuroimaging studies to date have
   examined reward circuitry during the anticipation phase of reward in PG
   compared with in OCD while considering repetitive gambling and
   compulsion as addictive behaviors.
   Methods/Principal Findings: To elucidate the neural activities specific
   to the anticipation phase of reward, we performed event-related
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in young adults with PG and
   compared them with those in patients with OCD and healthy controls.
   Fifteen male patients with PG, 13 patients with OCD, and 15 healthy
   controls, group-matched for age, gender, and IQ, participated in a
   monetary incentive delay task during fMRI scanning. Neural activation in
   the ventromedial caudate nucleus during anticipation of both gain and
   loss decreased in patients with PG compared with that in patients with
   OCD and healthy controls. Additionally, reduced activation in the
   anterior insula during anticipation of loss was observed in patients
   with PG compared with that in patients with OCD which was intermediate
   between that in OCD and healthy controls (healthy controls < PG < OCD),
   and a significant positive correlation between activity in the anterior
   insula and South Oaks Gambling Screen score was found in patients with
   PG.
   Conclusions: Decreased neural activity in the ventromedial caudate
   nucleus during anticipation may be a specific neurobiological feature
   for the pathophysiology of PG, distinguishing it from OCD and healthy
   controls. Correlation of anterior insular activity during loss
   anticipation with PG symptoms suggests that patients with PG fit the
   features of OCD associated with harm avoidance as PG symptoms
   deteriorate. Our findings have identified functional disparities and
   similarities between patients with PG and OCD related to the neural
   responses associated with reward anticipation.}},

Abstract = {{Early-stage romantic love is associated with activation in reward and
   motivation systems of the brain. Can these localized activations, or
   others, predict long-term relationship stability? We contacted
   participants from a previous fMRI study of early-stage love by Xu et al.
   {[}34] after 40 months from initial assessments. We compared brain
   activation during the initial assessment at early-stage love for those
   who were still together at 40 months and those who were apart, and
   surveyed those still together about their relationship happiness and
   commitment at 40 months. Six participants who were still with their
   partners at 40 months (compared to six who had broken up) showed less
   activation during early-stage love in the medial orbitofrontal cortex,
   right subcallosal cingulate and right accumbens, regions implicated in
   long-term love and relationship satisfaction {[}1,2]. These regions of
   deactivation at the early stage of love were also negatively correlated
   with relationship happiness scores collected at 40 months. Other areas
   involved were the caudate tail, and temporal and parietal lobes. These
   data are preliminary evidence that neural responses in the early stages
   of romantic love can predict relationship stability and quality up to 40
   months later in the relationship. The brain regions involved suggest
   that forebrain reward functions may be predictive for relationship
   stability, as well as regions involved in social evaluation, emotional
   regulation, and mood. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The formation of new sound categories is fundamental to everyday
   goal-directed behavior. Categorization requires the abstraction of
   discrete classes from continuous physical features as required by
   context and task. Electrophysiology in animals has shown that learning
   to categorize novel sounds alters their spatiotemporal neural
   representation at the level of early auditory cortex. However,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies so far did not
   yield insight into the effects of category learning on sound
   representations in human auditory cortex. This may be due to the use of
   overlearned speech-like categories and fMRI subtraction paradigms,
   leading to insufficient sensitivity to distinguish the responses to
   learning-induced, novel sound categories. Here, we used fMRI pattern
   analysis to investigate changes in human auditory cortical response
   patterns induced by category learning. We created complex novel sound
   categories and analyzed distributed activation patterns during passive
   listening to a sound continuum before and after category learning. We
   show that only after training, sound categories could be successfully
   decoded from early auditory areas and that learning-induced pattern
   changes were specific to the category-distinctive sound feature (i.e.,
   pitch). Notably, the similarity between fMRI response patterns for the
   sound continuum mirrored the sigmoid shape of the behavioral category
   identification function. Our results indicate that perceptual
   representations of novel sound categories emerge from neural changes at
   early levels of the human auditory processing hierarchy.}},

Abstract = {{According to social psychology models of adult attachment, a fundamental
   dimension of attachment is anxiety. Individuals who are high in
   attachment anxiety are motivated to achieve intimacy in relationships,
   but are mistrustful of others and their availability. Behavioral
   research has shown that anxiously attached persons are vigilant for
   emotional facial expression, but the neural substrates underlying this
   perceptual sensitivity remain largely unknown. In the present study
   functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine automatic
   brain reactivity to approach-related facial emotions as a function of
   attachment anxiety in a sample of 109 healthy adults. Pictures of sad
   and happy faces were presented masked by neutral faces. The Relationship
   Scales Questionnaire (RSQ) was used to assess attachment style.
   Attachment anxiety was correlated with depressivity, trait anxiety, and
   attachment avoidance. Controlling for these variables,
   attachment-related anxiety was positively related to responses in left
   inferior, middle, and medial prefrontal areas, globus pallidus,
   claustrum, and right cerebellum to masked happy facial expression.
   Attachment anxiety was not found to be associated with brain activation
   due to masked sad faces. Our findings suggest that anxiously attached
   adults are automatically more responsive to positive approach-related
   facial expression in brain areas that are involved in the perception of
   facial emotion, facial mimicry, or the assessment of affective value and
   social distance. (C) 2012 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Potentiated Amygdala Response to Repeated Emotional Pictures in

Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by an
   inability to regulate emotional responses. The amygdala is important in
   learning about the valence (goodness and badness) of stimuli and
   functions abnormally in BPD.
   Methods: Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was
   employed in three groups: unmedicated BPD (n = 33) and schizotypal
   personality disorder (n = 28) participants and healthy control subjects
   (n = 32) during a task involving an intermixed series of unpleasant,
   neutral, and pleasant pictures each presented twice within their
   respective trial block/run. The amygdala was hand-traced on each
   participant's structural MRI scan and co-registered to their MRI scan.
   Amygdala responses were examined with a mixed-model multivariate
   analysis of variance.
   Results: Compared with both control groups, BPD patients showed greater
   amygdala activation, particularly to the repeated emotional but not
   neutral pictures, and a prolonged return to baseline for the overall
   blood oxygen level-dependent response averaged across all pictures.
   Despite amygdala overactivation, BPD patients showed blunted self-report
   ratings of emotional but not neutral pictures. Fewer dissociative
   symptoms in both patient groups were associated with greater amygdala
   activation to repeated unpleasant pictures.
   Conclusions: The increased amygdala response to the repeated emotional
   pictures observed in BPD was not observed in schizotypal patients,
   suggesting diagnostic specificity. This BPD-related abnormality is
   consistent with the well-documented clinical feature of high sensitivity
   to emotional stimuli with unusually strong and long-lasting reactions.
   The finding of a mismatch between physiological and self-report measures
   of emotion reactivity in BPD patients suggests they may benefit from
   treatments targeting emotion recognition.}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Generalized social phobia (GSP) and generalized anxiety
   disorder (GAD) are both associated with emotion dysregulation. Research
   implicates dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in both explicit emotion
   regulation (EER) and top-down attentional control (TAC). Although
   studies have examined these processes in GSP or GAD, no work compares
   findings across the two disorders or examines functioning in cases
   comorbid for both disorders (GSP/GAD). Here we compare the neural
   correlates of EER and TAC in GSP, GAD, and GSP/GAD.
   Methods: Medication-free adults with GSP (EER n = 19; TAC n = 18), GAD
   (EER n = 17; TAC n = 17), GSP/GAD (EER n = 17; TAC n = 15), and no
   psychopathology (EER n = 18; TAC n = 18) participated. During EER,
   individuals alternatively viewed and upregulated and downregulated
   responses to emotional pictures. During TAC, they performed an emotional
   Stroop task.
   Results: For both tasks, significant group X condition interactions
   emerged in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and parietal cortices.
   Healthy adults showed significantly increased recruitment during emotion
   regulation, relative to emotion-picture viewing. GAD, GSP, and GSP/GAD
   subjects showed no such increases, with all groups differing from
   healthy adults but not from each other. Evidence of emotion-related
   disorder-specificity emerged in medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala.
   This disorder-specific responding varied as a function of emotion
   content but not emotion-regulatory demands.
   Conclusions: GSP and GAD both involve reduced capacity for engaging
   emotion-regulation brain networks, whether explicitly or via TAC. A
   reduced ability to recruit regions implicated in top-down attention
   might represent a general risk factor for anxiety disorders.}},

Title = {{A functional neuroimaging study assessing gender differences in the

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1473}},

Abstract = {{There is ample evidence of gender differences in neural processes and
   behavior. Differences in reward-related behaviors have been linked to
   either temporary or permanent organizational influences of gonadal
   hormones on the mesolimbic dopamine system and reward-related
   activation. Still, little is known about the association between
   biological gender and the neural underpinnings of the ability to resist
   reward-related impulses. Here we assessed with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging which neural processes enable men and women to
   successfully control their desire for immediate reward when this is
   required by a higher-order goal (i.e., during a `desire-reason dilemma';
   Dielchof and Gruber, 2010). Thirty-two participants (16 females) were
   closely matched for age, personality characteristics (e.g., novelty
   seeking) and behavioral performance in the `desire-reason task'. On the
   neural level, men and women showed similarities in the general response
   of the nucleus accumbens and of the ventral tegmental area to predictors
   of immediate reward, but they differed in additional brain mechanisms
   that enabled self-controlled decisions against the preference for
   immediate reward. Firstly, men exhibited a stronger reduction of
   activation in the ventral pallidum, putamen, temporal pole and pregenual
   anterior cingulate cortex during the `desire-reason dilemma'. Secondly,
   connectivity analyses revealed a significant change in the direction of
   the connectivity between anteroventral prefrontal cortex and nucleus
   accumbens during decisions counteracting the reward-related impulse when
   comparing men and women. Together, these findings support the view of a
   sexual dimorphism that manifested in the recruitment of gender-specific
   neural resources during the successful deployment of self-control. (c)

Abstract = {{Sleep deprivation affects cerebral metabolism and reduces the functional
   connectivity among various regions of the brain, potentially explaining
   some of the associated mood and emotional changes often observed. Prior
   neuroimaging studies have only examined the effects of sleep deprivation
   or partial sleep restriction on functional connectivity, but none have
   studied how such connectivity is associated with normal variations in
   self-reported sleep duration the night before the scan. We examined the
   relationship between sleep duration and resting state functional
   connectivity among healthy volunteers who slept at home according to
   their own schedules. Thirty-nine healthy individuals aged 18-45 (21
   females) completed a questionnaire asking about their recent sleep
   habits and entries in their sleep diary for the previous night, followed
   by resting state functional MRI at 3T. Participants reported sleeping
   between 5.0 and 8.5 h the night before the scan (M=7.0, SD=0.9). Seed
   regions were placed in the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior
   cingulate cortex nodes of the default mode network, regions previously
   implicated in sleep deprivation. Longer self-reported sleep duration was
   associated with significantly enhanced functional connectivity between
   the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate, as well as greater
   anticorrelations with parietal, occipital, and lateral prefrontal
   regions. Findings suggest that even normal variations in sleep duration
   measured by self-report are related to the strength of functional
   connectivity within select nodes of the default mode network and its
   anticorrelated network. NeuroReport 23:741-745 (C) 2012 Wolters Kluwer

Abstract = {{As genes that confer increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
   are identified, a crucial next step is to determine how these risk
   factors impact brain structure and function and contribute to disorder
   heterogeneity. With three converging lines of evidence, we show that a
   common, functional ASD risk variant in the Met Receptor Tyrosine Kinase
   (MET) gene is a potent modulator of key social brain circuitry in
   children and adolescents with and without ASD. MET risk genotype
   predicted atypical fMRI activation and deactivation patterns to social
   stimuli (i.e., emotional faces), as well as reduced functional and
   structural connectivity in temporo-parietal regions known to have high
   MET expression, particularly within the default mode network. Notably,
   these effects were more pronounced in individuals with ASD. These
   findings highlight how genetic stratification may reduce heterogeneity
   and help elucidate the biological basis of complex neuropsychiatric

Title = {{Explicit and implicit issues in the developmental cognitive neuroscience
   of social inequality}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{The appearance of developmental cognitive neuroscience (DCN) in the
   socio economic status (SES) research arena is hugely transformative, but
   challenging. We review challenges rooted in the implicit and explicit
   assumptions informing this newborn field. We provide balanced
   theoretical alternatives on how hypothesized psychological processes map
   onto the brain (e.g., problem of localization) and how experimental
   phenomena at multiple levels of analysis (e. g., behavior, cognition and
   the brain) could be related. We therefore examine unclear issues
   regarding the existing perspectives on poverty and their relationships
   with low SES, the evidence of low-SES adaptive functioning, historical
   precedents of the ``alternate pathways{''} (neuroplasticity)
   interpretation of learning disabilities related to low SES and the
   notion of deficit, issues of ``normativity{''} and validity in findings
   of neurocognitive differences between children from different SES, and
   finally alternative interpretations of the complex relationship between
   IQ and SES. Particularly, we examine the extent to which the available
   laboratory results may be interpreted as showing that cognitive
   performance in low-SES children reflects cognitive and behavioral
   deficits as a result of growing up in specific environmental or cultural
   contexts, and how the experimental findings should be interpreted for
   the design of different types of interventions-particularly those
   related to educational practices-or translated to the public especially
   the media. Although a cautionary tone permeates many studies, still, a
   potential deficit attribution-i.e., low-SES is associated with cognitive
   and behavioral developmental deficits seems almost an inevitable
   implicit issue with ethical implications. Finally, we sketch the agenda
   for an ecological DCN, suggesting recommendations to advance the field,
   specifically, to minimize equivocal divulgation and maximize ethically
   responsible translation.}},

Title = {{Approach-Bias Predicts Development of Cannabis Problem Severity in Heavy
   Cannabis Users: Results from a Prospective FMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 5}},
Abstract = {{A potentially powerful predictor for the course of drug (ab) use is the
   approach-bias, that is, the pre-reflective tendency to approach rather
   than avoid drug-related stimuli. Here we investigated the neural
   underpinnings of cannabis approach and avoidance tendencies. By
   elucidating the predictive power of neural approach-bias activations for
   future cannabis use and problem severity, we aimed at identifying new
   intervention targets. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   (fMRI), neural approach-bias activations were measured with a Stimulus
   Response Compatibility task (SRC) and compared between 33 heavy cannabis
   users and 36 matched controls. In addition, associations were examined
   between approach-bias activations and cannabis use and problem severity
   at baseline and at six-month follow-up. Approach-bias activations did
   not differ between heavy cannabis users and controls. However, within
   the group of heavy cannabis users, a positive relation was observed
   between total lifetime cannabis use and approach-bias activations in
   various fronto-limbic areas. Moreover, approach-bias activations in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) independently predicted cannabis problem severity after six months
   over and beyond session-induced subjective measures of craving. Higher
   DLPFC/ACC activity during cannabis approach trials, but lower activity
   during cannabis avoidance trials were associated with decreases in
   cannabis problem severity. These findings suggest that cannabis users
   with deficient control over cannabis action tendencies are more likely
   to develop cannabis related problems. Moreover, the balance between
   cannabis approach and avoidance responses in the DLPFC and ACC may help
   identify individuals at-risk for cannabis use disorders and may be new
   targets for prevention and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative studies have established that a number of structures within
   the rostromedial basal forebrain are critical for affiliative behaviors
   and social attachment. Lesion and neuroimaging studies concur with the
   importance of these regions for attachment and the experience of
   affiliation in humans as well. Yet it remains obscure whether the neural
   bases of affiliative experiences can be differentiated from the
   emotional valence with which they are inextricably associated at the
   experiential level. Here we show, using functional MRI, that
   kinship-related social scenarios evocative of affiliative emotion induce
   septal-preoptic-anterior hypothalamic activity that cannot be explained
   by positive or negative emotional valence alone. Our findings suggest
   that a phylogenetically conserved ensemble of basal forebrain
   structures, especially the septohypothalamic area, may play a key role
   in enabling human affiliative emotion. Our finding of a neural signature
   of human affiliative experience bears direct implications for the
   neurobiological mechanisms underpinning impaired affiliative experiences
   and behaviors in neuropsychiatric conditions.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective: D-Cycloserine may enhance fear extinction. The effects of
   D-cycloserine on human brain function are not well understood, with
   findings suggesting that D-cycloserine could augment exposure therapy
   via its effects on the neural substrates of emotional learning and
   extinction or by acting upon different neural pathways. The aim of this
   exploratory study was to investigate differences in neural response in
   patients receiving D-cycloserine or placebo in addition to exposure
   therapy.
   Method:Twenty adults with snake phobia (DSM-IV specific phobia) received
   50 mg of D-cycloserine or placebo (double-blind, randomized) 1 hour
   prior to a single session of graded exposure therapy in an outpatient
   specialty clinic. One week before and after treatment, patients
   completed a clinical examination and snake-stimuli symptom provocation
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task (primary outcome
   measure).
   Results:The D-cycloserine and placebo groups responded equally well to
   treatment, although the D-cycloserine patients reached the top of the
   exposure hierarchy more quickly (t = 2.61, P < .05). Only right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed an equivalent decrease in
   hyperactivation to snake stimuli in both groups. Compared to placebo,
   D-cycloserine augmentation resulted in different ventromedial prefrontal
   brain activation during processing of phobic stimuli, including enhanced
   medial orbitofrontal (F = 11.52, P = .001) and subgenual anterior
   cingulate activation (F = 7.41, P = .008) and normalized perigenual
   cingulate ``deactivation{''} (F = 3.85, P = .05) to snakes.
   Conclusions: A single administration of D-cycloserine combined with
   exposure therapy can lead to lasting changes in ventromedial and other
   prefrontal cortex response to phobic stimuli. These changes are
   qualitatively different from those seen in patients receiving exposure
   therapy without D-cycloserine.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Advances in the neurosciences have many implications for a collective
   understanding of what it means to be human, in particular, notions of
   the self, the concept of volition or agency, questions of individual
   responsibility, and the phenomenology of consciousness. As the ability
   to peer directly into the brain is scientifically honed, and conscious
   states can be correlated with patterns of neural processing, an easy-but
   premature-leap is to postulate a one-way, brain-based determinism. That
   leap is problematic, however, and emerging findings in neuroscience can
   even be seen as compatible with some of the basic tenets of
   existentialism. Given the compelling authority of modern ``science,{''}
   it is especially important to question how the findings of neuroscience
   are framed, and how the articulation of research results challenge or
   change individuals' perceptions of themselves. Context plays an
   essential role in the emergence of human identity and in the sculpting
   of the human brain; for example, even a lack of stimuli
   ({''}nothing{''}) can lead to substantial consequences for brain,
   behavior, and experience. Conversely, advances in understanding the
   brain might contribute to more precise definitions of what it means to
   be human, including definitions of appropriate social and moral
   behavior. Put another way, the issue is not simply the ethics involved
   in framing neurotechnology, but also the incorporation of
   neuroscientific findings into a richer understanding of human ethical
   (and existential) functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific developments take place in a socio-political context but
   scientists often ignore the ways their innovations will be both
   interpreted by the media and used by policy makers. In the rush to
   neuroscientific discovery important questions are overlooked, such as
   the ways: (1) the brain, environment and behavior are related; (2)
   biological changes are mediated by social organization; (3)
   institutional bias in the application of technical procedures ignores
   race, class and gender dimensions of society; (4) knowledge is used to
   the advantage of the powerful; and (5) its applications may reinforce
   existing structures of power that pose ethical questions about
   distributive justice. The case of crime, deception and functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) shows the complexity, and the
   political and ethical challenges that confront those who seek to use
   neuroscience to explain the etiology of crime, and who base policy on
   its findings. An ethically grounded neuroscience needs to take account
   of existing structures of power and difference, and to develop a public

   the application of science and technology are participants in the

Abstract = {{Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) with luteal phase related anxiety
   and mood swings compromise quality of life in around 4\% of reproductive
   women. While anxiety is related to amygdala function, prior studies on
   amygdala reactivity both in healthy controls and women with PMDD are
   inconsistent with respect to menstrual cycle effects. Here women with
   PMDD and healthy controls were exposed to emotional faces during the
   mid-follicular and late luteal phase, and mean blood-oxygen-level
   dependence (BOLD) signal changes in the amygdala were determined with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Women with PMDD had
   enhanced bilateral amygdala reactivity in the follicular phase in
   comparison with healthy controls, but there was no difference between
   groups during the luteal phase. In contrast, healthy controls displayed
   higher left amygdala reactivity in the luteal than in their follicular
   phase. However, among women with PMDD follicular phase progesterone
   serum concentrations were positively correlated with bilateral amygdala
   reactivity while depression scores were positively correlated with right
   amygdala reactivity in the luteal phase. In addition, women with PMDD
   and high scores on trait anxiety had increased right amygdala reactivity
   in the luteal as compared to the follicular phase. Finally, amygdala
   reactivity was more prone to habituation in women with PMDD, as they had
   enhanced amygdala reactivity in comparison with controls at the first,
   but not the second scanning session. Thus, while the study failed to
   indicate increased luteal phase amygdala reactivity in women with PMDD,
   our findings suggest that anxiety proneness and progesterone levels
   modulate menstrual cycle related amygdala reactivity in women with PMDD.

Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging is charged with revealing thoughts and
   intentions, the source of mental dysfunction, and the basis of
   fundamental human traits. Critics have argued that situating the mind in
   a brain scan risks essentializing contested social and psychiatric
   categories, encourages deterministic perspectives, and diverts attention
   from non-biological ways of understanding the mind. Here, I review these
   critical discourses and ask whether they are reflected in popular media,
   through a discourse analysis of print and online reports of functional
   neuroimaging research deriving primarily from the United Kingdom. In
   contrast to earlier studies, I found diverse challenges to the expertise
   of the scanner, ranging from explicit polemic to assertions of lay
   expertise. Brain images themselves were often manipulated, mislabelled
   or omitted in favour of photographic representations of mental function,
   posing new questions about the rhetorical power of the scan. These
   findings caution against premature conclusions concerning the reductive
   impact of popularized neuroimages, but I also argue for caution
   regarding the reach and novelty of the critical engagements I observed.
   Finally, I argue that qualitative analysis of media texts is essential
   to understanding the developing discourse surrounding functional
   neuroimaging, and discuss possible implications for science
   communication and public engagement practice. BioSocieties (2012) 7,

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders are developmental disorders characterized by
   impairments in social and communication abilities and repetitive
   behaviours. Converging neuroscientific evidence has suggested that the
   neuropathology of autism spectrum disorders is widely distributed,
   involving impaired connectivity throughout the brain. Here, we evaluate
   the hypothesis that decreased connectivity in high-functioning
   adolescents with an autism spectrum disorder relative to typically
   developing adolescents is concentrated within domain-specific circuits
   that are specialized for social processing. Using a novel whole-brain
   connectivity approach in functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found
   that not only are decreases in connectivity most pronounced between
   regions of the social brain but also they are selective to connections
   between limbic-related brain regions involved in affective aspects of
   social processing from other parts of the social brain that support
   language and sensorimotor processes. This selective pattern was
   independently obtained for correlations with measures of social symptom
   severity, implying a fractionation of the social brain in autism
   spectrum disorders at the level of whole circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Gray matter abnormalities have been found in anorexia nervosa (AN) in
   several brain regions. However, little is known about white matter
   abnormalities under the condition of AN. To comprehensively assess the
   microstructural integrity of white matter pathways in women with
   anorexia nervosa, we performed voxel-based Diffusion Tensor Imaging
   (DTI). 21 women with AN according to DSM-IV criteria (9 of them
   recovered) and 20 female age-matched healthy control subjects were
   enrolled in the study. The patients had a mean body mass index of 17.2
   kg/m(2) (controls: 19.6 kg/m(2)). High resolution T1 images (MP-RAGE)
   and DTI were performed on a 3 T Siemens-scanner. Images were
   pre-processed and analyzed using a modified protocol for DTI in SPM2.
   Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were compared using t-tests (p < 0.05.
   corrected). Compared with controls, AN patients showed bilateral
   reductions of FA maps in the posterior thalamic radiation which includes
   the optic radiation, and the left mediodorsal thalamus. Our study is
   limited by the small sample size and its cross-sectional design. A
   longitudinal design with the same individuals assessed when acutely ill
   and recovered is warranted for future studies. For the first time, the
   findings of our DTI study identified disturbances of associational and
   commissural fibers in the bilateral occipitotemporal white matter. The
   results help narrowing the prevailing biological models of AN by
   suggesting that body image distortion is related to microstructural
   alterations of white matter tracts connecting the extrastriate visual
   cortex with other brain regions involved in body perception. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Emotional abnormalities are a critical clinical feature of schizophrenia
   (SCZ), but complete understanding of their underlying neuropathology is
   lacking. Numerous studies have examined amygdala activation in response
   to affective stimuli in SCZ, but no consensus has emerged. However,
   behavioral studies examining ``in-the-moment{''} processing of affect
   have suggested intact emotional processing in SCZ. To examine which
   aspects of emotional processing may be impaired in SCZ, we combined
   behavior and neuroimaging to investigate effects of aversive stimuli
   during minimal cognitive engagement, at the level of behavior, amygdala
   recruitment, and its whole-brain task-based functional connectivity
   (tb-fcMRI) because impairments may manifest when examining across-region
   functional integration. Twenty-eight patients and 24 matched controls
   underwent rapid event-related fMRI at 3 T while performing a simple
   perceptual decision task with negative or neutral distraction. We
   examined perceptual decision slowing, amygdala activation, and
   whole-brain amygdala tb-fcMRI, while ensuring group signal-to-noise
   profile matching. Following scanning, subjects rated all images for
   experienced arousal and valence. No significant group differences
   emerged for negative vs neutral reaction time, emotional ratings across
   groups, or amygdala activation. However, even in the absence of
   behavioral or activation differences, SCZ subjects demonstrated
   significantly weaker amygdala-prefrontal cortical coupling, specifically
   during negative distraction. Whereas in-the-moment perception,
   behavioral response, and amygdala recruitment to negative stimuli during
   minimal cognitive load seem to be intact, there is evidence of aberrant
   amygdala-prefrontal integration in SCZ subjects. Such abnormalities may
   prove critical for understanding disturbances in patients' ability to
   use affective cues when guiding higher level cognitive processes needed
   in social interactions.}},

   responses to the first eight (Repetitions 1-7) and the last eight

   latter from the former revealed a significant effect within left

   weaknesses. It then discusses several promising application areas and
   research questions where IS researchers can benefit from the use of
   neurophysiological data. The proposed research topics are presented
   within three thematic areas: (1) development and use of systems, (2) IS
   strategy and business outcomes, and (3) group work and decision support.
   The article concludes with recommendations on how to use
   neurophysiological tools in IS research along with a set of practical
   suggestions for developing a research agenda for NeuroIS and
   establishing NeuroIS as a viable subfield in the IS literature.}},

Abstract = {{This research essay outlines a set of guidelines for conducting
   functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies in social science
   research in general and also, accordingly, in Information Systems
   research. Given the increased interest in using neuroimaging tools
   across the social sciences, this study aims at specifying the key steps
   needed to conduct an fMRI study while ensuring that enough detail is
   provided to evaluate the methods and results. The outline of an fMRI
   study consists of four key steps: (1) formulating the research question,
   (2) designing the fMRI protocol, (3) analyzing fMRI data, and (4)
   interpreting and reporting fMRI results. These steps are described with
   an illustrative example of a published fMRI study on trust and distrust
   in this journal (Dimoka 2010). The paper contributes to the
   methodological literature by (1) providing a set of guidelines for
   designing and conducting fMRI studies, (2) specifying methodological
   details that should be included in fMRI studies in academic venues, and
   (3) illustrating these practices with an exemplar fMRI study. Future
   directions for conducting high-quality fMRI studies in the social
   sciences are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence evidence confirms that emotion can trigger executive

   encountering emotionally negative or positive stimuli. This effect is
   accompanied by an enlarged conflict negativity in event-related brain
   potentials (ERPs) and activation of the ventral anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC) in fMRI. Here, we tested whether temperament (the trait
   effortful control) and subclinical factors (anxiety, depression) can
   influence the emotional modulation of executive attention. These factors
   correlated with conflict processing in six experiments that utilized
   different conflict tasks (flanker, Simon) and different types of
   emotional stimuli (visual, auditory). Participants high in effortful
   control and low in anxiety and depression responded faster to conflict
   processing in emotional stimuli, showed an enhanced ERP conflict
   negativity, and additional activation in the ventral ACC. The data show
   that temperamental effortful control, depression, and anxiety are
   related to the influence of emotion on executive attention and its
   underlying neural correlates. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Default-mode network changes in preclinical Huntington's disease}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{237}},

Pages = {{191-198}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The default-mode network (DMN) refers to as a set of brain regions which
   are active when the brain does not engage in a cognitive task and which
   are deactivated with task-related cognitive effort. Altered function of
   the DMN has been associated with a decline of cognition in several
   neurodegenerative diseases and related at-risk conditions. In
   Huntington's disease, an autosomal dominant inherited neurodegenerative
   disorder, several studies so far have shown abnormal task-related brain
   activation patterns even in preclinical carriers of the Huntington's
   disease gene mutation (preHD). To date, however, the functional
   integrity of the DMN has not been addressed in this population. The aim
   of this study was to study the functional connectivity of the DMN in 18
   preHD and 18 healthy controls who underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging during an attention task A group independent component
   analysis identified spatiotemporally distinct patterns of two DMN
   subsystems. The spatial distribution of these components in preHD was
   similar to controls. However, preHD showed lower subsystem-specific
   connectivity in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, the left inferior
   parietal and the posterior cingulate cortex (p<0.05, cluster-corrected).
   Connectivity between the two DMN subsystems was increased in preHD
   compared to controls. In preHD individuals lower functional connectivity
   of the left inferior parietal cortex was associated with shorter
   reaction times in the attention task This suggests that some
   functionally critical regions of the DMN may have to remain active to
   maintain or optimise cognitive performance in preHD. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Previous functional neuroimaging studies have shown brain activation
   abnormalities in clinically presymptomatic carriers of the Huntington's
   disease (preHD) gene mutation when performing complex cognitive tasks.
   However, little is known about the neural correlates of attentional
   processes in preHD. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to investigate basic aspects of attentional processing in preHD
   individuals (n = 18) compared to healthy participants (n = 18) during an
   alertness task. Uni- and multivariate statistical techniques were used
   to assess task-related regional brain activation and functional network
   connectivity. Compared to healthy controls, preHD individuals near to
   the estimated onset of clinical signs showed lower activation of right
   frontostriatal regions during phasic alertness (P < 0.001, uncorrected).
   Decreased striatal activation in this preHD subgroup was also evident
   when compared with those preHD individuals far from the estimated onset
   of HD signs. Lower putaminal activity was associated with longer
   reaction times and with proximity to onset. In addition, preHD
   participants near to onset had lower functional connectivity of motor
   regions when compared with controls and preHD individuals far from
   onset. Our data suggest that while alertness-related performance remains
   normal, the underlying frontostriatal activity and motor cortex
   connectivity decline only when approaching the onset of unequivocal
   signs of HD. However, these attentional network changes might not be the
   sole explanation for the differences in cognitive task performance

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{As humans, we gather a wide range of information about other people from
   watching them move. A network of parietal, premotor, and
   occipitotemporal regions within the human brain, termed the action
   observation network (AON), has been implicated in understanding others'
   actions by means of an automatic matching process that links observed
   and performed actions. Current views of the AON assume a matching
   process biased towards familiar actions; specifically, those performed
   by conspecifics and present in the observer's motor repertoire. In this
   study, we test how this network responds to form and motion cues when
   observing natural human motion compared to rigid robotic-like motion
   across two independent functional neuroimaging experiments. In
   Experiment 1, we report the surprising finding that premotor, parietal,
   occipitotemporal regions respond more robustly to rigid, robot-like
   motion than natural human motion. In Experiment 2, we replicate and
   extend this finding by demonstrating that the same pattern of results
   emerges whether the agent is a human or a robot, which suggests the
   preferential response to robot-like motion is independent of the agent's
   form. These data challenge previous ideas about AON function by
   demonstrating that the core nodes of this network can be flexibly
   engaged by novel, unfamiliar actions performed by both human and
   non-human agents. As such, these findings suggest that the AON is
   sensitive to a broader range of action features beyond those that are
   simply familiar. Hum Brain Mapp 33:22382254, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{Humans and many other animals use acoustical signals to mediate social
   interactions with conspecifics. The evolution of sound-based
   communication is still poorly understood and its neural correlates have
   only recently begun to be investigated. In the present study, we applied
   functional MRI to humans and macaque monkeys listening to identical
   stimuli in order to compare the cortical networks involved in the
   processing of vocalizations. At the first stages of auditory processing,
   both species showed similar fMRI activity maps within and around the
   lateral sulcus (the Sylvian fissure in humans). Monkeys showed
   remarkably similar responses to monkey calls and to human vocal sounds
   (speech or otherwise), mainly in the lateral sulcus and the adjacent
   superior temporal gyrus (STG). In contrast, a preference for human
   vocalizations and especially for speech was observed in the human STG
   and superior temporal sulcus (STS). The STS and Broca's region were
   especially responsive to intelligible utterances. The evolution of the
   language faculty in humans appears to have recruited most of the STS. It
   may be that in monkeys, a much simpler repertoire of vocalizations
   requires less involvement of this temporal territory. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To what extent do past experiences shape our behaviors, perceptions, and
   thoughts even without explicit knowledge of these influences? Behavioral
   research has demonstrated that various cognitive processes can be
   influenced by conceptual representations implicitly primed during a
   preceding and unrelated task. Here we investigated whether emotion
   processing might also be influenced by prior incidental exposure to
   negative semantic material and which neural substrates would mediate
   these effects. During a first (priming) task, participants performed a
   variant of the hangman game with either negative or neutral
   emotion-laden words. Subsequently, they performed a second, unrelated
   visual task with fearful and neutral faces presented at attended or
   unattended locations. Participants were generally not aware of any
   relationships between the two tasks. We found that priming with
   emotional words enhanced amygdala sensitivity to faces in the subsequent
   visual task, while decreasing discriminative responses to threat.
   Furthermore, the magnitude of the induced bias in behavior and amygdala
   activation was predicted by the effectiveness of semantic access
   observed in the priming task. This demonstrates that emotional
   processing can be modulated by implicit influence of environmental
   information processed at an earlier time, independently of volitional
   control. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous EEG-fMRI offers the possibility of non-invasively studying
   the spatiotemporal dynamics of epileptic activity propagation from the
   focus towards an extended brain network, through the identification of
   the haemodynamic correlates of ictal electrical discharges. In epilepsy
   associated with hypothalamic hamartomas (HH), seizures are known to
   originate in the HH but different propagation pathways have been
   proposed. Here, Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) was employed to estimate
   the seizure propagation pathway from fMRI data recorded in a HH patient,
   by testing a set of clinically plausible network connectivity models of
   discharge propagation. The model consistent with early propagation from
   the HH to the temporal-occipital lobe followed by the frontal lobe was
   selected as the most likely model to explain the data. Our results
   demonstrate the applicability of DCM to investigate patient-specific
   effective connectivity in epileptic networks identified with EEG-fMRI.
   In this way, it is possible to study the propagation pathway of seizure
   activity, which has potentially great impact in the decision of the
   surgical approach for epilepsy treatment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Normal aging is associated with a gradual decline in executive functions
   such as set-shifting, inhibition, and updating, along with a progressive
   decline of neurotransmitter systems including the dopamine system.
   Modulation from the dopamine system is thought to be critical for the
   gating of information during working memory. Given the known
   relationships between executive aging, cognition, and dopamine, this
   study aims to explore the neurobiology underlying age-related changes in
   working memory updating using fMRI with healthy subjects from across the
   adult age spectrum. Our results indicate that older age is associated
   with poorer performance, reduced meso-cortico-striatal activation, and
   reduced functional coupling between the caudate and the VLPFC during the
   updating task. Additionally, caudate activation is associated with
   improved accuracy and VLPFC activation with faster reaction times in the
   full sample. Thus, older subjects' under-recruitment of and reduced
   functional coupling between these regions may specifically underlie
   age-related changes in working memory updating. These results are
   consistent with computational models of executive cognition and
   dopamine-mediated age-related cognitive decline. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) is well known for its profound effects on
   social behavior, which appear to be mediated by an OT-dependent
   modulation of amygdala activity in the context of social stimuli. In
   humans, OT decreases amygdala reactivity to threatening faces in males,
   but enhances amygdala reactivity to similar faces in females, suggesting
   sex-specific differences in OT-dependent threat-processing. To further
   explore whether OT generally enhances amygdala-dependent
   threat-processing in females, we used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) in a randomized within-subject crossover design to
   measure amygdala activity in response to threatening and non-threatening
   scenes in 14 females following intranasal administration of OT or
   placebo. Participants' eye movements were recorded to investigate
   whether an OT-dependent modulation of amygdala activity is accompanied
   by enhanced exploration of salient scene features. Although OT had no
   effect on participants' gazing behavior, it increased amygdala
   reactivity to scenes depicting social and non-social threat. In females,
   OT may, thus, enhance the detection of threatening stimuli in the
   environment, potentially by interacting with gonadal steroids, such as
   progesterone and estrogen. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Famous people and artifacts are referred to as ``unique entities{''}
   (UEs) due to the unique nature of the knowledge we have about them. Past
   imaging and lesion experiments have indicated that the anterior temporal
   lobes (ATLs) as having a special role in the processing of UEs. It has
   remained unclear which attributes of UEs were responsible for the
   observed effects in imaging experiments. In this study, we investigated
   what factors of UEs influence brain activity. In a training paradigm, we
   systematically varied the uniqueness of semantic associations, the
   presence/absence of a proper name, and the number of semantic
   associations to determine factors modulating activity in regions
   subserving the processing of UEs. We found that a conjunction of unique
   semantic information and proper names modulated activity within a
   section of the left ATL. Overall, the processing of UEs involved a wider
   left-hemispheric cortical network. Within these regions, brain activity
   was significantly affected by the unique semantic attributes especially
   in the presence of a proper name, but we could not find evidence for an
   effect of the number of semantic associations. Findings are discussed in
   regard to current models of ATL function, the neurophysiology of
   semantics, and social cognitive processing.}},

Abstract = {{Alcoholic patients who have undergone multiple detoxifications/relapses
   show altered processing of emotional signals. We performed functional
   magnetic resonance imaging during performance of implicit and explicit
   versions of a task in which subjects were presented with morphs of
   fearful facial emotional expressions. Participants were abstaining,
   multiply detoxified (MDTx; n = 12) or singly detoxified patients (SDTx;
   n = 17), and social drinker controls (n = 31). Alcoholic patients were
   less able than controls to recognize fearful expressions, and showed
   lower activation in prefrontal areas, including orbitofrontal cortex and
   insula, which mediate emotional processing. The decrease in activation
   was greater in MDTx patients who also showed decreased connectivity
   between insula and prefrontal areas, and between amygdala and globus
   pallidus. In the explicit condition, the strength of connectivity
   between insula and areas involved in regulation of emotion (inferior
   frontal cortex and frontal pole) was negatively con-elated with both the
   number of detoxifications and dependency (measured by the severity of
   alcohol dependency (SADQ) and control over drinking score (Impaired
   Control questionnaire, ICQ)). In contrast, increased connectivity was
   found between insula and the colliculus neuronal cluster, and between
   amygdala and stria terminalis bed nucleus. In the implicit condition,
   number of detoxifications and ICQ score correlated positively with
   connectivity between amygdala and prefrontal cortical areas involved in
   attentional and executive processes. Repeated episodes of detoxification
   from alcohol are associated with altered function both in fear
   perception pathways and in cortical modulation of emotions. Such changes
   may confer increased sensitivity to emotional stress and impaired social
   competence, contributing to relapse. Neuropsychopharmacology (2012) 37,

Title = {{Dissociable patterns of medial prefrontal and amygdala activity to face

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background. Individuals with bipolar disorder demonstrate abnormal
   social function. Neuroimaging studies in bipolar disorder have shown
   functional abnormalities in neural circuitry supporting face emotion
   processing, but have not examined face identity processing, a key
   component of social function. We aimed to elucidate functional
   abnormalities in neural circuitry supporting face emotion and face
   identity processing in bipolar disorder.
   Method. Twenty-seven individuals with bipolar disorder I currently
   euthymic and 27 healthy controls participated in an implicit face
   processing, block-design paradigm. Participants labeled color flashes
   that were superimposed on dynamically changing background faces
   comprising morphs either from neutral to prototypical emotion (happy,
   sad, angry and fearful) or from one identity to another identity
   depicting a neutral face. Whole-brain and amygdala region-of-interest
   (ROI) activities were compared between groups.
   Results. There was no significant between-group difference looking
   across both emerging face emotion and identity. During processing of all
   emerging emotions, euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder showed
   significantly greater amygdala activity. During facial identity and also
   happy face processing, euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder showed
   significantly greater amygdala and medial prefrontal cortical activity
   compared with controls.
   Conclusions. This is the first study to examine neural circuitry
   supporting face identity and face emotion processing in bipolar
   disorder. Our findings of abnormally elevated activity in amygdala and
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during face identity and happy face
   emotion processing suggest functional abnormalities in key regions
   previously implicated in social processing. This may be of future
   importance toward examining the abnormal self-related processing,
   grandiosity and social dysfunction seen in bipolar disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The emotion of disgust can influence people's moral judgments, even if
   this emotion objectively is unrelated to the moral judgment in question.
   The present work demonstrates that attentional control regulates this
   effect. In three studies, disgust was induced. In an unrelated part of
   the studies, participants then judged a moral transgression. Disgust
   resulted in more severe moral judgments when attentional control (either
   measured by means of individual predisposition or manipulated with
   experimental control) was weak as opposed to strong (Studies 1-3).
   Findings further showed that attentional control mediated the positive
   relation between the intensity of participants' disgust responses and
   the severity of their moral judgments (Study 2). Moreover, attentional
   control has its effects through the regulation of affective processing
   (Study 3). Taken together, the findings suggest that unrelated
   influences of disgust on moral judgments are contingent on the attention
   system.}},

Title = {{Altered integration of speech and gesture in children with autism
   spectrum disorders}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{606-619}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The presence of gesture during speech has been shown to impact
   perception, comprehension, learning, and memory in normal adults and
   typically developing children. In neurotypical individuals, the impact
   of viewing co-speech gestures representing an object and/or action
   (i.e., iconic gesture) or speech rhythm (i.e., beat gesture) has also
   been observed at the neural level. Yet, despite growing evidence of
   delayed gesture development in children with autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD), few studies have examined how the brain processes multimodal
   communicative cues occurring during everyday communication in
   individuals with ASD. Here, we used a previously validated functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm to examine the neural
   processing of co-speech beat gesture in children with ASD and matched
   controls. Consistent with prior observations in adults, typically
   developing children showed increased responses in right superior
   temporal gyrus and sulcus while listening to speech accompanied by beat
   gesture. Children with ASD, however, exhibited no significant modulatory
   effects in secondary auditory cortices for the presence of co-speech
   beat gesture. Rather, relative to their typically developing
   counterparts, children with ASD showed significantly greater activity in
   visual cortex while listening to speech accompanied by beat gesture.
   Importantly, the severity of their socio-communicative impairments
   correlated with activity in this region, such that the more impaired
   children demonstrated the greatest activity in visual areas while
   viewing co-speech beat gesture. These findings suggest that although the
   typically developing brain recognizes beat gesture as communicative and
   successfully integrates it with co-occurring speech, information from
   multiple sensory modalities is not effectively integrated during social
   communication in the autistic brain.}},

Abstract = {{Are explicit versus implicit learning mechanisms reflected in the brain

   they distinguished by brain networks that involve overlapping systems
   with differential connectivity? In this functional MRI study we examined
   the neural correlates of explicit and implicit learning of artificial
   grammar sequences. Using effective connectivity analyses we found that
   brain networks of different connectivity underlie the two types of
   learning: while both processes involve activation in a set of cortical
   and subcortical structures, explicit learners engage a network that uses
   the insula as a key mediator whereas implicit learners evoke a direct
   frontal-striatal network. Individual differences in working memory also
   differentially impact the two types of sequence learning.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Deception has always been a part of human communication as it helps to
   promote self-presentation. Although both men and women are equally prone
   to try to manage their appearance, their strategies, motivation and
   eagerness may be different. Here, we asked if lying could be influenced
   by gender on both the behavioral and neural levels. To test whether the
   hypothesized gender differences in brain activity related to deceptive
   responses were caused by differential socialization in men and women, we
   administrated the Gender Identify Inventory probing the participants'
   subjective social sex role. In an fMRI session, personal information.
   Only for personal information, we found differences in neural responses
   during instructed deception in men and women. The women vs. men direct
   contrast revealed no significant differences in areas of activation, but
   men showed higher BOLD signal compared to women in the left middle front
   gyrus (MFG). Moreover, this effect remained unchanged when self-reported
   psycholoigical gender was controlled for. Thus, ourstudy showed that
   gender differences in the neural processes engaged during falsifying
   personal information might be independent from socialization.}},

   Learning}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is defined as visual performance
   improvement after visual experiences. VPL is often highly specific for a
   visual feature presented during training. Such specificity is observed
   in behavioral tuning function changes with the highest improvement
   centered on the trained feature and was originally thought to be
   evidence for changes in the early visual system associated with VPL.
   However, results of neurophysiological studies have been highly
   controversial concerning whether the plasticity underlying VPL occurs
   within the visual cortex. The controversy may be partially due to the
   lack of observation of neural tuning function changes in multiple visual
   areas in association with VPL. Here using human subjects we
   systematically compared behavioral tuning function changes after global
   motion detection training with decoded tuning function changes for 8
   visual areas using pattern classification analysis on functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. We found that the behavioral
   tuning function changes were extremely highly correlated to decoded
   tuning function changes only in V3A, which is known to be highly
   responsive to global motion with human subjects. We conclude that VPL of
   a global motion detection task involves plasticity in a specific visual
   cortical area.}},

Title = {{Dissociated Neural Processing for Decisions in Managers and Non-Managers}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging studies of decision-making so far mainly focused
   on decisions under uncertainty or negotiation with other persons. Dual
   process theory assumes that, in such situations, decision making relies
   on either a rapid intuitive, automated or a slower rational processing
   system. However, it still remains elusive how personality factors or
   professional requirements might modulate the decision process and the
   underlying neural mechanisms. Since decision making is a key task of
   managers, we hypothesized that managers, facing higher pressure for
   frequent and rapid decisions than non-managers, prefer the heuristic,
   automated decision strategy in contrast to non-managers. Such different
   strategies may, in turn, rely on different neural systems. We tested
   managers and non-managers in a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   study using a forced-choice paradigm on word-pairs. Managers showed
   subcortical activation in the head of the caudate nucleus, and reduced
   hemodynamic response within the cortex. In contrast, non-managers
   revealed the opposite pattern. With the head of the caudate nucleus
   being an initiating component for process automation, these results
   supported the initial hypothesis, hinting at automation during decisions
   in managers. More generally, the findings reveal how different
   professional requirements might modulate cognitive decision processing.}},

Title = {{Abnormal Neural Responses to Social Exclusion in Schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Social exclusion is an influential concept in politics, mental health
   and social psychology. Studies on healthy subjects have implicated the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region involved in emotional and
   social information processing, in neural responses to social exclusion.
   Impairments in social interactions are common in schizophrenia and are
   associated with reduced quality of life. Core symptoms such as delusions
   usually have a social content. However little is known about the neural
   underpinnings of social abnormalities. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the neural substrates of social exclusion in schizophrenia.
   Patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls underwent fMRI while
   participating in a popular social exclusion paradigm. This task involves
   passing a `ball' between the participant and two cartoon representations
   of other subjects. The extent of social exclusion (ball not being passed
   to the participant) was parametrically varied throughout the task.
   Replicating previous findings, increasing social exclusion activated the
   mPFC in controls. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia failed to
   modulate mPFC responses with increasing exclusion. Furthermore, the
   blunted response to exclusion correlated with increased severity of
   positive symptoms. These data support the hypothesis that the neural
   response to social exclusion differs in schizophrenia, highlighting the
   mPFC as a potential substrate of impaired social interactions.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the dissociable neural effects of anapanasati
   (focused-attention meditation, FAM) and metta (loving-kindness
   meditation, LKM) on BOLD signals during cognitive (continuous
   performance test, CPT) and affective (emotion-processing task, EPT, in
   which participants viewed affective pictures) processing. Twenty-two
   male Chinese expert meditators (11 FAM experts, 11 LKM experts) and 22
   male Chinese novice meditators (11 FAM novices, 11 LKM novices) had
   their brain activity monitored by a 3T MRI scanner while performing the
   cognitive and affective tasks in both meditation and baseline states. We
   examined the interaction between state (meditation vs. baseline) and
   expertise (expert vs. novice) separately during LKM and FAM, using a
   conjunction approach to reveal common regions sensitive to the expert
   meditative state. Additionally, exclusive masking techniques revealed
   distinct interactions between state and group during LKM and FAM.
   Specifically, we demonstrated that the practice of FAM was associated
   with expertise-related behavioral improvements and neural activation
   differences in attention task performance. However, the effect of state
   LKM meditation did not carry over to attention task performance. On the
   other hand, both FAM and LKM practice appeared to affect the neural
   responses to affective pictures. For viewing sad faces, the regions
   activated for FAM practitioners were consistent with attention-related
   processing; whereas responses of LKM experts to sad pictures were more
   in line with differentiating emotional contagion from
   compassion/emotional regulation processes. Our findings provide the
   first report of distinct neural activity associated with forms of
   meditation during sustained attention and emotion processing.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Automatic mimicry is based on the tight linkage between motor and
   perception action representations in which internal models play a key
   role. Based on the anatomical connection, we hypothesized that the
   direct effective connectivity from the posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (pSTS) to the ventral premotor area (PMv) formed an inverse
   internal model, converting visual representation into a motor plan, and
   that reverse connectivity formed a forward internal model, converting
   the motor plan into a sensory outcome of action. To test this
   hypothesis, we employed dynamic causal-modeling analysis with functional
   magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four normal participants
   underwent a change-detection task involving two visually-presented balls
   that were either manually rotated by the investigator's right hand
   ({''}Hand{''}) or automatically rotated. The effective connectivity from
   the pSTS to the PMv was enhanced by hand observation and suppressed by
   execution, corresponding to the inverse model. Opposite effects were
   observed from the PMv to the pSTS, suggesting the forward model.
   Additionally, both execution and hand observation commonly enhanced the
   effective connectivity from the pSTS to the inferior parietal lobule
   (IPL), the IPL to the primary sensorimotor cortex (S/M1), the PMv to the
   IPL, and the PMv to the S/M1. Representation of the hand action
   therefore was implemented in the motor system was suppressed whereas
   that toward the PMv and S/M1 was enhanced. Thus, the
   action-representation network acted as a dynamic feedback-control system
   during action observation.}},

Title = {{Impaired social brain network for processing dynamic facial expressions
   in autism spectrum disorders}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Impairment of social interaction via facial expressions
   represents a core clinical feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
   However, the neural correlates of this dysfunction remain unidentified.
   Because this dysfunction is manifested in real-life situations, we
   hypothesized that the observation of dynamic, compared with static,
   facial expressions would reveal abnormal brain functioning in
   individuals with ASD. We presented dynamic and static facial expressions
   of fear and happiness to individuals with high-functioning ASD and to
   age- and sex-matched typically developing controls and recorded their
   brain activities using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Result: Regional analysis revealed reduced activation of several brain
   regions in the ASD group compared with controls in response to dynamic
   versus static facial expressions, including the middle temporal gyrus
   (MTG), fusiform gyrus, amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, and inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG). Dynamic causal modeling analyses revealed that
   bi-directional effective connectivity involving the primary visual
   cortex-MTG-IFG circuit was enhanced in response to dynamic as compared
   with static facial expressions in the control group. Group comparisons
   revealed that all these modulatory effects were weaker in the ASD group
   than in the control group.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that weak activity and connectivity
   of the social brain network underlie the impairment in social
   interaction involving dynamic facial expressions in individuals with
   ASD.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Despite the abundant data on brain networks processing static social
   signals, such as pictures of faces, the neural systems supporting social
   perception in naturalistic conditions are still poorly understood. Here
   we delineated brain networks subserving social perception under
   naturalistic conditions in 19 healthy humans who watched, during 3-T
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a set of 137 short
   (approximately 16 s each, total 27 min) audiovisual movie clips
   depicting pre-selected social signals. Two independent raters estimated
   how well each clip represented eight social features (faces, human
   bodies, biological motion, goal-oriented actions, emotion, social
   interaction, pain, and speech) and six filler features (places, objects,
   rigid motion, people not in social interaction, non-goal-oriented
   action, and non-human sounds) lacking social content. These ratings were
   used as predictors in the fMRI analysis. The posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (STS) responded to all social features but not to any non-social
   features, and the anterior STS responded to all social features except
   bodies and biological motion. We also found four partially segregated,
   extended networks for processing of specific social signals: (1) a
   fronto-temporal network responding to multiple social categories, (2) a
   fronto-parietal network preferentially activated to bodies, motion, and
   pain, (3) a temporo-amygdalar network responding to faces, social
   interaction, and speech, and (4) a fronto-insular network responding to
   pain, emotions, social interactions, and speech. Our results highlight
   the role of the pSTS in processing multiple aspects of social
   information, as well as the feasibility and efficiency of fMRI mapping
   under conditions that resemble the complexity of real life.}},

Title = {{Self-evaluation in schizophrenia: an fMRI study with implications for
   the understanding of insight}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Lack of insight is a core feature of schizophrenia and is
   associated with structural brain abnormalities. The functional
   neuroanatomy of insight has only recently been investigated. When people
   evaluate their personality traits compared to those of another,
   activation is seen in central midline structures(CMS) of the brain. This
   study set out to compare cerebral activation in schizophrenia patients
   versus controls during a self-evaluation task which included positive
   and negative traits as well as mental and physical illness terms.
   Methods: Eleven schizophrenia patients and 8 healthy controls, matched
   for age were studied. Insight was assessed using the Schedule for the
   Assessment of Insight-expanded version(SAI-E). FMRI data were obtained
   with a 1.5 Tesla GE system and interactions between participant group,
   self versus other, significant at the cluster level, were recorded.
   Results: Significant hypoactivation in the medial superior frontal
   gyrus(dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) was observed in patients vs.
   controls during self-evaluation of all traits combined. A second cluster
   of hypoactivation in the posterior cingulate was also detected. When the
   response to individual traits was explored, underactivation in other
   frontal regions plus right inferior parietal lobule emerged and this
   tended to correlate, albeit weakly with lower insight scores. Further,
   there were areas of hyperactivation relative to controls in anterior
   cingulate, frontal and parietal regions(especially precuneus) which
   showed moderate inverse correlations with insight scores.
   Conclusions: We have demonstrated that the CMS, identified as a key
   system underpinning self-evaluation, is dysfunctional in patients with
   schizophrenia, particularly dorso-medial PFC. This may have implications
   for lack of insight in schizophrenia. Hypofunction within the
   dorsomedial prefrontal region seems to be particularly important
   although other posterior and lateral cortical regions play a part and
   may modulate self-evaluative responses depending on the type of trait
   under consideration.}},

Title = {{Reduced Connectivity in the Self-Processing Network of Schizophrenia
   Patients with Poor Insight}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Lack of insight (unawareness of illness) is a common and clinically
   relevant feature of schizophrenia. Reduced levels of self-referential
   processing have been proposed as a mechanism underlying poor insight.
   The default mode network (DMN) has been implicated as a key node in the
   circuit for self-referential processing. We hypothesized that during
   resting state the DMN network would show decreased connectivity in
   schizophrenia patients with poor insight compared to patients with good
   insight. Patients with schizophrenia were recruited from mental health
   care centers in the north of the Netherlands and categorized in groups
   having good insight (n = 25) or poor insight (n = 19). All subjects
   underwent a resting state fMRI scan. A healthy control group (n = 30)
   was used as a reference. Functional connectivity of the anterior and
   posterior part of the DMN, identified using Independent Component
   Analysis, was compared between groups. Patients with poor insight showed
   lower connectivity of the ACC within the anterior DMN component and
   precuneus within the posterior DMN component compared to patients with
   good insight. Connectivity between the anterior and posterior part of
   the DMN was lower in patients than controls, and qualitatively different
   between the good and poor insight patient groups. As predicted, subjects
   with poor insight in psychosis showed decreased connectivity in DMN
   regions implicated in self-referential processing, although this
   concerned only part of the network. This finding is compatible with
   theories implying a role of reduced self-referential processing as a
   mechanism contributing to poor insight.}},

   reward system activity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{The human reward system is sensitive to both social (e.g., validation)
   and non-social rewards (e.g., money) and is likely integral for
   relationship development and reputation building. However, data is
   sparse on the question of whether implicit social reward processing
   meaningfully contributes to explicit social representations such as
   trust and attachment security in pre-existing relationships. This
   event-related fMRI experiment examined reward system prediction-error
   activity in response to a potent social reward-social validation-and
   this activity's relation to both attachment security and trust in the
   context of real romantic relationships. During the experiment,
   participants' expectations for their romantic partners' positive regard
   of them were confirmed (validated) or violated, in either positive or
   negative directions. Primary analyses were conducted using predefined
   regions of interest, the locations of which were taken from previously
   published research. Results indicate that activity for mid-brain and
   striatal reward system regions of interest was modulated by social
   reward expectation violation in ways consistent with prior research on
   reward prediction-error. Additionally, activity in the striatum during
   viewing of disconfirmatory information was associated with both
   increases in post-scan reports of attachment anxiety and decreases in
   post-scan trust, a finding that follows directly from representational
   models of attachment and trust.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: One of the core symptoms of borderline personality disorder
   (BPD) is the instability in interpersonal relationships. This might be
   related to existent differences in mindreading between BPD patients and
   healthy individuals.
   Methods: We examined the behavioural and neurophysiological (fMRI)
   responses of BPD patients and healthy controls (HC) during performance
   of the `Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test (RMET).
   Results: Mental state discrimination was significantly better and faster
   for affective eye gazes in BPD patients than in HC. At the
   neurophysiological level, this was manifested in a stronger activation
   of the amygdala and greater activity of the medial frontal gyrus, the
   left temporal pole and the middle temporal gyrus during affective eye
   gazes. In contrast, HC subjects showed a greater activation in the
   insula and the superior temporal gyri.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that BPD patients are highly
   vigilant to social stimuli, maybe because they resonate intuitively with
   mental states of others.}},

Title = {{Neural computations underlying social risk sensitivity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 2}},
Abstract = {{Under standard models of expected utility, preferences over stochastic
   events are assumed to be independent of the source of uncertainty. Thus,
   in decision-making, an agent should exhibit consistent preferences,
   regardless of whether the uncertainty derives from the unpredictability
   of a random process or the unpredictability of a social partner.
   However, when a social partner is the source of uncertainty, social
   preferences can influence decisions over and above pure risk attitudes
   (RA). Here, we compared risk related hemodynamic activity and individual
   preferences for two sets of options that differ only in the social or
   non-social nature of the risk. Risk preferences in social and non-social
   contexts were systematically related to neural activity during decision
   and outcome phases of each choice. Individuals who were more risk averse
   in the social context exhibited decreased risk related activity in the
   amygdala during non-social decisions, while individuals who were more
   risk averse in the non-social context exhibited the opposite pattern.
   Differential risk preferences were similarly associated with hemodynamic
   activity in ventral striatum at the outcome of these decisions. These
   findings suggest that social preferences, including aversion to betrayal
   or exploitation by social partners, may be associated with variability
   in the response of these subcortical regions to social risk.}},

Title = {{Task-dependent neural bases of perceiving emotionally expressive targets}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 2}},
Abstract = {{Social cognition is fundamentally interpersonal: individuals' behaviour
   and dispositions critically affect their interaction partners'
   information processing. However, cognitive neuroscience studies,
   partially because of methodological constraints, have remained largely
   ``perceiver-centric{''}: focusing on the abilities, motivations, and
   goals of social perceivers while largely ignoring interpersonal effects.
   Here, we address this knowledge gap by examining the neural bases of
   perceiving emotionally expressive and inexpressive social ``targets.{''}
   Sixteen perceivers were scanned using fMRI while they watched targets
   discussing emotional autobiographical events. Perceivers continuously
   rated each target's emotional state or eye-gaze direction. The effects
   of targets' emotional expressivity on perceiver's brain activity
   depended on task set: when perceivers explicity attended to targets'
   emotions, expressivity predicted activity in neural structures-including
   medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex-associated with drawing
   inferences about mental states. When perceivers instead attended to

Abstract = {{The ability attesting the validity of a conditional statement is
   important in our everyday life. However, the brain mechanisms underlying
   this process, especially falsification process which is important in
   daily life, but especially crucial to scientific reasoning and research
   is not as yet completely clear. Therefore, in the present study, we used
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine
   the neural bases of the falsification process in testing the validity of
   a conditional statement as used in Wason's (1966) selection task. Our
   fMRI results showed that: (1) compared with the baseline condition, both
   Falsification (by using Modus Ponens, and Modus Tollens) and
   Non-Falsification conditions (affirming the consequent, and denying the
   antecedent) activated the left frontal areas (BA44/45, or BA6), and
   basal ganglia, the areas previously found in the rule-guided conditional
   reasoning operations; the parietal area (BA40, BA7) for recruiting
   cognitive resources to represent and maintain the different evidential
   information in working memory. (2) The left middle frontal gyrus (BA9)
   and cerebellum were shown to be activated in the contrast of
   Falsification condition versus Non-Falsification condition and in the
   contrast of MT versus Non-Falsification condition. These results
   indicated that the left middle frontal gyrus (BA9) might be the key
   brain region involved in the falsification process of conditional
   statement for which abstracting and integrating logical relationships,
   and inhibiting the distraction of the irrelevant information were the
   essential processes. Moreover, the cerebellum was found to be
   responsible for constructing an internal working model. In addition, our
   brain imaging results might support the dual-process theory of
   reasoning. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In our everyday lives, we perceive emotional information via multiple
   sensory channels. This is particularly evident for emotional faces and
   voices in a social context. Over the past years, a multitude of studies
   have addressed the question of how affective cues conveyed by auditory
   and visual channels are integrated. Behavioral studies show that hearing
   and seeing emotional expressions can support and influence each other, a
   notion which is supported by investigations on the underlying
   neurobiology. Numerous electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies
   have identified brain regions subserving the integration of multimodal
   emotions and have provided new insights into the neural processing steps
   underlying the synergistic confluence of affective information from
   voice and face. In this paper we provide a comprehensive review covering
   current behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging
   findings on the combination of emotions from the auditory and visual
   domains. Behavioral advantages arising from multimodal redundancy are
   paralleled by specific integration patterns on the neural level, from
   encoding in early sensory cortices to late cognitive evaluation in
   higher association areas. In summary, these findings indicate that
   bimodal emotions interact at multiple stages of the audiovisual
   integration process.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental necessity in human cognition is to link sequential mental
   operations where appropriate execution of the second task requires input
   from the first. The present study explores the neural basis of such
   chaining using a novel psychological refractory period (PRP) task.
   Participants were required to make speeded responses to two sequential
   visual tasks that were chained or independent. Magnetoencephalography
   (MEG) signals were recorded simultaneously to reveal the brain's
   response to these similar but fundamentally different conditions. RTs to
   Task 1 and 2 were slower in the Chained condition, and their temporal
   coupling weakened, relative to the Independent condition. MEG analysis
   of the accompanying event-related fields (ERFs) revealed an increased
   sustained posterior component in the Chained condition beginning
   approximately 350?ms after Task 2 onset and lasting for 450?ms.
   Beamformer localization of this ERF effect revealed a left hemisphere
   source near the junction of the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes.
   These results extend our understanding of the behavioral and
   corresponding neural mechanisms required by everyday decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that healthy participants learn to control
   local brain activity with operant training by using real-time functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI). Very little data exist, however,
   on the dynamics of interaction between critical brain regions during
   rt-fMRI-based training. Here, we examined self-regulation of
   stimulus-elicited insula activation and performed a psychophysiological
   interaction (PPI) analysis of real-time self-regulation data. During
   voluntary up-regulation of the left anterior insula in the presence of
   threat-related pictures, differential activations were observed in the
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the frontal operculum, the middle
   cingulate cortex and the right insula. Down-regulation in comparison to
   no-regulation revealed additional activations in right superior temporal
   cortex, right inferior parietal cortex and right middle frontal cortex.
   There was a significant learning effect over sessions during
   up-regulation, documented by a significant improvement of anterior
   insula control over time. Connectivity analysis revealed that successful
   up-regulation of the activity in left anterior insula while viewing
   aversive pictures was directly modulated by dorsomedial and
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Down-regulation of activity was more
   difficult to achieve and no learning effect was observed. More extensive
   training might be necessary for successful down-regulation. These
   findings illustrate the functional interactions between different brain
   areas during regulation of anterior insula activity in the presence of
   threat-related stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined neural activation during the experience of
   compassion, an emotion that orients people toward vulnerable others and
   prompts caregiving, and pride, a self-focused emotion that signals
   individual strength and heightened status. Functional magnetic resonance
   images (fMRI) were acquired as participants viewed 55 s continuous
   sequences of slides to induce either compassion or pride, presented in
   alternation with sequences of neutral slides. Emotion self-report data
   were collected after each slide condition within the fMRI scanner.
   Compassion induction was associated with activation in the midbrain
   periaqueductal gray (PAG), a region that is activated during pain and
   the perception of others' pain, and that has been implicated in parental
   nurturance behaviors. Pride induction engaged the posterior medial
   cortex, a region that has been associated with self-referent processing.
   Self-reports of compassion experience were correlated with increased
   activation in a region near the PAG, and in the right inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG). Self-reports of pride experience, in contrast, were
   correlated with reduced activation in the IFG and the anterior insula.
   These results provide preliminary evidence towards understanding the
   neural correlates of important interpersonal dimensions of compassion
   and pride. Caring (compassion) and self-focus (pride) may represent core
   appraisals that differentiate the response profiles of many emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is well established that prior experience with faces
   determines their subsequent social-emotional evaluation, recent work
   shows that top-down inhibitory mechanisms, including response
   inhibition, can lead to social devaluation after even a single, brief
   exposure. These rapidly induced effects indicate interplay among
   perceptual, attentional, response-selection and social-emotional
   networks; yet, the brain mechanisms underlying this are not well
   understood. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   to investigate the neural mechanism mediating the relationship between
   inhibitory control and emotional devaluation. Participants performed two
   tasks: (i) a Go/No-Go task in response to faces and (ii) a
   trustworthiness rating task involving the previously seen faces. No-Go
   faces were rated as significantly less trustworthy than Go faces. By
   examining brain activations during Task 1, behavioral measures and brain
   activations obtained in Task 2 could be predicted. Specifically,
   activity in brain areas during Task 1 associated with (i) executive
   control and response suppression (i.e. lateral prefrontal cortex) and
   (ii) affective responses and value representation (i.e. orbitofrontal
   cortex), systematically covaried with behavioral ratings and amygdala
   activity obtained during Task 2. The present findings offer insights
   into the neural mechanisms linking inhibitory processes to affective
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Alexithymia is a trait characterized by a diminished capacity to
   describe and distinguish emotions and to fantasize; it is associated
   with reduced introspection and problems in emotion processing. The
   default mode network (DMN) is a network of brain areas that is normally
   active during rest and involved in emotion processing and
   self-referential mental activity, including introspection. We
   hypothesized that connectivity of the DMN might be altered in
   alexithymia. Twenty alexithymic and 18 non-alexithymic healthy
   volunteers underwent a resting state fMRI scan. Independent component
   analysis was used to identify the DMN. Differences in connectivity
   strength were compared between groups. Within the DMN, alexithymic
   participants showed lower connectivity within areas of the DMN (medial
   frontal and temporal areas) as compared to non-alexithymic participants.
   In contrast, connectivity in the high-alexithymic participants was
   higher for the sensorimotor cortex, occipital areas and right lateral
   frontal cortex than in the low-alexithymic participants. These results
   suggest a diminished connectivity within the DMN of alexithymic
   participants, in brain areas that may also be involved in emotional
   awareness and self-referential processing. On the other hand,
   alexithymia was associated with stronger functional connections of the
   DMN with brain areas involved in sensory input and control of emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a chromosomal condition (47, XXY) that may
   help us to unravel gene-brain behavior pathways to psychopathology. The
   phenotype includes social cognitive impairments and increased risk for
   autism traits. We used functional MRI to study neural mechanisms
   underlying social information processing. Eighteen nonclinical controls
   and thirteen men with XXY were scanned during judgments of faces with
   regard to trustworthiness and age. While judging faces as untrustworthy
   in comparison to trustworthy, men with XXY displayed less activation
   than controls in (i) the amygdala, which plays a key role in screening
   information for socio-emotional significance, (ii) the insula, which
   plays a role in subjective emotional experience, as well as (iii) the
   fusiform gyrus and (iv) the superior temporal sulcus, which are both
   involved in the perceptual processing of faces and which were also less
   involved during age judgments in men with XXY. This is the first study
   showing that KS can be associated with reduced involvement of the neural
   network subserving social cognition. Studying KS may increase our
   understanding of the genetic and hormonal basis of neural dysfunctions
   contributing to abnormalities in social cognition and behavior, which
   are considered core abnormalities in psychiatric disorders such as
   autism and schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Comparing pain is done in daily life and involves short-term memorizing
   and attention focusing. This event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging study investigated the short-term brain activations associated
   with the comparison of pain stimuli using a delayed discrimination
   paradigm. Fourteen healthy young volunteers compared two successive pain
   stimuli administered at a 10 s interval to the same location at the
   nasal mucosa. Fourteen age- and sex-matched subjects received similar
   pain stimuli without performing the comparison task. With the comparison
   task, the activations associated with the second pain stimulus were
   significantly greater than with the first stimulus in the anterior
   insular cortex and the primary somatosensory area. This was observed on
   the background of a generally increased stimulus-associated brain
   activation in the presence of the comparison task that included regions
   of the pain matrix (insular cortex, primary and secondary somatosensory
   area, midcingulate cortex, supplemental motor area) and regions
   associated with attention, decision making, working memory and body
   recognition (frontal and temporal gyri, inferior parietal lobule,
   precuneus, lingual cortices). This data provides a cerebral correlate
   for the role of pain as a biological alerting system that gains the
   subject's attention and then dominates most other perceptions and
   activities involving pain-specific and non-pain-specific brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{The current study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   examine whether regulating negative bias to stigmatized individuals has
   a unique neural activity profile from general emotion regulation.
   Participants were presented with images of stigmatized (e.g. homeless
   people) or non-stigmatized (e.g. a man holding a gun) social targets
   while undergoing fMRI and were asked either to maintain or regulate
   their emotional response. Their implicit bias toward these stigmatized
   group members was also measured. Analyses were conducted in both, an
   event-related fashion, considering the event to be the onset of
   regulation, and in a blocked-design fashion, considering the sustained
   activity throughout the 8-s regulatory period. In the event-related
   (onset) analyses, participants showed more activity throughout the
   prefrontal cortex when initiating a regulatory response to stigmatized
   as compared with non-stigmatized images. This neural activity was
   positively correlated with their implicit bias. Interestingly, in the
   block (sustained) analyses, general emotion regulation elicited a more
   widespread pattern of neural activity as compared with stigma
   regulation. This activity was largely posterior, suggesting that general
   emotion regulation may engage more visuo-spatial processing as compared
   with stigma regulation. These findings suggest that regulating negative
   affect toward stigmatized targets may occur relatively more quickly than
   regulating negative affect toward non-stigmatized targets.}},

Abstract = {{Affective empathy (AE) is distinguished clinically and neurally from
   cognitive empathy (CE). While AE is selectively disrupted in
   psychopathy, autism is associated with deficits in CE. Despite such
   dissociations, AE and CE together contribute to normal human empathic
   experience. A dimensional measure of individual differences in AE
   `relative to' CE captures this interaction and may reveal brain-behavior
   relationships beyond those detectable with AE and CE separately. Using
   resting-state fMRI and measures of empathy in healthy adults, we show
   that relative empathic ability (REA) is reflected in the brain's
   intrinsic functional dynamics. Dominance of AE was associated with
   stronger functional connectivity among social-emotional regions (ventral
   anterior insula, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, perigenual anterior
   cingulate). Dominance of CE was related to stronger connectivity among
   areas implicated in interoception, autonomic monitoring and
   social-cognitive processing (brainstem, superior temporal sulcus,
   ventral anterior insula). These patterns were distinct from those
   observed with AE and CE separately. Finally, REA and the strength of
   several functional connections were associated with symptoms of
   psychopathology. These findings suggest that REA provides a dimensional
   index of empathic function and pathological tendencies in healthy
   adults, which are reflected in the intrinsic functional dynamics of
   neural systems associated with social and emotional cognition.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with differences in
   sensory sensitivity and affective response to sensory stimuli, the
   neural basis of which is still largely unknown. We used psychophysics
   and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate
   responses to somatosensory stimulation with three textured surfaces that
   spanned a range of roughness and pleasantness in a sample of adults with
   ASD and a control group. While psychophysical ratings of roughness and
   pleasantness were largely similar across the two groups, the ASD group
   gave pleasant and unpleasant textures more extreme average ratings than
   did controls. In addition, their ratings for a neutral texture were more
   variable than controls, indicating they are less consistent in
   evaluating a stimulus that is affectively ambiguous. Changes in brain
   blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in response to
   stimulation with these textures differed substantially between the
   groups, with the ASD group exhibiting diminished responses compared to
   the control group, particularly for pleasant and neutral textures. For
   the most unpleasant texture, the ASD group exhibited greater BOLD
   response than controls in affective somatosensory processing areas such
   as the posterior cingulate cortex and the insula. The amplitude of
   response in the insula in response to the unpleasant texture was
   positively correlated with social impairment as measured by the Autism

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of the current study was to differentiate between
   neural activity that represents neural anomalies that are responsible
   for persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) from the activity that is
   a result of compensating for stuttering. This was done by investigating
   alterations to the intrinsic functional architecture of speech-language
   processes of patients with PDS before and after a short-term
   intervention.
   Methods: The resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and cortical
   thickness were examined before and after the intervention. The
   structural data were used to validate the functional results. Fifteen
   stuttering patients who received intervention (PDS+), 13 stuttering
   patients who did not receive intervention (PDS-), and 13 fluent controls
   participated.
   Results: Before the intervention, both groups of PDS patients showed
   significant RSFC and cortical thickness reductions in the left
   pars-opercularis (PO) and RSFC increases in the cerebellum, as compared
   to fluent controls. The intervention was effective in reducing
   stuttering in PDS+ patients and lowering their RSFC in the cerebellum to
   the level of fluent controls. The intervention effect was specific to
   the PDS+ group (it was not evident in the PDS- group). The intervention
   did not change RSFC and cortical thickness in the left PO, which
   remained at its preintervention level.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the left PO is a locus where the
   intrinsic functional architecture of speech-language processes is
   altered in PDS patients, suggesting an etiologic role of this region in
   PDS. The cerebellum showed intervention-induced neural reorganization,
   suggesting a compensatory response when stuttering occurs. Neurology (R)

Abstract = {{Several neuroimaging studies underlined the importance of the amygdala
   and prefrontal brain structures (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   {[}DLPFC]) for the processing of emotional stimuli and for emotion
   regulation. Many studies used visual scenes or faces as emotion-inducing
   material, and there is evidence that negative or positive words activate
   emotion-processing brain regions in the same way. However, no study so
   far focused on the influence of subclinical measures of anxiety or
   depression on the neural processing of emotional words. In this
   fMRI-study, we therefore investigated brain activation to emotional
   words in relation to subclinical measures of trait anxiety and
   depression in a sample of 21 healthy subjects. We also assessed effects
   of subclinical anxiety and depression on amygdala-prefrontal coupling
   during negative (versus neutral) word reading. Both negative and
   positive words activated the amygdala, and negative-word processing
   revealed a positive correlation between amygdala activity and scores of
   trait anxiety and subclinical depression. During negative versus neutral
   word reading, subjects with high trait anxiety also showed a stronger
   functional coupling between left amygdala and left DLPFC. These results
   suggest a modulation of negative-word processing by subclinical
   depression and anxiety, as well as possible prefrontal compensatory
   processes during unintentional emotion regulation in subjects with
   higher trait anxiety. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol-dependence is associated with cognitive and biological
   alterations, and also with interpersonal impairments. Although
   overwhelming in clinical settings and involved in relapse, these social
   impairments have received little attention from researchers.
   Particularly, brain alterations related to social exclusion have not
   been explored in alcohol-dependence. Our primary purpose was to
   determine the neural correlates of social exclusion feelings in this
   population. In all, 44 participants (22 abstinent alcohol-dependent
   patients and 22 paired controls) played a virtual game ('cyberball')
   during fMRI recording. They were first included by other players, then
   excluded, and finally re-included. Brain areas involved in social
   exclusion were identified and the functional connectivity between these
   areas was explored using psycho-physiological interactions (PPI).
   Results showed that while both groups presented dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) activations during social exclusion,
   alcohol-dependent participants exhibited increased insula and reduced
   frontal activations (in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) as compared
   with controls. Alcohol-dependence was also associated with persistent
   dACC and parahippocampal gyrus activations in re-inclusion. PPI analyses
   showed reduced frontocingulate connectivity during social exclusion in
   alcohol-dependence. Alcohol-dependence is thus linked with increased
   activation in areas eliciting social exclusion feelings (dACC-insula),
   and with impaired ability to inhibit these feelings (indexed by reduced
   frontal activations). Altered frontal regulation thus appears implied in
   the interpersonal alterations observed in alcohol-dependence, which seem
   reinforced by impaired frontocingulate connectivity. This first
   exploration of the neural correlates of interpersonal problems in
   alcohol-dependence could initiate the development of a social
   neuroscience of addictive states. Neuropsychopharmacology (2012) 37,

Abstract = {{Humans often watch interactions between other people without taking part
   in the interaction themselves. Strikingly little is, however, known
   about how gestures and expressions of two interacting humans are
   processed in the observer's brain, since the study of social cues has
   mostly focused on the perception of solitary humans. To investigate the
   neural underpinnings of the third-person view of social interaction, we
   studied brain activations of subjects who observed two humans either
   facing toward or away from each other. Activations within the amygdala,
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex (dmPFC) were sensitive to the interactional position of the
   observed people and distinguished humans facing toward from humans
   facing away. The amygdala was most sensitive to face-to-face interaction
   and did not differentiate the humans facing away from the pixelated
   control figures, whereas the pSTS dissociated both human stimuli from
   the pixel figures. The results of the amygdala reactivity suggest that,
   in addition to regulating interpersonal distance towards oneself, the
   amygdala is involved in the assessment of the proximity between two
   other persons. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Racial identification shapes self-concept and how people share in and

   neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the role of the neural default
   network in self-referential and empathic processing. However, how racial

   unknown. Here, we examined the effect of racial identification on neural
   response related to social perception among African American and
   Caucasian American individuals using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Our results demonstrate that degree of racial identification
   predicts activity within cortical midline structures of the default
   network in response to viewing racial ingroup, relative to outgroup
   members, and activity within the medial temporal lobe subsystem of the
   default network in response to viewing racial outgroup, relative to
   ingroup members. Broadly, our findings suggest that the strength of
   racial identification is associated with differential recruitment of

Abstract = {{The neural bases of interactions between anxiety and cognitive control
   are not fully understood. We conducted an fMRI study in healthy
   participants and in patients with an anxiety disorder (social phobia) to
   determine the impact of stress on the brain network involved in
   cognitive control. Participants performed two working memory tasks that
   differed in their level of performance-induced stress. In both groups,
   the cognitive tasks activated a frontoparietal network, involved in
   working memory tasks. A supplementary activation was observed in the
   right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in patients during the
   more stressful cognitive task. Region of interest analyses showed that
   activation in the right VLPFC decreased in the more stressful condition
   as compared to the less stressful one in healthy subjects and remain at
   a similar level in the two cognitive tasks in patients. This pattern was
   specific to the right when compared to the left VLPFC activation.
   Anxiety was positively correlated with right VLPFC activation across
   groups. Finally, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activation
   was higher in healthy subjects than in patients in the more stressful
   task. These findings demonstrate that in healthy subjects, stress
   induces an increased activation in left DLPFC, a critical region for
   cognitive control, and a decreased activation in the right VLPFC, an
   area associated with anxiety. In patients, the differential modulation
   between these dorsal and ventral PFC regions disappears. This absence of
   modulation may limit anxious patients' ability to adapt to demanding
   cognitive control tasks. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{Moral sentiment has been hypothesized to reflect evolved adaptations to
   social living. If so, individual differences in moral values may relate
   to regional variation in brain structure. We tested this hypothesis in a
   sample of 70 young, healthy adults examining whether differences on two
   major dimensions of moral values were significantly associated with
   regional gray matter volume. The two clusters of moral values assessed
   were ``individualizing{''} (values of harm/care and fairness) and
   ``binding{''} (deference to authority, in-group loyalty, and
   purity/sanctity). Individualizing was positively associated with left
   dorsomedial pFC volume and negatively associated with bilateral
   precuneus volume. For binding, a significant positive association was
   found for bilateral subcallosal gyrus and a trend to significance for
   the left anterior insula volume. These findings demonstrate that
   variation in moral sentiment reflects individual differences in brain
   structure and suggest a biological basis for moral sentiment,
   distributed across multiple brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{The distinction between processes used to perceive and understand the
   self and others has received considerable attention in psychology and
   neuroscience. Brain findings highlight a role for various regions, in
   particular the medial PFC (mPFC), in supporting judgments about both the
   self and others. We performed a meta-analysis of 107 neuroimaging
   studies of self-and other-related judgments using multilevel kernel
   density analysis {[}Kober, H., \& Wager, T. D. Meta-analyses of
   neuroimaging data. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews, 1, 293-300, 2010].
   We sought to determine what brain regions are reliably involved in each
   judgment type and, in particular, what the spatial and functional
   organization of mPFC is with respect to them. Relative to nonmentalizing
   judgments, both self-and other judgments were associated with activity
   in mPFC, ranging from ventral to dorsal extents, as well as common
   activation of the left TPJ and posterior cingulate. A direct comparison
   between self-and other judgments revealed that ventral mPFC as well as
   left ventrolateral PFC and left insula were more frequently activated by
   self-related judgments, whereas dorsal mPFC, in addition to bilateral
   TPJ and cuneus, was more frequently activated by other-related
   judgments. Logistic regression analyses revealed that ventral and dorsal
   mPFC lay at opposite ends of a functional gradient: The z coordinates
   reported in individual studies predicted whether the study involved
   self-or other-related judgments, which were associated with increasingly
   ventral or dorsal portions of mPFC, respectively. These results argue
   for a distributed rather than localizationist account of mPFC
   organization and support an emerging view on the functional
   heterogeneity of mPFC.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Default network (DN) abnormalities have been identified in
   patients with chronic schizophrenia using ``resting state{''} functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI). Here, we examined the integrity of
   the DN in patients experiencing their first episode of psychosis (FEP)
   compared with sex-and age-matched healthy controls.
   Methods: We collected R-fMRI data from 19 FEP patients (mean age 24.9
   +/- 4.8 yrs, 14 males) and 19 healthy controls (26.1 +/- 4.8 yrs, 14
   males) at 3 T. Following standard preprocessing, we examined the
   functional connectivity (FC) of two DN subsystems and the two DN hubs
   (P<0.0045, corrected).
   Results: Patients with FEP exhibited abnormal FC that appeared largely
   restricted to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) DN subsystem.
   Relative to controls, FEP patients exhibited weaker positive FC between
   dMPFC and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus, extending
   laterally through the parietal lobe to the posterior angular gyrus.
   Patients with FEP exhibited weaker negative FC between the lateral
   temporal cortex and the intracalcarine cortex, bilaterally. The PCC and
   temporo-parietal junction also exhibited weaker negative FC with the
   right fusiform gyrus extending to the lingual gyrus and lateral
   occipital cortex, in FEP patients, compared to controls. By contrast,
   patients with FEP showed stronger negative FC between the temporal pole
   and medial motor cortex, anterior precuneus and posterior mid-cingulate
   cortex.
   Conclusions: Abnormalities in the dMPFC DN subsystem in patients with a
   FEP suggest that FC patterns are altered even in the early stages of
   psychosis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic cannabis use is associated with cognitive impairment and has
   been identified as a risk factor for schizophrenia. Patients with
   schizophrenia show profound deficits in social cognition such as the
   ability to attribute mental states to others, referred to as ``theory of
   mind{''} (ToM). Aberrant activation of the ToM network has been
   demonstrated across different phases of schizophrenia, including at-risk
   stages. Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the ToM network in chronic
   cannabis users. Fifteen cannabis users received functional brain imaging
   during performance of a ToM cartoon story task. Findings were compared
   with 14 control subjects. Cannabis users showed less activation in the
   left parahippocampal gyrus, the right precuneus and cuneus, but greater
   activation in the left cuneus and the right anterior cingulate gyrus
   compared to healthy controls. These activation patterns resemble those
   found in at-risk populations, suggesting that cannabis use can affect
   the processing of social information similar to other risk factor
   constellations for psychosis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cognitive remediation training has been shown to improve both cognitive
   and social cognitive deficits in people with schizophrenia, but the
   mechanisms that support this behavioral improvement are largely unknown.
   One hypothesis is that intensive behavioral training in cognition and/or
   social cognition restores the underlying neural mechanisms that support
   targeted skills. However, there is little research on the neural effects
   of cognitive remediation training. This study investigated whether a 50
   h (10-week) remediation intervention which included both cognitive and
   social cognitive training would influence neural function in regions
   that support social cognition. Twenty-two stable, outpatient
   schizophrenia participantswere randomized to a treatment condition
   consisting of auditory-based cognitive training (AT) {[}Brain Fitness
   Program/auditory module similar to 60 min/day] plus social cognition
   training (SCT) which was focused on emotion recognition {[}similar to
   5-15 min per day] or a placebo condition of non-specific computer games
   (CG) for an equal amount of time. Pre and post intervention assessments
   included an fMRI task of positive and negative facial emotion
   recognition, and standard behavioral assessments of cognition, emotion
   processing, and functional outcome. There were no significant
   intervention-related improvements in general cognition or functional
   outcome. fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time interaction.
   Specifically, in comparison to CG, AT + SCT participants had a greater
   pre-to-post intervention increase in postcentral gyrus activity during
   emotion recognition of both positive and negative emotions. Furthermore,
   among all participants, the increase in postcentral gyrus activity
   predicted behavioral improvement on a standardized test of emotion
   processing (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Results indicate that combined
   cognition and social cognition training impacts neural mechanisms that
   support social cognition skills. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to examine whether the personality
   trait of stress reaction (SR), as assessed with the Multidimensional
   Personality Questionnaire-Brief Form (MPQ-BF), (1) influences prefrontal
   and limbic area activity during overt sentence reading and if (2) SR and
   associated individual differences in prefrontal and limbic activations
   correlate with sensorimotor cortical activity during overt sentence
   reading. Ten vocally healthy adults (22-57 years) participated in a
   functional MRI study using an event-related sparse sampling design to
   acquire brain activation data during sentence production tasks (covert,
   whispered, overt). The outcome measure was the blood oxygenation
   level-dependent signal change in prefrontal, limbic, and primary
   somatosensory (S1) and motor cortices (M1). Significant positive
   correlations were found between SR scores and S1, dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (both r = .73, p < .05), and periaqueductal gray (r =
   .88, p < .01) activity. M1 activity was positively correlated with SR (r
   = .64, p < .05) and negatively with social potency (r = -.70, p < .05).
   Our findings suggest that motor cortical control subserving voice and
   speech production varies with expression of selected personality traits.
   Future studies should investigate the functional significance of
   personality differences in the central neural control of vocalization.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) was introduced to study the effective
   connectivity among brain regions using neuroimaging data. Until
   recently, DCM relied on deterministic models of distributed neuronal
   responses to external perturbation (e.g., sensory stimulation or task
   demands). However, accounting for stochastic fluctuations in neuronal
   activity and their interaction with task-specific processes may be of
   particular importance for studying state-dependent interactions.
   Furthermore, allowing for random neuronal fluctuations may render DCM
   more robust to model misspecification and finesse problems with network
   identification. In this article, we examine stochastic dynamic causal
   models (sDCM) in relation to their deterministic counterparts (dDCM) and
   highlight questions that can only be addressed with sDCM. We also
   compare the network identification performance of deterministic and
   stochastic DCM, using Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical case
   study of absence epilepsy. For example, our results demonstrate that
   stochastic DCM can exploit the modelling of neural noise to discriminate
   between direct and mediated connections. We conclude with a discussion
   of the added value and limitations of sDCM, in relation to its
   deterministic homologue. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Classic theories of emotion posit that awareness of one's internal
   bodily states (interoception) is a key component of emotional
   experience. This view has been indirectly supported by data
   demonstrating similar patterns of brain activity - most importantly, in
   the anterior insula - during both interoception and emotion elicitation.
   However, no study has directly compared these two phenomena within
   participants, leaving it unclear whether interoception and emotional
   experience truly share the same functional neural architecture. The
   current study addressed this gap in knowledge by examining the neural
   convergence of these two phenomena within the same population. In one
   task, participants monitored their own heartbeat: in another task they
   watched emotional video clips and rated their own emotional responses to
   the videos. Consistent with prior research, heartbeat monitoring engaged
   a circumscribed area spanning insular cortex and adjacent inferior
   frontal operculum. Critically, this interoception-related cluster also
   was engaged when participants rated their own emotion, and activity here
   correlated with the trial-by-trial intensity of participants' emotional
   experience. These findings held across both group-level and individual
   participant-level approaches to localizing interoceptive cortex.
   Together, these data further clarify the functional role of the anterior
   insula and provide novel insights about the connection between bodily
   awareness and emotion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Qualitative and quantitative reviews of the neuroimaging literature show
   that overlapping brain regions support theory of mind (ToM) and
   autobiographical memory (AM). This overlap has been taken to suggest
   that individuals draw on past personal experiences to infer others'
   mental states, but work with amnesic people shows that ToM does not
   always depend on AM. One variable that may determine the extent to which
   one relies on AM when inferring another's thoughts and feelings during
   ToM is whether that individual is personally known. To test this
   possibility, participants were scanned with fMRI as they remembered past
   experiences in response to personal photos ('AM' condition) and imagined
   others' experiences in response to photos of personally familiar ('pToM'
   condition) and unfamiliar ('ToM' condition) others. Spatiotemporal
   Partial Least Squares was used to identify the spatial and temporal
   characteristics of neural activation patterns associated with AM, pToM,
   and ToM. We found that the brain regions supporting pToM more closely
   resembled those supporting AM relative to ToM involving unfamiliar
   others, with the greatest degree of overlap within midline regions. A
   complementary finding was the observation of striking differences
   between pToM and ToM such that midline regions associated with AM
   predominated during pToM, whereas more lateral regions associated with
   social semantic memory predominated during ToM. Overall, this study
   demonstrates that ToM involves a dynamic interplay between AM and social
   semantic memory that is biased towards AM when a personally familiar
   other is the subject of the mental state inference. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Our review of research on PET and fMRI neuroimaging of experts and
   expertise acquisition reveals two apparently discordant patterns in
   working-memory-related tasks. When experts are involved, studies show
   activations in brain regions typically activated during long-term memory
   tasks that are not observed with novices, a result that is compatible
   with functional brain reorganization. By contrast, when involving
   novices and training programs, studies show a decrease in brain regions
   typically activated during working memory tasks, with no functional
   reorganization. We suggest that the latter result is a consequence of
   practice periods that do not allow important structures to be completely
   acquired: knowledge structures (i.e., Ericsson and Kintsch's retrieval
   structures; Gobet and Simon's templates) and in a lesser way, chunks.
   These structures allow individuals to improve performance on
   working-memory tasks, by enabling them to use part of long-term memory
   as working memory, causing a cerebral functional reorganization. Our
   hypothesis is that the two brain activation patterns observed in the
   literature are not discordant, but involve the same process of expertise
   acquisition in two stages: from decreased activation to brain functional
   reorganization. The dynamic of these two physiological stages depend on
   the two above-mentioned psychological constructs: chunks and knowledge
   structures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The Neural Bases of Social Intention Understanding: The Role of
   Interaction Goals}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{Decoding others' intentions is a crucial aspect of social cognition.
   Neuroimaging studies suggest that inferring immediate goals engages the
   neural system for action understanding (i.e. mirror system), while the
   decoding of long-term intentions requires the system subserving the
   attribution of mental states (i.e. mentalizing). A controversial issue,
   stimulated by recent inconsistent results, concerns whether the two
   systems are concurrently vs. exclusively involved in intention
   understanding. This issue is particularly relevant in the case of social
   interactions, whose processing has been mostly, but not
   uncontroversially, associated with the mentalizing system. We tested the
   alternative hypothesis that the relative contribution of the two systems
   in intention understanding may also depend on the shared goal of
   interacting agents. To this purpose, 27 participants observed social
   interactions differing in their cooperative vs. affective shared goal
   during functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging. The processing of both
   types of interactions activated the right temporo-parietal junction
   involved in mentalizing on action goals. Additionally, whole-brain and
   regions-of-interest analyses showed that the action understanding system
   (inferior prefrontal-parietal cortex) was more strongly activated by
   cooperative interactions, while the mentalizing-proper system (medial
   prefrontal cortex) was more strongly engaged by affective interactions.
   These differences were modulated by individual differences in
   empathizing. Both systems can thus be involved in understanding social
   intentions, with a relative weighting depending on the specific shared
   goal of the interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have shown that humans automatically react with
   congruent facial reactions, i.e., facial mimicry, when seeing a
   vis-a-vis' facial expressions. The current experiment is the first
   investigating the neuronal structures responsible for differences in the
   occurrence of such facial mimicry reactions by simultaneously measuring
   BOLD and facial EMG in an MRI scanner. Therefore, 20 female students
   viewed emotional facial expressions (happy, sad, and angry) of male and
   female avatar characters. During picture presentation, the BOLD signal
   as well as M. zygomaticus major and M. corrugator supercilii activity
   were recorded simultaneously. Results show prototypical patterns of
   facial mimicry after correction for MR related artifacts: enhanced M.
   zygomaticus major activity in response to happy and enhanced M.
   corrugator supercilii activity in response to sad and angry expressions.
   Regression analyses show that these congruent facial reactions correlate
   significantly with activations in the IFG, SMA, and cerebellum. Stronger
   zygomaticus reactions to happy faces were further associated to
   increased activities in the caudate, MTG, and PCC. Corrugator reactions
   to angry expressions were further correlated with the hippocampus,
   insula, and STS. Results are discussed in relation to core and extended
   models of the mirror neuron system (MNS).}},

Abstract = {{Two distinct strategies have been suggested to support action selection
   in humans and other animals on the basis of experiential learning: a
   goal-directed strategy that generates decisions based on the value and
   causal antecedents of action outcomes, and a habitual strategy that
   relies on the automatic elicitation of actions by environmental stimuli.
   In the present study, we investigated whether a similar dichotomy exists
   for actions that are acquired vicariously, through observation of other
   individuals rather than through direct experience, and assessed whether
   these strategies are mediated by distinct brain regions. We scanned
   participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they
   performed an observational learning task designed to encourage either
   goal-directed encoding of the consequences of observed actions, or a
   mapping of observed actions to conditional discriminative cues. Activity
   in different parts of the action observation network discriminated
   between the two conditions during observational learning and correlated
   with the degree of insensitivity to outcome devaluation in subsequent
   performance. Our findings suggest that, in striking parallel to
   experiential learning, neural systems mediating the observational
   acquisition of actions may be dissociated into distinct components: a
   goal-directed, outcome-sensitive component and a less flexible
   stimulus-response component.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has begun to identify neural regions associated with
   self-serving cognition, that is, the tendency to make claims that cast
   the self in an overly flattering light, yet little is known about the
   mechanisms supported by neural activation underlying self-serving
   cognition. One possibility suggested by current research is that MOFC, a
   region that shows reduced recruitment in relation to self-serving
   cognition, may support changes in the decision thresholds that influence
   whether information should be expressed in an evaluation. The current
   fMRI study addresses this question by combining a signal detection
   approach and a contextual manipulation that permits the measurement of
   changes in decision threshold. Participants evaluated their familiarity
   with blocks of existent and nonexistent information when they believed
   that self-serving claims of knowledge could either be exposed
   (accountable condition) or not (unaccountable condition). When held
   accountable, participants tended to shift their decision thresholds in a
   conservative (i.e., less self-serving) direction and showed greater
   activation in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Furthermore, the
   extent to which participants adopted more conservative (i.e., less
   self-serving) decision thresholds as a function of context (i.e.,
   accountability), the more they recruited MOFC activation. These findings
   refine current knowledge about the mechanisms performed by neural
   regions involved in self-serving cognition and suggest a role for MOFC
   in changing decision thresholds that influence whether information
   should be expressed in an evaluation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Most statistical analyses of fMRI data assume that the nature, timing
   and duration of the psychological processes being studied are known.
   However, often it is hard to specify this information a priori. In this
   work we introduce a data-driven technique for partitioning the
   experimental time course into distinct temporal intervals with different
   multivariate functional connectivity patterns between a set of regions
   of interest (ROIs). The technique, called Dynamic Connectivity
   Regression (DCR), detects temporal change points in functional
   connectivity and estimates a graph, or set of relationships between
   ROIs, for data in the temporal partition that falls between pairs of
   change points. Hence, DCR allows for estimation of both the time of
   change in connectivity and the connectivity graph for each partition,
   without requiring prior knowledge of the nature of the experimental
   design. Permutation and bootstrapping methods are used to perform
   inference on the change points. The method is applied to various
   simulated data sets as well as to an fMRI data set from a study (N = 26)
   of a state anxiety induction using a socially evaluative threat
   challenge. The results illustrate the method's ability to observe how
   the networks between different brain regions changed with subjects'
   emotional state. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A dual-subsystem model of the brain's default network: Self-referential
   processing, memory retrieval processes, and autobiographical memory
   retrieval}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{966-977}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Most internally oriented mental activities are known to strongly
   activate the default network, which includes remembering the past,
   future thinking and social cognition, and are heavily self-referential,
   and demanding of memory retrieval processes. Based on these observations
   and building on related findings from the literature, the present
   article proposed a simple, dual-subsystem model of the default network.
   The ability of the model to estimate brain activity during
   autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval and related reference conditions
   was then tested by performing a quantitative meta-analysis of relevant
   literature. The model divided the default network into two subsystems.
   The first, called the `cortical midline subsystem (CMS)', was comprised
   of the anteromedial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex,
   and primarily mediates self-referential processing. The other, termed
   the `parieto-temporal subsystem (PTS)', included the inferior parietal
   lobule, medial temporal lobe and lateral temporal cortex, and mainly
   supports memory retrieval processes. The meta-analysis of AM retrieval
   contrasts yielded a double dissociation that was consistent with this
   model. First, CMS regions associated more with an AM > laboratory-based
   memory (LM) contrast than with an AM > rest contrast, confirming that
   these regions play more critical roles in self-referential processing
   than memory retrieval processes. Second, all three PTS regions showed a
   greater association with an AM > rest contrast than with an AM > LM
   contrast, confirming that their role in memory retrieval processes is
   greater than in self-referential processing. Although the present model
   is limited in scope, both in terms of anatomical and functional
   specifications, it integrates diverse processes such as self-referential
   processing, episodic and semantic memory and subsystem interface, and
   provides useful heuristics that can guide further research on
   fractionation of the default network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent studies on selective attention have demonstrated that the
   perceptual load of a task determines the processing stage at which
   irrelevant sensory stimuli are filtered out. Although individuals with
   autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have been repeatedly reported to
   display several kinds of abnormal behavior related to attention
   deficits, the neural mechanisms underlying these deficits have not been
   well investigated within the framework of the load dependency of
   selective attention. The present study used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the brain responses of adults with
   high-functioning ASC to irrelevant visual distractors while performing a
   visual target detection task under high or low perceptual load. We
   observed that the increased perceptual load activated regions of the
   fronto-parietal attention network of controls and ASC comparably. On the
   other hand, the visual cortex activity evoked by visual distractors was
   less modulated by the increased perceptual load in ASC than in controls.
   Simple regression analyses showed that the degree of the modulation was
   significantly correlated with the severity of the autistic symptoms. We
   also observed reduced load-dependent modulation of the functional
   connectivity between the intraparietal and visual regions in the ASC
   group. These results revealed neural correlates for abnormal perceptual
   load-dependent engagement of visual attention in ASC, which may underlie
   aspects of cognitive and behavioral characteristics of these disorders.

Abstract = {{Interacting with others plays a fundamental role in human life. Although
   several brain regions have recently been associated with complex
   cognitive control processes, surprisingly little is known about the
   structural correlates underlying cognitive control processes involved in
   social interactions. In the present study we used gray matter
   voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate structural brain correlates
   of individual performance differences in a social Simon task. Here, two
   people share a Simon task, which requires each participant to respond to
   only one of two possible stimuli, rendering the paradigm a go-nogo task,
   so that a Simon effect - known as the Social Simon Effect (SSE) - is
   observable across both participants. Using a whole brain approach, we
   found that inter-individual differences in the SSE are negatively
   correlated with gray matter (GM) volume of the medial frontal cortex
   (MFC). The present data indicate that individuals with larger MFC GM
   volume were those with better conflict resolution in a social Simon task
   and vice versa. This brain-behavior relationship between cognitive
   control processes and individual GM volume differences might help to
   improve our understanding of social interactions in joint task
   performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Areas involved in social cognition, such as the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) and the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) appear to be active
   during the classification of sentences according to emotional criteria
   (happy, angry or sad, {[}Beaucousin et al., 2007]). These two regions
   are frequently co-activated in studies about theory of mind (ToM). To
   confirm that these regions constitute a coherent network during
   affective speech comprehension, new event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging data were acquired, using the emotional and
   grammatical-person sentence classification tasks on a larger sample of
   51 participants. The comparison of the emotional and grammatical tasks
   confirmed the previous findings. Functional connectivity analyses
   established a clear demarcation between a ``Medial{''} network,
   including the mPFC and TPJ regions, and a bilateral ``Language{''}
   network, which gathered inferior frontal and temporal areas. These
   findings suggest that emotional speech comprehension results from
   interactions between language, ToM and emotion processing networks. The
   language network, active during both tasks, would be involved in the
   extraction of lexical and prosodic emotional cues, while the medial
   network, active only during the emotional task, would drive the making
   of inferences about the sentences' emotional content, based on their
   meanings. The left and right amygdalae displayed a stronger response
   during the emotional condition, but were seldom correlated with the
   other regions, and thus formed a third entity. Finally, distinct regions
   belonging to the Language and Medial networks were found in the left
   angular gyrus, where these two systems could interface. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Regulating emotions through reappraisal has been shown to elicit
   abnormal neural activation patterns in currently depressed patients. It
   is, however, unclear if this deficit generalizes to other emotion
   regulation strategies, if it persists when patients recover, and if it
   is related to habitual use of reappraisal strategies. Therefore, we
   measured the neural responses to emotional images with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging in remitted patients with previous episodes
   of major depression and healthy controls. While viewing the images
   participants regulated the elicited emotions using either a reappraisal
   or a distraction strategy. Habitual reappraisal use was measured with
   the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Depressed patients
   showed a selective deficit in down-regulating amygdala responses to
   negative emotional stimuli using reappraisal. This down-regulation of
   amygdala activity was strongest in participants high in habitual
   reappraisal use. Activity in the regulating control-network including
   anterior cingulate and lateral orbitofrontal cortex was increased during
   both emotion regulation strategies. The findings in remitted patients
   with previous episodes of major depression suggest that altered emotion
   regulation is a trait-marker for depression. This interpretation is
   supported by the relation of habitual reappraisal use to amygdala
   down-regulation success. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The neural mechanisms by which testosterone acts on interpersonal trust}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{730-737}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{Recently, we demonstrated that the steroid-hormone testosterone reduces
   interpersonal trust in humans. The neural mechanism which underlies this
   effect is however unknown. It has been proposed that testosterone
   increases social vigilance via neuropeptide systems in the amygdala,
   augmenting communication between the amygdala and the brain stem.
   However, testosterone also affects connectivity between the
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the amygdala, which could subsequently
   lead to increased vigilance by reduced top-down control over the
   amygdala. Here, in a placebo-controlled testosterone administration
   study with 16 young women, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging
   to get more insights into neural mechanisms whereby testosterone acts on
   trust. Several cortical systems, among others the OFC, are involved in
   the evaluation of facial trustworthiness. Testosterone administration
   decreased functional connectivity between amygdala and the OFC during
   judgments of unfamiliar faces, and also increased amygdala responses
   specifically to the faces that were rated as untrustworthy. Finally,
   connectivity between the amygdala and the brain stem was not affected by
   testosterone administration. Although speculative, a neurobiological
   explanation for these findings is that in uncertain social situations,
   testosterone induces sustained decoupling between OFC and amygdala by a
   prefrontal-dopaminergic mechanism, subsequently resulting in more
   vigilant responses of the amygdala to signals of untrustworthiness. (c)

Abstract = {{Emotional communication is essential for successful social interactions.
   Emotional information can be expressed at verbal and nonverbal levels.
   If the verbal message contradicts the nonverbal expression, usually the
   nonverbal information is perceived as being more authentic, revealing
   the ``true feelings{''} of the speaker. The present fMRI study
   investigated the cerebral integration of verbal (sentences expressing
   the emotional state of the speaker) and nonverbal (facial expressions
   and tone of voice) emotional signals using ecologically valid
   audiovisual stimulus material. More specifically, cerebral activation
   associated with the relative impact of nonverbal information on judging
   the affective state of a speaker (individual nonverbal dominance index,
   INDI) was investigated. Perception of nonverbally expressed emotions was
   associated with bilateral activation within the amygdala, fusiform face
   area (FFA), temporal voice area (TVA), and the posterior temporal cortex
   as well as in the midbrain and left inferior orbitofrontal cortex
   (OFC)/left insula. Verbally conveyed emotions were linked to increased
   responses bilaterally in the TVA. Furthermore, the INDI correlated with
   responses in the left amygdala elicited by nonverbal and verbal
   emotional stimuli. Correlation of the INDI with the activation within
   the medial OFC was observed during the processing of communicative
   signals. These results suggest that individuals with a higher degree of
   nonverbal dominance have an increased sensitivity not only to nonverbal
   but to emotional stimuli in general. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The modulation of control processes by stimulus salience, as well as

   age-related differences in the influence of facial emotion on brain
   activation when an action had to be withheld, focusing on a
   developmental period characterized by rapid social-emotional and
   cognitive change. Groups of kindergarten and young school-aged children
   and a group of young adults performed a modified Go/Nogo task. Response
   cues were preceded by happy or angry faces. After controlling for task
   performance, left orbitofrontal regions discriminated trials with happy
   vs. angry faces in children but not in adults when a response was
   withheld, and this effect decreased parametrically with age group.
   Age-related changes in prefrontal responsiveness to facial expression
   were not observed when an action was required, nor did this region show
   age-related activation changes with the demand to withhold a response in
   general. Such results reveal age-related differences in prefrontal

Abstract = {{Whether an agent receives positive task feedback or a monetary reward,
   neural activity in their striatum increases. In the latter case striatal
   activity reflects extrinsic reward processing, while in the former,
   striatal activity reflects the intrinsically rewarding effects of
   performing well. There can be a ``hidden cost of reward{''}, which is a
   detrimental effect of extrinsic on intrinsic reward value. This raises
   the question how these two types of reward interact. To address this, we
   applied a monetary incentive delay task: in all trials participants
   received feedback depending on their performance. In half of the trials
   they could additionally receive monetary reward if they performed well.
   This resulted in high performance trials, which were monetarily rewarded
   and high performance trials that were not. This made it possible to
   dissociate the neural correlates of performance feedback from the neural
   correlates of monetary reward that comes with high performance.
   Performance feedback alone elicits activation increases in the ventral
   striatum. This activation increases due to additional monetary reward.
   Neural response in the dorsal striatum on the other hand is only
   significantly increased by feedback when a monetary incentive is
   present. The quality of performance does not significantly influence
   dorsal striatum activity. In conclusion, our results indicate that the
   dorsal striatum is primarily sensitive to optional or actually received
   external rewards, whereas the ventral striatum may be coding intrinsic
   reward due to positive performance feedback. Thus the ventral striatum
   is suggested to be involved in the processing of intrinsically motivated
   behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Motor familiarity: Brain activation when watching kinematic displays of

Abstract = {{The perception of action is influenced by the observer's familiarity
   with its movement. However, how does motor familiarity with own movement
   patterns modulate the visual perception of action effects? Cortical
   activation was examined with fMRI while 20 observers were watching
   videotaped point-light displays of markers on the shoulders, the right
   elbow, and wrist of an opposing table tennis player. The racket and ball
   were not displayed. Participants were asked to predict the invisible
   effect of the stroke, that is, the ball flight direction. Different
   table tennis models were used without the observers knowing and being
   informed in advance that some of the presented videos displayed their
   own movements from earlier training sessions. Prediction had to be made
   irrespective of the identity of the player represented by the four
   moving markers. Results showed that participants performed better when
   observing their ``own{''} strokes. Using a region-of-interest approach,
   fMRI data showed that observing own videos was accompanied by stronger
   activation (compared to other videos) in the left angular gyrus of the
   inferior parietal lobe and the anterior rostral medial frontal cortex.
   Other videos elicited stronger activation than own videos in the left
   intraparietal sulcus and right supramarginal gyms. We suggest that
   during action observation of motorically familiar movements, the
   compatibility between the observed action and the observers' motor
   representation is already coded in the parietal angular gyrus-in
   addition to the paracingulate gyrus. The activation in angular gyms is
   presumably part of an action-specific effect retrieval that accompanies
   actor-specific prefrontal processing. The intraparietal sulcus seems to
   be sensitive to incongruence between observed kinematics and internal
   model representations, and this also influences processing in the
   supramarginal gyms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to uncover the neural activity associated with
   specific in-group and out-group word related stimuli, to examine the
   neuroanatomical basis of group membership concept representation, and
   investigate to what extent neural processes represent `in-group'
   differently from `out-group'. Participants' brain activity was measured
   with functional MRI while they had to categorize social, in-group and
   out-group words and non-social, living and non-living words. The results
   showed that a network of brain regions previously identified as the
   `social brain', including the cortical midline structures,
   tempo-parietal junction and the anterior temporal gyrus showed enhanced
   activation for social words versus non-social words. Crucially, the
   processing of in-group words compared to the out-group words activated a
   specific network including the ventral medial prefrontal and anterior
   and dorsal cingulate cortex. These regions correspond to a neural
   network previously identified as the `personal self'. Our results
   suggest that the `social' and `personal self are closely related and
   that we derive our self image from the groups we belong to. Crown

Title = {{Response of face-selective brain regions to trustworthiness and gender

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated a role for
   the amygdala in processing the perceived trustworthiness of faces, but
   it remains uncertain whether its responses are linear (with the greatest
   response to the least trustworthy-looking faces), or quadratic (with
   increased fMRI signal for the dimension extremes). It is also unclear
   whether the trustworthiness of the stimuli is crucial or if the same
   response pattern can be found for faces varying along other dimensions.
   In addition, the responses to perceived trustworthiness of
   face-selective regions other than the amygdala are seldom reported. The
   present study addressed these issues using a novel set of stimuli
   created through computer image-manipulation both to maximise the
   presence of naturally occurring cues that underpin trustworthiness
   judgments and to allow systematic manipulation of these cues. With a
   block-design fMRI paradigm, we investigated neural responses to
   computer-manipulated trustworthiness in the amygdala and core
   face-selective regions in the occipital and temporal lobes. We asked
   whether the activation pattern is specific for differences in
   trustworthiness or whether it would also track variation along an
   orthogonal male-female gender dimension. The main findings were
   quadratic responses to changes in both trustworthiness and gender in all
   regions. These results are consistent with the idea that face-responsive
   brain regions are sensitive to face distinctiveness as well as the
   social meaning of the face features. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The current study examines the effect of status information on the
   neural substrates of person perception. In an event-related fMRI
   experiment, participants were presented with photographs of faces
   preceded with information denoting either: low or high financial status
   (e.g., ``earns \$25,000{''} or ``earns \$350,000{''}), or low or high
   moral status (e.g., ``is a tobacco executive{''} or ``does cancer
   research{''}). Participants were asked to form an impression of the
   targets, but were not instructed to explicitly evaluate their social
   status. Building on previous brain-imaging investigations, regions of
   interest analyses were performed for brain regions expected to support
   either cognitive (i.e., intraparietal sulcus) or emotional (i.e.,
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex) components of social status perception.
   Activation of the intraparietal sulcus was found to be sensitive to the
   financial status of individuals while activation of the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex was sensitive to the moral status of individuals. The
   implications of these results towards uncovering the neural substrates
   of status perception and, more broadly, the extended network of brain

Abstract = {{In this study, associations between alexithymia, interpersonal problems,

   Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). To measure interpersonal problems,
   the dominance and affiliation dimension scores of the Inventory of
   Interpersonal Problems were used, and cognitive-structural
   characteristics of interpersonal representations were measured using the
   Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale (SCORS). As hypothesized,
   alexithymia was related to cold and withdrawn, but not to dominant or
   submissive, interpersonal functioning. In terms of the SCORS,
   alexithymia was negatively related to complexity of interpersonal
   representations, both in TAT and in interview narratives, indicating a
   link between alexithymia and mentalization. However, alexithymia was
   related only to the dimension of social causality when this dimension
   was scored on TAT narratives. Overall, the TSIA provides the most
   consistent and stable results after controlling for negative
   affectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Heightened moral sensitivity seems to characterize patients
   with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Recent advances in social
   cognitive neuroscience suggest that a compelling relationship may exist
   between this disorder-relevant processing bias and the functional
   activity of brain regions implicated in OCD.
   Objective: To test the hypothesis that patients with OCD demonstrate an
   increased response of relevant ventromedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal
   cortex regions in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of
   difficult moral decision making.
   Design: Case-control cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Hospital referral OCD unit and magnetic resonance imaging
   facility.
   Participants: Seventy-three patients with OCD (42 men and 31 women) and
   73 control participants matched for age, sex, and education level.
   Main Outcome Measures: Functional magnetic resonance imaging activation
   maps representing significant changes in blood oxygenation
   level-dependent signal in response to 24 hypothetical moral dilemma vs
   nondilemma task vignettes and additional activation maps representing
   significant linear associations be-tween patients' brain responses and
   symptom severity ratings.
   Results: In both groups, moral dilemma led to robust activation of
   frontal and temporoparietal brain regions. Supporting predictions,
   patients with OCD demonstrated significantly increased activation of the
   ventral frontal cortex, particularly of the medial orbitofrontal cortex.
   In addition, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left middle
   temporal gyrus were more robustly activated in patients with OCD. These
   results were unexplained by group differences in comorbid affective
   symptoms. Patients' global illness severity predicted the relative
   magnitude of orbitofrontal-striatal activation. The severity of
   ``harm/checking{''} symptoms and ``sexual/religious{''} obsessions
   predicted the magnitude of posterior temporal and amygdala-paralimbic
   activation, respectively.
   Conclusions: The neural correlates of moral sensitivity in patients with
   OCD partly coincide with brain regions that are of general interest to
   pathophysiologic models of this disorder. In particular, these findings
   suggest that the orbitofrontal cortex together with the left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be relevant for understanding the
   link between neurobiological processes and certain maladaptive
   cognitions in OCD.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper was to develop and test two equivalent forms of
   the Assessment Battery for Communication (ABaCo), a tool for evaluating
   pragmatic abilities in patients with neuropsychological and psychiatric

   clinical practice and intervention research, when performance needs to
   be tested on two separate occasions, for example before and after a
   rehabilitation program. The present results provide additional evidence
   on the psychometric functioning of the equivalent forms of the ABaCo and
   their usability in a clinical context.
   Learning outcomes: The reader will be able to discuss the evidence of

Abstract = {{Face recognition is of major social importance and involves highly
   selective brain regions thought to be organized in a distributed
   functional network. However, the exact architecture of interconnections
   between these regions remains unknown. We used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to identify face-responsive regions in 22 participants
   and then employed diffusion tensor imaging with probabilistic
   tractography to establish the white-matter pathways between these
   functionally defined regions. We identified strong white-matter
   connections between the occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area
   (FFA), with a significant right-hemisphere predominance. We found no
   evidence for direct anatomical connections between FFA and superior
   temporal sulcus (STS) or between OFA and STS, contrary to predictions
   based on current cognitive models. Instead, our findings point to
   segregated processing along a ventral extrastriate visual pathway to
   OFA-FFA and another more dorsal system connected to STS and
   frontoparietal areas. In addition, early occipital areas were found to
   have direct connections to the amygdala, which might underlie a rapid
   recruitment of limbic brain areas by visual inputs bypassing more
   elaborate extrastriate cortical processing. These results unveil the
   structural neural architecture of the human face recognition system and
   provide new insights on how distributed face-responsive areas may work
   together.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of people worldwide engage in online role-playing with their
   avatar, a virtual agent that represents the self. Previous behavioral
   studies have indicated that many gamers identify more strongly with
   their avatar than with their biological self. Through their avatar,
   gamers develop social networks and learn new social-cognitive skills.
   The cognitive neurosciences have yet to identify the neural processes
   that underlie self-identification with these virtual agents. We applied
   functional neuroimaging to 22 long-term online gamers and 21 nongaming
   controls, while they rated personality traits of self, avatar, and
   familiar others. Strikingly, neuroimaging data revealed greater
   avatar-referential cortical activity in the left inferior parietal lobe,
   a region associated with self-identification from a third-person
   perspective. The magnitude of this brain activity correlated positively
   with the propensity to incorporate external body enhancements into one's
   bodily identity. Avatar-referencing furthermore recruited greater
   activity in the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, suggesting relatively
   greater emotional self-involvement with one's avatar. Post-scanning
   behavioral data revealed superior recognition memory for avatar relative
   to others. Interestingly, memory for avatar positively covaried with
   play duration. These findings significantly advance our knowledge about
   the brain's plasticity to self-identify with virtual agents and the
   human cognitive-affective potential to live and learn in virtual worlds.}},

Abstract = {{The self has long been regarded as a unique cognitive structure by
   virtue of its superior mnemonic abilities. Two separate effects result
   from this self memory facilitation: self-reference effect and
   self-descriptiveness effect in memory. Self-reference effect denotes
   that information processed with reference to the self is better
   remembered than information processed with reference to others, whereas
   self-descriptiveness effect indicates that items judged to be
   self-relevant is remembered better than items judged not to be relevant
   to self during self-reference task. Although there is a compelling
   connection between self-reference effect in memory and self
   mentalization processes indexed by the medial prefrontal activity, the
   underlying mechanisms of the self-descriptiveness effect in memory have
   remained underspecified. In the present fMRI study, we used a subsequent
   memory paradigm to examine the neural correlates of self-descriptiveness
   and self-reference effect in memory. Participants encoded personality
   traits while performing self-reference and other-reference task (judged
   the descriptiveness of the traits to themselves or a famous person Bruce
   Lee), and then were given a test of recognition memory outside the
   scanner. It is revealed that the hippocampal activity corresponded with
   self-descriptiveness effect in memory, but the activity of the medial
   prefrontal cortex and perirhinal cortex related to self-reference effect
   in memory. These findings suggested that the memory boost for
   self-relevant items relies on the enhanced relational binding mechanisms
   employed during self-relevant items. (C) Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Interventions based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) are widely
   used to treat chronic pain, but the brain mechanisms responsible for
   these treatment effects are poorly understood. The aim of this study was
   to validate the relevance of the cortical control theory in response to
   an exposure-based form of CBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, in
   patients with chronic pain. Forty-three female patients diagnosed with
   fibromyalgia syndrome were enrolled in a randomized, 12-week,
   waiting-list controlled clinical trial (CBT n = 25; controls n = 18).
   CBT was administered in groups of six patients during 12 weekly
   sessions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during
   pressure-evoked pain was assessed before and after treatment or the
   12-week period. Self-report questionnaires of depression and anxiety
   were administered pre- and posttreatment as well as 3 months following
   end of treatment. Patients treated with CBT reported larger improvement
   of fibromyalgia on the Patient Global Impression of Change measure, and
   improved depression and anxiety symptoms, compared to the waiting-list
   controls. However, there were no effects on clinical pain or pain
   sensitivity measures. An analysis of fMRI scans revealed that CBT led to
   increased activations in the ventrolateral prefrontal/lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex; regions associated with executive cognitive
   control. We suggest that CBT changes the brain's processing of pain
   through an altered cerebral loop between pain signals, emotions, and
   cognitions; leading to increased access to executive regions for
   reappraisal of pain. Our data thereby support our hypothesis about the
   activation of a cortical control mechanism in response to CBT treatment
   in chronic pain. (C) 2012 International Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Self-awareness (SA) is one of the core domains of higher cortical
   functions and is frequently compromised in schizophrenia. Deficits in SA
   have been associated with functional and psychosocial impairment in this
   patient population. However, despite its clinical significance, only a
   few studies have examined the neural substrates of self-referential
   processing in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to assess
   self-awareness in schizophrenia using a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) paradigm designed to elicit judgments of self-reference
   in a simulated social context. While scanned, volunteers looked at
   visually-displayed sentences that had the volunteer's own first name
   (self-directed sentence-stimulus) or an unknown other person's first
   name (other-directed sentence stimulus) as the grammatical subject of
   the sentence. The volunteers were asked to discern whether each
   sentence-stimulus was about the volunteer personally (during a
   self-referential cue epoch) or asked whether each statement was about
   someone else (during an other-referential cue epoch). We predicted that
   individuals with schizophrenia would demonstrate altered functional
   activation to self- and other-directed sentence-stimuli as compared to
   controls. Fifteen controls and seventeen schizophrenia volunteers
   completed clinical assessments and SA fMRI task on a 3T Philips 3.0 T
   Achieva system. The results showed significantly greater activation in
   schizophrenia compared to controls for cortical midline structures in
   response to self-vs. other-directed sentence-stimuli. These findings
   support results from earlier studies and demonstrate selective
   alteration in the activation of cortical midline structures associated
   with evaluations of self-reference in schizophrenia as compared to
   controls. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The human amygdala plays a crucial role in processing social
   signals, such as face expressions, particularly fearful ones, and
   facilitates responses to them in face-sensitive cortical regions. This
   contributes to social competence and individual amygdala size correlates
   with that of social networks. While rare patients with focal bilateral
   amygdala lesion typically show impaired recognition of fearful faces,
   this deficit is variable, and an intriguing possibility is that other
   brain regions can compensate to support fear and social signal
   processing.
   Methods: To investigate the brain's functional compensation of selective
   bilateral amygdala damage, we performed a series of behavioral,
   psychophysiological, and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   experiments in two adult female monozygotic twins (patient 1 and patient
   2) with equivalent, extensive bilateral amygdala pathology as a sequela
   of lipoid proteinosis due to Urbach-Wiethe disease.
   Results: Patient 1, but not patient 2, showed preserved recognition of
   fearful faces, intact modulation of acoustic startle responses by
   fear-eliciting scenes, and a normal-sized social network. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging revealed that patient 1 showed potentiated
   responses to fearful faces in her left premotor cortex face area and
   bilaterally in the inferior parietal lobule.
   Conclusions: The premotor cortex face area and inferior parietal lobule
   are both implicated in the cortical mirror-neuron system, which mediates
   learning of observed actions and may thereby promote both imitation and
   empathy. Taken together, our findings suggest that despite the
   pre-eminent role of the amygdala in processing social information, the
   cortical mirror-neuron system may sometimes adaptively compensate for
   its pathology.}},

Abstract = {{Diminished social motivation is one of the most striking features in
   autism. Yet, few studies have directly assessed the value people with an
   ASD place on social interactions, or how rewarding they report it to be.
   In the present study, we directly measure social motivation by looking
   at responses to a questionnaire assessing self-reported pleasure in
   social and non social situations. Twenty-nine adolescents with ASD and
   matched controls took part in the study. Our results reveal that
   children with an ASD differ from the controls with respect to social
   enjoyment, but not with respect to physical and other sources of
   hedonism. Further analyses demonstrate that the degree of social
   anhedonia correlates with autism severity.}},

Abstract = {{Human faces present crucial visual information for social interaction.
   Specialized brain regions are involved in the perception of faces, with
   the fusiform face area (FFA) a key neuronal substrate. Face processing
   is genetically controlled, but by which specific genes is unknown. A
   genome-wide approach identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms
   (SNPs) associated with areas of increased brain activity in response to
   affective facial expressions, measured with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. SNPs in 20 genetic regions were linked with neural
   responses to negative facial expressions in a Norwegian sample (n =
   246), which included patients with mental illness. Three genetic regions
   were linked with FFA activation in a further discovery experiment using
   positive facial expressions and involving many of the same individuals
   (n = 284). Two of these three regions showed significant association
   with right FFA activation to negative facial expressions in an
   independent North American replication sample of healthy Caucasians (n =
   85, 3q26.31, P = 0.004; 20p12.3, P = 0.045). The activation patterns
   were particularly striking for the SNP in 3q26.31, which lies in a gene
   TMEM212; only the FFA was activated. The specialized function of this
   brain region suggests that TMEM212 could contribute to the innate
   architecture of face processing.}},

Abstract = {{Background. While 20\% of schizophrenia patients worldwide speak tonal
   languages (e.g. Mandarin), studies are limited to Western-language
   patients. Western-language patients show tonal deficits that are related
   to impaired emotional processing of speech. However, language processing
   is minimally affected. In contrast, in Mandarin, syllables are voiced in
   one of four tones, with word meaning varying accordingly. We
   hypothesized that Mandarin-speaking schizophrenia patients would show
   impairments in underlying basic auditory processing that, unlike in
   Western groups, would relate to deficits in word recognition and social
   outcomes.
   Method. Altogether, 22 Mandarin-speaking schizophrenia patients and 44
   matched healthy participants were recruited from New York City. The
   auditory tasks were: (1) tone matching; (2) distorted tunes; (3) Chinese
   word discrimination; (4) Chinese word identification. Social outcomes
   were measured by marital status, employment and most recent employment
   status.
   Results. Patients showed deficits in tone-matching, distorted tunes,
   word discrimination and word identification versus controls (all p
   <0.0001). Impairments in tone-matching across groups correlated with
   both word identification (p <0.0001) and discrimination (p <0.0001). On
   social outcomes, tonally impaired patients had `lower-status' jobs
   overall when compared with tonally intact patients (p <0.005) and
   controls (p <0.0001).
   Conclusions. Our study is the first to investigate an interaction
   between neuropsychology and language among Mandarin-speaking
   schizophrenia patients. As predicted, patients were highly impaired in
   both tone and auditory word processing, with these two measures
   significantly correlated. Tonally impaired patients showed significantly
   worse employment-status function than tonally intact patients,
   suggesting a link between sensory impairment and employment status
   outcome. While neuropsychological deficits appear similar
   cross-culturally, their consequences may be language- and
   culture-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{To recognize an action, an observer exploits information about the
   applied manipulation, the involved objects, and the context where the
   action occurs. Context, object, and manipulation information are hence
   expected to be tightly coupled in a triadic relationship (the COM triad
   hereafter). The current fMRI study investigated the hemodynamic
   signatures of reciprocal modulation in the COM triad. Participants
   watched short video clips of pantomime actions, that is, actions
   performed with inappropriate objects, taking place at compatible or
   incompatible contexts. The usage of pantomime actions enabled the
   disentanglement of the neural substrates of context-manipulation (CM)
   and context-object (CO) associations. There were trials in which (1)
   both manipulation and objects, (2) only manipulation, (3) only objects,
   or (4) neither manipulation nor objects were compatible with the
   context. CM compatibility effects were found in an action-related
   network comprising ventral premotor cortex, SMA, left anterior
   intraparietal sulcus, and bilateral occipito-temporal cortex.
   Conversely, CO compatibility effects were found bilaterally in lateral
   occipital complex. These effects interacted in subregions of the lateral
   occipital complex. An overlap of CM and CO effects was observed in the
   occipito-temporal cortex and the dorsal attention network, that is,
   superior frontal sulcus/dorsal premotor cortex and superior parietal
   lobe. Results indicate that contextual information is integrated into
   the analysis of actions. Manipulation and object information is linked
   by contextual associations as a function of co-occurrence in specific
   contexts. Activation of either CM or CO associations shifts attention to
   either action-or object-related relevant information.}},

Abstract = {{Social statistical information can be used to quantitatively describe
   external events or facts, such as statistics on products, incomes, or
   sales, which consist of two basic features: associations and sociality.
   Previous studies in cognitive psychology have investigated statistical
   graph comprehension, but the neural basis of social statistical
   information processing has not been examined. In our study, 36 subjects
   were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while
   reading statistical information visually presented in one of three basic
   forms: as text, as statistical graphs, and as both graphs and text. All
   three forms consistently activated the right posterior tip of the
   parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and the left amygdala, suggesting that both
   regions contribute to social statistical information processing,
   regardless of the presentation form. Previous studies have implicated
   the posterior tip of the PHC in contextual associations and the amygdala
   in processing emotion-related events and social cognition. Taken
   together with previous studies, we proposed that the posterior tip of
   the PHC is more involved in establishing associations during social
   statistical information processing, while the amygdala is more related
   to the social component. This study provides neuroimaging evidence for
   commonly processing of the two basic features of social statistical
   information by the PHC and amygdala. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Although the fear of being scrutinized by others in a social context is
   a key symptom in social anxiety disorder (SAD), the neural processes
   underlying the perception of scrutiny have not previously been studied
   by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used fMRI to map
   brain activation during a perception-of-scrutiny task in 20 SAD patients
   and 20 controls. A multi-dimensional analytic approach was used.
   Scrutiny perception was mediated by activation of the medial frontal
   cortex, insula-operculum region and cerebellum, and the additional
   recruitment of visual areas and the thalamus in patients. Between-group
   comparison demonstrated significantly enhanced brain activation in
   patients in the primary visual cortex and cerebellum. Functional
   connectivity mapping demonstrated an abnormal connectivity between
   regions underlying general arousal and attention. SAD patients showed
   significantly greater task-induced functional connectivity in the
   thalamo-cortical and the fronto-striatal circuits. A statistically
   significant increase in task-induced functional connectivity between the
   anterior cingulate cortex and scrutiny-perception-related regions was
   observed in the SAD patients, suggesting the existence of enhanced
   behavior-inhibitory control. The presented data indicate that scrutiny
   perception in SAD enhances brain activity in arousal-attention systems,
   suggesting that fMRI may be a useful tool to explore such a behavioral
   dimension. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Interactive Effects of Three Core Goal Pursuit Processes on Brain
   Control Systems: Goal Maintenance, Performance Monitoring, and Response
   Inhibition}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{Goal attainment relies in part on one's ability to maintain a cognitive
   representation of the desired goal (goal maintenance), monitor the
   current state vis-a-vis the targeted end state and remain vigilant for
   lapses in progress (performance monitoring), and inhibit counter-goal
   behaviors (response inhibition). Because neurocognitive studies have
   typically examined these three processes in isolation from one another,
   little is known regarding if and how they interact during goal pursuit.
   However, these processes frequently co-occur during online, real-world
   goal pursuit. The present study employed a novel task to investigate how
   goal maintenance, performance monitoring, and response inhibition
   interact with one another. We identified functional activations distinct
   to each of the processes that correspond to results of prior
   investigations. In addition, we report interactive effects between
   response inhibition and goal maintenance in the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex and between performance monitoring and goal maintenance
   in the superior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus. Implications for
   studying the neural systems of in situ goals include the need for both
   experimental designs that distinguish between process, but also more
   complex, realistic tasks to begin to map interactions among these
   neurocognitive processes and how they are altered by the presence or
   absence of one another.}},

Title = {{Neural Network Development in Late Adolescents during Observation of
   Risk-Taking Action}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{Emotional maturity and social awareness are important for adolescents,
   particularly college students beginning to face the challenges and risks
   of the adult world. However, there has been relatively little research
   into personality maturation and psychological development during late
   adolescence and the neural changes underlying this development. We
   investigated the correlation between psychological properties
   (neuroticism, extraversion, anxiety, and depression) and age among late
   adolescents (n = 25, from 18 years and 1 month to 22 years and 8
   months). The results revealed that late adolescents became less
   neurotic, less anxious, less depressive and more extraverted as they
   aged. Participants then observed video clips depicting hand movements
   with and without a risk of harm (risk-taking or safe actions) during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results revealed that
   risk-taking actions elicited significantly stronger activation in the
   bilateral inferior parietal lobule, temporal visual regions
   (superior/middle temporal areas), and parieto-occipital visual areas
   (cuneus, middle occipital gyri, precuneus). We found positive
   correlations of age and extraversion with neural activation in the
   insula, middle temporal gyrus, lingual gyrus, and precuneus. We also
   found a negative correlation of age and anxiety with activation in the
   angular gyrus, precentral gyrus, and red nucleus/substantia nigra.
   Moreover, we found that insula activation mediated the relationship
   between age and extraversion. Overall, our results indicate that late
   adolescents become less anxious and more extraverted with age, a process
   involving functional neural changes in brain networks related to social
   cognition and emotional processing. The possible neural mechanisms of
   psychological and social maturation during late adolescence are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Everyday goals and experiences are often shared with others who may hold
   different places within our social networks. We investigated whether the
   experience of sharing a reward differs with respect to social network.
   Twenty human participants played a card guessing game for shared
   monetary outcomes with three partners: a computer, a confederate (out of
   network), and a friend (in network). Participants subjectively rated the
   experience of sharing a reward more positively with their friends than
   the other partners. Neuroimaging results support participants'
   subjective reports, as ventral striatal BOLD responses were more robust
   when sharing monetary gains with a friend as compared to the confederate
   or computer, suggesting a higher value for sharing with an in-network
   partner. Interestingly, ratings of social closeness covaried with this
   activity, resulting in a significant partner x closeness interaction;
   exploratory analysis showed that only participants reporting higher
   levels of closeness demonstrated partner-related differences in striatal
   BOLD response. These results suggest that reward valuation in social
   contexts is sensitive to distinctions of social network, such that
   sharing positive experiences with in-network others may carry higher
   value.}},

Title = {{Reduction in neural activation to high-calorie food cues in obese
   endometrial cancer survivors after a behavioral lifestyle intervention:
   a pilot study}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer (EC) and
   obese EC patients have the highest risk of death among all
   obesity-associated cancers. However, only two lifestyle interventions
   targeting this high-risk population have been conducted. In one trial,
   food disinhibition, as determined by the Three-Factor Eating
   Questionnaire, decreased post-intervention compared to baseline,
   suggesting an increase in emotional eating and, potentially, an increase
   in food related reward. Therefore, we evaluated appetitive behavior
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a visual food
   task in 8 obese, Stage I/II EC patients before and after a lifestyle
   intervention (Survivors in Uterine Cancer Empowered by Exercise and a
   Healthy Diet, SUCCEED), which aimed to improve nutritional and exercise
   behaviors over 16 group sessions in 6 months using social cognitive
   theory.
   Results: Congruent to findings in the general obese population, we found
   that obese EC patients, at baseline, had increased activation in
   response to high- vs. low-calorie food cues after eating a meal in brain
   regions associated with food reward (insula, cingulate gyrus; precentral
   gyrus; whole brain cluster corrected, p < 0.05). At 6 months
   post-intervention compared to baseline, we observed decreased activation
   for the high- calorie vs. non-food contrast, post-meal, in regions
   involved in food reward and motivation (posterior cingulate, cingulate
   gyrus, lateral globus pallidus, thalamus; claustrum; whole brain cluster
   corrected, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest behavioral lifestyle
   interventions may help to reduce high- calorie food reward in obese EC
   survivors who are at a high-risk of death. To our knowledge, this is the
   first study to demonstrate such changes.}},

Title = {{Look at this: the neural correlates of initiating and responding to bids
   for joint attention}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 22}},
Abstract = {{When engaging in joint attention, one person directs another person's
   attention to an object (Initiating Joint Attention, IJA), and the second
   person's attention follows (Responding to Joint Attention, RJA). As
   such, joint attention must occur within the context of a social
   interaction. This ability is critical to language and social
   development; yet the neural bases for this pivotal skill remain
   understudied. This paucity of research is likely due to the challenge in
   acquiring functional MRI data during a naturalistic, contingent social
   interaction. To examine the neural bases of both IJA and RJA we
   implemented a dual-video set-up that allowed for a face-to-face
   interaction between subject and experimenter via video during fMRI data
   collection. In each trial, participants either followed the
   experimenter's gaze to a target (RJA) or cued the experimenter to look
   at the target (IJA). A control condition, solo attention (SA), was
   included in which the subject shifted gaze to a target while the
   experimenter closed her eyes. Block and event-related analyses were
   conducted and revealed common and distinct regions for IJA and RJA.
   Distinct regions included the ventromedial prefrontal cortex for RJA and
   intraparietal sulcus and middle frontal gyrus for IJA (as compared to
   SA). Conjunction analyses revealed overlap in the dorsal medial
   prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and right posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) for IJA and RJA (as compared to SA) for the event analyses.
   Functional connectivity analyses during a resting baseline suggest joint
   attention processes recruit distinct but interacting networks, including
   social-cognitive, voluntary attention orienting, and visual networks.
   This novel experimental set-up allowed for the identification of the
   neural bases of joint attention during a real-time interaction and
   findings suggest that whether one is the initiator or responder, the
   dMPFC and right pSTS, are selectively recruited during periods of joint
   attention.}},

Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) of the brain consists of areas that are
   typically more active during rest than during active task performance.
   Recently however, this network has been shown to be activated by certain
   types of tasks. Social cognition, particularly higher-order tasks such
   as attributing mental states to others, has been suggested to activate a
   network of areas at least partly overlapping with the DMN. Here, we
   explore this claim, drawing on evidence from meta-analyses of functional
   MRI data and recent studies investigating the structural and functional
   connectivity of the social brain. In addition, we discuss recent
   evidence for the existence of a DMN in non-human primates. We conclude
   by discussing some of the implications of these observations.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental challenge in social cognition is how humans learn another
   person's values to predict their decision-making behavior. This form of
   learning is often assumed to require simulation of the other by direct
   recruitment of one's own valuation process to model the other's process.
   However, the cognitive and neural mechanism of simulation learning is
   not known. Using behavior, modeling, and fMRI, we show that simulation
   involves two learning signals in a hierarchical arrangement. A
   simulated-other's reward prediction error processed in ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex mediated simulation by direct recruitment, being
   identical for valuation of the self and simulated-other. However, direct
   recruitment was insufficient for learning, and also required observation
   of the other's choices to generate a simulated-other's action prediction
   error encoded in dorsomedial/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These
   findings show that simulation uses a core prefrontal circuit for
   modeling the other's valuation to generate prediction and an adjunct
   circuit for tracking behavioral variation to refine prediction.}},

Title = {{Neural Basis of Moral Elevation Demonstrated through Inter-Subject
   Synchronization of Cortical Activity during Free-Viewing}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most research investigating the neural basis of social
   emotions has examined emotions that give rise to negative evaluations of
   others (e. g. anger, disgust). Emotions triggered by the virtues and
   excellences of others have been largely ignored. Using fMRI, we
   investigated the neural basis of two ``other-praising{''} emotions -
   Moral Elevation (a response to witnessing acts of moral beauty), and
   Admiration (which we restricted to admiration for physical skill).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Ten participants viewed the same nine
   video clips. Three clips elicited moral elevation, three elicited
   admiration, and three were emotionally neutral. We then performed
   pair-wise voxel-by-voxel correlations of the BOLD signal between
   individuals for each video clip and a separate resting-state run. We
   observed a high degree of inter-subject synchronization, regardless of
   stimulus type, across several brain regions during free-viewing of
   videos. Videos in the elevation condition evoked significant
   inter-subject synchronization in brain regions previously implicated in
   self-referential and interoceptive processes, including the medial
   prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula. The degree of synchronization
   was highly variable over the course of the videos, with the strongest
   synchrony occurring during portions of the videos that were
   independently rated as most emotionally arousing. Synchrony in these
   same brain regions was not consistently observed during the admiration
   videos, and was absent for the neutral videos.
   Conclusions/Significance: Results suggest that the neural systems
   supporting moral elevation are remarkably consistent across subjects
   viewing the same emotional content. We demonstrate that model-free
   techniques such as inter-subject synchronization may be a useful tool
   for studying complex, context dependent emotions such as
   self-transcendent emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Another person's caress is one of the most powerful of all emotional
   social signals. How much the primary somatosensory cortices (SIs)
   participate in processing the pleasantness of such social touch remains
   unclear. Although ample empirical evidence supports the role of the
   insula in affective processing of touch, here we argue that SI might be
   more involved in affective processing than previously thought by showing
   that the response in SI to a sensual caress is modified by the perceived
   sex of the caresser. In a functional MRI study, we manipulated the
   perceived affective quality of a caress independently of the sensory
   properties at the skin: heterosexual males believed they were sensually
   caressed by either a man or woman, although the caress was in fact
   invariantly delivered by a female blind to condition type. Independent
   analyses showed that SI encoded, and was modulated by, the visual sex of
   the caress, and that this effect is unlikely to originate from the
   insula. This suggests that current models may underestimate the role
   played by SI in the affective processing of social touch.}},

Title = {{An fMRI study of joint action-varying levels of cooperation correlates
   with activity in control networks}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{As social agents, humans continually interact with the people around
   them. Here, motor cooperation was investigated using a paradigm in which
   pairs of participants, one being scanned with fMRI, jointly controlled a
   visually presented object with joystick movements. The object oscillated
   dynamically along two dimensions, color and width of gratings,
   corresponding to the two cardinal directions of joystick movements.
   While the overall control of each participant on the object was kept
   constant, the amount of cooperation along the two dimensions varied
   along four levels, from no (each participant controlled one dimension
   exclusively) to full (each participant controlled half of each
   dimension) cooperation. Increasing cooperation correlated with BOLD
   signal in the left parietal operculum and anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC), while decreasing cooperation correlated with activity in the
   right inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri, the intraparietal
   sulci and inferior temporal gyri bilaterally, and the dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex. As joint performance improved with the level of
   cooperation, we assessed the brain responses correlating with behavior,
   and found that activity in most of the areas associated with levels of
   cooperation also correlated with the joint performance. The only brain
   area found exclusively in the negative correlation with cooperation was
   in the dorso medial frontal cortex, involved in monitoring action
   outcome. Given the cluster location and condition-related signal change,
   we propose that this region monitored actions to extract the level of
   cooperation in order to optimize the joint response. Our results,
   therefore, indicate that, in the current experimental paradigm involving
   joint control of a visually presented object with joystick movements,
   the level of cooperation affected brain networks involved in action
   control, but not mentalizing.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely held that the interaction between instrumental and
   Pavlovian conditioning induces powerful motivational biases.
   Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) is one of the key paradigms
   demonstrating this effect, which can further be decomposed into a
   general and specific component. Although these two forms of PIT have
   been studied at the level of amygdalar subregions in rodents, it is
   still unknown whether they involve different areas of the human
   amygdala. Using a high-resolution fMRI (hr-fMRI) protocol optimized for
   the amygdala in combination with a novel free operant task designed to
   elicit effects of both general and specific PIT, we demonstrate that a
   region of ventral amygdala within the boundaries of the basolateral
   complex and the ventrolateral putamen are involved in specific PIT,
   while a region of dorsal amygdala within the boundaries of the
   centromedial complex is involved in general PIT. These results add to a
   burgeoning literature indicating different functional contributions for
   these different amygdalar subregions in reward-processing and

Abstract = {{We read conspecifics' social cues effortlessly, but little is known
   about our abilities to understand social gestures of other species. To
   investigate the neural underpinnings of such skills, we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to study the brain activity of experts and
   non-experts of dog behavior while they observed humans or dogs either
   interacting with, or facing away from a conspecific. The posterior
   superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) of both subject groups dissociated
   humans facing toward each other from humans facing away, and in dog
   experts, a distinction also occurred for dogs facing toward vs. away in
   a bilateral area extending from the pSTS to the inferior
   temporo-occipital cortex: the dissociation of dog behavior was
   significantly stronger in expert than control group. Furthermore, the
   control group had stronger pSTS responses to humans than dogs facing
   toward a conspecific, whereas in dog experts, the responses were of
   similar magnitude. These findings suggest that dog experts' brains
   distinguish socially relevant body postures similarly in dogs and
   humans.}},

Title = {{Covert Tracking: A Combined ERP and Fixational Eye Movement Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Attention can be directed to particular spatial locations, or to objects
   that appear at anticipated points in time. While most work has focused
   on spatial or temporal attention in isolation, we investigated covert
   tracking of smoothly moving objects, which requires continuous
   coordination of both. We tested two propositions about the neural and
   cognitive basis of this operation: first that covert tracking is a right
   hemisphere function, and second that pre-motor components of the
   oculomotor system are responsible for driving covert spatial attention
   during tracking. We simultaneously recorded event related potentials
   (ERPs) and eye position while participants covertly tracked dots that
   moved leftward or rightward at 12 or 20 degrees/s. ERPs were sensitive
   to the direction of target motion. Topographic development in the
   leftward motion was a mirror image of the rightward motion, suggesting
   that both hemispheres contribute equally to covert tracking. Small
   shifts in eye position were also lateralized according to the direction
   of target motion, implying covert activation of the oculomotor system.
   The data addresses two outstanding questions about the nature of
   visuospatial tracking. First, covert tracking is reliant upon a
   symmetrical frontoparietal attentional system, rather than being right
   lateralized. Second, this same system controls both pursuit eye
   movements and covert tracking.}},

Title = {{An imaging genetics approach to understanding social influence}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Normative social influences shape nearly every aspect of our lives, yet
   the biological processes mediating the impact of these social influences
   on behavior remain incompletely understood. In this Hypothesis, we
   outline a theoretical framework and an integrative research approach to
   the study of social influences on the brain and genetic moderators of
   such effects. First, we review neuroimaging evidence linking social
   influence and conformity to the brain's reward system. We next review
   neuroimaging evidence linking social punishment (exclusion) to brain
   systems involved in the experience of pain, as well as evidence linking
   exclusion to conformity. We suggest that genetic variants that increase
   sensitivity to social cues may predispose individuals to be more
   sensitive to either social rewards or punishments (or potentially both),
   which in turn increases conformity and susceptibility to normative
   social influences more broadly. To this end, we review evidence for
   genetic moderators of neurochemical responses in the brain, and suggest
   ways in which genes and pharmacology may modulate sensitivity to social
   influences. We conclude by proposing an integrative imaging genetics
   approach to the study of brain mediators and genetic modulators of a
   variety of social influences on human attitudes, beliefs, and actions.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 8}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we study neural responses to inequitable distributions of
   rewards despite equal performance. We specifically focus on differences
   between advantageous inequity (AI) and disadvantageous inequity (DI). AI
   and DI were realized in a hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) experiment with pairs of subjects simultaneously
   performing a task in adjacent scanners and observing both subjects'
   rewards. Results showed (1) hypoactivation of the ventral striatum (VS)
   under DI but not under AI; (2) inequity induced activation of the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) that was stronger under DI than
   under AI; (3) correlations between subjective evaluations of AI
   evaluation and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal and left insular
   activity. Our study provides neurophysiological evidence for different
   cognitive processes that occur when exposed to DI and AI, respectively.
   One possible interpretation is that any form of inequity represents a
   norm violation, but that important differences between AI and DI emerge
   from an asymmetric involvement of status concerns.}},

Title = {{Abnormal social reward processing in autism as indexed by pupillary
   responses to happy faces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) typically
   show impaired eye contact during social interactions. From a young age,
   they look less at faces than typically developing (TD) children and tend
   to avoid direct gaze. However, the reason for this behavior remains
   controversial; ASD children might avoid eye contact because they
   perceive the eyes as aversive or because they do not find social
   engagement through mutual gaze rewarding.
   Methods: We monitored pupillary diameter as a measure of autonomic
   response in children with ASD (n = 20, mean age = 12.4) and TD controls
   (n = 18, mean age = 13.7) while they looked at faces displaying
   different emotions. Each face displayed happy, fearful, angry or neutral
   emotions with the gaze either directed to or averted from the subjects.
   Results: Overall, children with ASD and TD controls showed similar
   pupillary responses; however, they differed significantly in their
   sensitivity to gaze direction for happy faces. Specifically, pupillary
   diameter increased among TD children when viewing happy faces with
   direct gaze as compared to those with averted gaze, whereas children
   with ASD did not show such sensitivity to gaze direction. We found no
   group differences in fixation that could explain the differential
   pupillary responses. There was no effect of gaze direction on pupil
   diameter for negative affect or neutral faces among either the TD or ASD
   group.
   Conclusions: We interpret the increased pupillary diameter to happy
   faces with direct gaze in TD children to reflect the intrinsic reward
   value of a smiling face looking directly at an individual. The lack of
   this effect in children with ASD is consistent with the hypothesis that
   individuals with ASD may have reduced sensitivity to the reward value of
   social stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Self-esteem can be defined as evaluations that individuals make about
   their worth as human beings. These evaluations are in part based on how
   we evaluate ourselves on our abilities, values, opinions, etc. compared
   with others or our past or ideal self; and they are also influenced by a
   thought that what others may think about us. Studies to date
   investigating the neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in
   self-esteem have focused mostly on the latter process (i.e. on how
   self-esteem is associated with neural correlates of processing feedback
   from others). However, given that people spend a lot of time thinking
   about themselves and evaluating their worth, we aimed to investigate
   neural mechanism underlying the association between levels of
   self-esteem and processing of self-relevant information. Seventeen
   participants completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   scan during which they were asked to evaluate whether a given statement
   is true about them (Self), an acquaintance of theirs (Other), or about
   general knowledge (Semantic). A whole brain correlational analysis
   revealed a significant negative correlation between levels of
   self-esteem and changes in activation of dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus
   (dACC, BA32) in response to evaluating self-relevant information (Self
   versus Other contrast). This result extends previous findings
   implicating this region in the association between processing evaluative
   feedback and levels of self-esteem and suggests that activity in this
   region is affected by self-esteem levels also when individuals are
   engaged in self-referencing and self-evaluation. Future studies should
   investigate whether these associations are affected differently based on
   valence of self-evaluations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research in neuroeconomics suggests that social economic
   decision-making may be best understood as a dual-systems process,
   integrating the influence of deliberative and affective subsystems.
   However, most of this research has focused on young adults and it
   remains unclear whether our current models extend to healthy aging. To
   address this question, we investigated the behavioral and neural basis
   of simple economic decisions in 18 young and 20 older healthy adults.
   Participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting
   monetary offers from human and non-human (computer) partners in an
   Ultimatum Game, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). The partners' proposals involved splitting an amount of money
   between the two players, and ranged from \$1 to \$5 (from a \$10 pot).
   Relative to young adults, older participants expected more equitable
   offers and rejected moderately unfair offers (\$3) to a larger extent.
   Imaging results revealed that, relative to young participants, older
   adults had higher activations in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC) when receiving unfair offers (\$1-\$3). Age group moderated the
   relationship between left DLPFC activation and acceptance rates of
   unfair offers. In contrast, older adults showed lower activation of
   bilateral anterior insula in response to unfair offers. No age group
   difference was observed when participants received fair (\$5) offers.
   These findings suggest that healthy aging may be associated with a
   stronger reliance on computational areas subserving goal maintenance and
   rule shifting (DLPFC) during interactive economic decision-making.
   Consistent with a well-documented ``positivity effect{''}, older age may
   also decrease recruitment of areas involved in emotion processing and
   integration (anterior insula) in the face of social norm violation.

Abstract = {{In synesthesia, certain stimuli to one sensory modality lead to sensory
   perception in another unstimulated modality. In addition to other
   models, a two-stage model is discussed to explain this phenomenon, which
   combines two previously formulated hypotheses regarding synesthesia:
   direct cross-activation and hyperbinding. The direct cross-activation
   model postulates that direct connections between sensory-specific areas
   are responsible for co-activation and synesthetic perception. The
   hyperbinding hypothesis suggests that the inducing stimulus and the
   synesthetic sensation are coupled by a sensory nexus area, which may be
   located in the parietal cortex. This latter hypothesis is compatible
   with the disinhibited feedback model, which suggests unusual feedback
   from multimodal convergence areas as the cause of synesthesia. In this
   study, the relevance of these models was tested in a group (n = 1 4) of
   auditory-visual synesthetes by performing a functional connectivity
   analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Different
   simple and complex sounds were used as stimuli, and functionally defined
   seed areas in the bilateral auditory cortex (AC) and the left inferior
   parietal cortex (IPC) were used for the connectivity calculations. We
   found no differences in the connectivity of the AC and the visual areas
   between synesthetes and controls. The main finding of the study was
   stronger connectivity of the left IPC with the left primary auditory and
   right primary visual cortex in the group of auditory-visual synesthetes.
   The results support the model of disinhibited feedback as a cause of
   synesthetic perception but do not suggest direct cross-activation. (C)

Abstract = {{We recently found activity in default mode and reward-related regions
   during self-relevant tasks in young adults. Here we examine the effect
   of aging on engagement of the default network (DN) and reward network
   (RN) during these tasks. Previous studies have shown reduced engagement
   of the DN and reward areas in older adults, but the influence of age on
   these circuits during self-relevant tasks has not been examined. The
   tasks involved judging personality traits about one's self or a well
   known other person. There were no age differences in reaction time on
   the tasks but older adults had more positive Self and Other judgments,
   whereas younger adults had more negative judgments. Both groups had
   increased DN and RN activity during the self-relevant tasks, relative to
   non-self tasks, but this increase was reduced in older compared to young
   adults. Functional connectivity of both networks during the tasks was
   weaker in the older relative to younger adults. Intrinsic functional
   connectivity, measured at rest, also was weaker in the older adults in
   the DN, but not in the RN. These results suggest that, in younger
   adults, the processing of personally relevant information involves
   robust activation of and functional connectivity within these two
   networks, in line with current models that emphasize strong links
   between the self and reward. The finding that older adults had more
   positive judgments, but weaker engagement and less consistent functional
   connectivity in these networks, suggests potential brain mechanisms for
   the ``positivity bias{''} with aging. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is associated with behavioral and
   emotional dysregulation, particularly in social contexts; however, the
   underlying pathophysiology at the level of brain function is not well
   understood. Previous studies found abnormalities in frontal cortical and
   limbic areas suggestive of poor frontal regulation of downstream brain
   regions. However, the striatum, which is closely connected with the
   medial frontal cortices and plays an important role in motivated
   behaviors and processing of rewarding stimuli, has been understudied in
   BPD. Here we hypothesized that, in addition to frontal dysfunction, BPD
   patients may show abnormal striatal function. In this study, 38 BPD
   patients with intermittent explosive disorder (BPD-IED) and 36 healthy
   controls (HC) participated in the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm
   (PSAP), a computer game played with a fictitious other player.
   (18)Fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FOG-PET) measured
   relative glucose metabolism (rGMR) within caudate and putamen in
   response to aggression-provoking and non-provoking versions of the PSAP.
   Male BPD-IED patients had significantly lower striatal rGMR than all
   other groups during both conditions, although male and female BPD-IED
   patients did not differ in clinical or behavioral measures. These sex
   differences suggest differential involvement of frontal-striatal
   circuits in BPD-IED, and are discussed in relation to striatal
   involvement in affective learning and social decision-making. Published

Abstract = {{Recent research on potential applications of fMRI in the detection of

   hemodynamic response patterns to deception. This interpretation is
   challenged by the results of the present study. Participants were
   required to memorize probe and target items (a banknote and a playing
   card, each). Subsequently, these items were repeatedly presented along
   with eight irrelevant items in a modified Guilty Knowledge Test design
   and participants were instructed to simply acknowledge item presentation
   by pressing one button after each stimulus. Despite the absence of
   response monitoring demands and thus overt response conflicts, the
   experiment revealed a differential physiological response pattern as a
   function of item type. First, probes elicited the largest skin
   conductance responses. Second, differential hemodynamic responses were
   observed in bilateral inferior frontal regions, the right supramarginal
   gyrus and the supplementary motor area as a function of item type.
   Probes and targets were accompanied by a larger signal increase than
   irrelevant items in these regions. Moreover, the responses to probes
   differed substantially from targets. The observed neural response
   pattern seems to rely on retrieval processes that depend on the depth of
   processing in the encoding situation.}},

Abstract = {{Brain mechanisms underlying explicit evaluation of emotion have been
   explored using different tasks including `stimulus-focused evaluation',
   `evaluation of one's own emotion' and `evaluation of others' emotions'.
   Yet the extent to which similar brain mechanisms underlie different
   evaluation tasks is unclear. A meta-analysis of published neuroimaging
   studies of explicit emotional evaluation was conducted to examine common
   and distinct regions underlying these different evaluation tasks. This
   study revealed regions common to all three tasks: The amygdala and LPFC
   as common regions may be involved in emotion-cognition interactions, and
   the DMPFC may possibly play integrative roles in explicit emotional
   evaluation. Distinct regions were also identified: (i) the sensory
   cortex and VLPFC were specifically associated with `stimulus
   evaluation', possibly involved in perceptual and conceptual processing;
   (ii) the insula and rACC were specifically associated with `evaluation
   of one's own emotion', potentially associated with interoceptive and
   experiential processing; and (iii) the STS and TPJ were specifically
   associated with `evaluation of others' emotions', potentially reflecting
   their roles in TOM and empathy. These findings suggest that different
   types of explicit emotional evaluation may involve common and distinct
   networks and provide new insights on multiple mechanisms underlying
   explicit emotional evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Human empathy is not merely a resonance with others' physical condition,
   but is modulated by social factors. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, the present study demonstrated an increased brain empathic
   response to others in pain when they received no rather than a large
   reward, with increments of the ACC, aMCC, insula and postcentral gyrus
   in the pain matrix and temporoparietal junction. Thus, pain target's
   financial situation modulated brain empathic responses in the pain
   matrix based on an understanding of the situation pain target faces.}},

Abstract = {{We examined whether amygdala responses to rapidly presented fear
   expressions are preferentially tuned to averted vs direct gaze fear and
   conversely whether responses to more sustained presentations are
   preferentially tuned to direct vs averted gaze fear. We conducted three
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to test these
   predictions including: Study 1: a block design employing sustained
   presentations (1 s) of averted vs direct gaze fear expressions taken
   from the Pictures of Facial Affect; Study 2: a block design employing
   rapid presentations (300 ms) of these same stimuli and Study 3: a direct
   replication of these studies in the context of a single experiment using
   stimuli selected from the NimStim Emotional Face Stimuli. Together,
   these studies provide evidence consistent with an early, reflexive
   amygdala response tuned to clear threat and a later reflective response
   tuned to ambiguous threat.}},

Abstract = {{A number of recent studies have put human subjects in true social
   interactions, with the aim of better identifying the psychophysiological
   processes underlying social cognition. Interestingly, this emerging
   Neuroscience of Social Interactions (NSI) field brings up challenges
   which resemble important ones in the field of Brain-Computer Interfaces(
   BCI). Importantly, these challenges go beyond common objectives such as
   the eventual use of BCI and NSI protocols in the clinical domain or
   common interests pertaining to the use of online neurophysiological
   techniques and algorithms. Common fundamental challenges are now
   apparent and one can argue that a crucial one is to develop
   computational models of brain processes relevant to human interactions
   with an adaptive agent, whether human or artificial. Coupled with
   neuroimaging data, such models have proved promising in revealing the
   neural basis and mental processes behind social interactions. Similar
   models could help BCI to move from well-performing but offline static
   machines to reliable online adaptive agents. This emphasizes a social
   perspective to BCI, which is not limited to a computational challenge
   but extends to all questions that arise when studying the brain in
   interaction with its environment.}},

Abstract = {{FMRI was performed with the dynamic facial expressions fear and
   happiness. This was done to detect differences in valence processing
   between 25 subjects with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and 27
   typically developing controls. Valence scaling was abnormal in ASDs.
   Positive valence induces lower deactivation and abnormally strong
   activity in ASD in multiple regions. Negative valence increased
   deactivation in visual areas in subjects with ASDs. The most marked
   differences between valences focus on fronto-insular and temporal
   regions. This supports the idea that subjects with ASDs may have
   difficulty in passive processing of the salience and mirroring of
   expressions. When the valence scaling of brain activity fails, in
   contrast to controls, these areas activate and/or deactivate
   inappropriately during facial stimuli presented dynamically.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions involve more than ``just{''} language. As important
   is a more primitive nonlinguistic mode of communication acting in
   parallel with linguistic processes and driving our decisions to a much
   higher degree than is generally suspected. Amongst the ``honest
   signals{''} that influence our behavior is perceived vocal
   attractiveness. Not only does vocal attractiveness reflect important
   biological characteristics of the speaker, it also influences our social
   perceptions according to the ``what sounds beautiful is good{''}
   phenomenon. Despite the widespread influence of vocal attractiveness on
   social interactions revealed by behavioral studies, its neural
   underpinnings are yet unknown. We measured brain activity while
   participants listened to a series of vocal sounds ({''}ah{''}) and
   performed an unrelated task. We found that voice-sensitive auditory and
   inferior frontal regions were strongly correlated with implicitly
   perceived vocal attractiveness. While the involvement of auditory areas
   reflected the processing of acoustic contributors to vocal
   attractiveness ({''}distance to mean{''} and spectrotemporal
   regularity), activity in inferior prefrontal regions (traditionally
   involved in speech processes) reflected the overall perceived
   attractiveness of the voices despite their lack of linguistic content.
   These results suggest the strong influence of hidden nonlinguistic
   aspects of communication signals on cerebral activity and provide an
   objective measure of this influence.}},

Abstract = {{Neural research on social cognition has not examined motivations known
   to influence social cognition. One fundamental motivation in social
   cognition is positivity motivation, that is, the desire to view close
   others in an overly positive light. Positivity motivation does not
   extend to non-close others. The current functional magnetic resonance
   imaging study is the first to identify neural regions modulated by
   positivity motivation. Participants compared the personalities of a
   close other (i.e., romantic partner) and a non-close other (i.e.,
   roommate) with their average peer. Romantic partners were perceived as
   above average under certain conditions; roommates were perceived as
   similar to an average peer across conditions. Neural regions previously
   associated with social cognition did not significantly relate to
   positivity motivation. Instead, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and, to a
   lesser extent, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activation
   increased when social targets were perceived as similar to an average
   peer. Furthermore, OFC activity negatively correlated with the extent to
   which a social target was perceived as above average. Intimacy with the
   social target modulated the extent to which ventral ACC distinguished
   positive from negative stimuli. The results expand current knowledge
   about neural regions associated with social cognition and provide
   initial information needed to create neural models of social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become an important
   method in clinical psychiatry research whereas there are still only few
   comparable preclinical investigations. Herein, we report that fMRI in
   rats can provide key information regarding brain areas underlying
   anxiety behavior. Perfusion as surrogate for neuronal activity was
   measured by means of arterial spin labeling-based fMRI in various brain
   areas of high anxiety F344 rats and control Sprague Dawley rats. In one
   of these areas, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), c-Fos
   labeling was compared between these two strains with immunolabeling. The
   effects of a neurotoxic ibotenic acid lesion of the dmPFC in F344 rats
   were examined in a social approach avoidance anxiety procedure and fMRI.
   Regional brain activity of high anxiety F344 rats was different in
   selective cortical and subcortical areas as compared to that of low
   anxiety Sprague Dawley rats; the largest difference (i.e. hyperactivity)
   was measured in the dmPFC. Independently, c-Fos labeling confirmed that
   F344 rats show increased dmPFC activity. The functional role was
   confirmed by neurotoxic lesion of the dmPFC that reversed the high
   anxiety-like behavior and partially normalized the brain activity
   pattern of F344 rats. The current findings may have translational value
   as increased activity is reported in an equivalent cortical area in
   patients with social anxiety, suggesting that pharmacological or
   functional inhibition of activity in this brain area should be explored
   to alleviate social anxiety in patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. and

   more about the stereotypes than about race per se. Amygdala activity
   (correlated with negative racial attitudes in other studies) appeared
   driven by norm violation, rather than race. Similarly, a pattern of

Abstract = {{While previous aging studies have focused on particular components of
   social perception (e.g., theory of mind, self-referencing), little is
   known about age-related differences specifically for the neural basis of
   perception of affiliation and isolation. This study investigates
   age-related similarities and differences in the neural basis of
   affiliation and isolation. Participants viewed images of affiliation
   (groups engaged in social interaction) and isolation (lone individuals),
   as well as nonsocial stimuli (e.g., landscapes), while making
   pleasantness judgments and undergoing functional neuroimaging (BOLD
   fMRI). Results indicated age-related similarities in response to
   affiliation and isolation in recruitment of regions involved in theory
   of mind and self-referencing (e.g., temporal pole, medial prefrontal
   cortex). Yet age-related differences also emerged in response to
   affiliation and isolation in regions implicated in the theory of mind,
   as well as self-referencing. Specifically, in response to isolation
   versus affiliation images, older adults showed greater recruitment than
   did younger adults of the temporal pole, a region that is important for
   retrieval of personally relevant memories utilized to understand others'
   mental states. Furthermore, in response to images of affiliation versus
   isolation, older adults showed greater recruitment than did younger
   adults of the precuneus, a region implicated in self-referencing. We
   suggest that age-related divergence in neural activation patterns
   underlying judgments of scenes depicting isolation versus affiliation
   may indicate that older adults' theory of mind processes are driven by
   retrieval of isolation-relevant information. Moreover, older adults'
   greater recruitment of the precuneus for affiliation versus isolation
   suggests that the positivity bias for emotional information may extend
   to social information involving affiliation.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of social self is often described as a representation of the
   self-reflected in the eyes or minds of others. Although the appearance
   of one's own face has substantial social significance for humans,
   neuroimaging studies have failed to link self-face recognition and the
   likely neural substrate of the social self, the medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC). We assumed that the social self is recruited during self-face
   recognition under a rich social context where multiple other faces are
   available for comparison of social values. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined the modulation of neural responses
   to the faces of the self and of a close friend in a social context. We
   identified an enhanced response in the ventral MPFC and right
   occipitoparietal sulcus in the social context specifically for the
   self-face. Neural response in the right lateral parietal and inferior
   temporal cortices, previously claimed as self-face-specific, was
   unaffected for the self-face but unexpectedly enhanced for the friend's
   face in the social context. Self-face-specific activation in the pars
   triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, and self-face-specific
   reduction of activation in the left middle temporal gyrus and the right
   supramarginal gyrus, replicating a previous finding, were not subject to
   such modulation. Our results thus demonstrated the recruitment of a
   social self during self-face recognition in the social context. At least
   three brain networks for self-face-specific activation may be
   dissociated by different patterns of response-modulation in the social
   context, suggesting multiple dynamic self-other representations in the
   human brain. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Parochial altruisma preference for altruistic behavior towards ingroup
   members and mistrust or hostility towards outgroup membersis a pervasive
   feature in human society and strongly shapes the enforcement of social
   norms. Since the uniqueness of human society critically depends on the
   enforcement of norms, the understanding of the neural circuitry of the
   impact of parochial altruism on social norm enforcement is key, but
   unexplored. To fill this gap, we measured brain activity with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects had the opportunity to
   punish ingroup members and outgroup members for violating social norms.
   Findings revealed that subjects' strong punishment of defecting outgroup
   members is associated with increased activity in a functionally
   connected network involved in sanction-related decisions (right
   orbitofrontal gyrus, right lateral prefrontal cortex, right dorsal
   caudatus). Moreover, the stronger the connectivity in this network, the
   more outgroup members are punished. In contrast, the much weaker
   punishment of ingroup members who committed the very same norm violation
   is associated with increased activity and connectivity in the
   mentalizing-network (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, bilateral
   temporo-parietal junction), as if subjects tried to understand or
   justify ingroup members' behavior. Finally, connectivity analyses
   between the two networks suggest that the mentalizing-network modulates
   punishment by affecting the activity in the right orbitofrontal gyrus
   and right lateral prefrontal cortex, notably in the same areas showing
   enhanced activity and connectivity whenever third-parties strongly
   punished defecting outgroup members. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. (c) 2011

Title = {{Neural activity associated with self-reflection}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Self-referential cognitions are important for
   self-monitoring and self-regulation. Previous studies have addressed the
   neural correlates of self-referential processes in response to or
   related to external stimuli. We here investigated brain activity
   associated with a short, exclusively mental process of self-reflection
   in the absence of external stimuli or behavioural requirements. Healthy
   subjects reflected either on themselves, a personally known or an
   unknown person during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The
   reflection period was initialized by a cue and followed by photographs
   of the respective persons (perception of pictures of oneself or the
   other person).
   Results: Self-reflection, compared with reflecting on the other persons
   and to a major part also compared with perceiving photographs of
   one-self, was associated with more prominent dorsomedial and lateral
   prefrontal, insular, anterior and posterior cingulate activations.
   Whereas some of these areas showed activity in the
   ``other{''}-conditions as well, self-selective characteristics were
   revealed in right dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex
   for self-reflection; in anterior cingulate cortex for self-perception
   and in the left inferior parietal lobe for self-reflection and
   -perception.
   Conclusions: Altogether, cingulate, medial and lateral prefrontal,
   insular and inferior parietal regions show relevance for self-related
   cognitions, with in part self-specificity in terms of comparison with
   the known-, unknown- and perception-conditions. Notably, the results are
   obtained here without behavioural response supporting the reliability of
   this methodological approach of applying a solely mental intervention.
   We suggest considering the reported structures when investigating
   psychopathologically affected self-related processing.}},

Abstract = {{Impulsive behavior is thought to reflect a traitlike characteristic that
   can have broad consequences for an individual's success and well-being,
   but its neurobiological basis remains elusive. Although striatal
   dopamine D-2-like receptors have been linked with impulsive behavior and
   behavioral inhibition in rodents, a role for D-2-like receptor function
   in frontostriatal circuits mediating inhibitory control in humans has
   not been shown. We investigated this role in a study of healthy research
   participants who underwent positron emission tomography with the D-2/D-3
   dopamine receptor ligand {[} F-18] fallypride and BOLD fMRI while they
   performed the Stop-signal Task, a test of response inhibition. Striatal
   dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor availability was negatively correlated with
   speed of response inhibition (stopsignal reaction time) and positively
   correlated with inhibition-related fMRI activation in frontostriatal
   neural circuitry. Correlations involving D-2/D-3 receptor availability
   were strongest in the dorsal regions (caudate and putamen) of the
   striatum, consistent with findings of animal studies relating dopamine
   receptors and response inhibition. The results suggest that striatal
   D-2-like receptor function in humans plays a major role in the neural
   circuitry that mediates behavioral control, an ability that is essential
   for adaptive responding and is compromised in a variety of common
   neuropsychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Humans devote 30-40\% of speech output solely to informing others of
   their own subjective experiences. What drives this propensity for
   disclosure? Here, we test recent theories that individuals place high
   subjective value on opportunities to communicate their thoughts and
   feelings to others and that doing so engages neural and cognitive
   mechanisms associated with reward. Five studies provided support for
   this hypothesis. Self-disclosure was strongly associated with increased
   activation in brain regions that form the mesolimbic dopamine system,
   including the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. Moreover,
   individuals were willing to forgo money to disclose about the self. Two
   additional studies demonstrated that these effects stemmed from the
   independent value that individuals placed on self-referential thought
   and on simply sharing information with others. Together, these findings
   suggest that the human tendency to convey information about personal
   experience may arise from the intrinsic value associated with
   self-disclosure.}},

Abstract = {{Though emotions have been shown to have sometimes dramatic effects on
   decision-making, the neural mechanisms mediating these biases are
   relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated how incidental affect (i.e.
   emotional states unrelated to the decision at hand) may influence
   decisions, and how these biases are implemented in the brain. Nineteen
   adult participants made decisions which involved accepting or rejecting
   monetary offers from others in an Ultimatum Game while undergoing
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Prior to each set of
   decisions, participants watched a short video clip aimed at inducing
   either a sad or neutral emotional state. Results demonstrated that, as
   expected, sad participants rejected more unfair offers than those in the
   neutral condition. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that receiving unfair
   offers while in a sad mood elicited activity in brain areas related to
   aversive emotional states and somatosensory integration (anterior
   insula) and to cognitive conflict (anterior cingulate cortex). Sad
   participants also showed a diminished sensitivity in neural regions
   associated with reward processing (ventral striatum). Importantly,
   insular activation uniquely mediated the relationship between sadness
   and decision bias. This study is the first to reveal how subtle mood
   states can be integrated at the neural level to influence
   decision-making. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Because the way we grasp an object varies depending on the intention
   with which the object is grasped, monitoring the properties of

   grasping movements performed with social versus individual intents. The
   results show that activation within the mirror system is stronger during
   the observation of socially intended movements relative to individual
   movements. Moreover, areas that form the mentalizing system are more
   active during social grasping movements. These findings demonstrate
   that, in the absence of context information, social information conveyed
   by action kinematics modulates intention processing, leading to a
   transition from mirroring to mentalizing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Cocaine addiction is characterized by impulsivity, impaired social
   relationships, and abnormal mesocorticolimbic reward processing, but
   their interrelationships relative to stages of cocaine addiction are
   unclear. We assessed blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal in
   ventral and dorsal striatum during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) in current (CCD; n = 30) and former (FCD; n = 28) cocaine
   dependent subjects as well as healthy control (HC; n = 31) subjects
   while playing an interactive competitive Domino game involving
   risk-taking and reward/punishment processing. Out-of-scanner
   impulsivity-related measures were also collected. Although both FCD and
   CCD subjects scored significantly higher on impulsivity-related measures
   than did HC subjects, only FCD subjects had differences in striatal
   activation, specifically showing hypoactivation during their response to
   gains versus losses in right dorsal caudate, a brain region linked to
   habituation, cocaine craving and addiction maintenance. Right caudate
   activity in FCD subjects also correlated negatively with
   impulsivity-related measures of self-reported compulsivity and
   sensitivity to reward. These findings suggest that remitted cocaine
   dependence is associated with striatal dysfunction during social reward
   processing in a manner linked to compulsivity and reward sensitivity
   measures. Future research should investigate the extent to which such
   differences might reflect underlying vulnerabilities linked to
   cocaine-using propensities (e. g., relapses).}},

Title = {{Regional Brain Responses in Nulliparous Women to Emotional Infant
   Stimuli}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Infant cries and facial expressions influence social interactions and
   elicit caretaking behaviors from adults. Recent neuroimaging studies
   suggest that neural responses to infant stimuli involve brain regions
   that process rewards. However, these studies have yet to investigate
   individual differences in tendencies to engage or withdraw from
   motivationally relevant stimuli. To investigate this, we used
   event-related fMRI to scan 17 nulliparous women. Participants were
   presented with novel infant cries of two distress levels (low and high)
   and unknown infant faces of varying affect (happy, sad, and neutral) in
   a randomized, counter-balanced order. Brain activation was subsequently
   correlated with scores on the Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral
   Activation System scale. Infant cries activated bilateral superior and
   middle temporal gyri (STG and MTG) and precentral and postcentral gyri.
   Activation was greater in bilateral temporal cortices for low-relative
   to high-distress cries. Happy relative to neutral faces activated the
   ventral striatum, caudate, ventromedial prefrontal, and orbitofrontal
   cortices. Sad versus neutral faces activated the precuneus, cuneus, and
   posterior cingulate cortex, and behavioral activation drive correlated
   with occipital cortical activations in this contrast. Behavioral
   inhibition correlated with activation in the right STG for high- and
   low-distress cries relative to pink noise. Behavioral drive correlated
   inversely with putamen, caudate, and thalamic activations for the
   comparison of high-distress cries to pink noise. Reward-responsiveness
   correlated with activation in the left precentral gyrus during the
   perception of low-distress cries relative to pink noise. Our findings
   indicate that infant cry stimuli elicit activations in areas implicated
   in auditory processing and social cognition. Happy infant faces may be
   encoded as rewarding, whereas sad faces activate regions associated with
   empathic processing. Differences in motivational tendencies may modulate
   neural responses to infant cues.}},

Abstract = {{Employers often make payment contingent on performance in order to
   motivate workers. We used fMRI with a novel incentivized skill task to
   examine the neural processes underlying behavioral responses to
   performance-based pay. We found that individuals' performance increased
   with increasing incentives; however, very high incentive levels led to
   the paradoxical consequence of worse performance. Between initial
   incentive presentation and task execution, striatal activity rapidly
   switched between activation and deactivation in response to increasing
   incentives. Critically, decrements in performance and striatal
   deactivations were directly predicted by an independent measure of
   behavioral loss aversion. These results suggest that incentives
   associated with successful task performance are initially encoded as a
   potential gain; however, when actually performing a task, individuals
   encode the potential loss that would arise from failure.}},

Title = {{How do we think machines think? An fMRI study of alleged competition
   with an artificial intelligence}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Mentalizing is defined as the inference of mental states of fellow
   humans, and is a particularly important skill for social interactions.
   Here we assessed whether activity in brain areas involved in mentalizing
   is specific to the processing of mental states or can be generalized to
   the inference of non-mental states by comparing brain responses during
   the interaction with an intentional and an artificial agent.
   Participants were scanned using fMRI during interactive
   rock-paper-scissors games while believing their opponent was a fellow
   human (Intentional agent, Int), a humanoid robot endowed with an
   artificial intelligence (Artificial agent, Art), or a computer playing
   randomly (Random agent, Rnd). Participants' subjective reports indicated
   that they adopted different stances against the three agents. The
   contract of brain activity during interaction with the artificial and
   the random agents didn't yield any cluster at the threshold used,
   suggesting the absence of a reproducible stance when interacting with an
   artificial intelligence. We probed response to the artificial agent in
   regions of interest corresponding to clusters found in the contrast
   between the intentional and the random agents. In the precuneus involved
   in working memory, the posterior intraparietal sulcus, in the control of
   attention and the dorsolaterial prefrontal cortex, in executive
   functions, brain activity for Art was larger than for Rnd but lower than
   for Int, supporting the intrinsically engaging nature of social
   interactions. A similar pattern in the left premotor cortex and anterior
   intraparietal sulcus involved in motor resonance suggested that
   participants simulated human, and to a lesser extend humanoid robot
   actions, when playing the game. Finally mentalizing regions, the medial
   prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction, responded to the
   human only, supporting the specificity of mentalizing areas for
   interactions with intentional agents.}},

Title = {{Pavlovian Reward Prediction and Receipt in Schizophrenia: Relationship
   to Anhedonia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Reward processing abnormalities have been implicated in the
   pathophysiology of negative symptoms such as anhedonia and avolition in
   schizophrenia. However, studies examining neural responses to reward
   anticipation and receipt have largely relied on instrumental tasks,
   which may confound reward processing abnormalities with deficits in
   response selection and execution. 25 chronic, medicated outpatients with
   schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging using a Pavlovian reward prediction paradigm with no
   response requirements. Subjects passively viewed cues that predicted
   subsequent receipt of monetary reward or non-reward, and
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal was measured at the time of cue
   presentation and receipt. At the group level, neural responses to both
   reward anticipation and receipt were largely similar between groups. At
   the time of cue presentation, striatal anticipatory responses did not
   differ between patients and controls. Right anterior insula demonstrated
   greater activation for nonreward than reward cues in controls, and for
   reward than nonreward cues in patients. At the time of receipt, robust
   responses to receipt of reward vs. nonreward were seen in striatum,
   midbrain, and frontal cortex in both groups. Furthermore, both groups
   demonstrated responses to unexpected versus expected outcomes in
   cortical areas including bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
   Individual difference analyses in patients revealed an association
   between physical anhedonia and activity in ventral striatum and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex during anticipation of reward, in which
   greater anhedonia severity was associated with reduced activation to
   money versus no-money cues. In ventromedial prefrontal cortex, this
   relationship held among both controls and patients, suggesting a
   relationship between anticipatory activity and anhedonia irrespective of
   diagnosis. These findings suggest that in the absence of response
   requirements, brain responses to reward receipt are largely intact in
   medicated individuals with chronic schizophrenia, while reward
   anticipation responses in left ventral striatum are reduced in those
   patients with greater anhedonia severity.}},

Abstract = {{The primate orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is involved in reward processing,
   learning, and decision making. Research in monkeys has shown that this
   region is densely connected with higher sensory, limbic, and subcortical
   regions. Moreover, a parcellation of the monkey OFC into two
   subdivisions has been suggested based on its intrinsic anatomical
   connections. However, in humans, little is known about any functional
   subdivisions of the OFC except for a rather coarse medial/lateral
   distinction. Here, we used resting-state fMRI in combination with
   unsupervised clustering techniques to investigate whether OFC
   subdivisions can be revealed based on their functional connectivity
   profiles with other brain regions. Examination of different cluster
   solutions provided support for a parcellation into two parts as observed
   in monkeys, but it also highlighted a much finer hierarchical clustering
   of the orbital surface. Specifically, we identified (1) a medial, (2) a
   posterior-central, (3) a central, and (4-6) three lateral clusters
   spanning the anterior-posterior gradient. Consistent with animal tracing
   studies, these OFC clusters were connected to other cortical regions
   such as prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices but also subcortical
   areas in the striatum and the midbrain. These connectivity patterns
   provide important implications for identifying specific functional roles
   of OFC subdivisions for reward processing, learning, and decision
   making. Moreover, this parcellation schema can provide guidance to
   report results in future studies.}},

Title = {{Theory of mind in patients with schizophrenia: Is mentalizing delayed?}},
Journal = {{SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{224-229}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Functional imaging studies have used numerous neurocognitive
   designs to investigate brain activation during theory of mind (ToM)
   tasks in patients with schizophrenia. The majority of studies asks
   participants to retrospectively attribute mental states to others. We
   used a novel animated task to investigate implicit mentalizing online.
   Because behavioral studies have revealed slower ToM performance reaction
   times in patients with schizophrenia, we hypothesized that time would
   influence functional MRI (fMRI) activation patterns also.
   Methods: We applied the ``Moving Shapes{''} paradigm, which involves two
   interacting triangles, to a functional MRI block design and investigated
   the neural activation patterns of 15 patients with schizophrenia and 14
   healthy controls. We additionally analyzed the first and second halves
   of each video separately to assess time-related differences.
   Results: Overall, patients with schizophrenia showed increased
   activation in the inferior and middle frontal gyri, the superior
   temporal gyrus, the precuneus and the cerebellum compared with controls
   during ToM versus non-ToM videos. Most importantly, patients with
   schizophrenia had predominantly increased activation in ToM-related
   brain areas during the second half of the ToM paradigm, whereas the
   activation in areas of the ToM-network in healthy controls occurred
   during the first half of the presentation.
   Conclusions: Our results confirm recent findings of significantly
   stronger neural activations that encompass the fronto-temporo-parietal
   cerebral areas in patients with schizophrenia compared with controls
   during ToM tasks. The observation of slower cognitive processing in
   patients with schizophrenia during mentalizing might explain some of the
   contradictory imaging findings in these patients and have implications
   for cognitive remediation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alcohol abuse and dependence are common problems in the
   United States that stem from a variety of factors, one of which may be a
   period of high level social drinking during college and early adulthood.
   Extant study implicates risk taking as a cognitive factor that
   contributes to habitual and heavy drinking. We sought to examine the
   neural processes of risk taking in young, nondependent drinkers.
   Methods: We compared 20 young adult social drinkers with a high level of
   alcohol use (AH), as defined by number of drinks per month, and 21
   demographically matched drinkers with low to moderate alcohol use (ALM)
   in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of the stop signal
   task. By contrasting risk taking (speeded) to risk aversion (slowed)
   trials, we examined the neural correlates of risk taking. Brain imaging
   data were analyzed with Statistical Parametric Mapping. Regions of
   interest were identified and corresponding effect sizes were examined
   for correlations with self-reported alcohol use. Results: The results
   showed that, compared with ALM, AH demonstrated decreased activation in
   right superior frontal gyrus and left caudate nucleus when contrasting
   risk taking and risk aversion trials at p < 0.001, uncorrected.
   Furthermore, examination of the effect size data showed that the extent
   of these decreased regional activations correlated with frequency of
   drinking in women, but not men. Conclusions: These findings suggest a
   neural analog of nondependent, high level drinking. Specifically, high
   level social drinking is associated with altered activation of the
   caudate and superior frontal cortex, an association that appears to be
   stronger in women than in men and is strongly tied to the frequency of
   drinking. These results are relevant in understanding risk taking
   behavior in social drinking as well as in examining the potential path
   from high level social use in young adults to dangerous alcohol
   consumption later in life.}},

Title = {{From head to toe: Evidence for selective brain activation reflecting
   visual perception of whole individuals}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Our ability to recognize other people's faces and bodies is crucial for
   our social interactions. Previous neuroimaging studies have repeatedly
   demonstrated the existence of brain areas that selectively respond to
   visually presented faces and bodies. In daily life, however, we see
   ``whole{''} people and not just isolated faces and bodies, and the
   question remains of how information from these two categories of stimuli
   is integrated at a neural level. Are faces and bodies merely processed
   independently, or are there neural populations that actually code for
   whole individuals? In the current study we addressed this question using
   a functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation paradigm involving
   the sequential presentation of visual stimuli depicting whole
   individuals. It is known that adaptation effects for a component of a
   stimulus only occur in neural populations that are sensitive to that
   particular component. The design of our experiment allowed us to measure
   adaptation effects occurring when either just the face, just the body,
   or both the face and the body of an individual were repeated. Crucially,
   we found novel evidence for the existence of neural populations in
   fusiform as well as extrastriate regions that showed selective
   adaptation for whole individuals, which could not be merely explained by
   the sum of adaptation for face and body respectively. The functional
   specificity of these neural populations is likely to support fast and
   accurate recognition and integration of information conveyed by both
   faces and bodies. Hence, they can be assumed to play an important role
   for identity as well as emotion recognition in everyday life.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibitory control describes a number of distinct processes. Effortless
   inhibition refers to acts of control that are automatic and reflexive.
   Effortful inhibition refers to voluntary, goal-directed acts of control
   such as response flexibility, interference control, cancellation
   inhibition, and restraint inhibition. Disruptions to a number of
   inhibitory control processes occur as a consequence of childhood
   traumatic brain injury (TBI). This paper reviews the current knowledge
   of inhibition deficits following childhood TB!, and includes an overview
   of the inhibition construct and a discussion of the specific deficits
   shown by children and adolescents with TBI and the factors that mediate
   the expression of these deficits, including injury-related variables and
   the expression of pre- and post-injury attention-deficit/hyperactivity
   disorder. The review illustrates that inhibitory control processes
   differ in terms of measurement, assessment, and neurological
   underpinnings, and also that childhood TBI may selectively disrupt
   particular forms of inhibition. (C) 2011 ISDN. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{The relationship of resting cerebral blood flow and brain activation
   during a social cognition task in adolescents with chronic moderate to

Abstract = {{`Alterations in cerebrovascular function are evident acutely in moderate
   to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), although less is known about
   their chronic effects. Adolescent and adult patients with moderate to
   severe TBI have been reported to demonstrate diffuse activation
   throughout the brain during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Because fMRI is a measure related to blood flow, it is possible
   that any deficits in blood flow may alter activation. An arterial spin
   labeling (ASL) perfusion sequence was performed on seven adolescents
   with chronic moderate to severe TBI and seven typically developing (TD)
   adolescents during the same session in which they had performed a social
   cognition task during fMRI. In the TD group, prefrontal CBF was
   positively related to prefrontal activation and negatively related to
   non-prefrontal, posterior, brain activation. This relationship was not
   seen in the TBI group, who demonstrated a greater positive relationship
   between prefrontal CBF and non-prefrontal activation than the TD group.
   An analysis of CBF data independent of fMRI showed reduced CBF in the
   right non-prefrontal region (p < .055) in the TBI group. To understand
   any role reduced CBF may play in diffuse extra-activation, we then
   related the right non-prefrontal CBF to activation. CBF in the right
   non-prefrontal region in the TD group was positively associated with
   prefrontal activation, suggesting an interactive role of non-prefrontal
   and prefrontal blood flow throughout the right hemisphere in healthy
   brains. However, the TBI group demonstrated a positive association with
   activation constrained to the right non-prefrontal region. These data
   suggest a relationship between impaired non-prefrontal CBF and the
   presence of non-prefrontal extra-activation, where the region with more
   limited blood flow is associated with activation limited to that region.
   In a secondary analysis, pathology associated with hyperintensities on
   T2-weighted FLAIR imaging over the whole brain was related to whole
   brain activation, revealing a negative relationship between lesion
   volume and frontal activation, and a positive relationship between
   lesion volume and posterior activation. These preliminary data, albeit
   collected with small sample sizes, suggest that reduced non-prefrontal
   CBF, and possibly pathological tissue associated with
   T2-hyperintensities, may provide contributions to the diffuse, primarily
   posterior extra-activation observed in adolescents following moderate to
   severe TBI. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of ISDN.}},

Abstract = {{The conditions under which we identify entities as animate agents and
   the neural mechanisms supporting this ability are central questions in
   social neuroscience. Prior studies have focused upon 2 perceptual cues
   for signaling animacy: 1) surface features representing body forms such
   as faces, torsos, and limbs and 2) motion cues associated with
   biological forms. Here, we consider a third cue-the goal-directedness of
   an action. Regions in the social brain network, such as the right
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and fusiform face area (FFA),
   are activated by human-like motion and body form perceptual cues
   signaling animacy. Here, we investigate whether these same brain regions
   are activated by goal-directed motion even when performed by entities
   that lack human-like perceptual cues. We observed an interaction effect
   whereby the presence of either human-like perceptual cues or
   goal-directed actions was sufficient to activate the right pSTS and FFA.
   Only stimuli that lacked human-like perceptual cues and goal-directed
   actions failed to activate the pSTS and FFA at the same level.}},

Abstract = {{Age has been reported to influence amplitude and latency of the P300
   potential. Nevertheless, it is not yet fully understood which brain
   regions are responsible for these effects. The aim of this study was to
   investigate age-effects on the P300 potential and the simultaneously
   acquired BOLD signal of functional MRI. 32 healthy male subjects were
   investigated using an auditory oddball paradigm. The functional fMRI
   data were acquired in temporal synchrony to the task. The evoked
   potential data were recorded during the intervals in between MR image
   acquisitions in order to reduce the influence of the scanner noise on
   the presentation of the tones and to reduce gradient artifacts. The
   age-effects were calculated by means of regression analyses. In
   addition, brain regions modulated by the task-induced amplitude
   variation of the P300 were identified (single trial analysis). The
   results indicated an age effect on the P300 amplitude. Younger subjects
   demonstrated increased parietal P300 amplitudes and increased BOLD
   responses in a network of brain regions including the anterior and
   posterior cingulate cortex, the insula, the temporo-parietal junction,
   the superior temporal gyrus, the caudate body, the amygdala and the
   parahippocampal gyrus. Single trial coupling of EEG and fMRI indicated
   that P300 amplitudes were predominantly associated with neural
   response:; in the anterior cingulate cortex, the putamen and temporal
   brain areas. Taken together, the results indicate diminished neural
   responses in older compared to younger subjects especially in frontal,
   temporo-parietal and subcortical brain regions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Semantic unification, the process by which small blocks of semantic
   information are combined into a coherent utterance, has been studied
   with various types of tasks. However, whether the brain activations
   reported in these studies are attributed to semantic unification per se
   or to other task-induced concomitant processes still remains unclear.
   The neural basis for semantic unification in sentence comprehension was
   examined using event-related potentials (ERP) and functional Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The semantic unification load was manipulated
   by varying the goodness of fit between a critical word and its preceding
   context (in high cloze, low doze and violation sentences). The sentences
   were presented in a serial visual presentation mode. The participants
   were asked to perform one of three tasks: semantic congruency judgment
   (SEM), silent reading for comprehension (READ), or font size judgment
   (FONT), in separate sessions. The ERP results showed a similar N400
   amplitude modulation by the semantic unification load across all of the
   three tasks. The brain activations associated with the semantic
   unification load were found in the anterior left inferior frontal gyrus
   (aLIFG) in the FONT task and in a widespread set of regions in the other
   two tasks. These results suggest that the aLIFG activation reflects a
   semantic unification, which is different from other brain activations
   that may reflect task-specific strategic processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Human communication is based on a dynamic information exchange of the
   communication channels facial expressions, prosody, and speech content.
   This fMRI study elucidated the impact of multimodal emotion processing
   and the specific contribution of each channel on behavioral empathy and
   its prerequisites.
   Ninety-six video clips displaying actors who told self-related stories
   were presented to 27 healthy participants. In two conditions, all
   channels uniformly transported only emotional or neutral information.
   Three conditions selectively presented two emotional channels and one
   neutral channel. Subjects indicated the actors' emotional valence and
   their own while fMRI was recorded.
   Activation patterns of tri-channel emotional communication reflected
   multimodal processing and facilitative effects for empathy. Accordingly,
   subjects' behavioral empathy rates significantly deteriorated once one
   source was neutral. However, emotionality expressed via two of three
   channels yielded activation in a network associated with
   theory-of-mind-processes. This suggested participants' effort to infer
   mental states of their counterparts and was accompanied by a decline of
   behavioral empathy, driven by the participants' emotional responses.
   Channel-specific emotional contributions were present in
   modality-specific areas.
   The identification of different network-nodes associated with human
   interactions constitutes a prerequisite for understanding dynamics that
   underlie multimodal integration and explain the observed decline in
   empathy rates. This task might also shed light on behavioral deficits
   and neural changes that accompany psychiatric diseases. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{To comprehend figurative utterances such as metaphor or sarcasm, a
   listener must both judge the literal meaning of the statement and infer
   the speaker's intended meaning (mentalizing; Amodio and Frith, 2006). To
   delineate the neural substrates of pragmatic comprehension, we conducted
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with 20 normal adult
   volunteers. Participants read short stories followed by a target
   sentence. Depending on the context provided by the preceding stories,
   the target sentences were classified as follows: (1) metaphor versus
   literally coherent; (2) metaphor versus literally incoherent; (3)
   sarcasm versus literally coherent; and (4) sarcasm versus literally
   incoherent. For each task pair, we directly compared the activations
   evoked by the same target sentences in the different contexts. The
   contrast images were incorporated into a 2 (metaphor and sarcasm) x 2
   (literal coherency and incoherency) design. Metaphor-specific activation
   was found in the head of the caudate, which might be involved in
   associating statements with potential meanings, and restricting sentence
   meanings within a set of possible candidates for what the speaker
   intended. Sarcasm-specific activation was found in the left amygdala,
   which is an important component of the neural substrates of social
   behavior. Conjunction analysis revealed that both metaphor and sarcasm
   activated the anterior rostral medial frontal cortex (arMFC), which is a
   key node of mentalizing. A distinct literal coherency effect was found
   in the orbital MFC, which is thought to be involved in monitoring. These
   mesial frontal areas are jointly involved in monitoring literal
   coherency and mentalizing within social contexts in order to comprehend
   the pragmatic meanings of utterances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Srl. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{268-276}},

Abstract = {{Background: Biased causal attribution is a critical factor in the
   cognitive model of depression. Whereas depressed patients interpret
   events negatively, healthy people show a self-serving bias (internal
   attribution of positive events and external attribution of negative
   events).
   Methods: Using fMRI, depressed patients (n = 15) and healthy controls (n
   = 15) were confronted with positive and negative social events and made
   causal attributions (internal vs. external). Functional data were
   analyzed using a mixed effects model.
   Results: Behaviourally, controls showed a self-serving bias, whereas
   patients demonstrated a balanced attributional pattern. Analysis of
   functional data revealed a significant group difference in a
   fronto-temporal network. Higher activation of this network was
   associated with non self-serving attributions in controls but
   self-serving attributions in patients. Applying a psycho-physiological
   interaction analysis, we observed reduced coupling between a dorsomedial
   PFC seed region and limbic areas during self-serving attributions in
   patients compared to controls. Limitations: Results of the PPI analysis
   are preliminary given the liberal statistical threshold.
   Conclusions: The association of the behaviourally less frequent
   attributional pattern with activation in a fronto-temporal network
   suggests that non self-serving responses may produce a self-related
   response conflict in controls, while self-serving responses produce this
   conflict in patients. Moreover, attribution-modulated coupling between
   the dorsomedial PFC and limbic regions was weaker in patients than
   controls. This preliminary finding suggests that depression may be
   associated with disturbances in fronto-limbic coupling during
   attributional decisions. Our results implicate that treatment of major
   depression may benefit from approaches that facilitate reinterpretation
   of emotional events in a more positive, more self-serving way. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The brain seeks to combine related inputs from different senses (e.g.,
   hearing and vision), via multisensory integration. Temporal information
   can indicate whether stimuli in different senses are related or not. A
   recent human fMRI study (Noesselt et al. {[}2007]: J Neurosci
   27:1143111441) used auditory and visual trains of beeps and flashes with
   erratic timing, manipulating whether auditory and visual trains were
   synchronous or unrelated in temporal pattern. A region of superior
   temporal sulcus (STS) showed higher BOLD signal for the synchronous
   condition. But this could not be related to performance, and it remained
   unclear if the erratic, unpredictable nature of the stimulus trains was
   important. Here we compared synchronous audiovisual trains to
   asynchronous trains, while using a behavioral task requiring detection
   of higher-intensity target events in either modality. We further varied
   whether the stimulus trains had predictable temporal pattern or not.
   Synchrony (versus lag) between auditory and visual trains enhanced
   behavioral sensitivity (d') to intensity targets in either modality,
   regardless of predictable versus unpredictable patterning. The analogous
   contrast in fMRI revealed BOLD increases in several brain areas,
   including the left STS region reported by Noesselt et al. {[}2007: J
   Neurosci 27:1143111441]. The synchrony effect on BOLD here correlated
   with the subject-by-subject impact on performance. Predictability of
   temporal pattern did not affect target detection performance or STS
   activity, but did lead to an interaction with audiovisual synchrony for
   BOLD in inferior parietal cortex. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{Processing the vocalizations of conspecifics is critical for adaptive
   social interaction. A species-specific voice-selective region has been
   identified in the right STS that responds more strongly to human vocal
   sounds compared with a variety of nonvocal sounds. However, the STS also
   activates in response to a wide range of signals used in communication,
   such as eye gaze, biological motion, and speech. These findings raise
   the possibility that the voice-selective region of the STS may be
   especially sensitive to vocal sounds that are communicative, rather than
   to all human vocal sounds. Using fMRI, we demonstrate that the
   voice-selective region of the STS responds more strongly to
   communicative vocal sounds (such as speech and laughter) compared with
   non-communicative vocal sounds (such as coughing and sneezing). The
   implications of these results for understanding the role of the STS in
   voice processing and in disorders of social communication, such as
   autism spectrum disorder, are discussed.}},

Title = {{Patients with fibromyalgia display less functional connectivity in the
   brain's pain inhibitory network}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PAIN}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is evidence for augmented processing of pain and
   impaired endogenous pain inhibition in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM). In
   order to fully understand the mechanisms involved in FM pathology, there
   is a need for closer investigation of endogenous pain modulation. In the
   present study, we compared the functional connectivity of the descending
   pain inhibitory network in age-matched FM patients and healthy controls
   (HC). We performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 42
   subjects; 14 healthy and 28 age-matched FM patients (2 patients per HC),
   during randomly presented, subjectively calibrated pressure pain
   stimuli. A seed-based functional connectivity analysis of brain activity
   was performed. The seed coordinates were based on the findings from our
   previous study, comparing the fMRI signal during calibrated pressure
   pain in FM and HC: the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and
   thalamus.
   Results: FM patients required significantly less pressure (kPa) to reach
   calibrated pain at 50 mm on a 0-100 visual analogue scale (p < .001,
   two-tailed). During fMRI scanning, the rACC displayed significantly
   higher connectivity to the amygdala, hippocampus, and brainstem in
   healthy controls, compared to FM patients. There were no regions where
   FM patients showed higher rACC connectivity. Thalamus showed
   significantly higher connectivity to the orbitofrontal cortex in healthy
   controls but no regions showed higher thalamic connectivity in FM
   patients.
   Conclusion: Patients with FM displayed less connectivity within the
   brain's pain inhibitory network during calibrated pressure pain,
   compared to healthy controls. The present study provides brain-imaging
   evidence on how brain regions involved in homeostatic control of pain
   are less connected in FM patients. It is possible that the dysfunction
   of the descending pain modulatory network plays an important role in
   maintenance of FM pain and our results may translate into clinical
   implications by using the functional connectivity of the pain modulatory
   network as an objective measure of pain dysregulation.}},

Title = {{Motivation and Motor Control: Hemispheric Specialization for Approach
   Motivation Reverses with Handedness}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: According to decades of research on affective motivation in
   the human brain, approach motivational states are supported primarily by
   the left hemisphere and avoidance states by the right hemisphere. The
   underlying cause of this specialization, however, has remained unknown.
   Here we conducted a first test of the Sword and Shield Hypothesis (SSH),
   according to which the hemispheric laterality of affective motivation
   depends on the laterality of motor control for the dominant hand (i.e.,
   the ``sword hand,'' used preferentially to perform approach actions) and
   the nondominant hand (i.e., the ``shield hand,'' used preferentially to
   perform avoidance actions).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To determine whether the laterality of
   approach motivation varies with handedness, we measured alpha-band power
   (an inverse index of neural activity) in right- and left-handers during
   resting-state electroencephalography and analyzed hemispheric
   alpha-power asymmetries as a function of the participants' trait
   approach motivational tendencies. Stronger approach motivation was
   associated with more left-hemisphere activity in right-handers, but with
   more right-hemisphere activity in left-handers.
   Conclusions: The hemispheric correlates of approach motivation reversed
   between right- and left-handers, consistent with the way they typically
   use their dominant and nondominant hands to perform approach and
   avoidance actions. In both right- and left-handers, approach motivation
   was lateralized to the same hemisphere that controls the dominant hand.
   This covariation between neural systems for action and emotion provides
   initial support for the SSH.}},

Title = {{The Impact of Social Disparity on Prefrontal Function in Childhood}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{The prefrontal cortex (PFC) develops from birth through late
   adolescence. This extended developmental trajectory provides many
   opportunities for experience to shape the structure and function of the
   PFC. To date, a few studies have reported links between parental
   socioeconomic status (SES) and prefrontal function in childhood, raising
   the possibility that aspects of environment associated with SES impact
   prefrontal function. Considering that behavioral measures of prefrontal
   function are associated with learning across multiple domains, this is
   an important area of investigation. In this study, we used fMRI to
   replicate previous findings, demonstrating an association between
   parental SES and PFC function during childhood. In addition, we present
   two hypothetical mechanisms by which SES could come to affect PFC
   function of this association: language environment and stress
   reactivity. We measured language use in the home environment and change
   in salivary cortisol before and after fMRI scanning. Complexity of
   family language, but not the child's own language use, was associated
   with both parental SES and PFC activation. Change in salivary cortisol
   was also associated with both SES and PFC activation. These observed
   associations emphasize the importance of both enrichment and
   adversity-reduction interventions in creating good developmental
   environments for all children.}},

Abstract = {{The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) including the anterior cingulate
   sulcus is implicated in both decision-making and social cognition,
   suggesting that this area may play a central role in decision-making
   based on social context. In the present study, neural activity was
   recorded from the monkey anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) while the
   monkeys chose one of two identical figures based on the choice
   previously made by a robot arm. Monkeys observed that the robot touched
   one of the two figures in the left or right side of a touch screen.
   Every time the robot chose the correct option, the same pair appeared on
   another touch screen for the monkey. Then, the monkey had to touch the
   figure in the same side to obtain reward. Neuronal responses were
   compared by one-way ANOVA among 17 intervals distributed in 4 phases:
   baseline before the trial, observation phase (robot arm choices and
   feedback signals), inter-phase interval (between observation and
   following execution phases), and execution phase (monkeys choices and
   associated outcomes). Of 264 neurons recorded, 164 (62.12\%) responded
   in one or more intervals of the task. Of these, 16 responded during the
   observation-phase, 5 during the inter-phase interval, 98 during the
   execution-phase and 18 on both observation and execution phases.
   Furthermore, neuronal activity of 69 (26.14\%) neurons during action
   observation was correlated with that during real action (execution).
   This type of neurons might correspond to mirror neurons. The results
   indicated that the ACC processes information about self and others
   actions and outcomes, which may support social-based decision-making.

Abstract = {{A sizeable number of studies have implicated the default network (e. g.,
   medial prefrontal and parietal cortices) in tasks that require
   participants to infer the mental states of others (i.e., to mentalize).
   Parallel research has demonstrated that default network function
   declines over the lifespan, suggesting that older adults may show
   impairments in social-cognitive tasks that require mentalizing. Older
   and younger human adults were scanned using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging while performing three different social-cognitive
   tasks. Across three mentalizing paradigms, younger and older adults
   viewed animated shapes in brief social vignettes, stories about a
   person's moral actions, and false belief stories. Consistent with
   predictions, older adults responded less accurately to stories about
   others' false beliefs and made less use of actors' intentions to judge
   the moral permissibility of behavior. These impairments in performance
   during social-cognitive tasks were accompanied by age-related decreases
   across all three paradigms in the BOLD response of a single brain
   region, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest
   specific task-independent age-related deficits in mentalizing that are
   localizable to changes in circumscribed subregions of the default
   network.}},

Abstract = {{Since false belief reasoning requires mental state representation
   independently of the state of reality, it is seen as a key ability in
   Theory of Mind (ToM). Although true beliefs do not have to be processed
   independently of the state of reality, growing behavioural evidence
   indicates that true belief reasoning is different from just reasoning
   about the state of reality. So far, neural studies on true and false
   belief reasoning revealed inconsistent findings in the medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) and in the right temporo-parietal junction (R-TPJ), brain
   regions that are hypothesized to play an important role in ToM. To
   further explore true and false belief reasoning, the present functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in eighteen adult subjects used
   methodological refinements such as ensuring that the true belief trials
   did not elicit false belief reasoning, as well as including paralleled
   control conditions requiring reasoning about the state of reality. When
   compared to its control condition, common R-TPJ activity was observed
   for true and false belief reasoning, supporting its role in belief
   reasoning in general, and indicating that, at least in adults, also true
   belief reasoning appears to be different from reasoning about the state
   of reality. Differential activity was observed in a broad network of
   brain regions such as the MPFC, the inferior frontal cortex, and the
   precuneus. False over true belief reasoning induced activation in the
   posterior MPFC (pMPFC), supporting its role in the decoupling
   mechanisms, which is defined as processing a mental state independently
   of the state of reality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on memory retrieval suggest a reactivation of cortical regions
   engaged during encoding, such that visual or auditory areas reactivate
   for visual or auditory memories. The content specificity and any emotion
   dependency of such reactivations are still unclear. Because distinct
   visual areas are specialized in processing distinct stimulus categories,
   we tested for face and word specific reactivations during a memory task
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Furthermore, because
   visual processing and memory are both modulated by emotion, we compared
   reactivation for stimuli encoded in a neutral or emotionally significant
   context. In the learning phase, participants studied pairs of stimuli
   that consisted of either a scene and a face, or a scene and a word.
   Scenes were either neutral or negative, but did not contain faces or
   words. In the test phase scenes were presented alone (one in turn), and
   participants indicated whether it was previously paired with a face, a
   word, or was new. Results from the test phase showed activation in a
   functionally defined face-responsive region in the right fusiform gyrus,
   as well as in a word-responsive region in the left inferior temporal
   gyrus, for scenes previously paired with faces and words, respectively.
   Reactivation tended to be larger in both the face- and word-responsive
   regions when the associated scene was negative as compared to neutral.
   However, relative to neutral context, the recall of faces and words
   paired with a negative context produced smaller activations in brain
   regions associated with social and semantic processing, respectively, as
   well as poorer memory performance overall. Taken together, these results
   support the idea of cortical memory reactivations, even at a
   content-specific level, and further suggest that emotional context may
   produce opposite effects on reactivations in early sensory areas and
   more elaborate processing in higher-level cortical areas. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Even more than in cognitive research applications, moving fMRI to the
   clinic and the drug development process requires the generation of
   stable and reliable signal changes. The performance characteristics of
   the fMRI paradigm constrain experimental power and may require different
   study designs (e.g., crossover vs. parallel groups), yet fMRI
   reliability characteristics can be strongly dependent on the nature of
   the fMRI task. The present study investigated both within-subject and
   group-level reliability of a combined three-task fMRI battery targeting
   three systems of wide applicability in clinical and cognitive
   neuroscience: an emotional (face matching), a motivational (monetary
   reward anticipation) and a cognitive (n-back working memory) task. A
   group of 25 young, healthy volunteers were scanned twice on a 3 T MRI
   scanner with a mean test-retest interval of 14.6 days. FMRI reliability
   was quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
   applied at three different levels ranging from a global to a localized
   and fine spatial scale: (1) reliability of group-level activation maps
   over the whole brain and within targeted regions of interest (ROIs); (2)
   within-subject reliability of ROI-mean amplitudes and (3) within-subject
   reliability of individual voxels in the target ROIs. Results showed
   robust evoked activation of all three tasks in their respective target
   regions (emotional task = amygdala; motivational task = ventral
   striatum; cognitive task = right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
   parietal cortices) with high effect sizes (ES) of ROI-mean summary
   values (ES = 1.11-1.44 for the faces task, 0.96-1.43 for the reward
   task, 0.83-2.58 for the n-back task). Reliability of group level
   activation was excellent for all three tasks with ICCs of 0.89-0.98 at
   the whole brain level and 0.66-0.97 within target ROIs. Within-subject
   reliability of ROI-mean amplitudes across sessions was fair to good for
   the reward task (ICCs = 0.56-0.62) and, dependent on the particular ROI,
   also fair-to-good for the n-back task (ICCs = 0.44-0.57) but lower for
   the faces task (ICC = -0.02-0.16). In conclusion, all three tasks are
   well suited to between-subject designs, including imaging genetics. When
   specific recommendations are followed, the n-back and reward task are
   also suited for within-subject designs, including pharmaco-fMRI. The
   present study provides task-specific fMRI reliability performance
   measures that will inform the optimal use, powering and design of fMRI
   studies using comparable tasks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The current research explored the neural mechanisms linking social
   status to perceptions of the social world. Two fMRI studies provide
   converging evidence that individuals lower in social status are more
   likely to engage neural circuitry often involved in `mentalizing' or
   thinking about others' thoughts and feelings. Study 1 found that college
   students' perception of their social status in the university community
   was related to neural activity in the mentalizing network (e.g., DMPFC,
   MPFC, precuneus/PCC) while encoding social information, with lower
   social status predicting greater neural activity in this network. Study
   2 demonstrated that socioeconomic status, an objective indicator of
   global standing, predicted adolescents' neural activity during the
   processing of threatening faces, with individuals lower in social status
   displaying greater activity in the DMPFC, previously associated with
   mentalizing, and the amygdala, previously associated with
   emotion/salience processing. These studies demonstrate that social
   status is fundamentally and neurocognitively linked to how people
   process and navigate their social worlds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1902-1912}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Two major influences on how the brain processes music are maturational
   development and active musical training. Previous functional
   neuroimaging studies investigating music processing have typically
   focused on either categorical differences between ``musicians versus
   nonmusicians{''} or ``children versus adults.{''} In the present study,
   we explored a cross-sectional data set (n = 84) using multiple linear
   regression to isolate the performance-independent effects of age (5 to
   33 years) and cumulative duration of musical training (0 to 21,000
   practice hours) on fMRI activation similarities and differences between
   melodic discrimination (MD) and rhythmic discrimination (RD).
   Age-related effects common to MD and RD were present in three left
   hemisphere regions: temporofrontal junction, ventral premotor cortex,
   and the inferior part of the intraparietal sulcus, regions involved in
   active attending to auditory rhythms, sensorimotor integration, and
   working memory transformations of pitch and rhythmic patterns. By
   contrast, training-related effects common to MD and RD were localized to
   the posterior portion of the left superior temporal gyrus/planum
   temporale, an area implicated in spectrotemporal pattern matching and
   auditory-motor coordinate transformations. A single cluster in right
   superior temporal gyrus showed significantly greater activation during
   MD than RD. This is the first fMRI which has distinguished maturational
   from training effects during music processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Dissociating Object Directed and Non-Object Directed Action in the Human
   Mirror System; Implications for Theories of Motor Simulation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{APR 10}},
Abstract = {{Mirror neurons are single cells found in macaque premotor and parietal
   cortices that are active during action execution and observation. In
   non-human primates, mirror neurons have only been found in relation to
   object-directed movements or communicative gestures, as non-object
   directed actions of the upper limb are not well characterized in
   non-human primates. Mirror neurons provide important evidence for motor
   simulation theories of cognition, sometimes referred to as the direct
   matching hypothesis, which propose that observed actions are mapped onto
   associated motor schemata in a direct and automatic manner. This study,
   for the first time, directly compares mirror responses, defined as the
   overlap between action execution and observation, during object directed
   and meaningless non-object directed actions. We present functional MRI
   data that demonstrate a clear dissociation between object directed and
   non-object directed actions within the human mirror system. A premotor
   and parietal network was preferentially active during object directed
   actions, whether observed or executed. Moreover, we report spatially
   correlated activity across multiple voxels for observation and execution
   of an object directed action. In contrast to predictions made by motor
   simulation theory, no similar activity was observed for non-object
   directed actions. These data demonstrate that object directed and
   meaningless non-object directed actions are subserved by different
   neuronal networks and that the human mirror response is significantly
   greater for object directed actions. These data have important
   implications for understanding the human mirror system and for
   simulation theories of motor cognition. Subsequent theories of motor
   simulation must account for these differences, possibly by acknowledging
   the role of experience in modulating the mirror response.}},

Title = {{Characterizing Acupuncture Stimuli Using Brain Imaging with fMRI - A
   Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Literature}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: The mechanisms of action underlying acupuncture, including
   acupuncture point specificity, are not well understood. In the previous
   decade, an increasing number of studies have applied fMRI to investigate
   brain response to acupuncture stimulation. Our aim was to provide a
   systematic overview of acupuncture fMRI research considering the
   following aspects: 1) differences between verum and sham acupuncture, 2)
   differences due to various methods of acupuncture manipulation, 3)
   differences between patients and healthy volunteers, 4) differences
   between different acupuncture points.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We systematically searched English,
   Chinese, Korean and Japanese databases for literature published from the
   earliest available up until September 2009, without any language
   restrictions. We included all studies using fMRI to investigate the
   effect of acupuncture on the human brain (at least one group that
   received needle-based acupuncture). 779 papers were identified, 149 met
   the inclusion criteria for the descriptive analysis, and 34 were
   eligible for the meta-analyses. From a descriptive perspective, multiple
   studies reported that acupuncture modulates activity within specific
   brain areas, including somatosensory cortices, limbic system, basal
   ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. Meta-analyses for verum acupuncture
   stimuli confirmed brain activity within many of the regions mentioned
   above. Differences between verum and sham acupuncture were noted in
   brain response in middle cingulate, while some heterogeneity was noted
   for other regions depending on how such meta-analyses were performed,
   such as sensorimotor cortices, limbic regions, and cerebellum.
   Conclusions: Brain response to acupuncture stimuli encompasses a broad
   network of regions consistent with not just somatosensory, but also
   affective and cognitive processing. While the results were
   heterogeneous, from a descriptive perspective most studies suggest that
   acupuncture can modulate the activity within specific brain areas, and
   the evidence based on meta-analyses confirmed some of these results.
   More high quality studies with more transparent methodology are needed
   to improve the consistency amongst different studies.}},

Title = {{Embodied empathy for tactile events: Interindividual differences and

Abstract = {{A growing body of evidence suggests an involvement of the somatosensory
   cortices for social perception. For example, it has been shown that
   observing touch on other bodies (in the absence of any real touch on the
   own body) affects somatosensory brain areas. Thus, understanding others'
   sensory experiences seems to rely on vicarious activation of
   somatosensory cortices. Recent studies also demonstrated that
   observation of painful and nonpainful touch engages the observer's
   somatosensory cortex differentially. The somatosensory activation during
   observation of painful stimulation has been related to trait differences
   in empathy, thereby drawing the attention to inter-individual
   differences in vicarious somatosensory activation. The current study
   aims to test the hypothesis if vicarious somatosensory activation during
   observation of nonpainful touch is also linked to inter-individual
   differences in empathy. We employed a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) paradigm to present video clips showing simple
   non-painful touch with a paintbrush to a hand relative to a control
   condition including the same visual and motion parts. Results revealed
   vicarious somatosensory activation when seeing the hand being touched.
   This activation was associated with trait differences in interpersonal
   reactivity. Thus, we found that the somatosensory response in primary
   somatosensory cortex (SI) was associated with the empathy subscale
   perspective taking. This link demonstrates that vicarious somatosensory
   responses for simple touch are influenced by the observer's personality
   traits, therefore suggesting a role for personality traits in a putative
   mirror neuron system. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the visual word recognition literature, it is well understood that
   various stimulus effects interact with behavioral task. For example,
   effects of word frequency are exaggerated and effects of
   spelling-to-sound regularity are reduced in the lexical decision task,
   relative to reading aloud. Neuroimaging studies of reading often examine
   effects of task and stimulus properties on brain activity independently,
   but potential interactions between task demands and stimulus effects
   have not been extensively explored. To address this issue, we conducted
   lexical decision and symbol detection tasks using stimuli that varied
   parametrically in their word-likeness, and tested for task by stimulus
   class interactions. Interactions were found throughout the reading
   system, such that stimulus selectivity was observed during the lexical
   decision task, but not during the symbol detection task. Further, the
   pattern of stimulus selectivity was directly related to task difficulty,
   so that the strongest brain activity was observed to the most word-like
   stimuli that required ``no{''} responses, whereas brain activity to
   words, which elicit rapid and accurate ``yes{''} responses were
   relatively weak. This is in line with models that argue for
   task-dependent specialization of brain regions, and contrasts with the
   notion of task-independent stimulus selectivity in the reading system.

Title = {{An exponential random graph modeling approach to creating group-based

Abstract = {{Group-based brain connectivity networks have great appeal for
   researchers interested in gaining further insight into complex brain
   function and how it changes across different mental states and disease
   conditions. Accurately constructing these networks presents a daunting
   challenge given the difficulties associated with accounting for
   inter-subject topological variability. Viable approaches to this task
   must engender networks that capture the constitutive topological
   properties of the group of subjects' networks that it is aiming to
   represent. The conventional approach has been to use a mean or median
   correlation network (Achard et al., 2006; Song et al., 2009; Zuo et al.,
   2011) to embody a group of networks. However, the degree to which their
   topological properties conform with those of the groups that they are
   purported to represent has yet to be explored. Here we investigate the
   performance of these mean and median correlation networks. We also
   propose an alternative approach based on an exponential random graph
   modeling framework and compare its performance to that of the
   aforementioned conventional approach. Simpson et al. (2011) illustrated
   the utility of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) for creating
   brain networks that capture the topological characteristics of a single
   subject's brain network. However, their advantageousness in the context
   of producing a brain network that ``represents{''} a group of brain
   networks has yet to be examined. Here we show that our proposed ERGM
   approach outperforms the conventional mean and median correlation based
   approaches and provides an accurate and flexible method for constructing
   group-based representative brain networks. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The investigation of self-reflective processing during adolescence is
   relevant, as this period is characterized by deep reorganization of the
   self-concept. It may be the case that an atypical development of brain
   regions underlying self-reflective processing increases the risk for
   psychological disorders and impaired social functioning. In this study,
   we investigated the neural bases of self- and other-related processing
   in typically developing adolescents and youths with 22q11.2 deletion
   syndrome (22q11DS), a rare neurogenetic condition associated with
   difficulties in social interactions and increased risk for
   schizophrenia. The fMRI paradigm consisted in judging if a series of
   adjectives applied to the participant himself/herself (self), to his/her
   best friend or to a fictional character (Harry Potter). In control
   adolescents, we observed that self- and other-related processing
   elicited strong activation in cortical midline structures (CMS) when
   contrasted with a semantic baseline condition. 22q11DS exhibited
   hypoactivation in the CMS and the striatum during the processing of
   self-related information when compared to the control group. Finally,
   the hypoactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex was associated with
   the severity of prodromal positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The
   findings are discussed in a developmental framework and in light of
   their implication for the development of schizophrenia in this at-risk
   population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The brain's default network (DN) is comprised of several cortical
   regions demonstrating robust intrinsic connectivity at rest. The authors
   sought to examine the differential effects of emotional reasoning and
   reasoning under certainty upon the DN through the employment of an
   event-related fMRI design in healthy participants. Participants were
   presented with syllogistic arguments which were organized into a 2 x 2
   factorial design in which the first factor was emotional salience and
   the second factor was certainty/uncertainty. We demonstrate that regions
   of the DN were activated both during reasoning that is emotionally
   salient and during reasoning which is more certain, suggesting that
   these processes are neurally instantiated on a network level. In
   addition, we present evidence that emotional reasoning preferentially
   activates the dorsomedial (dMPFC) subsystem of the DN, whereas reasoning
   in the context of certainty activates areas specific to the DN's medial
   temporal (MTL) subsystem. We postulate that emotional reasoning
   mobilizes the dMPFC subsystem of the DN because this type of reasoning
   relies upon the recruitment of introspective and self-relevant data such
   as personal bias and temperament. In contrast, activation of the MTL
   subsystem during certainty argues that this form of reasoning involves
   the recruitment of mnemonic and semantic associations to derive
   conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies on moral decision-making have thus far largely
   focused on differences between moral judgments with opposing utilitarian
   (well-being maximizing) and deontological (duty-based) content. However,
   these studies have investigated moral dilemmas involving extreme
   situations, and did not control for two distinct dimensions of moral
   judgment: whether or not it is intuitive (immediately compelling to most
   people) and whether it is utilitarian or deontological in content. By
   contrasting dilemmas where utilitarian judgments are counterintuitive
   with dilemmas in which they are intuitive, we were able to use
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the neural correlates
   of intuitive and counterintuitive judgments across a range of moral
   situations. Irrespective of content (utilitarian/deontological),
   counterintuitive moral judgments were associated with greater difficulty
   and with activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting
   that such judgments may involve emotional conflict; intuitive judgments
   were linked to activation in the visual and premotor cortex. In
   addition, we obtained evidence that neural differences in moral judgment
   in such dilemmas are largely due to whether they are intuitive and not,
   as previously assumed, to differences between utilitarian and
   deontological judgments. Our findings therefore do not support theories
   that have generally associated utilitarian and deontological judgments

Abstract = {{Acute stress has been shown to impair working memory (WM), and to
   decrease prefrontal activation during WM in healthy humans. Stress also
   enhances amygdala responses towards emotional stimuli. Stress might thus
   be specifically detrimental to WM when one is distracted by emotional
   stimuli. Usually, emotional stimuli presented as distracters in a WM
   task slow down performance, while evoking more activation in ventral
   `affective' brain areas, and a relative deactivation in dorsal
   `executive' areas. We hypothesized that after acute social stress, this
   reciprocal dorsal-ventral pattern would be shifted towards greater
   increase of ventral `affective' activation during emotional distraction,
   while impairing WM performance. To investigate this, 34 healthy men,
   randomly assigned to a social stress or control condition, performed a
   Sternberg WM task with emotional and neutral distracters inside an MRI
   scanner. Results showed that WM performance after stress tended to be
   slower during emotional distraction. Brain activations during emotional
   distraction was enhanced in ventral affective areas, while dorsal
   executive areas tended to show less deactivation after stress. These
   results suggest that acute stress shifts priority towards processing of
   emotionally significant stimuli, at the cost of WM performance.}},

Abstract = {{The reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) relates individual
   differences in reward sensitivity to the activation of the behavioral
   approach system (BAS). Dopamine-related brain structures have been
   repeatedly associated with reward processing, but also with cognitive
   processes such as task switching. In the present study, we examined the
   association between reward sensitivity and the event-related fMRI BOLD
   response with set switching in 31 males. As expected, the right inferior
   frontal cortex (rIFG) and the striatum (i.e. the left putamen) were
   involved in set-switching activity for the overall sample.
   Interindividual differences in Gray's reward sensitivity were related to
   stronger activity in the rIFG and the ventral striatum. Thus, trait
   reward sensitivity contributed to the modulation of brain responsiveness
   in set-switching tasks. Having considered previous research, we propose
   that higher BAS activity is associated with a stronger reward to process
   a better implementation of goal-directed tasks and the diminished
   processing of secondary cues.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately reading the body language of others may be vital for
   navigating the social world, and this ability may be influenced by
   factors, such as our gender, personality characteristics and
   neurocognitive processes. This fMRI study examined the brain activation
   of 26 healthy individuals (14 women and 12 men) while they judged the
   action performed or the emotion felt by stick figure characters
   appearing in different postures. In both tasks, participants activated
   areas associated with visual representation of the body, motion
   processing and emotion recognition. Behaviorally, participants
   demonstrated greater ease in judging the physical actions of the
   characters compared to judging their emotional states, and participants
   showed more activation in areas associated with emotion processing in
   the emotion detection task, whereas they showed more activation in
   visual, spatial and action-related areas in the physical action task.
   Gender differences emerged in brain responses, such that men showed
   greater activation than women in the left dorsal premotor cortex in both
   tasks. Finally, participants higher in self-reported empathy
   demonstrated greater activation in areas associated with
   self-referential processing and emotion interpretation. These results
   suggest that empathy levels and sex of the participant may affect neural
   responses to emotional body language.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research indicates gender differences in the impact of stress on
   decision behavior, but little is known about the brain mechanisms
   involved in these gender-specific stress effects. The current study used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine whether
   induced stress resulted in gender-specific patterns of brain activation
   during a decision task involving monetary reward. Specifically, we
   manipulated physiological stress levels using a cold pressor task, prior
   to a risky decision making task. Healthy men (n = 24, 12 stressed) and
   women (n = 23, 11 stressed) completed the decision task after either
   cold pressor stress or a control task during the period of cortisol
   response to the cold pressor. Gender differences in behavior were
   present in stressed participants but not controls, such that stress led
   to greater reward collection and faster decision speed in males but less
   reward collection and slower decision speed in females. A
   gender-by-stress interaction was observed for the dorsal striatum and
   anterior insula. With cold stress, activation in these regions was
   increased in males but decreased in females. The findings of this study
   indicate that the impact of stress on reward-related decision processing
   differs depending on gender.}},

Abstract = {{Video games are an exciting part of new media. Although game play has
   been intensively studied, the underlying neurobiology is still poorly
   understood. Flow theory is a well-established model developed to
   describe subjective game experience. In 13 healthy male subjects, we
   acquired fMRI data during free play of a video game and analyzed brain
   activity based on the game content. In accordance with flow theory, we
   extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance
   between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii)
   direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control
   over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by
   specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be
   assessed-at least partially-by content factors contributing to the
   emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by
   specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing
   reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and
   sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in
   the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for
   flow experience. Flow factors can be validated with functional brain
   imaging which can improve the understanding of human emotions and
   motivational processes during media entertainment.}},

Abstract = {{It is increasingly clear that simple decisions are made by computing
   decision values for the options under consideration, and then comparing
   these values to make a choice. Computational models of this process
   suggest that it involves the accumulation of information over time, but
   little is known about the temporal course of valuation in the brain. To
   examine this, we manipulated the available decision time and observed
   the consequences in the brain and behavioral correlates of choice.
   Participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging
   while they chose to eat or not eat basic food items, in two conditions
   differing in the amount of time provided for choice. After identifying
   valuation-related regions with unbiased whole-brain general linear
   models, we analyzed two regions of interest: ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (VMPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Finite
   impulse response models of the upsampled estimated neural activity from
   those regions allowed us to examine the onset, duration and termination
   of decision value signals, and to compare across regions. We found
   evidence for the immediate onset of value computation in both regions,
   but an extended duration with longer decision time. However, this was
   not accompanied by behavioral changes in either the accuracy or
   determinants of choice. Finally, there was modest evidence that DLPFC
   computation correlated with, but lagged behind, VMPFC computation,
   suggesting the sharing of information across these regions. These
   findings have important implications for models of decision value
   computation and choice.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. One of the most difficult dilemmas in relationship science
   and couple therapy concerns the interaction between sexual desire and
   love. As two mental states of intense longing for union with others,
   sexual desire and love are, in fact, often difficult to disentangle from
   one another.
   Aim. The present review aims to help understand the differences and
   similarities between these two mental states using a comprehensive
   statistical meta-analyses of all functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) studies on sexual desire and love.
   Methods. Systematic retrospective review of pertinent neuroimaging
   literature.
   Main Outcome Measures. Review of published literature on fMRI studies
   illustrating brain regions associated with love and sexual desire to
   date.
   Results. Sexual desire and love not only show differences but also
   recruit a striking common set of brain areas that mediate somatosensory
   integration, reward expectation, and social cognition. More precisely, a
   significant posteriorto- anterior insular pattern appears to track
   sexual desire and love progressively.
   Conclusions. This specific pattern of activation suggests that love
   builds upon a neural circuit for emotions and pleasure, adding regions
   associated with reward expectancy, habit formation, and feature
   detection. In particular, the shared activation within the insula, with
   a posterior-to-anterior pattern, from desire to love, suggests that love
   grows out of and is a more abstract representation of the pleasant
   sensorimotor experiences that characterize desire. From these results,
   one may consider desire and love on a spectrum that evolves from
   integrative representations of affective visceral sensations to an
   ultimate representation of feelings incorporating mechanisms of reward
   expectancy and habit learning. Cacioppo S, Bianchi-Demicheli F, Frum C,

Abstract = {{Given the relevance of leadership in organizational life, we designed an
   exploratory study to assess the neural mechanisms involved in memories
   of interactions with resonant and dissonant leaders (a follower-centric
   study). Subjects in advanced professional roles were asked about
   previous incidents with both types of leaders, and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were then conducted with cues developed
   from these recollections. Recalling experiences with resonant leaders
   activated neural areas such as the bilateral insula, right inferior
   parietal lobe, and left superior temporal gyms; regions associated with
   the mirror neuron system, default mode or social network, and positive
   affect. Recalling experiences with dissonant leaders negatively
   activated the right anterior cingulate cortex and activated the right
   inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral posterior region of the inferior
   frontal gyrus, and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus/insula; regions
   associated with the mirror neuron system and related to avoidance,
   narrowed attention, decreased compassion, and negative emotions. (c)

Abstract = {{Individuals learn associations between alcohol's sensory properties and
   intoxication, with such conditioned stimuli (CS) becoming involved in
   craving and relapse. However, these CS also carry idiosyncratic
   associations.
   This study aimed to test brain responses to novel CS conditioned with
   alcohol intoxication.
   Fourteen heavy drinkers (age 24.9 +/- 3.2) performed a reaction time
   task with embedded novel geometric CS and were told only that the task
   was to measure alcohol's effect on speed. Rapid intravenous alcohol
   infusion (the unconditioned stimulus; UCS) began with the appearance of
   a CS+, using pharmacokinetic modeling to increment breath alcohol by
   similar to 18 mg\% in 200 s per each of six CS-UCS pairings.
   Placebo-saline infusion with CS- used the same infusion parameters in
   same-day randomized/counterbalanced sessions. The next morning subjects,
   connected to inactive intravenous pumps, underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) of the same task with mixed brief presentations
   of CS+, CS-, and irrelevant CS and were told that alcohol could be
   infused at any time during imaging.
   CS- responses were significantly greater than those of CS+ in medial
   frontal cortex. Notably, CS+ responses were negative, suggesting reduced
   neural activity. Negative activity was most pronounced in early scans,
   extinguishing with time. As subjects were told that alcohol could be
   administered in fMRI, a CS+ without alcohol is similar to a negative
   prediction error, with associated reduced frontal activity during
   withheld reward.
   Novel stimuli relatively free of demand characteristics can be
   classically conditioned to intermittent brain exposure of even low
   alcohol concentrations, permitting imaging studies of conditioned
   alcohol expectancies.}},

Title = {{Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Activation During Emotional Anticipation
   and Neuropsychological Performance in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{Context: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with
   executive or attentional dysfunction and problems in emotion processing.
   However, it is unclear whether these two domains of dysfunction are
   related to common or distinct neurophysiological substrates.
   Objective: To examine the hypothesis that greater neuropsychological
   impairment in PTSD relates to greater disruption in
   prefrontal-subcortical networks during emotional anticipation.
   Design: Case-control, cross-sectional study.
   Setting: General community and hospital and community psychiatric
   clinics.
   Participants: Volunteer sample of 37 women with PTSD related to intimate
   partner violence and 34 age-comparable healthy control women.
   Main Outcome Measures: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to examine neural responses during anticipation of negative and
   positive emotional images. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale was
   used to characterize PTSD symptom severity. The Wechsler Adult
   Intelligence Scale, Third Edition, Digit Symbol Test, Delis-Kaplan
   Executive Function System Color-Word Interference Test, and Wisconsin
   Card Sorting Test were used to characterize neuropsychological
   performance.
   Results: Women with PTSD performed worse on complex visuomotor
   processing speed (Digit Symbol Test) and executive function (Color-Word
   Interference Inhibition/Switching subtest) measures compared with
   control subjects. Posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with
   greater anterior insula and attenuated lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   activation during emotional anticipation. Greater dorsolateral PFC
   activation (anticipation of negative images minus anticipation of
   positive images) was associated with lower PTSD symptom severity and
   better visuomotor processing speed and executive functioning. Greater
   medial PFC and amygdala activation related to slower visuomotor
   processing speed.
   Conclusions: During emotional anticipation, women with PTSD show
   exaggerated activation in the anterior insula, a region important for
   monitoring internal bodily state. Greater dorsolateral PFC response in
   PTSD patients during emotional anticipation may reflect engagement of
   cognitive control networks that are beneficial for emotional and
   cognitive functioning. Novel treatments could be aimed at strengthening
   the balance between cognitive control (dorsolateral PFC) and affective
   processing (medial PFC and amygdala) networks to improve overall
   functioning for PTSD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Humans and other primates are adept at using the direction of another's
   gaze or head turn to infer where that individual is attending. Research
   in macaque neurophysiology suggests that anterior superior temporal
   sulcus (STS) contains a direction-sensitive code for such social
   attention cues. By contrast, most human functional Magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) studies report that posterior STS is responsive to social
   attention cues. It is unclear whether this functional discrepancy is
   caused by a species difference or by experimental design differences.
   Furthermore, social attention cues are dynamic in naturalistic social
   interaction, but most studies to date have been restricted to static
   displays. In order to address these issues, we used multivariate pattern
   analysis of fMRI data to test whether response patterns in human right
   STS distinguish between leftward and rightward dynamic head turns. Such
   head turn discrimination was observed in right anterior STS/superior
   temporal gyrus (STG). Response patterns in this region were also
   significantly more discriminable for head turn direction than for
   rotation direction in physically matched ellipsoid control stimuli. Our
   findings suggest a role for right anterior STS/STG in coding the
   direction of motion in dynamic social attention cues.}},

Abstract = {{How do we understand and empathize with individuals whose bodies are
   drastically different from our own? We investigated the neural processes
   by which an individual with a radically different body, a congenital
   amputee who is born without limbs, engages her own sensory-motor
   representations as a means to understand other people's body actions or
   emotional states. Our results support the prediction that when the goal
   of the action is possible for the observer, one's own motor regions are
   involved in processing action observation, just as when individuals
   viewed those similar to themselves. However, when the observed actions
   are not possible, mentalizing mechanisms, relying on a different set of
   neural structures, are additionally recruited to process the actions.
   Furthermore, our results indicate that when individuals view others
   experiencing pain in body parts that they have, the insula and
   somatosensory cortices are activated, consistent with previous reports.
   However, when an individual views others experiencing pain in body parts
   that she does not have, the insula and secondary somatosensory cortices
   are still active, but the primary somatosensory cortices are not. These
   results provide a novel understanding for how we understand and
   empathize with individuals who drastically differ from the self.}},

Abstract = {{Social interaction is a coregulated coupling activity that involves at
   least 2 autonomous agents. Numerous methodological and technical
   challenges impede the production of natural social interaction within an
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging environment under controlled conditions. To
   overcome the obstacle, we chose a simple format of social interaction,
   namely ``interactive imitation{''} through a double-video system. We
   registered blood oxygen level-dependent activity of 23 participants
   during 2 imitative conditions: free (F) and instructed (I) episodes of
   imitating (i) and of being imitated (bi). In addition to the areas
   classically reported in instructed imitation tasks, 2 activation
   patterns were found, which differentiate the subconditions. Firstly,
   brain areas involved during decisional and attentional processes
   (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , dorsal part of anterior cingulate
   gyrus {[}dACC], pre-SMA) were activated during all conditions except for
   instructed imitation-classically used in neuroimaging studies of
   imitation. Second, a greater activation in dACC and insula combined with
   an increased deactivation in the default mode network was observed when
   subjects were imitated compared with when they imitated. We suggest that
   these 2 patterns reflect the anticipation of the other's behavior and
   the engagement with others required by social interaction.}},

Abstract = {{The neural mechanisms supporting social bonds between adult men remain
   uncertain. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we
   investigate the impact of intranasally administered oxytocin (OT) and
   vasopressin (AVP) on behavior and brain activity among men in the
   context of an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game, which models a real-life
   social situation. fMRI results show that, relative to both AVP and
   placebo, OT increases the caudate nucleus response to reciprocated
   cooperation, which may augment the reward of reciprocated cooperation
   and/or facilitate learning that another person can be trusted. OT also
   enhances left amygdala activation in response to reciprocated
   cooperation. Behaviorally, OT was associated with increased rates of
   cooperation following unreciprocated cooperation in the previous round
   compared with AVP. AVP strongly increased cooperation in response to a
   cooperative gesture by the partner compared with both placebo and OT. In
   response to reciprocated cooperation, AVP increased activation in a
   region spanning known vasopressin circuitry implicated in affiliative
   behaviors in other species. Finally, both OT and AVP increase amygdala
   functional connectivity with the anterior insula relative to placebo,
   which may increase the amygdala's ability to elicit visceral somatic
   markers that guide decision making. These findings extend our knowledge
   of the neural and behavioral effects of OT and AVP to the context of
   genuine social interactions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and social
   anxiety disorder are among the most prevalent and frequently
   co-occurring psychiatric disorders in adults and may be characterized by
   a common deficiency in processing of emotional information.
   Methods: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging during the
   performance of an emotional word encoding and recognition paradigm in
   patients with MDD (n = 51), comorbid MDD and anxiety (n = 59), panic
   disorder and/or social anxiety disorder without comorbid MDD (n = 56),
   and control subjects (n = 49). In addition, we studied effects of
   illness severity, regional brain volume, and antidepressant use.
   Results: Patients with MDD, prevalent anxiety disorders, or both showed
   a common hyporesponse in the right hippocampus during positive (>
   neutral) word encoding compared with control subjects. During negative
   encoding, increased insular activation was observed in both depressed
   groups (MDD and MDD + anxiety), whereas increased amygdala and anterior
   cingulate cortex activation during positive word encoding were observed
   as depressive state-dependent effects in MDD only. During recognition,
   anxiety patients showed increased inferior frontal gyrus activation.
   Overall, effects were unaffected by medication use and regional brain
   volume.
   Conclusions: Hippocampal blunting during positive word encoding is a
   generic effect in depression and anxiety disorders, which may constitute
   a common vulnerability factor. Increased insular and amygdalar
   involvement during negative word encoding may underlie heightened
   experience of, and an inability to disengage from, negative emotions in
   depressive disorders. Our results emphasize a common neurobiological
   deficiency in both MDD and anxiety disorders, which may mark a general
   insensitiveness to positive information.}},

Abstract = {{This fMRI study investigated phonological vs. auditory temporal
   processing in developmental dyslexia by means of a German vowel length
   discrimination paradigm (Groth, Lachmann, Riecker, Muthmann, \&
   Steinbrink, 2011). Behavioral and fMRI data were collected from
   dyslexics and controls while performing same-different judgments of
   vowel duration in two experimental conditions. In the temporal, but not
   in the phonological condition, hemodynamic brain activation was observed
   bilaterally within the anterior insular cortices in both groups and
   within the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in controls, indicating
   that the left IFG and the anterior insular cortices are part of a neural
   network involved in temporal auditory processing. Group subtraction
   analyses did not demonstrate significant effects. However, in a subgroup
   analysis, participants performing low in the temporal condition (all
   dyslexic) showed decreased activation of the insular cortices and the
   left IFG, suggesting that this processing network might form the neural
   basis of temporal auditory processing deficits in dyslexia. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Emblematic (or symbolic) gestures allow individuals to convey a variety
   of thoughts and emotions ranging from approval to hostility. The use of
   such gestures involves the execution of a codified motor act by the
   addresser and its perception and decoding by the addressee. To examine
   underlying common and distinct neural correlates, we used fMRI tasks in
   which subjects viewed video clips of emblematic one-hand gestures. They
   were asked to (1) take the perspective of the addresser and imagine
   executing the gestures (expression condition), and to (2) take the
   perspective of the addressee and imagine being confronted with the
   gestures (reception condition). Common areas of activation were found in
   inferior frontal, medial frontal, and posterior temporal cortices with
   left-hemispheric predominance as well as in the cerebellum. The
   distinction between regions specifically involved in the expression or
   reception condition partly resembled the dorsal and ventral stream
   dichotomy of visual processing with junctions in inferior frontal and
   medial prefrontal cortices. Imagery of gesture expression involved the
   dorsal visual stream as well as higher-order motor areas. In contrast,
   gesture reception encompassed regions related to semantic processing,
   and medial prefrontal areas known to be involved in the process of
   understanding the intentions of others. In conclusion, our results
   provide evidence for a dissociation in representations of emblematic
   gesture processing between addresser and addressee in addition to shared
   components in language-related areas. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{Previous studies of the BOLD response in the injured brain have revealed
   neural recruitment relative to controls during working memory tasks in
   several brain regions, most consistently the right prefrontal cortex and
   anterior cingulate cortices. We previously proposed that the recruitment
   observed in this literature represents auxiliary support resources, and
   that recruitment of PFC is not abnormal or injury specific and should
   reduce as novelty and challenge decrease. The current study directly
   tests this hypothesis in the context of practice of a working memory
   task. It was hypothesized that individuals with brain injury would
   demonstrate recruitment of previously indicated regions, behavioral
   improvement following task practice, and a reduction in the BOLD signal
   in recruited regions after practice. Individuals with traumatic brain
   injury and healthy controls performed the n-back during fMRI
   acquisition, practiced each task out of the scanner, and returned to the
   scanner for additional fMRI n-back acquisition. Statistical parametric
   maps demonstrated a number of regions of recruitment in the 1-back in
   individuals with brain injury and a number of corresponding regions of
   reduced activation in individuals with brain injury following practice
   in both the 1-back and 2-back. Regions of interest demonstrated reduced
   activation following practice, including the anterior cingulate and
   right prefrontal cortices. Individuals with brain injury demonstrated
   modest behavioral improvements following practice. These findings
   suggest that neural recruitment in brain injury does not represent
   reorganization but a natural extension of latent mechanisms that engage
   transiently and are contingent upon cerebral challenge. Hum Brain Mapp,

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{70-81}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is a multidimensional construct composed of several components
   such as emotion recognition, emotional perspective taking and affective
   responsiveness. Even though patients with schizophrenia demonstrate
   deficits in all core components of this basic social ability, the neural
   underpinnings of these dysfunctions are less clear.
   Using fMRI, we analyzed data from 15 patients meeting the DSM-IV
   criteria for schizophrenia and 15 matched healthy volunteers performing
   three separate paradigms tapping the core components of empathy, i.e.
   emotion recognition, perspective taking and affective responsiveness.
   Behavioral data analysis indicated a significant empathic deficit in
   patients, reflected in worse performance in all three domains. Analysis
   of functional data revealed hypoactivation in a fronto-temporo-parietal
   network including the amygdala in patients. Moreover, amygdala
   activation correlated negatively with severity of negative symptoms.
   The results suggest that schizophrenia patients not only suffer from a
   broad range of emotional deficits but also show cortical and subcortical
   abnormalities, extending previous findings on fronto-temporal cortical
   dysfunctions. Since empathy is related to psychosocial functioning and
   hence of high clinical relevance in schizophrenia, a more detailed
   understanding of the exact nature of these impairments is mandatory. (C)

Abstract = {{The discovery of mirror neurons-neurons that code specific actions both
   when executed and observed-in area F5 of the macaque provides a
   potential neural mechanism underlying action understanding. To date,
   neuroimaging evidence for similar coding of specific actions across the
   visual and motor modalities in human ventral premotor cortex (PMv)-the
   putative homologue of macaque F5-is limited to the case of actions
   observed from a first-person perspective. However, it is the
   third-person perspective that figures centrally in our understanding of
   the actions and intentions of others. To address this gap in the
   literature, we scanned participants with fMRI while they viewed two
   actions from either a first- or third-person perspective during some
   trials and executed the same actions during other trials. Using
   multivoxel pattern analysis, we found action-specific cross-modal
   visual-motor representations in PMv for the first-person but not for the
   third-person perspective. Additional analyses showed no evidence for
   spatial or attentional differences across the two perspective
   conditions. In contrast, more posterior areas in the parietal and
   occipitotemporal cortex did show cross-modal coding regardless of
   perspective. These findings point to a stronger role for these latter
   regions, relative to PMv, in supporting the understanding of others'
   actions with reference to one's own actions.}},

Abstract = {{Independent component analysis (ICA) - the theory of mixed, independent,

   of this research field is that independent subspace analysis (ISA) - the
   extension of the ICA problem, where groups of sources are independent -
   can be solved by traditional ICA followed by grouping the ICA
   components. The conjecture, called ISA separation principle, (i) has
   been rigorously proven for some distribution types recently, (ii) forms
   the basis of the state-of-the-art ISA solvers, (iii) enables one to
   estimate the unknown number and the dimensions of the sources
   efficiently, and (iv) can be extended to generalizations of the ISA
   task, such as different linear-, controlled-, post nonlinear-, complex
   valued-, partially observed problems, as well as to problems dealing

Abstract = {{The laterality index (LI) is often applied in functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to determine functional hemispheric
   lateralization. A difficulty in using conventional LI methods lies in
   ensuring a legitimate computing procedure with a clear rationale.
   Another problem with LI is dealing with outliers and noise. We propose a
   method called AveLI that follows a simple and unbiased computational
   principle using all voxel t-values within regions of interest (ROIs).
   This method first computes subordinate Lis (sub-Lis) using each of the
   task-related positive voxel t-values in the ROIs as the threshold as
   follows: sub-LI = (Lt - Rt)/(Lt + Rt), where Lt and Rt are the sums of
   the t-values at and above the threshold in the left and right ROIs,
   respectively. The AveLI is the average of those sub-Lis and indicates
   how consistently lateralized the performance of the subject is across
   the full range of voxel t-value thresholds. Its intrinsic weighting of
   higher t-value voxels in a data-driven manner helps to reduce noise
   effects. The resistance against outliers is demonstrated using a
   simulation. We applied the AveLI as well as other ``non-thresholding{''}
   and ``thresholding{''} LI methods to two language tasks using
   participants with right- and left-hand preferences. The AveLI showed a
   moderate index value among 10 examined indices. The rank orders of the
   participants did not vary between indices. AveLI provides an index that
   is not only comprehensible but also highly resistant to outliers and to
   noise, and it has a high reproducibility between tasks and the ability
   to categorize functional lateralization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Do we care about the powerless third? An ERP study of the three-person
   ultimatum game}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have provided increasing insights into the factors
   affecting economic decision-making. Little is known about how these
   factors influence decisions that also bear consequences for other
   people. We examined whether decisions that also affected a third,
   passive player modulate the behavioral and neural responses to monetary
   offers in a modified version of the three-person ultimatum game. We
   aimed to elucidate to what extent social preferences affect early
   neuronal processing when subjects were evaluating offers that were fair
   or unfair to themselves, to the third player, or to both. As an
   event-related potential (ERP) index for early evaluation processes in
   economic decision-making, we recorded the medial frontal negativity
   (MFN) component in response to such offers. Unfair offers were rejected
   more often than equitable ones, in particular when negatively affecting
   the subject. While the MFN amplitude was higher following unfair as
   compared to fair offers to the subject, MFN amplitude was not modulated
   by the shares assigned to the third, passive player. Furthermore,
   rejection rates and MFN amplitudes following fair offers were positively
   correlated, as subjects showing lower MFN amplitudes following fair
   offers tended to reject unfair offers more oftenbut only if those offers
   negatively affected their own payoff. Altogether, the rejection behavior
   suggests that humans mainly care about a powerless third when they are
   confronted with inequality as well. The correlation between rejection
   rates and the MFN amplitude supports the notion that this ERP component
   is also modulated by positive events and highlights how our expectations
   concerning other humans' behavior guide our own decisions. However,
   social preferences like inequality aversion and concern for the
   well-being of others are not reflected in this early neuronal response,
   but seem to result from later, deliberate and higher-order cognitive
   processes.}},

Title = {{Pregabalin effects on neural response to emotional faces}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Pregabalin has shown promise in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
   Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indicate
   agents used to treat anxiety, e.g., SSRIs and benzodiazepines, attenuate
   amygdala, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation during
   emotional processing. Our prior study has shown that during anticipation
   of an emotional stimulus, pregabalin attenuates amygdala and insula
   activation but increases medial PFC activation. In this study, we
   examined whether, similar to SSRIs and benzodiazepines, pregabalin
   attenuates amygdala, insula, and medial PFC during emotional face
   processing. Sixteen healthy volunteers underwent a double-blind
   within-subjects fMRI study investigating effects of placebo, 50 mg, and
   200 mg pregabalin on neural activation during an emotional face-matching
   task. Linear mixed model analysis revealed that pregabalin
   dose-dependently attenuated left amygdala activation during fearful
   face-matching and left anterior insula activation during angry
   face-matching. The 50 mg dose exhibited more robust effects than the 200
   mg dose in the right anterior insula and ventral ACC. Thus, pregabalin
   shares some similarity to SSRIs and benzodiazepines in attenuating anger
   and fear-related insula and amygdala activation during emotional face
   processing. However, there is evidence that a subclinical 50 mg dose of
   pregabalin produced more robust and widespread effects on neural
   responses in this paradigm than the more clinically relevant 200 mg
   dose. Taken together, pregabalin has a slightly different effect on
   brain activation as it relates to anticipation and emotional face
   processing, which may account for its unique characteristic as an agent
   for the treatment of anxiety disorders.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4260-4270}},

Abstract = {{We compared brain structure and function in two subgroups of 21 stroke
   patients with either moderate or severe chronic speech comprehension
   impairment. Both groups had damage to the supratemporal plane; however,
   the severe group suffered greater damage to two unimodal auditory areas:
   primary auditory cortex and the planum temporale. The effects of this
   damage were investigated using fMRI while patients listened to speech
   and speech-like sounds. Pronounced changes in connectivity were found in
   both groups in undamaged parts of the auditory hierarchy. Compared to
   controls, moderate patients had significantly stronger feedback
   connections from planum temporale to primary auditory cortex
   bilaterally, while in severe patients this connection was significantly
   weaker in the undamaged right hemisphere. This suggests that predictive
   feedback mechanisms compensate in moderately affected patients but not
   in severely affected patients. The key pathomechanism in humans with
   persistent speech comprehension impairments may be impaired feedback
   connectivity to unimodal auditory areas.}},

   mechanisms}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1444}},
Pages = {{55-64}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive control is required to regulate conflict between relevant and
   irrelevant information. Although previous neuroimaging studies have
   focused on response conflict, recent studies suggested that distinct
   neural networks are recruited in regulating perceptual conflict. The aim
   of the current study was to distinguish between brain areas involved in
   detecting and regulating perceptual conflict using a conflict adjustment
   paradigm. The Stroop color-matching task was combined with an arrow
   version of the Stroop task in order to independently manipulate
   perceptual and response conflicts. Behavioral results showed that
   post-conflict adjustment for perceptual and response conflicts were
   independent from each other. Imaging results demonstrated that the
   caudal portion of the dorsal cingulate cortex (cdACC) was selectively
   associated with the occurrence of perceptual conflict, whereas the left
   dorsal portion of the premotor cortex (pre-PMd) was selectively
   associated with both preceding and current perceptual conflict trials.
   Furthermore, the rostral portion of the dorsal cingulate cortex (rdACC)
   was selectively linked with response conflict, whereas the left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was selectively involved in both
   preceding and current response conflict trials. We suggest that cdAcc is
   involved in detecting perceptual conflict and left pre-PMd is involved
   in regulating perceptual conflict, which is analogous to the recruitment
   of rdACC and left DLPFC in control processes for response conflict. Our
   findings provide support for the hypothesis that multiple independent
   monitor-controller loops are implemented in the frontal cognitive
   control system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity and sequencing of movements
   in schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: Abnormal execution of several movements in a sequence is a
   frequent finding in schizophrenia. Successful performance of such motor
   acts requires correct integration of cortico-subcortical processes,
   particularly those related to cerebellar functions. Abnormal
   connectivity between cortical and cerebellar regions with resulting
   cognitive dysmetria has been proposed as the core dysfunction behind
   many signs and symptoms of schizophrenia. The aim of the present study
   was to assess if these proposed abnormalities in connectivity are a
   unifying feature of schizophrenia, or, rather, reflect a specific
   symptom domain of a heterogeneous disease. We predicted that abnormal
   functional connectivity between the motor cortex and cerebellum would be
   linked with abnormal performance of movement sequencing.
   Methods: We examined 24 schizophrenia patients (SCH) and 24 age-, sex-,
   and handedness-matched healthy controls (HC) using fMRI during a
   modified finger-tapping task. The ability to perform movement sequencing
   was tested using the Neurological Evaluation Scale (NES). The subjects
   were categorized into two groups, with (SQ+) and without (SQ-) movement
   sequencing abnormalities, according to the NES-SQ score. The effects of
   diagnosis and movement sequencing abnormalities on the functional
   connectivity parameters between the motor cortex and cerebellum
   (MC-CRBL) and the supplementary motor cortex and cerebellum (SMA-CRBL)
   activated during the motor task were analyzed.
   Results: We found no effect of diagnosis on the functional connectivity
   measures. There was, however, a significant effect on the SQ group: SQ +
   patients showed a lower level of MC-CRBL connectivity than SQ- patients
   and healthy controls. Moreover, the level of MC-CRBL and SMA-CRBL
   negatively correlated with the magnitude of NES-SQ abnormalities, but
   with no other NES domain.
   Conclusions: Abnormal cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity during
   the execution of a motor task is linked with movement sequencing
   abnormalities in schizophrenia, but not with the diagnosis of
   schizophrenia per se. It seems that specific patterns of inter-regional
   connectivity are linked with corresponding signs and symptoms of
   clinically heterogeneous conditions such as schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{With tasks involving action concept comprehension, many fMRI studies
   have reported brain activations in sensori-motor regions specific to
   effectors of the referent action. There is relatively less evidence
   whether such activations reflect early semantic access or late
   conceptual re-processing. Here we recorded event-related potentials when
   participants recognized noun-verb pairs. For Congruent pairs, the verb
   was the one most commonly associated with the noun (e.g.,
   football-kick). Compared with a control condition, verbs in Congruent
   pairs showed priming effects in the time windows of 100-150 ms and
   210-260 ms. Such activation seems to be specific to body part but not
   other aspects of the action as similar priming effect was also found
   when the noun and verb involved different actions though sharing the
   same body part (e.g., football-jump), documenting for the first time the
   early activation of body part representations in action concept
   comprehension. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Human social exchange is often characterized by conflicts of interest
   requiring strategic behavior for their resolution. To investigate the
   development of the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying strategic
   behavior, we studied children's decisions while they played two types of
   economic exchange games with differing demands of strategic behavior. We
   show an increase of strategic behavior with age, which could not be
   explained by age-related changes in social preferences but instead by
   developmental differences in impulsivity and associated brain functions
   of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore,
   observed differences in cortical thickness of IDLPFC were predictive of
   differences in impulsivity and strategic behavior irrespective of age.
   We conclude that egoistic behavior in younger children is not caused by
   a lack of understanding right or wrong, but by the inability to
   implement behavioral control when tempted to act selfishly; a function
   relying on brain regions maturing only late in ontogeny.}},

Abstract = {{The neural basis of action understanding in humans remains disputed,
   with some research implicating the putative mirror neuron system (MNS)
   and some a mentalizing system (MZS) for inferring mental states. The
   basis for this dispute may be that action understanding is a
   heterogeneous construct: actions can be understood from sensory
   information about body movements or from language about action, and with
   the goal of understanding the implementation ({''}how{''}) or motive
   ({''}why{''}) of an action. Although extant research implicates the MNS
   in understanding implementation and the MZS in understanding motive, it
   remains unknown to what extent these systems subserve modality-specific
   or supramodal functions in action understanding. While undergoing fMRI,
   21 volunteers considered the implementation ({''}How is she doing
   it?{''}) and motive ({''}Why is she doing it?{''}) for actions presented
   in video or text. Bilateral parietal and right frontal areas of the MNS
   showed a modality-specific association with perceiving actions in
   videos, while left-hemisphere MNS showed a supramodal association with
   understanding implementation. Largely left-hemisphere MZS showed a
   supramodal association with understanding motive; however, connectivity
   among the MZS and MNS during the inference of motive was modality
   specific, being significantly stronger when motive was understood from
   actions in videos compared to text. These results support a tripartite
   model of MNS and MZS contributions to action understanding, where
   distinct areas of the MNS contribute to action perception
   ({''}perceiving what{''}) and the representation of action
   implementation ({''}knowing how{''}), while the MZS supports an
   abstract, modality-independent representation of the mental states that
   explain action performance ({''}knowing why{''}).}},

Abstract = {{We used the five weeks leading up to the 2008 presidential election as a
   backdrop to examine the ways that the brain processes attitudes and
   beliefs under different circumstances. We examined individual
   differences in personal issue importance and trait perspective-taking,
   as well as the temporal context in which attitude representation took
   place (i.e. number of days until the election). Finally, we examined the
   extent to which similar or dissimilar processes were recruited when
   considering the attitudes of political ingroup and outgroup candidates.
   Brain regions involved in social cognition and theory of mind, and to a
   lesser extent the limbic system, were modulated by these factors. Higher
   issue importance led to greater recruitment of neural regions involved
   in social cognition, across target perspectives. Higher trait
   perspective-taking was also associated with greater recruitment of
   several regions involved in social cognition, but differed depending on
   target perspective; greater activity was observed in prefrontal regions
   associated with social cognition when considering the perspective of
   one's own candidate compared with the opponent, and this effect was
   amplified closer to the election. Taken together, these results
   highlight ways in which ability and motivational relevance modulate
   socio-affective processing of the attitudes of others.}},

Abstract = {{Sacred values, such as those associated with religious or ethnic
   identity, underlie many important individual and group decisions in
   life, and individuals typically resist attempts to trade off their
   sacred values in exchange for material benefits. Deontological theory
   suggests that sacred values are processed based on rights and wrongs
   irrespective of outcomes, while utilitarian theory suggests that they
   are processed based on costs and benefits of potential outcomes, but
   which mode of processing an individual naturally uses is unknown. The
   study of decisions over sacred values is difficult because outcomes
   cannot typically be realized in a laboratory, and hence little is known
   about the neural representation and processing of sacred values. We used
   an experimental paradigm that used integrity as a proxy for sacredness
   and which paid real money to induce individuals to sell their personal
   values. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found
   that values that people refused to sell (sacred values) were associated
   with increased activity in the left temporoparietal junction and
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, regions previously associated with
   semantic rule retrieval. This suggests that sacred values affect
   behaviour through the retrieval and processing of deontic rules and not
   through a utilitarian evaluation of costs and benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Using fMRI, the present study compares the brain activation underlying
   false belief thinking induced by pictorial, nonverbal material to that
   instigated by strong non-factive verbs in a sample of adult Chinese
   speakers. These verbs obligatorily negate their complements which
   describe the mind content of the sentence agent, and thus may activate
   part of the false belief network. Some previous studies have shown a
   behavioral correlation between verb non-factivity/false complementation
   and conventional false belief but corresponding neural evidence is
   lacking. Our results showed that the non-factive grammar and false
   belief commonly implicated the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ),
   which had been shown by past studies to play a role in general
   mentalizing. Regions that were unique to nonverbal false belief were the
   left TPJ and right middle frontal gyrus (MFG), whereas the unique
   regions for the non-factive grammar were the left inferior frontal gyrus
   (IFG) and right superior temporal gyrus (STG). Hence, conventional
   nonverbal false belief and verb non-factivity have both shared and
   unique neural representations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The present behavioral study investigated the influence of negative

   conflict resolution, comprising specific attentional and motor control
   processes. On each task trial, target stimuli were preceded by a face
   stimulus exhibiting a fearful, sad, or neutral expression, providing
   three affect conditions. Our data provides strong evidence for

Abstract = {{In sentencing guilty defendants, jurors and judges weigh `mitigating
   circumstances', which create sympathy for a defendant. Here we use
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure neural activity in
   ordinary citizens who are potential jurors, as they decide on mitigation
   of punishment for murder. We found that sympathy activated regions
   associated with mentalising and moral conflict (dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex, precuneus and temporo-parietal junction). Sentencing also
   activated precuneus and anterior cingulate cortex, suggesting that
   mitigation is based on negative affective responses to murder, sympathy
   for mitigating circumstances and cognitive control to choose numerical
   punishments. Individual differences on the inclination to mitigate, the
   sentence reduction per unit of judged sympathy, correlated with activity
   in the right middle insula, an area known to represent interoception of
   visceral states. These results could help the legal system understand
   how potential jurors actually decide, and contribute to growing
   knowledge about whether emotion and cognition are integrated sensibly in
   difficult judgments.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation plays a crucial role in adaptive functioning and
   mounting evidence suggests that some emotion regulation strategies are
   often more effective than others. However, little attention has been
   paid to the different ways emotions can be generated: from the
   `bottom-up' (in response to inherently emotional perceptual properties
   of the stimulus) or `top-down' (in response to cognitive evaluations).
   Based on a process priming principle, we hypothesized that mode of
   emotion generation would interact with subsequent emotion regulation.
   Specifically, we predicted that top-down emotions would be more
   successfully regulated by a top-down regulation strategy than bottom-up
   emotions. To test this hypothesis, we induced bottom-up and top-down
   emotions, and asked participants to decrease the negative impact of
   these emotions using cognitive reappraisal. We observed the predicted
   interaction between generation and regulation in two measures of
   emotional responding. As measured by self-reported affect, cognitive
   reappraisal was more successful on top-down generated emotions than
   bottom-up generated emotions. Neurally, reappraisal of bottom-up
   generated emotions resulted in a paradoxical increase of amygdala
   activity. This interaction between mode of emotion generation and
   subsequent regulation should be taken into account when comparing of the
   efficacy of different types of emotion regulation, as well as when
   reappraisal is used to treat different types of clinical disorders.}},

   elicited by stimuli embedded in a sequence of contextual stimuli with an

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with low self-esteem have been found to react more
   negatively to signs of interpersonal rejection than those with high
   self-esteem. However, previous research has found that individual
   differences in attentional control can attenuate negative reactions to
   social rejection among vulnerable, low self-esteem individuals. The
   current fMRI study sought to elucidate the neurobiological substrate of
   this buffering effect. We hypothesized and found that while looking at
   scenes of social rejection (vs negative scenes) low self-esteem high
   attentional control individuals engaged the rostral anterior cingulate
   cortex (rACC), an area of the brain associated with emotional control,
   more than their low self-esteem low attentional control peers.
   Furthermore, we found that low self-esteem high attentional control
   individuals evaluated social rejection as less arousing and less
   rejecting in a separate behavioral task. Importantly, activation in the
   rACC fully mediated the relationship between the interaction of
   self-esteem and attentional control and emotional evaluations,
   suggesting that the rACC activation underlies the buffering effects of
   attentional control. Results are discussed in terms of individual
   differences in emotional vulnerability and protection and by
   highlighting the role of rACC in emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Among a range of cognitive functions of the amygdala, recent studies
   suggest its involvement in identification of the pupil size. To further
   address its role, we investigated the response of the amygdala to human
   and cat faces with varied pupil size, taking into account the effect of
   the gender and subjective attractiveness ratings. Twenty-seven subjects
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing faces with
   large and small pupils. Large pupil faces induced increased activation
   in the amygdala, without interactions with either subject or stimuli
   gender, although no equivalent activation differences were seen for cat
   face stimuli. The activation differences were irrespective of the
   perceived attractiveness, and without explicit knowledge about the
   manipulation of the pupil size. These data support the idea that the
   amygdala is responsive not only to explicit or implicit fear, abhorrence
   or preference, but also to other elements that might suggest heightened
   vigilance of biologically relevant stimuli, which does not necessarily
   require subjective awareness.}},

Abstract = {{The current study takes a new approach to understand the neural systems

   research has inferred emotional influences on judgment from
   disadvantageous judgments or non-random individual differences. The
   current study manipulated the influence of emotional information on
   judgments of stimuli that were equivocally composed of positive and
   negative attributes. Emotion-congruent processing was operationalized in
   two ways: neural activation significantly associated with primes that
   lead to emotionally congruent judgments and neural activation
   significantly associated with judgments that were preceded by
   emotionally congruent primes. Distinct regions of medial orbitofrontal
   cortex were associated with these patterns of emotion-congruent
   processing. Judgments that were incongruent with preceding primes were
   associated with dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex and lateral orbitofrontal cortex activity. The current study
   demonstrates a new approach to investigate the neural systems associated
   with emotion-congruent judgment. The findings suggest that medial OFC

Abstract = {{The increasing popularity of functional neuroimaging technologies in
   multiple disciplines has gained attention from within and outside the
   field of neuroscience. As the scope of research employing functional
   neuroimaging technologies broadens, there appears to also be a growing
   concern about the use of these technologies and the related social,
   ethical and legal issues. These concerns have been coined
   `neuroskepticism'. First, we review how the term neuroskepticism has
   been previously used and defined. Second, we examine review and
   commentary articles published in journals with top impact factors,
   probing the presence and evolution of neuroskepticism within these
   articles. Results demonstrate a wide, but expected, range of issues
   associated with functional neuroimaging. It also appears that
   neuroskepticism is increasing as functional neuroimaging technologies
   gain popularity, which may indicate the presence of a classic Gartner

   mg in low consumers (Experiment 1) and peaking at 400 mg in high
   consumers (Experiment 2). In both cases, covariate analyses demonstrated
   that arousal state mediated the relationship between caffeine
   consumption and the detection and repair of complex global errors.
   Detection and repair rates for the other 3 error types were not affected
   by caffeine consumption. Taken together, we demonstrate that caffeine
   has differential effects on error detection and repair as a function of
   dose and error type, and this relationship is closely tied to caffeine's
   effects on subjective arousal state. These results support the notion
   that central nervous system stimulants may enhance global processing of
   language-based materials and suggest that such effects may originate in
   caffeine-related right hemisphere brain processes. Implications for
   understanding the relationships between caffeine consumption and
   real-world cognitive functioning are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{First impressions profoundly influence our attitudes and behavior toward
   others. However, little is known about whether and to what degree the
   cognitive processes that underlie impression formation depend on the
   domain of the available information about the target person. To
   investigate the neural bases of the influence of verbal as compared to
   nonverbal information on interpersonal judgments, we identified brain
   regions where the BOLD signal parametrically increased with increasing
   strength of evaluation based on either short text vignettes or mimic and
   gestural behavior. While for verbal stimuli the increasing strength of
   subjective evaluation was correlated with increased neural activation of
   precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PC/PCC), a similar effect was
   observed for nonverbal stimuli in the amygdala. These findings support
   the assumption that qualitatively different cognitive operations
   underlie person evaluation depending upon the stimulus domain: while the
   processing of nonverbal person information may be more strongly
   associated with affective processing as indexed by recruitment of the
   amygdala. verbal person information engaged the PC/PCC that has been
   related to social inferential processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Pages = {{230-240}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Numerical processing has been demonstrated to be subserved typically by
   the brain regions around the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The
   goal of the current study was to investigate whether the processing of
   mathematical terms shared the same brain regions with numerical
   processing. Healthy adult participants performed semantic distance
   judgment tasks on five types of materials, including geometric terms,
   algebraic terms, linguistic terms, words for tools and other common
   objects, and Arabic numbers. Brain activation was measured with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results showed that
   geometric terms had greater activation than algebraic terms, linguistic
   terms and tool words in the horizontal IPS, but algebraic terms did not
   have greater activation than linguistic terms and tool words in this
   region. Arabic numbers showed greater activation than non-number
   materials (including geometric terms, algebraic terms, linguistic terms
   and tool words) in the bilateral IPS, right inferior frontal gyrus and
   bilateral middle frontal gyrus, but the non-number materials showed
   stronger activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle
   temporal gyrus. These results suggest that the brain area for the
   processing of numbers (the left IPS) seems to be involved in semantic
   processing of geometric terms, but not that of other mathematical terms
   such as algebraic terms. Both algebraic and geometric terms share
   similar brain organization with basic semantic processing in the left
   temporal and frontal regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   choices in the experimental game according to the degree of strategic
   reasoning so that we can identify the neural substrates of different
   levels of strategizing. We found a correlation between levels of
   strategic reasoning and activity in a neural network related to
   mentalizing, i.e. the ability to think about other's thoughts and mental
   states. Moreover, brain data showed how complex cognitive processes
   subserve the higher level of reasoning about others. We describe how a

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Background: During the postpartum period, some women might be under a
   considerable amount of stress and at increased risk for onset or
   exacerbation of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Little is known
   about the stress response correlates during the postpartum period and in
   patients with OCD. This study aimed to examine the cerebral, psychologic
   and endocrine correlates of the stress response in patients with OCD and
   during the postpartum period. Methods: Women with postpartum OCD,
   healthy postpartum women and healthy mothers past the postpartum period
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while facing a reliable
   psychosocial stressor (the Montreal Imaging Stress Task). Stress-related
   psychologic and endocrine responses (i.e., cortisol) were obtained.
   Results: We enrolled 12 women with postpartum OCD, 16 healthy postpartum
   women and 11 healthy mothers past the postpartum period in our study.
   Compared with healthy postpartum counterparts, postpartum women with OCD
   had a heightened self-reported and endocrine stress response associated
   with a distinct brain activation pattern in response to psychosocial
   stress involving the orbitofrontal and temporal cortices. Moreover,
   compared with mothers assessed in a period of time beyond the postpartum
   period, healthy postpartum women did not differ in psychologic and
   cortisol response to stress, but recruited different brain regions, such
   as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex,
   during exposure to stress. Limitations: Potential confounding factors,
   such as medication use, breasffeeding, parity and personality factors,
   may have modulated the stress-related endocrine response and could not
   be assessed in this study. Conclusion: Obsessive compulsive disorder and
   the postpartum period differentially influence the brain circuitry
   underlying psychosocial stress as well as the psychologic and endocrine
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Youth at familial risk for bipolar disorder (BD) show
   deficits in face emotion processing, but the neural correlates of these
   deficits have not been examined. This preliminary study tests the
   hypothesis that, relative to healthy comparison (HC) subjects, both BD
   subjects and youth at risk for BD (i.e., those with a first-degree BD
   relative) will demonstrate amygdala hyperactivation when viewing fearful
   and happy faces. The at-risk youth were unaffected, in that they had no
   history of mood disorder. Method: Amygdala activity was examined in 101
   unrelated participants, 8 to 18 years old. Age, gender, and IQ-matched
   groups included BD (N = 32), unaffected at-risk (N = 13), and HC (N =
   56). During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants attended
   to emotional and nonemotional aspects of fearful and happy faces.
   Results: While rating their fear of fearful faces, both BD and
   unaffected at-risk subjects exhibited amygdala hyperactivity versus HC.
   There were no between-group differences in amygdala activity in response
   to happy faces. Post-hoc comparisons revealed that, in at-risk youth,
   familial risk status (offspring versus sibling), presence of Axis I
   diagnosis (n = 1 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder {[}ADHD], n =
   1 social phobia), and history of medication exposure (n = 1) did not
   influence imaging findings. Conclusions: We found amygdala
   hyperactivation in both unaffected at-risk and BD youth while rating
   their fear of fearful faces. These pilot data suggest that both face
   emotion labeling deficits and amygdala hyperactivity during face
   processing should receive further study as potential BD endophenotypes.
   Longitudinal studies should test whether amygdala hyperactivity to
   fearful faces predicts conversion to BD in at-risk youth. J. Am. Acad.

Abstract = {{Early neural research on self-evaluation began testing whether
   self-evaluation was somehow neurally different than evaluations of other
   people and inanimate objects. Self-evaluation was lauded as potentially
   unique partially because of motivational and affective influences.
   Despite the acknowledgement that motivation influences social cognition
   such as self-perception, neural models of self-perception have been
   conspicuously silent on how motivational states affect the neural level
   of analysis. What can be learned by examining motivational influences on
   the neural systems underlying social cognition including
   self-perception? An emerging body of neural research on self-enhancement
   motivation (i.e., the motivation to see one's self in a positive light)
   is described and its implications for longstanding psychological
   questions about self-enhancement are discussed. Finally, several
   additional avenues for using the neural level of analysis to test
   questions about motivational influences on social cognition are

Abstract = {{Throughout history, dance has maintained a critical presence across all
   human cultures, defying barriers of class, race, and status. How dance
   has synergistically co-evolved with humans has fueled a rich debate on
   the function of art and the essence of aesthetic experience, engaging
   numerous artists, historians, philosophers, and scientists. While dance
   shares many features with other art forms, one attribute unique to dance
   is that it is most commonly expressed with the human body. Because of
   this, social scientists and neuroscientists are turning to dance and
   dancers to help answer questions of how the brain coordinates the body
   to perform complex, precise, and beautiful movements. In the present
   paper, we discuss how recent advances in neuroscientific methods provide
   the tools to advance our understanding of not only the cerebral
   phenomena associated with dance learning and observation but also the
   neural underpinnings of aesthetic appreciation associated with watching
   dance. We suggest that future work within the fields of dance
   neuroscience and neuroaesthetics have the potential to provide mutual
   benefits to both the scientific and artistic communities.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol is thought to contribute to an increase in risk-taking behavior,

   neural response to choosing a safe or risky option, anticipating outcome
   and receiving feedback. We found that alcohol increased risk-taking
   behavior, particularly among participants who experienced more
   stimulating effects of alcohol. fMRI scans demonstrated that alcohol
   increased activation in the striatum to risky compared with safe choices
   and dampened the neural response to notification of both winning and
   losing throughout the caudate, thalamus and insula. This study suggests
   that alcohol may increase risk-taking behavior by both activating brain
   regions involved in reward when a decision is made, and dampening the
   response to negative and positive feedback.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   investigate the influence that the presence of an object, intended as
   the target for an action, might have on the neural circuit underlying
   the observation of the movement of others (action observation network
   {[}AON]). This system entails a simulation process of the observed
   movement occurring via the recruitment of the motor and somatosensory
   cortices involved in the execution of such movement. Here, participants
   were requested to observe grasping actions ending behind a partition
   knowing in advance whether a target-object would be present (i.e.,
   object-directed action) or absent (i.e., non object-directed action).
   These ``action{''} conditions were compared with ``control{''}
   conditions in which a stationary hand was presented either alone or
   together with the target-object hidden behind the partition. Activation
   within most regions of the AON was similar for observing partially
   occluded object-related and non object-related actions. However, within
   one of the regions belonging to the AON, namely in the somatosensory
   cortices, blood oxygen level-dependent activity was modulated by the
   presence of a target-object. We interpreted such modulation as
   demonstration of the differential involvement of the somatosensory
   component of the AON for the coding of these 2 types of actions.}},

Abstract = {{The question of hemispheric lateralization of neural processes is one
   that is pertinent to a range of subdisciplines of cognitive
   neuroscience. Language is often assumed to be left-lateralized in the
   human brain, but there has been a long running debate about the
   underlying reasons for this. We addressed this problem with fMRI by
   identifying the neural responses to amplitude and spectral modulations
   in speech and how these interact with speech intelligibility to test
   previous claims for hemispheric asymmetries in acoustic and linguistic
   processes in speech perception. We used both univariate and multivariate
   analyses of the data, which enabled us to both identify the networks
   involved in processing these acoustic and linguistic factors and to test
   the significance of any apparent hemispheric asymmetries. We demonstrate
   bilateral activation of superior temporal cortex in response to
   speech-derived acoustic modulations in the absence of intelligibility.
   However, in a contrast of amplitude-modulated and spectrally modulated
   conditions that differed only in their intelligibility (where one was
   partially intelligible and the other unintelligible), we show a left
   dominant pattern of activation in STS, inferior frontal cortex, and
   insula. Crucially, multivariate pattern analysis showed that there were
   significant differences between the left and the right hemispheres only
   in the processing of intelligible speech. This result shows that the
   left hemisphere dominance in linguistic processing does not arise
   because of low-level, speech-derived acoustic factors and that
   multivariate pattern analysis provides a method for unbiased testing of
   hemispheric asymmetries in processing.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{A fear of being rejected can cause perceptions of more insecurity and
   stress in close relationships. Healthy individuals activate the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) when experiencing social rejection,
   while those who are vulnerable to depression deactivate the dACC
   presumably to downregulate salience of rejection cues and minimize
   distress. Schizotypal individuals, characterized by unusual perceptual
   experiences and/or odd beliefs, are more rejection sensitive than
   normal. We tested the hypothesis, for the first time, that individuals
   with high schizotypy also have an altered dACC response to rejection
   stimuli. Twenty-six healthy individuals, 14 with low schizotypy (LS) and
   12 with high schizotypy (HS), viewed depictions of rejection and
   acceptance and neutral scenes while undergoing functional MRI.
   Activation maps in LS and HS groups during each image type were compared
   using SPM5, and their relation to participant mood and subjective
   ratings of the images was examined. During rejection relative to neutral
   scenes, LS activated and HS deactivated the bilateral dACC, right
   superior frontal gyrus, and left ventral prefrontal cortex. Across both
   groups, a temporo-occipito-parieto-cerebellar network was active during
   rejection, and a left fronto-parietal network during acceptance,
   relative to neutral scenes, and the bilateral lingual gyrus during
   rejection relative to acceptance scenes. Our finding of
   dACC-dorso-ventral PFC activation in LS, but deactivation in HS
   individuals when perceiving social rejection scenes suggests that HS
   individuals attach less salience to and distance themselves from such
   stimuli. This may enable them to cope with their higher-than-normal
   sensitivity to rejection. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (C) 2011 Wiley

Volume = {{57}},

Pages = {{96-107}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Translation is at the centre of many cognitive domains such as pedagogy,
   linguistic, pragmatic, neurosciences, and social cognition. This
   multi-domain aspect is reflected in the current models of translation.
   Recently, cognitive neurosciences have unraveled some brain mechanisms
   in the bilingualism domain, and it is quite logical to transfer such
   knowledge to the field of translation as well as the learning of
   translation. One interesting question is which non-linguistic cognitive
   and communicative processes are particularly involved in translation.
   Particularly, in translation, the author's intentions have to be
   interpreted although they may not be explicitly stated in the text.
   These intentions have to be considered while rendering the text for the
   target public, a process for which it is also important to anticipate
   the target public's prior knowledge of the subject and the extent to
   Which the author's aims and intentions have to be adapted in order to be
   correctly communicated in the other language. In neuroscience, being
   able to imagine another person's mental state is known as having a
   Theory of Mind (ToM). This skill seems dissociated from the group of
   executive functions - though it is very dependent on the latter and
   seems to rely on a large but individualized brain network. While
   translation is a widely investigated phenomenon at the micro-level,
   there is scarcely any research about the process of interpretation going
   on at the macro-level of text interpretation and rendering. Preliminary
   neuroscience experiments on the translations paradigm suggest that
   neurosciences can bring interesting data not only to linguistic but also
   to cognitive and social mechanisms of translation strategies.}},

Journal = {{COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE \& BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{115-139}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The present study addressed the hypothesis that emotional stimuli
   relevant to survival or reproduction (biologically emotional stimuli)
   automatically affect cognitive processing (e.g., attention, memory),
   while those relevant to social life (socially emotional stimuli) require
   elaborative processing to modulate attention and memory. Results of our
   behavioral studies showed that (1) biologically emotional images hold
   attention more strongly than do socially emotional images, (2) memory
   for biologically emotional images was enhanced even with limited
   cognitive resources, but (3) memory for socially emotional images was
   enhanced only when people had sufficient cognitive resources at
   encoding. Neither images' subjective arousal nor their valence modulated
   these patterns. A subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging study
   revealed that biologically emotional images induced stronger activity in
   the visual cortex and greater functional connectivity between the
   amygdala and visual cortex than did socially emotional images. These
   results suggest that the interconnection between the amygdala and visual
   cortex supports enhanced attention allocation to biological stimuli. In
   contrast, socially emotional images evoked greater activity in the
   medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and yielded stronger functional

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to determine how authenticity of
   emotion expression in speech modulates activity in the neuronal
   substrates involved in emotion recognition. Within an fMRI paradigm,
   participants judged either the authenticity (authentic or play acted) or
   emotional content (anger, fear, joy, or sadness) of recordings of
   spontaneous emotions and reenactments by professional actors. When
   contrasting between task types, active judgment of authenticity, more
   than active judgment of emotion, indicated potential involvement of the
   theory of mind (ToM) network (medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal
   cortex, retrosplenium) as well as areas involved in working memory and
   decision making (BA 47). Subsequently, trials with authentic recordings
   were contrasted with those of reenactments to determine the modulatory
   effects of authenticity. Authentic recordings were found to enhance
   activity in part of the ToM network (medial prefrontal cortex). This
   effect of authenticity suggests that individuals integrate recollections
   of their own experiences more for judgments involving authentic stimuli
   than for those involving play-acted stimuli. The behavioral and
   functional results show that authenticity of emotional prosody is an
   important property influencing human responses to such stimuli, with
   implications for studies using play-acted emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence suggests that autistic traits, such as reduced social
   and communication skills, exist along a continuum between healthy and
   pathological conditions. Thus, functional and structural investigations
   of neuroanatomical substrates that significantly correlate with autistic
   tendency in healthy human subjects are critical for understanding this
   disorder. To accomplish this goal, we performed functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) in 30 healthy young subjects. The subjects were evaluated using
   the Autistic-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), which was designed to measure
   autistic traits in healthy and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD)
   subjects. Face-specific brain activation in the superior temporal sulcus
   (STS) and amygdala (AMG) was identified using fMRI and passive viewing
   of faces. In addition, probabilistic tractography performed in each
   subject by using DTI showed a white matter pathway between the
   face-specific regions of interest in the STS and AMG. The volume of
   connectivity between the STS and AMG correlated positively with the
   total AQ score (Spearman's rho = 0.38, p < 0.05); however, among the AQ
   subscales, only imagination was significantly associated with the
   connectivity volume. These results suggest that healthy subjects with
   high autistic traits may show an increase in the white matter pathway
   that connects key regions involved in face processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia patients suffer from severe cognitive deficits, such as
   impaired reality monitoring. Reality monitoring is the ability to
   distinguish the source of internal experiences from outside reality.
   During reality monitoring tasks, schizophrenia patients make errors
   identifying ``I made it up{''} items, and even during accurate
   performance, they show abnormally low activation of the medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region that supports self-referential
   cognition. We administered 80 hr of computerized training of cognitive
   processes to schizophrenia patients and found improvement in reality
   monitoring that correlated with increased mPFC activity. In contrast,
   patients in a computer games control condition did not show any
   behavioral or neural improvements. Notably, recovery in mPFC activity
   after training was associated with improved social functioning 6 months
   later. These findings demonstrate that a serious behavioral deficit in
   schizophrenia, and its underlying neural dysfunction, can be improved by
   well-designed computerized cognitive training, resulting in better
   quality of life.}},

Title = {{The Effect of the Visual Context in the Recognition of Symbolic Gestures}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: To investigate, by means of fMRI, the influence of the
   visual environment in the process of symbolic gesture recognition.
   Emblems are semiotic gestures that use movements or hand postures to
   symbolically encode and communicate meaning, independently of language.
   They often require contextual information to be correctly understood.
   Until now, observation of symbolic gestures was studied against a blank
   background where the meaning and intentionality of the gesture was not
   fulfilled.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Normal subjects were scanned while
   observing short videos of an individual performing symbolic gesture with
   or without the corresponding visual context and the context scenes
   without gestures. The comparison between gestures regardless of the
   context demonstrated increased activity in the inferior frontal gyrus,
   the superior parietal cortex and the temporoparietal junction in the
   right hemisphere and the precuneus and posterior cingulate bilaterally,
   while the comparison between context and gestures alone did not recruit
   any of these regions.
   Conclusions/Significance: These areas seem to be crucial for the
   inference of intentions in symbolic gestures observed in their natural
   context and represent an interrelated network formed by components of
   the putative human neuron mirror system as well as the mentalizing
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Humans use theory of mind when predicting the thoughts and feelings and
   actions of others. There is accumulating evidence that cooperation with
   a computerized game correlates with a unique pattern of brain
   activation. To investigate the neural correlates of cooperation in
   real-time we conducted an fMRI hyperscanning study. We hypothesized that
   real-time cooperation to complete a maze task, using a blind-driving
   paradigm, would activate substrates implicated in theory of mind. We
   also hypothesized that cooperation would activate neural reward centers
   more than when participants completed the maze themselves. Of interest
   and in support of our hypothesis we found left caudate and putamen
   activation when participants worked together to complete the maze. This
   suggests that cooperation during task completion is inherently
   rewarding. This finding represents one of the first discoveries of a
   proximate neural mechanism for group based interactions in real-time,
   which indirectly supports the social brain hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Although social withdrawal is a prominent symptom of sickness, the
   mechanisms associated with this behavioral change remain unclear. In
   animals, the amygdala is a key neural region involved in
   sickness-induced social withdrawal. Consistent with this, in humans,
   heightened amygdala activity to negative social cues is associated with
   social avoidance tendencies. Based on these findings, we investigated
   whether an experimental inflammatory challenge selectively increased
   amygdala activity to socially threatening images as well as whether this
   activity related to feelings of social disconnection. Thirty-nine
   participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or
   low-dose endotoxin, which increases inflammatory activity.
   Pro-inflammatory cytokines were assessed at 7 hourly time points via
   blood draws; self-reported feelings of social disconnection and physical
   sickness symptoms were assessed hourly as well. Two hours
   post-injection, participants underwent an fMRI procedure to assess
   amygdala reactivity during the presentation of socially threatening
   images (fear faces) as well as non-socially threatening images (guns),
   socially non-threatening images (happy faces), and non-social,
   non-threatening images (household objects). Endotoxin led to greater
   amygdala activity in response to socially threatening vs. all other
   types of images. No such differences were found for placebo
   participants. Additionally, increased amygdala activity in endotoxin
   participants during the viewing of socially vs. non-socially threatening
   images was associated with increased feelings of social disconnection.
   These findings highlight the amygdala as a neural region that may be
   important for sickness-induced social withdrawal. The implications of
   amygdalar involvement in sickness-induced social withdrawal are
   discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders
   characterised by impaired social interaction and communication,
   restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. The severity of these
   characteristics are posited to lie on a continuum extending into the
   typical population, and typical adults' performance on behavioural tasks
   that are impaired in ASD is correlated with the extent to which they
   display autistic traits (as measured by Autism Spectrum Quotient, AQ).
   Individuals with ASD also show structural and functional differences in
   brain regions involved in social perception. Here we show that variation
   in AQ in typically developing individuals is associated with altered
   brain activity in the neural circuit for social attention perception
   while viewing others' eye gaze. In an fMRI experiment, participants
   viewed faces looking at variable or constant directions. In control
   conditions, only the eye region was presented or the heads were shown
   with eyes closed but oriented at variable or constant directions. The
   response to faces with variable vs. constant eye gaze direction was
   associated with AQ scores in a number of regions (posterior superior
   temporal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, temporoparietal junction,
   amygdala, and MT/VS) of the brain network for social attention
   perception. No such effect was observed for heads with eyes closed or
   when only the eyes were presented. The results demonstrate a
   relationship between neurophysiology and autism spectrum traits in the
   typical (non-ASD) population and suggest that changes in the functioning
   of the neural circuit for social attention perception is associated with
   an extended autism spectrum in the typical population. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Touch massage (TM) is a form of pleasant touch stimulation used as
   treatment in clinical settings and found to improve well-being and
   decrease anxiety, stress, and pain. Emotional responses reported during
   and after TM have been studied, but the underlying mechanisms are still
   largely unexplored. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance
   (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that the combination of human touch (i.e.
   skin-to-skin contact) with movement is eliciting a specific response in
   brain areas coding for pleasant sensations. The design included four
   different touch conditions; human touch with or without movement and
   rubber glove with or without movement. Force (2.5 N) and velocity (1.5
   cm/s) were held constant across conditions. The pleasantness of the four
   different touch stimulations was rated on a visual analog scale
   (VAS-scale) and human touch was rated as most pleasant, particularly in
   combination with movement. The fMRI results revealed that TM stimulation
   most strongly activated the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC).
   These results are consistent with findings showing pgACC activation
   during various rewarding pleasant stimulations. This area is also known
   to be activated by both opioid analgesia and placebo. Together with
   these prior results, our finding furthers the understanding of the basis
   for positive TM treatment effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that word processing in bilinguals is language
   nonselective. However, this has mostly been shown in contexts involving
   deliberate processing focusing on a particular aspect of linguistic
   information (e.g., lexicality, semantic category, relatedness). It is
   therefore unknown to what extent nontarget language access is only
   apparent in overt language processing contexts. Here, we examined the
   effect of involuntary word processing in bilingual individuals
   performing a nonverbal judgment task on shapes. Chinese English
   bilinguals had to differentiate between circles and squares by pressing
   buttons while ignoring intervening English words. In the critical
   trials, the to-be-ignored words concealed a sound repetition with the
   words ``circle{''} or ``square{''} when translated into Chinese. In
   these trials, we found increased N200 event-related potential
   amplitudes, reflecting inhibition in this condition as compared to the
   control condition, in which the intervening words were totally unrelated
   to the shapes. Since no lateralised readiness potential effect was found
   in this comparison, access to Chinese translations must have been
   quickly inhibited, consistent with the fact that we observed no
   behavioural effects of the hidden manipulation. These results suggest
   fast and unconscious language nonselective access even when no language
   task is being performed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Pages = {{3594-3603}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Imitation plays a central role in the acquisition of culture. People
   preferentially imitate others who are self-similar, prestigious or
   successful. Because race can indicate a person's self-similarity or
   status, race influences whom people imitate. Prior studies of the neural
   underpinnings of imitation have not considered the effects of race. Here
   we measured neural activity with fMRI while European American
   participants imitated meaningless gestures performed by actors of their
   own race, and two racial outgroups, African American, and Chinese
   American. Participants also passively observed the actions of these
   actors and their portraits. Frontal, parietal and occipital areas were
   differentially activated while participants imitated actors of different
   races. More activity was present when imitating African Americans than
   the other racial groups, perhaps reflecting participants' reported lack
   of experience with and negative attitudes towards this group, or the
   group's lower perceived social status. This pattern of neural activity
   was not found when participants passively observed the gestures of the
   actors or simply looked at their faces. Instead, during face-viewing
   neural responses were overall greater for own-race individuals,
   consistent with prior race perception studies not involving imitation.
   Our findings represent a first step in elucidating neural mechanisms
   involved in cultural learning, a process that influences almost every
   aspect of our lives but has thus far received little neuroscientific
   study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Self-evaluation is affected by facial attractiveness, particularly in
   females, and may be related to self-esteem. Self-face evaluation is
   relative to the attractiveness of others ({''}contrast effect{''}). In
   this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined
   both the neural correlates of self-face evaluation using the contrast
   effect and a neural relationship between self-face evaluation and
   self-esteem. We prepared the following three types of ``target
   faces{''}: one's own face (S), a close friend's face (F), and an
   unfamiliar face (0). They were randomly intermingled among same-sex
   unfamiliar foils during two block-types. Our intention was to evoke
   positive evaluations of target faces using unattractive foils in one
   block-type, and negative evaluations using attractive foils in the
   other. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ventral tegmental area
   (VTA) exhibited greater activation from the positive modulation for S
   than for O. Activation in these regions was positively correlated with
   self-esteem and showed the same tendency between S and F. PCC and VTA,
   which have been implicated in the processing of self-relatedness and
   reward, respectively, might play a role in the processing of positive
   self-face evaluation as self-referential stimuli and social rewards,
   respectively. These results suggested that the PCC and the VTA are the
   neural correlates of positive self-face evaluation, and that there is a
   neural relationship between self-face evaluation and self-esteem. The
   positive evaluation of a close friend's face might be perceived and
   processed in the same way as one's own face. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Keeping track of various amounts of social cognitive information,
   including people's mental states, traits, and relationships, is
   fundamental to navigating social interactions. However, to date, no
   research has examined which brain regions support variable amounts of
   social information processing ({''}social load{''}). We developed a
   social working memory paradigm to examine the brain networks sensitive
   to social load. Two networks showed linear increases in activation as a
   function of increasing social load: the medial frontoparietal regions
   implicated in social cognition and the lateral frontoparietal system
   implicated in nonsocial forms of working memory. Of these networks, only
   load-dependent medial frontoparietal activity was associated with
   individual differences in social cognitive ability (trait
   perspective-taking). Although past studies of nonsocial load have
   uniformly found medial frontoparietal activity decreases with increasing
   task demands, the current study demonstrates these regions do support
   increasing mental effort when such effort engages social cognition.
   Implications for the etiology of clinical disorders that implicate
   social functioning and potential interventions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Although it is common to describe experiences of social rejection or
   loss with words typically reserved for physical pain, the idea that
   these social experiences might actually be experienced as painful seems
   more far-fetched. However, accumulating evidence demonstrates that
   social pain-the painful feelings following social rejection or loss-may
   rely on pain-related neural circuitry. Here, I summarize a program of
   research that has explored whether social pain relies on pain-related
   neural regions, as well as some of the expected consequences of a
   physical-social pain overlap. I also discuss the implications of these
   findings for our understanding of social pain.}},

Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{Background: Fronto-limbic regions of the brain including the sub-genual
   (sgPFC) and medial prefrontal (mPFC) cortices are central to processing
   emotionally salient and hedonic stimuli (Mayberg, 2009) and implicated
   in depression. The relevance of cortico-limbic models of emotion and
   reward processing in children with genetic risk for psychiatric
   disorders has not been assessed.
   Methods: Here we studied adolescents at risk for schizophrenia (HRS) and
   controls (HC) using an event-related fMRI continuous affective appraisal
   task. HRS were divided into sub-groups based on the presence or absence
   of negative symptoms (Miller et al., 2003), HRS\_NS+ and HRS\_NS-
   respectively. Brain responses to positive, negative and neutral
   emotional stimuli were estimated.
   Results: Consistent with observations in the depressive phenotype, for
   positively valenced stimuli, HRS\_NS + (relative to HC and HRS\_NS-)
   were characterized by hypo-responsivity of the sgPFC and the mPFC, but
   hyper-responsivity of the mid-brain. sgPFC and mPFC signals were coupled
   across groups.
   Limitations: Such studies can benefit from larger sample sizes, though
   our observed effect sizes were in the moderate to large range.
   Conclusions: Children and adolescents at risk for psychiatric illness
   and who evince reliably present negative symptoms show brain responses
   to socially rewarding stimuli similar to those observed in depression.
   Studies in at-risk children and adolescents may be important in
   understanding how early manifestations of depression-like
   characteristics impact brain function. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Behavioral abnormalities related to processing negative emotions such as
   fear have been demonstrated in schizophrenia. The amygdala is strongly
   associated with fear processing, and alterations in amygdala function
   and structure have been demonstrated in schizophrenia. Further,
   functional disconnectivity has been attributed as key to the etiology of
   schizophrenia, with a number of lines of evidence supporting this
   theory. In the present study, we examine the effective connectivity
   corresponding to fear processing, from the amygdala to the whole brain,
   and compare this between patients with schizophrenia and control
   participants. An implicit facial emotion processing task was performed
   by 19 patients with schizophrenia and 24 matched controls during fMRI
   scanning. During the task, participants made gender judgments from
   facial images with either neutral or fearful emotion. Neural response to
   fearful images versus neutral was used as contrast of interest to
   estimate effective connectivity between the amygdala and the whole brain
   using the psycho-physiological interactions approach. This connectivity
   was compared between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls.
   We show that when looking at fearful compared to neutral faces patients
   with schizophrenia show significantly reduced effective connectivity
   from the amygdala to a large cluster of regions including parts of the
   precuneus and parietal lobe, compared to healthy controls. These regions
   have been associated with emotion processing and high level social
   cognition tasks involving self related processing and mental
   representations about other people. The reduced amygdala connectivity in
   schizophrenia shown here further illuminates the neural basis for the
   behavioral abnormalities in emotional and social function found in the
   disorder. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have shown that patients with schizophrenia
   show abnormalities in brain activation when processing emotional faces.
   However, very few studies have examined if such abnormalities are also
   found in non-western patient samples and in at-risk individuals. The
   current study explored whether patients with schizophrenia and siblings
   of patients in China would show abnormal brain activation during
   processing of emotional faces.
   Methods: Thirty-six participants (three groups of twelve each of
   patients with schizophrenia, nonpsychotic siblings, and healthy
   controls) took part in the study. They were administered a task to judge
   emotional valence of three types of faces (viz., happy, fearful, and
   neutral), during fMRI scanning.
   Results: Results of this study demonstrated that patients with
   schizophrenia showed abnormalities in the social brain neural circuit
   during facial emotion processing, in comparison with nonpsychotic
   siblings and healthy controls. Patients with schizophrenia demonstrated
   lower activation right superior and middle frontal gyrus, left
   precentral gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus and left insula in
   comparison with healthy controls; and showed abnormal activation in
   bilateral inferior and middle frontal gyri, right orbital frontal gyrus,
   left superior and middle temporal gyrus. bilateral insula, and right
   superior parietal gyrus/postcentral gyrus when compared with their
   nonpyschotic siblings. Meanwhile, patients with schizophrenia showed
   greater activation in left middle frontal gyrus than healthy controls,
   and overactivation in bilateral middle frontal gyri, right orbital
   frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus than their nonpsychotic
   siblings during processing of fearful faces. Moreover, nonpsychotic
   siblings seemed to share some similar dysfunctions in processing facial
   expressions as their psychotic probands, the two groups both showed
   abnormal activation in precentral and superior frontal gyri, and such
   abnormal activation lied between patients with schizophrenia and healthy
   controls.
   Conclusions: The current findings support the universality of emotion
   perception impairments in schizophrenia, and also suggest that facial
   emotion perception might be a potential endophenotype of schizophrenia.

Volume = {{134}},

Pages = {{158-164}},

Abstract = {{Background: A deficit in Theory of mind (ToM) or `mentalizing' has been
   purported to underlie the poor social functioning seen in patients with
   schizophrenia. To understand the neural basis of this deficit studies
   have primarily used tasks requiring `off-line' or explicit mentalizing
   but, in daily life, successful social interactions depend upon implicit
   or `on-line' mentalizing. Therefore in the present study we used
   functional neuroimaging and a task that elicits `on-line' mentalizing to
   investigate the neural basis of ToM deficits in schizophrenia.
   Methods: Functional MRI images were acquired from 20 male patients with
   established schizophrenia and 19 age and gender matched healthy controls
   while they watched animated sequences involving two triangles. In the
   control condition the two triangles moved at random whereas in the
   experimental condition they moved interactively with implied intentions.
   The identification of ToM networks and differential responses between
   groups, within this network, was investigated using a random effects
   model. To account for differences in educational status between the
   groups this was included as a covariate in the between group analysis.
   Correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between
   neural activity change during mentalizing and the clinical and
   functional outcomes of patients.
   Results: Patients with schizophrenia had significantly diminished
   activity in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) at the
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and bilaterally within the inferior
   frontal gyri (IFG). Interestingly, frontal neural activity showed
   significant correlation with functional outcomes in patients with
   schizophrenia.
   Conclusions: Findings from this novel study suggest that the ToM deficit
   in male schizophrenia patients may reflect impairment in the automatic
   or implicit processing of mentalizing. If replicated, this is an
   important finding that provides additional insight into the neural basis
   of impairments in social functioning that are experienced by patients
   with schizophrenia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Social cognitive deficits contribute to functional
   disability in schizophrenia. Social cognitive tasks in healthy persons
   consistently evoke activation of medial prefrontal cortex, inferior
   frontal gyrus, temporoparietal gyrus, and posterior cingulate
   cortex/precuneus. We tested the hypothesis that patients with
   schizophrenia and their unaffected siblings share dysfunction of the
   same neural networks.
   Methods: Neural activation during emotion processing (EP), theory of
   mind (ToM), and control tasks was measured using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) in 14 patients with schizophrenia, 14
   nonpsychotic siblings of patients with schizophrenia, and 14 matched
   healthy subjects.
   Results: Compared with healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia
   showed reduced activation of right hemisphere structures involved in EP
   and ToM including inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and
   right temporoparietal junction. These deficits were shared, in part, by
   unaffected siblings. The latter group demonstrated deficits in bilateral
   precuneus activation during ToM, not present in patients.
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia appears to be associated with a deficit in
   activation of right hemisphere components of a ToM network. Such
   deficits are shared in part by those at high genetic risk but unaffected
   by schizophrenia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For every claim in the neuroimaging literature about a particular brain
   region supporting syntactic processing, there exist other claims
   implicating the target region in different linguistic processes, and, in
   many cases, in non-linguistic cognitive processes (e.g., Blumstein,
   2009). We argue that traditional group analysis methods in neuroimaging
   may obscure functional specificity because of inter-subject anatomical
   variability (Fedorenko \& Kanwisher, 2009). In Fedorenko, Hsieh,
   Nieto-Castanon, Whitfield-Gabrieli, and Kanwisher (2010) we presented a
   functional localizer that allows quick and reliable identification of
   key language-sensitive regions in each individual brain. This approach
   enables pooling data from corresponding functional regions across
   subjects rather than from the same locations in stereotaxic space that
   may differ functionally due to inter-subject anatomical variability. In
   the current paper we demonstrate that the individual-subjects functional
   localization approach is superior to the traditional methods in its
   ability to distinguish among conditions in a brain region's response.
   This ability is at the core of all neuroimaging research and is critical
   for answering questions of functional specialization (e.g., does a brain
   region specialize for processing syntactic aspects of the linguistic
   signal), which is in turn essential for making inferences about the
   precise computations conducted in each brain region. Based on our
   results, we argue that supplementing existing methods with an
   individual-subjects functional localization approach may lead to a
   clearer picture of the neural basis of syntactic processing, as it has
   in some other domains, such as high-level vision (e.g., Kanwisher, 2010)
   and social cognition (e.g., Saxe \& Kanwisher, 2003). (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study investigated depression-related differences in primiparous
   mothers' neural response to their own infant's distress cues. Mothers
   diagnosed with major depressive disorder (n = 11) and comparison mothers
   with no diagnosable psychopathology (n = 11) were exposed to their own
   18-months-old infant's cry sound, as well as unfamiliar infant's cry and
   control sound, during functional neuroimaging. Depressed mothers'
   response to own infant cry greater than other sounds was compared to
   non-depressed mothers' response in the whole brain {[}false discovery
   rate (FDR) corrected]. A continuous measure of self-reported depressive
   symptoms (CESD) was also tested as a predictor of maternal response.
   Non-depressed mothers activated to their own infant's cry greater than
   control sound in a distributed network of para/limbic and prefrontal
   regions, whereas depressed mothers as a group failed to show activation.
   Non-depressed compared to depressed mothers showed significantly greater
   striatal (caudate, nucleus accumbens) and medial thalamic activation.
   Additionally, mothers with lower depressive symptoms activated more
   strongly in left orbitofrontal, dorsal anterior cingulate and medial
   superior frontal regions. Non-depressed compared to depressed mothers
   activated uniquely to own infant greater than other infant cry in
   occipital fusiform areas. Disturbance of these neural networks involved
   in emotional response and regulation may help to explain parenting
   deficits in depressed mothers.}},

Abstract = {{Although empathic responses to stimuli with emotional contents may occur
   automatically, humans are capable to intentionally empathize with other
   individuals. Intentional empathy for others is even possible when they
   do not show emotional expressions. However, little is known about the
   neuronal mechanisms of this intentionally controlled empathic process.
   To investigate the neuronal substrates underlying intentional empathy,
   we scanned 20 healthy Chinese subjects, using fMRI, when they tried to
   feel inside the emotional states of neutral or angry faces of familiar
   (Asian) and unfamiliar (Caucasian) models. Skin color evaluation of the
   same stimuli served as a control task. Compared to a baseline condition,
   the empathy task revealed a network of established empathy regions,
   including the anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral inferior frontal
   cortex and bilateral anterior insula. The contrast of intentional
   empathy vs skin color evaluation, however, revealed three regions: the
   bilateral inferior frontal cortex, whose hemodynamic responses were
   independent of perceived emotion and familiarity and the right-middle
   temporal gyrus, whose activity was modulated by emotion but not by
   familiarity. These findings extend our understanding of the role of the
   inferior frontal cortex and the middle temporal gyrus in empathy by
   demonstrating their involvement in intentional empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Social interaction deficits and restricted repetitive behaviors and
   interests that characterize autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) may both
   reflect aberrant functioning of brain reward circuits. However, no
   neuroimaging study to date has investigated the integrity of reward
   circuits using an incentive delay paradigm in individuals with ASDs. In
   the present study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   assess blood-oxygen level-dependent activation during reward
   anticipation and outcomes in 15 participants with an ASD and 16 matched
   control participants. Brain activation was assessed during anticipation
   of and in response to monetary incentives and object image incentives
   previously shown to be visually salient for individuals with ASDs (e.g.
   trains, electronics). Participants with ASDs showed decreased nucleus
   accumbens activation during monetary anticipation and outcomes, but not
   during object anticipation or outcomes. Group x reward-type-interaction
   tests revealed robust interaction effects in bilateral nucleus accumbens
   during reward anticipation and in ventromedial prefrontal cortex during
   reward outcomes, indicating differential responses contingent on reward
   type in these regions. Results suggest that ASDs are characterized by
   reward-circuitry hypoactivation in response to monetary incentives but
   not in response to autism-relevant object images. The clinical
   implications of the double dissociation of reward type and temporal
   phase in reward circuitry function in ASD are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Social bonds fulfill the basic human need to belong. Being rejected
   thwarts this basic need, putting bonds with others at risk. Attachment
   theory suggests that people satisfy their need to belong through
   different means. Whereas anxious attachment is associated with craving
   acceptance and showing vigilance to cues that signal possible rejection,
   avoidant attachment is associated with discomfort with closeness and
   using avoidant strategies to regulate one's relationships. Given these
   different styles by which people satisfy their need to belong (that can
   operate simultaneously within the same individual), responses to social
   rejection may differ according to these individual differences in
   attachment anxiety and avoidance. To test this hypothesis, we used
   neuroimaging techniques to examine how the degree to which people
   display each of the two attachment dimensions (anxiety and avoidance)
   uniquely correlated with their neural activity during a simulated
   experience of social exclusion. Anxious attachment related to heightened
   activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior
   insula, regions previously associated with rejection-related distress.
   In contrast, avoidant attachment related to less activity in these
   regions. Findings are discussed in terms of the strategies that
   individuals with varying attachment styles might use to promote
   maintenance of social bonds.}},

Abstract = {{The idea of `extended self' refers to the incorporation of personally

   used a transient imagined ownership paradigm to explore brain regions

   anticipated, MPFC showed greater activation when objects were assigned
   to participants compared to when objects were assigned to another
   person. Activity in MPFC was also associated with superior subsequent
   source memory and increased preference for objects assigned to the self.
   These findings provide neural evidence for the incorporation of
   self-relevant objects into an extended self, which, in turn, increases
   their judged value (mere ownership effect).}},

Abstract = {{Our recent work showed that close relationships result in shared
   cognitive and neural representations of the self and one's mother in
   collectivistic individuals (Zhu et al., 2007, Neuroimage, 34, 1310-7).
   However, it remains unknown whether close others, such as mother, father
   and best friend, are differentially represented in collectivistic
   brains. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a trait
   judgment task, we showed evidence that, while trait judgments of the
   self and mother generated comparable activity in the medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) and anterior cingulate (ACC) of Chinese adults, trait
   judgments of mother induced greater MPFC/ACC activity than trait
   judgments of father and best friend. Our results suggest that, while
   neural representations of the self and mother overlapped in the
   MPFC/ACC, close others such as mother, father and best friend are
   unequally represented in the MPFC/ACC of collectivistic brains.}},

Abstract = {{When you see someone reach into a cookie jar, their goal remains obvious
   even if you know that the last cookie has already been eaten. Thus, it
   is possible to infer the goal of an action even if you know that the
   goal cannot be achieved. Previous research has identified distinct brain
   networks for processing information about object locations, actions and
   mental-state inferences. However, the relationship between brain
   networks for action understanding in social contexts remains unclear.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, this study assesses the
   role of these networks in understanding another person searching for
   hidden objects. Participants watched movie clips depicting a toy animal
   hiding and an actor, who was ignorant of the hiding place, searching in
   the filled or empty location. When the toy animal hid in the same
   location repeatedly, the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response
   was suppressed in occipital, posterior temporal and posterior parietal
   brain regions, consistent with processing object properties and spatial
   attention. When the actor searched in the same location repeatedly, the
   BOLD signal was suppressed in the inferior frontal gyrus, consistent
   with the observation of hand actions. In contrast, searches towards the
   filled location compared to the empty location were associated with a
   greater response in the medial prefrontal cortex and right temporal
   pole, which are both associated with mental state inference. These
   findings show that when observing another person search for a hidden
   object, brain networks for processing information about object
   properties, actions and mental state inferences work together in a
   complementary fashion. This supports the hypothesis that brain regions
   within and beyond the putative human mirror neuron system are involved
   in action comprehension within social contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Humor is a vital component of human well-being. Neuroimaging studies
   conducted with adults indicate that humor activates specific brain
   regions, including the temporo-occipito-parietal junction (TOPJ),
   involved in incongruity resolution, and mesolimbic regions, involved in
   reward processing. However, no study to date has used neuroimaging to
   examine humor in typically developing children. Here, we illuminate the
   neural network involved in the detection and appreciation of humor in
   childhood.
   Fifteen typically developing children (ages, 6-12 years) were invited to
   watch and respond to video clips while neural activity was imaged with a
   31 GE Discovery MR750 scanner. Before presentation during functional
   imaging, the clips were evaluated by age-matched controls and were
   representative of three categories: Funny, Positive (enjoyable but not
   funny), and Neutral (not intended to evoke any emotional response). We
   found TOPJ and mesolimbic activation in children's response to humor,
   suggesting these regions may form a humor-essential neural network
   already present in childhood. Furthermore, in a novel comparison of
   Funny to Positive stimuli, we found that bilateral TOPJ activation may
   be specific to humor processing and not part of a general constellation
   of neural activity in response to reward. Finally, we observed greater
   activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and nucleus accumbens in
   younger participants, indicating humor activation intensity changes
   during development.
   By providing a crucial link in studying the neurodevelopment of humor
   processing across the fifespan, our findings contribute valuable
   information about the evolution of how children understand their world.}},

Abstract = {{The cerebellum is thought to be engaged not only in motor control, but
   also in the neural network dedicated to visual processing of body
   motion. However, the pattern of connectivity within this network, in
   particular, between the cortical circuitry for observation of others'
   actions and the cerebellum remains largely unknown. By combining
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with functional
   connectivity analysis and dynamic causal modelling (DCM), we assessed
   cerebro-cerebellar connectivity during a visual perceptual task with
   point-light displays depicting human locomotion. In the left lateral
   cerebellum, regions in the lobules Crus land VIIB exhibited increased
   fMRI response to biological motion. The outcome of the connectivity
   analyses delivered the first evidence for reciprocal communication
   between the left lateral cerebellum and the right posterior superior
   temporal sulcus (STS). Through communication with the right posterior
   STS that is a key node not only for biological motion perception but
   also for social interaction and visual tasks on theory of mind, the left
   cerebellum might be involved in a wide range of social cognitive
   functions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although research suggests that most false memories are mediated by a
   sense of familiarity, behavioral evidence indicates that some are
   characterized by retrieval of item-specific details associated with
   recollection. However, neuroimaging studies have yet to isolate and
   analyze the neural correlates of false (or phantom) recollection,
   focusing instead on general recognition processes. In doing so, results
   are mixed with respect to the role of the medial temporal lobes (MTL) in
   distinguishing between true and false retrieval. The present study
   sought to investigate the neural basis of true and phantom recollection
   and clarify the role of the MTL in dissociating between the two
   processes. Results showed that true and phantom recollection were
   associated with a largely overlapping retrieval network including
   activity in bilateral anterior parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus,
   anterior cingulate cortex, and right superior parietal cortex. However,
   connectivity analyses using two common MTL seeds revealed a more
   inferior network (fusiform gyrus, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus)
   associated with true recollection and a more superior network (superior
   parietal, superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex) associated
   with false recollection. Finally, direct comparisons between true and
   phantom recollection showed greater activity in right hippocampus and
   early visual cortex for true recollection, whereas no region exhibited
   greater activity for false recollection. Results indicate that while
   both true and phantom recollection show similar patterns of activation,
   there are also distinctions in the neural networks contributing to the
   two recollection processes. Moreover, results conclude that within the
   MTL, the hippocampus proper can distinguish between true and phantom
   recollection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding others' emotions requires both the identification of overt
   behaviors ({''}smiling{''}) and the attribution of behaviors to a cause
   ({''}friendly disposition{''}). Previous research suggests that whereas
   emotion identification depends on a cortical mirror system that enables
   the embodiment of observed motor behavior within one's own motor system,
   causal attribution for emotion depends on a separate cortical
   mentalizing system, so-named because its function is associated with
   mental state representation. We used fMRI to test an
   Identification-Attribution model of mirror and mentalizing system
   contributions to the comprehension of emotional behavior. Normal
   volunteers watched a set of ecologically valid videos of human emotional
   displays. During each viewing, volunteers either identified an
   emotion-relevant motor behavior (explicit identification) or inferred a
   plausible social cause (explicit attribution). These explicit
   identification and attribution goals strongly distinguished activity in
   the mirror and mentalizing systems, respectively. However, frontal
   mirror areas, though preferentially engaged by the identification goal,
   nevertheless exhibited activation when observers possessed the
   attribution goal. One of these areas right posterior inferior frontal
   gyrus demonstrated effective connectivity with areas of the mentalizing
   system during attributional processing. These results support an
   integrative model of the neural systems supporting the comprehension of
   emotional behavior, where the mirror system helps facilitate the rapid
   identification of emotional expressions that then serve as inputs to
   attributional processing in the mentalizing system. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dyslexia is a developmental disorder characterised by extensive
   difficulties in the acquisition of reading or spelling. Genetic
   influence is estimated at 50-70\%. However, the link between genetic
   variants and phenotypic deficits is largely unknown. Our aim was to
   investigate a role of genetic variants of FOXP2, a prominent speech and
   language gene, in dyslexia using imaging genetics. This technique
   combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and genetics to
   investigate relevance of genetic variants on brain activation. To our
   knowledge, this represents the first usage of fMRI-based imaging
   genetics in dyslexia. In an initial case/control study (n=245) for
   prioritisation of FOXP2 polymorphisms for later use in imaging genetics,
   nine SNPs were selected. A non-synonymously coding mutation involved in
   verbal dyspraxia was also investigated. SNP rs12533005 showed nominally
   significant association with dyslexia (genotype GG odds ratio recessive
   model=2.1 (95\% confidence interval 1.1-3.9), P=0.016). A correlated SNP
   was associated with altered expression of FOXP2 in vivo in human
   hippocampal tissue. Therefore, influence of the rs12533005-G risk
   variant on brain activity was studied. fMRI revealed a significant main
   effect for the factor `genetic risk' in a temporo-parietal area involved
   in phonological processing as well as a significant interaction effect
   between the factors `disorder' and `genetic risk' in activation of
   inferior frontal brain areas. Hence, our data may hint at a role of
   FOXP2 genetic variants in dyslexia-specific brain activation and
   demonstrate use of imaging genetics in dyslexia research. European

Abstract = {{Objective: The ability to perceive faces is acquired through an
   interaction between species-specific biological mechanisms and social
   experience. To elucidate the mechanisms of the cognitive system
   underlying face recognition, we investigated cerebral oscillations
   related to encoding in `person identity nodes'.
   Methods: EEG was measured in nine healthy adults during perception of
   their own face, familiar face and unfamiliar face images.
   Results: Event-related synchronization (ERS) in theta, alpha and beta
   bands was initially induced in occipito-temporal areas within 0-200 ms
   of the presentation of facial stimuli. In addition, delta ERS over
   parietal and left temporal areas was greater in response to familiar
   faces around 0-800 ms compared with unfamiliar faces. Beta ERS over the
   right prefrontal area was significantly greater in response to a
   participant's own face compared with a familiar face at 400-800 ms
   post-stimulus.
   Conclusions: ERS within 0-200 ms reflects structural encoding of faces
   (i.e., N170 of the event related potential). Delta ERS within 0-800 ms
   suggests an association with memory retrieval. Beta ERS within 400-800
   ms is consistent with the cortical areas reported to be strongly related
   to self-face perception in previous fMRI studies.
   Significance: The delta and beta bands ERS might provide an index of
   familiarity and self-recognition, respectively. (C) 2011 International

Abstract = {{Functional neuroanatomy of executive functions has been delineated in a
   large number of neuroimaging studies using conflict-inducing tasks. The
   neural basis of alcohol's effects on cognitive control is poorly
   understood despite the evidence of impaired ability to evaluate
   competing demands and to inhibit maladaptive responses. To investigate
   the effects of moderate intoxication, healthy social drinkers
   participated in both alcohol (0.60 g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg for
   women) and placebo conditions while being scanned using blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A
   modified four-color Stroop task combined reading and color naming and
   used manual responses. Twenty subjects (10 women) were instructed to
   press a button corresponding to the font color except when a word was
   written in gray in which case they had to respond to the meaning of the
   word. Alcohol increased reaction times and a tendency to make more
   errors on incongruent trials. Behavioral indices of alcohol-induced
   premature responding correlated with the current drinking levels and
   impulsivity traits, suggesting an interaction between alcohol effects
   and personality predispositions. A distributed frontoparietal cortical
   network was activated by incongruity. However, moderate alcohol
   inebriation selectively attenuated anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   activation during both high-conflict trials and erroneous responses,
   indicating vulnerability of the regulative function subserved by the
   ACC. By disrupting topdown, strategic processing, alcohol may interfere
   with goal-directed behavior, resulting in poor self control. The present
   results support models proposing that alcohol-induced prefrontal
   impairments diminish inhibitory control and are modulated by
   dispositional risk factors and levels of alcohol consumption. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{Face, hands, and body movements are powerful signals essential for
   social interactions. In the last 2 decades, a large number of brain
   imaging studies have explored the neural correlates of the perception of
   these signals. Formal synthesis is crucially needed, however, to extract
   the key circuits involved in human motion perception across the variety
   of paradigms and stimuli that have been used. Here, we used the
   activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis approach with
   random effect analysis. We performed meta-analyses on three classes of
   biological motion: movement of the whole body, hands, and face.
   Additional analyses of studies of static faces or body stimuli and
   sub-analyses grouping experiments as a function of their control stimuli
   or task employed allowed us to identify main effects of movements and
   forms perception, as well as effects of task demand. In addition to
   specific features, all conditions showed convergence in
   occipito-temporal and fronto-parietal regions, but with different peak
   location and extent. The conjunction of the three ALE maps revealed
   convergence in all categories in a region of the right posterior
   superior temporal sulcus as well as in a bilateral region at the
   junction between middle temporal and lateral occipital gyri. Activation
   in these regions was not a function of attentional demand and was
   significant also when controlling for non-specific motion perception.
   This quantitative synthesis points towards a special role for posterior
   superior temporal sulcus for integrating human movement percept, and
   supports a specific representation for body parts in middle temporal,
   fusiform, precentral, and parietal areas. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{CACNA1C gene polymorphism (rs1006737) is a susceptibility factor for
   both schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). However, its role in
   working memory, a cognitive function that is impaired in both diseases,
   is not clear. Using three samples, including healthy controls, patients
   with SCZ, and patients currently in manic episodes of BP, this study
   tested the association between the SNP rs1006737 and spatial working
   memory as measured by an N-back task and a dot pattern expectancy (DPX)
   task. Among SCZ patients and healthy controls, the clinical risk allele
   was associated with impaired working memory, but the association was
   either in opposite direction or nonsignificant in patients with BP.
   These results indicated that rs1006737 may have differential effects on
   working memory in different disease populations and pointed to the
   necessity for more studies in different patient populations.

Abstract = {{Despite the prevalence and potentially harmful consequences of first
   impression bias during social decision-making, its precise neural
   underpinnings remain unclear. Here, on the basis of the fMRI study using
   ultimatum games, the authors show that the responders' decisions to
   accept or reject offers were significantly affected by facial
   trustworthiness of proposers. Analysis using a model-based fMRI method
   revealed that activity in the right lateral OFC (lOFC) of responders
   increased as a function of negative decision bias, indicating a greater
   likelihood of rejecting otherwise fair offers, possibly because of the
   facial trustworthiness of proposers. In addition, lOFC showed changes in
   functional connectivity strength with amygdala and insula as a function
   of decision bias, and individual differences in the strengths of
   connectivities between lOFC and bilateral insula were also found to
   predict the likelihood of responders to reject offers from
   untrustworthy-looking proposers. The present findings emphasize that the
   lOFC plays a pivotal role in integrating signals related to facial
   impression and creating signal biasing decisions during social
   interactions.}},

Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In two fMRI experiments, participants named pictures with superimposed
   distractors that were high or low in frequency or varied in terms of age
   of acquisition. Pictures superimposed with low-frequency words were
   named more slowly than those superimposed with high-frequency words, and
   late-acquired words interfered with picture naming to a greater extent
   than early-acquired words. The distractor frequency effect (Experiment
   1) was associated with increased activity in left premotor and posterior
   superior temporal cortices, consistent with the operation of an
   articulatory response buffer and verbal self-monitoring system.
   Conversely, the distractor age-of-acquisition effect (Experiment 2) was
   associated with increased activity in the left middle and posterior
   middle temporal cortex, consistent with the operation of lexical level
   processes such as lemma and phonological word form retrieval. The
   spatially dissociated patterns of activity across the two experiments
   indicate that distractor effects in picture-word interference may occur
   at lexical or postlexical levels of processing in speech production.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined the neural correlates of long-term intense
   romantic love using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Ten
   women and 7 men married an average of 21.4 years underwent fMRI while
   viewing facial images of their partner. Control images included a highly
   familiar acquaintance; a close, long-term friend; and a low-familiar
   person. Effects specific to the intensely loved, long-term partner were
   found in: (i) areas of the dopamine-rich reward and basal ganglia
   system, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dorsal striatum,
   consistent with results from early-stage romantic love studies; and (ii)
   several regions implicated in maternal attachment, such as the globus
   pallidus (GP), substantia nigra, Raphe nucleus, thalamus, insular
   cortex, anterior cingulate and posterior cingulate. Correlations of
   neural activity in regions of interest with widely used questionnaires
   showed: (i) VTA and caudate responses correlated with romantic love
   scores and inclusion of other in the self; (ii) GP responses correlated
   with friendship-based love scores; (iii) hypothalamus and posterior
   hippocampus responses correlated with sexual frequency; and (iv)
   caudate, septum/fornix, posterior cingulate and posterior hippocampus
   responses correlated with obsession. Overall, results suggest that for
   some individuals the reward-value associated with a long-term partner
   may be sustained, similar to new love, but also involves brain systems
   implicated in attachment and pair-bonding.}},

Abstract = {{Whether people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) have a specific
   deficit when processing biological motion has been a topic of much
   debate. We used psychophysical methods to determine individual
   behavioural thresholds in a point-light direction discrimination
   paradigm for a small but carefully matched groups of adults (N = 10 per
   group) with and without ASDs. These thresholds were used to derive
   individual stimulus levels in an identical fMRI task, with the purpose
   of equalising task performance across all participants whilst inside the
   scanner. The results of this investigation show that despite comparable
   behavioural performance both inside and outside the scanner, the group
   with ASDs shows a different pattern of BOLD activation from the TD group
   in response to the same stimulus levels. Furthermore, connectivity
   analysis suggests that the main differences between the groups are that
   the TD group utilise a unitary network with information passing from
   temporal to parietal regions, whilst the ASD group utilise two distinct
   networks; one utilising motion sensitive areas and another utilising
   form selective areas. Furthermore, a temporal-parietal link that is
   present in the TD group is missing in the ASD group. We tentatively
   propose that these differences may occur due to early dysfunctional
   connectivity in the brains of people with ASDs, which to some extent is
   compensated for by rewiring in high functioning adults. (C) 2011

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1668-1683}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{The first aim of this event-related fMRI study was to identify the
   neural circuits involved in imitation learning. We used a rapid
   imitation task where participants directly imitated pictures of guitar
   chords. The results provide clear evidence for the involvement of
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the fronto-parietal mirror
   circuit (FPMC) during action imitation when the requirements for working
   memory are low. Connectivity analyses further indicated a robust
   connectivity between left prefrontal cortex and the components of the
   FPMC bilaterally. We conclude that a mechanism of automatic
   perception-action matching alone is insufficient to account for
   imitation learning. Rather, the motor representation of an observed,
   complex action, as provided by the FPMC, only serves as the `raw
   material' for higher-order supervisory and monitoring operations
   associated with the prefrontal cortex. The second aim of this study was
   to assess whether these neural circuits are also recruited during
   observational practice (OP, without motor execution), or only during
   physical practice (PP). Whereas prefrontal cortex was not consistently
   activated in action observation across all participants, prefrontal
   activation intensities did predict the behavioural practice effects,
   thus indicating a crucial role of prefrontal cortex also in OP. In
   addition, whilst OP and PP produced similar activation intensities in
   the FPMC when assessed during action observation, during imitative
   execution, the practice-related activation decreases were significantly
   more pronounced for PP than for OP. This dissociation indicates a lack
   of execution-related resources in observationally practised actions.
   More specifically, we found neural efficiency effects in the right motor
   cingulate-basal ganglia circuit and the FPMC that were only observed
   after PP but not after OP. Finally, we confirmed that practice generally
   induced activation decreases in the FPMC during both action observation
   and imitation sessions and outline a framework explaining the discrepant
   findings in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with high anxiety show heightened neural activation in
   affective processing regions, including the amygdala and insula.
   Activations have been shown to be correlated with anxiety severity, but
   although anxiety is a heterogeneous state, prior studies have not
   systematically disentangled whether neural activity in affective
   processing circuitry is uniquely related to specific domains of anxiety.
   Forty-five young adults were tested on an emotional face processing task
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants completed the
   Social Interactional Anxiety Scale, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, and
   Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory. Using a robust multiple regression
   approach, we examined the effects of social anxiety, anxiety
   sensitivity, and trait anxiety (which overlapped with depressive
   symptoms, and can therefore be considered a measure of negative
   affectivity) on activation in insula, amygdala, and medial prefrontal
   cortex, in response to emotional faces. Adjusting for negative
   affectivity and anxiety sensitivity, social anxiety was associated with
   activity in left amygdala, right insula, and subgenual anterior
   cingulate across all emotional faces. When comparing negative and
   positive faces directly, greater negative affectivity was uniquely
   associated with less activity to positive faces in left amygdala, left
   anterior insula, and dorsal anterior cingulate. The current findings
   support the hypothesis that hyperactivity in brain areas during general
   emotional face processing is predominantly a function of social anxiety.
   In comparison, hypoactivity to positively valenced faces was
   predominantly associated with negative affectivity. Implications for the
   understanding of emotion processing in anxiety are discussed. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Background: Neuroimaging studies of emotion in schizophrenia have
   reported abnormalities in amygdala and other regions, although divergent
   results and heterogeneous paradigms complicate conclusions from single
   experiments. To identify more consistent patterns of dysfunction, a
   meta-analysis of functional imaging studies of emotion was undertaken.
   Methods: Searching Medline and PsycINFO databases through January 2011,
   88 potential articles were identified, of which 26 met inclusion
   criteria, comprising 450 patients with schizophrenia and 422 healthy
   comparison subjects. Contrasts were selected to include emotion
   perception and emotion experience. Foci from individual studies were
   subjected to a voxelwise meta-analysis using multilevel kernel density
   analysis.
   Results: For emotional experience, comparison subjects showed greater
   activation in the left occipital pole. For emotional perception,
   schizophrenia subjects showed reduced activation in bilateral amygdala,
   visual processing areas, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral frontal
   cortex, medial frontal cortex, and subcortical structures. Schizophrenia
   subjects showed greater activation in the cuneus, parietal lobule,
   precentral gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus. Combining across studies
   and eliminating studies that did not balance on effort and stimulus
   complexity eliminated most differences in visual processing regions as
   well as most areas where schizophrenia subjects showed a greater signal.
   Reduced reactivity of the amygdala appeared primarily in implicit
   studies of emotion, whereas deficits in anterior cingulate cortex
   activity appeared throughout all contrasts.
   Conclusions: Processing emotional stimuli, schizophrenia patients show
   reduced activation in areas engaged by emotional stimuli, although in
   some conditions, schizophrenia patients exhibit increased activation in
   areas outside those traditionally associated with emotion, possibly
   representing compensatory processing.}},

Abstract = {{The default-mode network (DMN) of the human brain has become a central
   topic of cognitive neuroscience research. Although alterations in its
   resting state activity and in its recruitment during tasks have been
   reported for several mental and neurodegenerative disorders, its role in
   emotion processing has received relatively little attention. We
   investigated brain responses to different categories of emotional faces
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and found deactivation
   in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), posterior cingulate gyrus
   (PC) and cuneus. This deactivation was modulated by emotional category
   and was less prominent for happy than for sad faces. These deactivated
   areas along the midline conformed to areas of the DMN. We also observed
   emotion-dependent deactivation of the left middle frontal gyrus, which
   is not a classical component of the DMN. Conversely, several areas in a
   frontoparietal network commonly linked with attention were
   differentially activated by emotion categories. Functional connectivity
   patterns, as obtained by correlation of activation levels, also varied
   between emotions. VMPFC, PC or cuneus served as hubs between the
   DMN-type areas and the fronto-parietal network. These data support
   recent suggestions that the DMN is not a unitary system but
   differentiates according to task and even type of stimulus. The
   emotion-specific differential pattern of DMN deactivation may be
   explored further in patients with mood disorder, where the quest for
   biological markers of emotional biases is still ongoing. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Humans and animals are exquisitely, though idiosyncratically, sensitive
   to risk or variance in the outcomes of their actions. Economic,
   psychological, and neural aspects of this are well studied when
   information about risk is provided explicitly. However, we must normally
   learn about outcomes from experience, through trial and error.
   Traditional models of such reinforcement learning focus on learning
   about the mean reward value of cues and ignore higher order moments such
   as variance. We used fMRI to test whether the neural correlates of human
   reinforcement learning are sensitive to experienced risk. Our analysis
   focused on anatomically delineated regions of a priori interest in the
   nucleus accumbens, where blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
   signals have been suggested as correlating with quantities derived from
   reinforcement learning. We first provide unbiased evidence that the raw
   BOLD signal in these regions corresponds closely to a reward prediction
   error. We then derive from this signal the learned values of cues that
   predict rewards of equal mean but different variance and show that these
   values are indeed modulated by experienced risk. Moreover, a close
   neurometric-psychometric coupling exists between the fluctuations of the
   experience-based evaluations of risky options that we measured neurally
   and the fluctuations in behavioral risk aversion. This suggests that
   risk sensitivity is integral to human learning, illuminating economic
   models of choice, neuroscientific models of affective learning, and the
   workings of the underlying neural mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Remembering events from the personal past (autobiographical memory) and
   inferring the thoughts and feelings of other people (mentalizing) share
   a neural substrate. The shared functional neuroanatomy of these
   processes has been demonstrated in a meta-analysis of independent task
   domains (Spreng, Mar \& Kim, 2009) and within subjects performing both
   tasks (Rabin, Gilboa, Stuss, Mar, \& Rosenbaum, 2010; Spreng \& Grady,
   2010). Here, we examine spontaneous low-frequency fluctuations in fMRI
   BOLD signal during rest from two separate regions key to memory and
   mentalizing, the left hippocampus and right temporal parietal junction,
   respectively. Activity in these two regions was then correlated with the
   entire brain in a resting-state functional connectivity analysis.
   Although the left hippocampus and right temporal parietal junction were
   not correlated with each other, both were correlated with a distributed
   network of brain regions. These regions were consistent with the
   previously observed overlap between autobiographical memory and
   mentalizing evoked brain activity found in past studies. Reliable
   patterns of overlap included the superior temporal sulcus, anterior
   temporal lobe, lateral inferior parietal cortex (angular gyrus),
   posterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial and ventral prefrontal cortex,
   inferior frontal gyms, and the amygdala. We propose that the functional
   overlap facilitates the integration of personal and interpersonal
   information and provides a means for personal experiences to become
   social conceptual knowledge. This knowledge, in turn, informs strategic
   social behavior in support of personal goals. In closing, we argue for a
   new perspective within social cognitive neuroscience, emphasizing the
   importance of memory in social cognition. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Most analysis of multi-subject fMRI data is concerned with determining
   whether there exists a significant population-wide `activation' in a
   comparison between two or more conditions. This is typically assessed by
   testing the average value of a contrast of parameter estimates (COPE)
   against zero in a general linear model (GLM) analysis. However,
   important information can also be obtained by testing whether there
   exist significant individual differences in effect magnitude between
   subjects, i.e. whether the variance of a COPE is significantly different
   from zero. Intuitively, such a test amounts to testing whether
   inter-individual differences are larger than would be expected given the
   within-subject error variance. We compare several methods for estimating
   variance components, including a) a naive estimate using ordinary least
   squares (OLS); b) linear mixed effects in R (LMER); c) a novel Matlab
   implementation of iterative generalized least squares (IGLS) and its
   restricted maximum likelihood variant (RIGLS). All methods produced
   reasonable estimates of within- and between-subject variance components,
   with IGLS providing an attractive balance between sensitivity and
   appropriate control of false positives. Finally, we use the IGLS method
   to estimate inter-subject variance in a perfusion fMRI study (N = 18) of
   social evaluative threat, and show evidence for significant
   inter-individual differences in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC),
   amygdala, hippocampus and medial temporal lobes, insula, and brainstem,
   with predicted inverse coupling between VMPFC and the midbrain
   periaqueductal gray only when high inter-individual variance was used to
   define the seed for functional connectivity analyses. In sum, tests of
   variance provides a way of selecting regions that show significant
   inter-individual variability for subsequent analyses that attempt to
   explain those individual differences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{One tenet of behavioral economics is the asymmetry in how decision
   makers evaluate risks involving gains versus risks involving losses.
   Correspondingly, an increasingly important question is what
   neuroanatomical and neurochemical correlates underpin valuation over
   gains and losses. By employing an imaging genetics strategy, this paper
   aims at identifying the specific neurotransmitter pathways underlying
   these decision making processes. We find enhanced striatal activation
   responding to increases in the magnitude of utility for risks over gains
   and to increases in the magnitude of disutility for risks over losses,
   while increased amygdala activation correlates only with the disutility
   for risks over losses. Stratifying brain activation by genotype, we find
   that a well-characterized polymorphism in the dopamine transporter
   (DAT1) contributes to individual differences in striatal response for
   gain-oriented risks, whereas a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter
   (STin2) partially accounts for individual differences in amygdala
   responses for loss-oriented risks. Together, our results suggest the
   role of the amygdala and corresponding serotonergic pathway in
   evaluating losses. This further corroborates the hypothesis of serotonin
   being linked to dopamine in an ``opponent partnership{''}. (C) 2011

   reduction of prosocial behavior. In this fMRI study we examined the
   neural networks involved in social exclusion and subsequent fairness
   considerations across adolescent development. Participants from 3 age
   groups (10-12, 14-16 and 19-21 year olds) participated in the study and
   performed two tasks; first, participants played Cyberball to induce
   feelings of social inclusion and exclusion, followed by a Dictator game
   in which participants were asked to divide coins between themselves and
   the players who previously included or excluded them. Results revealed a
   network of regions associated with social exclusion, which involve the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/ventral anterior cingulate cortex
   (vACC), subgenual ACC and the lateral PFC, as well as the insula and the
   dorsal ACC. Although social exclusion generated strong distress for all
   age groups, 10-12 year olds showed increased activity in the subgenual
   ACC in the exclusion game, which has been associated in previous studies
   with negative affective processing. Results of the Dictator game
   revealed that all age groups selectively punished the excluders by
   making lower offers. These offers were associated with activation in the
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ), superior temporal sulcus (STS) and the
   lateral PFC. Age comparisons revealed that adults showed additional
   activity in the insula and dorsal ACC when making offers to the
   excluders. The results are discussed in the light of recent findings on
   neural networks involved in social exclusion and the development of
   social brain regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation of the A118G polymorphism of the mu-opioid receptor
   gene (OPRM1) predicts individual sensitivity to social rejection and
   fMRI activation during simulated social rejection in adults, while data
   on these relationships during childhood are lacking. We investigated
   whether this polymorphism predicts childhood withdrawal - a predictor of
   sensitivity to social rejection -, and the face-specific N170
   event-related waveform in response to facial expressions. Among facial
   expressions, `anger' was expected to be particularly evocative, as it
   communicates social rejection.
   Forty-nine children aged 8-10 years were characterised for their OPRM1
   genotype, their score at the Withdrawn Scale of the Child Behavior
   Checklist (CBCL), and for N170 latencies and amplitudes recorded during
   a task of implicit processing of happy, neutral, and angry expressions
   of other children. Children carrying the OPRM1-G allele had higher CBCL
   Withdrawn scores and enhanced N170 amplitudes in response to facial
   expressions. Multiple linear regressions showed that the Withdrawn scale
   score predicts larger N170 amplitudes at the Pz and C4 electrodes, only
   for the anger expression.
   Children who carry one or two copies of the OPRM1 G-allele are more
   likely to manifest withdrawn behaviours, and differ for
   electrophysiological responses to the early phases of processing
   affective stimuli. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The neural mechanisms underlying moral judgment have been extensively
   studied in healthy adults. How these mechanisms evolve from adolescence
   to adulthood has received less attention. Brain regions that have been
   consistently implicated in moral judgment in adults, including the
   superior temporal cortex and prefrontal cortex, undergo extensive
   developmental changes from adolescence to adulthood. Thus, their role in
   moral judgment may also change over time. In the present study, 51
   healthy male participants age 13-53 were scanned with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while they viewed pictures that did or
   did not depict situations considered by most individuals to represent
   moral violations, and rated their degree of moral violation severity.
   Consistent with predictions, a regression analysis revealed a positive
   correlation between age and hemodynamic activity in the temporo-parietal
   junction when participants made decisions regarding moral severity. This
   region is known to contribute to mentalizing processes during moral
   judgment in adults and suggests that adolescents use these types of
   inferences less during moral judgment than do adults. A positive
   correlation with age was also present in the posterior cingulate.
   Overall, the results suggest that the brain regions utilized in moral
   judgment change over development. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in the
   brain organization of motor control in left- and right-handers and to
   study whether early left-to-right handwriting switch changes the
   cortical representation of finger movements in the left and right
   hemispheres. Echo-planar MR imaging was performed in 52 subjects:
   consistent right-handers (RH), consistent left-handers (LH), and
   subjects who had been forced at an early age to switch their left-hand
   preferences toward the right side. The scanning was performed during
   simple (flexion/extension of the index finger) and complex (successive
   finger-thumb opposition) tasks. Subjects performed the tasks using both
   the preferred and non-preferred hand. In right-handers, there was a
   general predominance of left-hemisphere activation relative to right
   hemisphere activation. In left-handers this pattern was reversed. The
   switched subjects showed no such volumetric asymmetry. Increasing levels
   of complexity of motor activity resulted in an increase in the volume of
   consistently activated areas and the involvement of the ipsilateral in
   addition to contralateral activations. In both right- and left-handers,
   movements of the preferred hand activated mainly the contralateral
   hemisphere, whereas movements of the non-preferred hand resulted in a
   more balanced pattern of activation in the two hemispheres, indicating
   greater involvement of the ipsilateral activations. Overall, this study
   shows that in both left- and right-handed subjects, the preferred hand
   is controlled mainly by the hemisphere contralateral to that hand,
   whereas the non-preferred hand is controlled by both hemispheres. The
   switched individuals share features of both left-handers and
   right-handers regarding their motor control architectures.}},

Pages = {{715-724}},
Abstract = {{In line with the psychological model of self-expansion, recent
   neuroimaging evidence shows an overlap between the brain network
   mediating passionate love and that involved in self-representation.
   Nevertheless, little remains known about the temporal dynamics of these
   brain areas. To address this question, we recorded brain activity from
   20 healthy participants using high-density electrophysiological
   recordings while participants were performing a cognitive priming
   paradigm known to activate the so-called love brain network. Our results
   show that when a person is feeling high passionate love, the subliminal
   presentation of their beloved's name evokes specific brain states that
   are mediated by generators located in the pleasure, reward and cognitive
   brain pathways. More precisely, visual areas are activated in the first
   milliseconds after stimulus onset, then higher-order associative brain
   areas, such as those involved in self-related processes (e. g., the
   angular gyrus/temporoparietal junction) are activated, and finally a
   flow of backward activation seems to occur from these associative brain
   areas to the primary visual and emotional brain areas. These results
   reinforce the neuro-functional top-down model of interpersonal
   relationships, suggesting that associative brain areas may prime more
   basic brain area sat a pre-conscious stage (i.e., starting at 80ms
   post-stimulus onset) of information processing. This raises the question
   of the various states of consciousness in people feeling in passionate
   love.}},

Abstract = {{Although a growing body of research provides critical information about
   the spatio-temporal dynamic of the brain network mediating the

   we recorded electrical brain activity from 16 healthy adults while they
   performed an intention understanding task including actions with three
   different types of causality; 1) private intentions by two agents acting
   independently from one another; 2) communicative intentions by two
   agents acting in an interactive way with one another; 3) physical
   causality among objects. Electrophysiological results showed
   differential electrical activity for private compared to communicative
   intentions within 400 ms post-stimulus. Brain source localization of the
   difference waves between communicative and private actions showed a
   generator located in the vicinity of middle cingulate cortex, which
   reinforces the role of this brain area in predicting social intentions.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted with a young woman who had suddenly
   developed mirror writing in the right hand, which she used for writing.
   She was not cured for eight years. The patient was ambidextrous and had
   no medical complaints except for migraine with perceptual and sensory
   abnormalities, and an enlarged cavity of the septum pellucidum. A
   previous study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   conducted when she imagined letters and wrote letters in the air with
   either hand, indicated that both her cerebral hemispheres were active.
   In the present study three experiments were conducted using a
   tachistoscope to explore the stage in the cognitive process when
   directional errors emerged. In the experiments, after independently
   being presented with Attneave's meaningless figures or letters to each
   hemisphere, participants were requested to do the following: (a)
   verbally respond whether the orientation of two consecutively shown
   figures were the same or different and the letters were standard or
   reversed; (b) distinguish the orientations with right and left hand
   movements other than by writing (by pushing a button); and (c) reproduce
   the stimuli (drawing) immediately after the presentation. Results showed
   a higher rate of incorrect directions only when drawings were reproduced
   by the right hand. Results also indicated that the woman's inaccurate
   judgment in direction emerged only when in writing and not at the
   perceptual level, or when responding with hand movements other than
   writing. Her migraine was cured after five years following the
   experiment. The mirror writing was cured 2-3 months later.}},

Abstract = {{Brain injury in the pediatric patient not only occurs in an immature
   brain, but potentially influences all subsequent brain and
   neurodevelopmental maturation. This presents unique challenges in
   neuroimaging the developing central nervous system, which is reviewed
   herein. The most significant neuroimaging advances in assessing
   pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) have occurred with magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion tensor imaging and the
   multiple emerging techniques using functional MRI (fMRI). Pediatric
   neuroimaging findings of TBI are discussed in terms of techniques that
   can assess underlying neural networks and provide information about
   neuroplasticity of recovery. Neuroimaging methods also provide insights
   into the complexities of brain injury, cognitive and neurobehavioral
   recovery, and how multimodality contemporary neuroimaging methods best
   demonstrate underlying neuropathology that affects outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Using the emotion-priming paradigm, we examined the neural mechanisms

   and not very happy) groups. Late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes
   elicited by emotional words were compared with words elicited in the
   neutral priming condition, and we found LPPs significantly reduced under
   the fear-inducing priming condition. This priming effect was more
   prominent in the group of participants who were not very happy, showing
   that, compared to the very happy group, these participants were more
   sensitive and subject to the influence of external stimuli (particularly
   negative emotional stimuli). The findings provide electrophysiological
   evidence for the relationship between SWB and emotion processing.}},

Title = {{Age-related changes to the neural correlates of social evaluation}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{552-564}},
Abstract = {{Recent work suggests the existence of a specialized neural system
   underlying social processing that may be relatively spared with age,
   unlike pervasive aging-related decline occurring in many cognitive
   domains. We investigated how neural mechanisms underlying social
   evaluation are engaged with age, and how age-related changes to
   socioemotional goals affect recruitment of regions within this network.
   In a functional MRI study, 15 young and 15 older adults formed
   behavior-based impressions of individuals. They also responded to a
   prompt that was interpersonally meaningful, social but interpersonally
   irrelevant, or non-social. Both age groups engaged regions implicated in
   mentalizing and impression formation when making social relative to
   non-social evaluations, including dorsal and ventral medial prefrontal
   cortices, precuneus, and temporoparietal junction. Older adults had
   increased activation over young in right temporal pole when making
   social relative to non-social evaluations, suggesting reliance on past
   experiences when evaluating others. Young adults had greater activation
   than old in posterior cingulate gyrus when making interpersonally
   irrelevant, compared to interpersonally meaningful, evaluations,
   potentially reflecting enhanced valuation of this information. The
   findings demonstrate the age-related preservation of the neural
   correlates underlying social evaluation, and suggest that functioning in
   these regions might be mediated by age-related changes in socioemotional
   goals.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{578-590}},
Abstract = {{When perceiving imminent harm to others, quickly detecting potential
   hazards to oneself should be vital. In this case, mirroring the outcome
   of observed actions appears paradoxical. This study measured
   electroencephalographic/event-related potentials and mu suppression that
   were induced by dynamic animations; each animation was composed of three
   consecutive pictures depicting an individual being accidentally injured.
   The results indicated that the first picture evoked frontal N260 and
   central N360, the possible brain source of which is estimated in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the third picture elicited late
   positive potentials, the possible sources of which might be generated
   from the insular and mid-cingulate cortex. Differential mu suppression,
   in relation to the sensorimotor resonance of empathy for pain, is
   associated with the third picture containing the crucial affective
   valence, but not with the first picture. The masking procedure on the
   third picture attenuated this mu suppression. Mediation analysis further
   confirmed that sensorimotor resonance is not a significant mediator in
   predicting subjective unpleasantness for observed actions. The findings
   suggest that sensorimotor resonance is not a platform, but rather an
   outcome when anticipating harm to others.}},

   cortex in behavior understanding and trait identification}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{591-605}},
Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) is
   involved in inferring immediate goals and intentions from behaviors,
   whereas the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) integrates social
   information, such as traits, at a more abstract level. To explore the
   differential role of the TPJ and mPFC, participants read several verbal
   descriptions about an agent. Embedded in a factorial design, in one-half
   of the trials (behavior condition), the agent was engaged in a simple
   goal-directed behavior, whereas in the other half this description was
   absent. In another half of the trials (trait condition), the
   participants had to answer a question about a trait of the agent,
   whereas in the other half the question was about the agent's physical
   appearance. The results revealed that the dorsal mPFC was recruited when
   participants inferred the agent's trait, irrespective of a behavioral
   description. In contrast, the TPJ, posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS), anterior intraparietal sulcus, and premotor cortex were
   activated when goal-directed behavioral information was presented,
   irrespective of a trait question. These findings confirm that in a
   social context, the TPJ (and pSTS) is activated for understanding
   goal-directed behaviors, whereas the mPFC is involved in processing

   action perception}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{606-621}},
Abstract = {{It has been proposed that common codes for vision and action emerge from
   associations between an individual's production and simultaneous
   observation of actions. This typically first-person view of one's own
   action subsequently transfers to the third-person view when observing
   another individual. We tested vision-action associations and the
   transfer from first-person to third-person perspective by comparing
   novel hand-action sequences that were learned under three conditions:
   first, by being performed and simultaneously viewed from a first-person
   perspective; second, by being performed but not seen; and third, by
   being seen from a first-person view without being executed. We then used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the response to
   these three types of learned action sequences when they were presented
   from a third-person perspective. Visuomotor areas responded most
   strongly to sequences that were learned by simultaneously producing and
   observing the action sequences. We also note an important asymmetry
   between vision and action: Action sequences learned by performance
   alone, in the absence of vision, facilitated the emergence of visuomotor
   responses, whereas action sequences learned by viewing alone had
   comparably little effect. This dominance of action over vision supports
   the notion of forward/predictive models of visuomotor systems.}},

Title = {{The neural substrates of social emotion perception and regulation are
   modulated by adult attachment style}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{473-493}},
Abstract = {{Adult attachment style (AAS) refers to individual differences in the way
   people experience and regulate their social relationships and
   corresponding emotions. Based on developmental and psychological
   research, it has been hypothesized that avoidant attachment style (AV)
   entails deactivating strategies in social contexts, whereas anxious
   attachment style (AX) involves hyper vigilance and up-regulation
   mechanisms. However, the neural substrates of differences in social
   emotion regulation associated with AAS have not been systematically
   investigated. Here we used fMRI in 19 healthy adults to investigate the
   effect of AAS on the processing of pleasant or unpleasant social and
   nonsocial scenes. Participants were asked either to naturally attend
   (NAT), cognitively reappraise (REAP), or behaviorally suppress (ESUP)
   their emotional responses. Avoidantly attached participants showed
   increased prefrontal and anterior cingulate activation to social
   negative scenes when making spontaneous emotion judgments. They also
   exhibited persistent increases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
   left amygdala activity for the same stimuli during reappraisal, as well
   as additional activation in supplementary motor area and ventral caudate
   during the suppression of social positive emotions. These results
   suggest that AV may imply less efficient reappraisal strategies to
   regulate social negative emotions, and lead to higher conflict or
   effortful control when suppression cannot be employed. In contrast,
   anxiously attached participants showed differential increases in the
   right amygdala and left parahippocampal cortex for social negative and
   positive stimuli, respectively, but only when making spontaneous emotion
   judgments. No effect of AX was found during down-regulation conditions.
   This suggests heightened arousal to negative information without
   difficulty in down-regulating emotions through cognitive re-evaluation
   or suppression. Taken together, these findings reveal for the first time
   the neural underpinnings of attachment-related differences in social
   emotion regulation.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{494-509}},
Abstract = {{This study uses fMRI to investigate the cognitive demands of
   decision-making in two types of cooperation games: a prisoner's dilemma
   (PD) eliciting a temptation to free-ride, leading to a dominant,
   self-interested response, and a stag hunt (SH) that has no dominant
   response but offers pay-off incentives that make mutual cooperation
   collectively beneficial but risky. Consequently, the PD poses greater
   conflict between self-and collective interest, greater demands for
   computational reasoning to derive the optimal solution, and greater
   demands for mentalizing to infer the intentions of others. Consistent
   with these differences between the two games, the results indicate that
   the PD is associated with increased activity in the anterior cingulate
   gyrus, prefrontal cortex, parietal lobe, and temporoparietal junction.
   With less conflict, the demands for computation and mentalizing are
   reduced in the SH, and cooperation levels increase dramatically. The
   differences in brain activation elicited by the different incentive
   structures of the PD and the SH appear to be independent of individual
   differences in revealed social preferences.}},

Pages = {{537-551}},
Abstract = {{Research findings show that proposers make surprisingly fair offers in
   the ultimatum and dictator games, an observation that contradicts
   predictions of classical game theory. The present functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) study examines brain activities of proposers
   that contribute to fair and unfair behaviors. We hypothesized that
   egoistic and altruistic motives of proposers affect fairness
   differentially in the two games. fMRI analysis revealed that the 28\% of
   fair offers in the present ultimatum game were related to enhanced
   activity in prefrontal areas, in particular, in regions involved in
   reward and theory of mind. This corroborates the idea that egoistic
   motives are primarily responsible for fair offers in this game, which we
   denote as strategic fairness. Fair offers in the dictator game, however,
   were related to increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. This supports the idea that
   altruistic motives primarily drive fair offers in the dictator game,
   denoted here as altruistic fairness.}},

   content to empathy}},
Journal = {{COGNITION \& EMOTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{995-1014}},
Abstract = {{Background: Facial expressions, prosody, and speech content constitute
   channels by which information is exchanged. Little is known about the
   simultaneous and differential contribution of these channels to empathy
   when they provide emotionality or neutrality. Especially neutralised
   speech content has gained little attention with regards to influencing
   the perception of other emotional cues. Methods: Participants were
   presented with video clips of actors telling short-stories. One
   condition conveyed emotionality in all channels while the other
   conditions either provided neutral speech content, facial expression, or
   prosody, respectively. Participants judged the emotion and intensity
   presented, as well as their own emotional state and intensity. Skin
   conductance served as a physiological measure of emotional reactivity.
   Results: Neutralising channels significantly reduced empathic responses.
   Electrodermal recordings confirmed these findings. The differential
   effect of the communication channels on empathy prerequisites was that
   target emotion recognition of the other decreased mostly when the face
   was neutral, whereas decreased emotional responses attributed to the
   target emotion were especially present in neutral speech. Conclusion:
   Multichannel integration supports conscious and autonomous measures of
   empathy and emotional reactivity. Emotional facial expressions influence
   emotion recognition, whereas speech content is important for responding
   with an adequate own emotional state, possibly reflecting contextual
   emotion-appraisal.}},

   provides robust evidence for a single-system model in preference to
   multiple-systems models. This evidence comes from several sources
   including studies of the effects of amnesia and ageing on explicit and

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{331-346}},
Abstract = {{Human peer relations provide tangible benefits, including food and
   protection, as well as emotional benefits. While social exclusion poses
   a threat to all of these benefits, the psychological threat is
   particularly susceptible to modulation by the relation of the excluders
   to the excluded person. The current study used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to explore the effects of manipulating the gender
   relation of participants to their excluders during an interactive
   ball-toss game. Ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation was higher
   during exclusion by same-gender peers, while right ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex activation negatively correlated with self-reported
   distress in other-gender exclusion. Results imply that exclusion by
   one's own gender is fundamentally different from exclusion by the
   opposite gender, and suggest a regulatory role for ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex in response to out-group exclusion. Individual
   differences in implicit gender attitudes modulated neural responses to
   exclusion. The importance of these findings to investigations of social
   cognition is discussed.}},

   a mere exposure paradigm}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{347-358}},
Abstract = {{Mere familiarization with a stimulus increases liking for it or similar
   stimuli ({''}mere exposure{''} effects) as well as perceptual fluency,
   indexed by the speed and accuracy of categorizing it or similar stimuli
   ({''}priming{''} effects). Candidate mechanisms proposed to explain mere
   exposure effects include both increased positive affect associated with
   greater perceptual fluency, and reduced negative affect associated with
   diminished apprehensiveness of novel stimuli. Although these two
   mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, it is difficult for behavioral
   measures to disentangle them, since increased liking or other indices of
   greater positive affect toward exposed stimuli could result from
   increases in positive feelings or decreases in negative feelings or
   both. The present study sought to clarify this issue by building on
   research showing a dissociation at the neural level in which the lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex (LOFC) is activated more by negatively valenced
   than by neutral or positively valenced stimuli, with the reverse effect
   for medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC). Supporting the reduced
   apprehensiveness hypothesis, we found lower LOFC activation to
   familiarized faces and objects (repetition suppression). We did not find
   evidence to support the positive affect hypothesis in increased
   activation to familiarized stimuli in MOFC or in other parts of the
   reward circuit that respond more to positively valenced stimuli
   (repetition enhancement), although enhancement effects were shown in
   some regions.}},

Abstract = {{In adapting our behavior to a rapidly changing environment, we also tune
   our behavior to that of others. To investigate the neural bases of such
   adaptive mechanisms, we examined how individuals adjust their actions
   after decision-conflicts observed in others compared to self-experienced
   conflicts. Participants responded to the color of a stimulus, while its
   spatial position elicited either a conflicting or a congruent action.
   Participants were required either to respond to stimuli themselves or to
   observe the response of another participant. We studied the difference
   between interference effects following conflicting or congruent stimuli,
   an effect known as conflict adaptation. Consistent with earlier reports,
   we found that the implementation of reactive control, following
   congruent trials, was accompanied by activation of the right inferior
   frontal cortex. Individual differences in the efficacy of response
   inhibition covaried with the level of activation in that region.
   Sustaining proactive control, following incongruent trials, activated
   the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Most importantly, adaptive controls
   induced by decision-conflicts observed in others, as well as the
   associated prefrontal activations, were comparable to those induced by
   self-experienced conflicts. We show that in both behavioral and neural
   terms we adapt to conflicts happening to others just as if they happened
   to us.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{398-409}},
Abstract = {{Currently, potential jurors' racial biases are measured by explicit
   questioning-a poor measure because people often hide their views to
   adhere to social norms, and people have implicit views they are not
   consciously aware of. In this experiment, we investigated whether two
   alternative methods of measuring racial bias-a standard Black/White,
   good/bad Implicit Association Test (IAT) and neural activity, measured
   by fMRI, in response to seeing faces of Black and White
   individuals-could predict how much money subjects would award Black
   victims in hypothetical employment discrimination cases. IAT scores
   failed to predict how much money subjects awarded victims. However, in
   right inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and in right superior/middle
   frontal gyrus (BA 9/10)-which have both previously been implicated in
   measuring biases and implicit preferences-the difference in neural
   activity between when subjects viewed Black faces paired with neutral
   adjectives and when subjects viewed White faces paired with neutral
   adjectives was positively correlated with the amount of money the
   subjects awarded victims. This suggests that brain activity measures
   racial bias with more practical validity, at least in this situation and
   with our sample size, than a common behavioral measure (the IAT).}},

   decisions}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{424-435}},
Abstract = {{The ability to attribute mental states to others and understand the
   basis of their decisions is essential for human social interaction. A
   controversial theory states that this is achieved by simulating
   another's information processing in one's own neural circuits. The
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is known to play an important role in
   the registration of discrepancies between the predicted and actual
   outcomes of decisions (prediction errors). When positive and negative
   feedback fails altogether, the failure may also signal errors in the
   prediction that the outcome of that decision would be informative and
   guide future decisions. Does the ACC signal that an outcome is
   unexpectedly uninformative? When an outcome directed to others is
   uninformative, do we understand their mental states by simulating them
   in the circuits of the ACC in our own brain? The aim of our study was to
   test for these two possibilities in the human brain with event-related
   fMRI. We tested whether the ACC processes errors in the prediction of
   informative feedback and whether the ACC is also activated when scanned
   subjects process the same outcomes of another's decisions. We show that
   each is processed by a separate subregion of the ACC.}},

Abstract = {{Mind reading is the ability to understand another person's thoughts,
   intentions, and feelings (Whiten, 1991). The purpose of this study was
   to clarify which part of the brain is evoked while mind reading in
   functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiments, using a mind
   reading task, the Reading Mind in the Eyes Test (RME: Baron-Cohen et
   al., 2001) with four choices (mental state words). The participants were
   right-handed and sex-matched healthy Japanese university students (10
   males and 10 females, age range 19-25). We used periodic ABA ... block
   design in the fMRI sessions. Task A (an experimental task) was the mind
   reading task and Task B (a control task) was the age-gender task. In
   order to clarify the activated region of the brain while mind reading,
   we calculated the difference between the degrees of BOLD
   (Blood-oxygen-level dependent) activation during the Task A and Task B.
   The results showed that there was a significant difference in activation
   of the right superior occipital gyrus, and the left parietal lobe. These
   findings indicated that these regions were used while mind reading. The
   role of these regions was discussed in terms of the findings from
   previous studies.}},

   presents clinicians and research teams with a unique set of problems.
   These include procedural difficulties (e. g., participant anxiety or

   challenge of choosing the most appropriate analysis methods for
   pediatric imaging data. Here, we summarize and review pediatric imaging
   and analysis tools and present neuroimaging protocols for young

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence shows that the neural circuits involved in beat
   perception overlap with motor circuitry even in the absence of overt
   movement. This study investigated effects of tempo on beat-based
   processing by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with a
   perceptual timing paradigm where participants made simple temporal
   judgments about short rhythmic sequences. Of central interest were
   judgments about ambiguous test rhythms where the perceived direction of
   a timing deviation ({''}speeding up{''} vs. ``slowing down{''}) depended
   on the induction of an implied beat. Successful beat induction was
   reduced when the implied beat was at a slower tempo (1,500 ms) than when
   it was at a faster tempo (600 ms). Decreased beat induction was
   accompanied by decreased functional activity in the basal ganglia,
   premotor and supplementary motor regions, and thalamus. Findings support
   the conclusion that rhythms presented at a slow tempo reduce involvement
   of a striato-thalamo-cortico network in beat-based processing.}},

   cultural environment in which we live. Although cultural-invariant,
   universal principles certainly contribute to sound processing, cultural
   factors play a role as well. In this review paper, we discuss two
   potential sources of cultural influence on auditory perception. We term
   the first type bottom-up, and use it to refer to the way that increased
   exposure to particular kinds of sound could shape our auditory and
   auditory-neural responses. The second type we term top-down, and use it
   to refer to the way our cultural upbringing broadly shapes how we think,
   which may in turn have an impact on how we perceive the world. An
   important consideration regarding cultural influences is that many
   individuals grow up with exposure to environmental stimulations of more
   than one culture. In our discussion, we will consider both mono- and
   bicultural experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Singing in one's mind or forming expectations about upcoming notes both
   require that mental images of one or more pitches will be generated. As
   with other musical abilities, the acuity with which such images are
   formed might be expected to vary across individuals and may depend on
   musical training. Results from several behavioral tasks involving
   intonation judgments indicate that multiple memory systems contribute to
   the formation of accurate mental images for pitch, and that the
   functionality of each is affected by musical training.
   Electrophysiological measures indicate that the ability to form accurate
   mental images is associated with greater engagement of auditory areas
   and associated error-detection circuitry when listeners imagine
   ascending scales and make intonation judgments about target notes. A
   view of auditory mental images is espoused in which unified mental image
   representations are distributed across multiple brain areas. Each brain
   area helps shape the acuity of the unified representation based on
   current behavioral demands and past experience.}},

Abstract = {{Musical imagery is associated with neural activity in auditory cortex,
   but prior studies have not examined musical imagery tasks requiring
   mental transformations. This paper describes functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies requiring manipulation of musical
   information. In one set of experiments, listeners were asked to mentally
   reverse a familiar tune when presented backwards. This manipulation
   consistently elicits neural activity in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS).
   Separate experiments requiring judgments about melodies that have been
   transposed from one musical key to another also elicit IPS activation.
   Conjunction analyses indicate that the same portions of the IPS are
   recruited in both tasks. The findings suggest that the dorsal pathway of
   auditory processing is involved in the manipulation and transformation
   of auditory information, as has also been shown for visuomotor and
   visuospatial tasks. As such, it provides a substrate for the creation of
   new mental representations that are based on manipulation of previously
   experienced sensory events.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a preliminary study based on the theoretical
   assumption that continuous closed-loop audio-motor control could be
   disadvantageous for pianists. It is argued that the functional
   relationship between the intracerebral electrical activations in the
   auditory and premotor cortex should be rhythmically decreased and
   increased. To test this hypothesis, intracerebral electrical activations
   for the auditory and premotor cortex were estimated using scalp EEG and
   standardized low-resolution electrical tomography (sLORETA). The
   extracted times series were subjected to a Granger causality analysis,
   revealing a causal relationship from the auditory cortex to the premotor
   cortex that was considerably stronger during piano playing and weaker
   during rest. Importantly, this relationship varied rhythmically during
   the course of piano playing, with lags (obtained with
   cross-correlations) between 666 ms and 820 milliseconds. This study thus
   delivers evidence that the functional coupling between the auditory and
   premotor cortex varies during piano playing.}},

Abstract = {{Precise timing of sound is crucial in music for both performing and
   listening. Indeed, listening to rhythmic sound sequences activates not
   only the auditory system but also the sensorimotor system. Previously,
   we showed the significance of neural beta-band oscillations (15-30 Hz)
   for the timing processing that involves such auditory-motor
   coordination. Thus, we hypothesized that motor rehabilitation training
   incorporating music playing will stimulate and enhance auditory-motor
   interaction in stroke patients. We examined three chronic patients who
   received Music-Supported Therapy following the protocols practiced by
   Schneider. Neuromagnetic beta-band activity was remarkably alike during
   passive listening to ametronome and during finger tapping, with or
   without the metronome, for either the paretic or nonparetic hand,
   suggesting a shared mechanism of the beta modulation. In the listening
   task, the magnitude of the beta decrease after the tone onset was more
   pronounced at the posttraining time point and was accompanied by
   improved arm and hand skills. The present case data give insight into
   the neural underpinnings of rehabilitation with music making and
   rhythmic auditory stimulation.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to carry a tune, natural for the majority, is underpinned by
   a complex functional system (i.e., the vocal sensorimotor loop, VSL).
   The VSL involves various components, including perceptual mechanisms,
   auditory-motor mapping, motor control, and memory. The malfunction of
   one of these components can bring about poor-pitch singing. So far,
   disturbed perception and deficient sensorimotor mapping have been
   treated as important causes of poor singing. Yet, memory has been paid
   relatively little attention. Here, we review results obtained from both
   occasional singers and individuals suffering from congenital amusia, who
   were asked to produce from memory or imitate a well-known melody under
   conditions with different memory loads. The findings point to memory as
   a relevant source of impairment in poor-pitch singing and to imitation
   as a useful aid for poor singers.}},

Pages = {{147-165}},
Abstract = {{In early-nineteenth-century Europe, dance was an essential part of
   celebration and recreation in both city and country and of the rich
   social and cultural context within which music was performed. As has
   often been noted, however, the cultural practices of
   early-nineteenth-century Europe underwent a number of profound changes,
   and the practices surrounding music and dance were no exception. While
   in the years before 1800, a clear distinction existed between dance
   music for a privileged few and dance music for everyone else,
   circumstances began to change, and by the 1820s the line between dance
   for the few and dance for the many had blurred, or, in many cases-and
   the waltz certainly represented one of them-all but disappeared. As a
   consequence of this change, the meaning to which dance music gave rise
   in the early nineteenth century also changed: Dance music might be for a
   literal dance or it might be for a quasi-dramatic evocation of the
   dance, but its role as a way to structure musical discourse-that is, the
   resource it offered as a musical topic-became decidedly attenuated.
   Recent research in cognitive science can help explain why dance topics
   in the eighteenth century were so effective, but to discover why the
   meaning of dance music in general, and dance topics in particular,
   changed so significantly in the early nineteenth century, we must look
   elsewhere. In the musical universe consequent to this change, there was
   music to accompany the whirl and press of ballroom dance, music that
   called forth memories of the whirl and press of ballroom dance, and
   little else in between.}},

   understanding the factors that cause us to believe that a mental
   experience is a memory of an actual past experience. According to the

   make about our mental experiences based on their subjective qualities,
   our prior knowledge and beliefs, our motives and goals, and the social
   context. From this perspective, we discuss cognitive behavioral studies
   using both objective (e.g., recognition, source memory) and subjective
   (e.g., ratings of memory characteristics) measures that provide much
   information about the encoding, revival and monitoring processes that
   yield both true and false memories. The chapter also considers how
   neuroimaging findings, especially from functional magnetic resonance
   imaging studies, are contributing to our understanding of the relation

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) show impaired emotional
   responses to self-face processing, but the underlying neural bases are
   unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated
   brain activity when 15 individuals with high-functioning ASD and 15
   controls rated the photogenicity of self-face images and photographs of
   others' faces. Controls showed a strong correlation between
   photogenicity ratings and extent of embarrassment evoked by self-face
   images; this correlation was weaker among ASD individuals, indicating a
   decoupling between the cognitive evaluation of self-face images and
   emotional responses. Individuals with ASD demonstrated relatively low
   self-related activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), which was
   related to specific autistic traits. There were significant group
   differences in the modulation of activity by embarrassment ratings in
   the right insular (IC) and lateral orbitofrontal cortices. Task-related
   activity in the right IC was lower in the ASD group. The reduced
   activity in the right IC for self-face images was associated with weak
   coupling between cognitive evaluation and emotional responses to
   self-face images. The PCC is responsible for self-referential
   processing, and the IC plays a role in emotional experience. Dysfunction
   in these areas could contribute to the lack of self-conscious behaviors
   in response to self-reflection in ASD individuals.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{252-268}},
Abstract = {{We examined how individual differences in mood and anxiety in the early
   postpartum period are related to brain response to infant stimuli during
   fMRI, with particular focus on regions implicated in both maternal
   behavior and mood/anxiety, that is, the subgenual anterior cingulate
   cortex (sgACC) and the amygdala. At approximately 3 months postpartum,
   22 mothers completed an affect-rating task (ART) during fMRI, where
   their affective response to infant stimuli was explicitly probed.
   Mothers viewed/rated four infant face conditions: own positive (OP), own
   negative (ON), unfamiliar positive (UP), and unfamiliar negative (UN).
   Mood and anxiety were measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
   Scale (EDPS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Version
   (STAI-T); maternal factors related to parental stress and attachment
   were also assessed. Brain-imaging data underwent a random-effects
   analysis, and cluster-based statistical thresholding was applied to the
   following contrasts: OP-UP, ON-UN, OP-ON, and UP-UN. Our main finding
   was that poorer quality of maternal experience was significantly related
   to reduced amygdala response to OP compared to UP infant faces. Our
   results suggest that, in human mothers, infant-related amygdala function
   may be an important factor in maternal anxiety/mood, in quality of
   mothering, and in individual differences in the motivation to mother.}},

   traits and social identities}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{280-291}},
Abstract = {{Cross-cultural studies have shown that personality traits are less
   central and social identities are more important to the selfhood of
   collectivistic people. However, most cultural neuroscience studies using
   the self-reference effect (SRE) paradigm have only used personality
   traits to explore cultural differences in the neural circuits of
   self-referential processes. In the present study, we used both
   personality traits and social identities as stimuli in the SRE paradigm
   and investigated whether and how one's cultural orientation (i.e.,
   individualism vs. collectivism) affects the SRE in the brain. The
   results showed that the medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate,
   bilateral temporoparietal regions, and precuneus were involved in
   self-representation for both personality traits and social identities.
   Importantly, cultural orientation predicted differential activation
   patterns in these regions. Collectivists showed stronger activation in
   the left temporoparietal regions than individualists, who mainly
   recruited the medial prefrontal regions. Our findings suggest that the
   personal and social self share common neural substrates, the activation
   of which can be modulated by one's cultural orientation.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{301-310}},
Abstract = {{Typical adult observers demonstrate enhanced behavioral sensitivity to
   human movement compared to animal movement. Yet, the neural
   underpinnings of this effect are unknown. We examined the tuning of
   brain mechanisms for the perception of biological motion to the social
   relevance of this category of motion by comparing neural response to
   human and non-human biological motion. In particular, we tested the
   hypothesis that the response of the right posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (pSTS) varies according to the social relevance of the motion,
   responding most strongly to those biological motions with the greatest
   social relevance (human > dog). During a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) session, typical adults viewed veridical point-light
   displays of human, dog, and tractor motions created from motion capture
   data. A conjunction analysis identified regions of significant
   activation during biological motion perception relative to object
   motion. Within each of these regions, only one brain area, the right
   pSTS, revealed an enhanced response to human motion relative to dog
   motion. This finding demonstrates that the pSTS response is sensitive to
   the social relevance of a biological motion stimulus.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{317-330}},
Abstract = {{How specialized is the infant brain for processing voice within our
   environment? Research in adults suggests that portions of the temporal
   lobe play an important role in differentiating vocalizations from other
   environmental sounds; however, very little is known about this process
   in infancy. Recent research in infants has revealed discrepancies in the
   cortical location of voice-selective activation, as well as the age of
   onset of this response. The current study used functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS) to further investigate voice processing in awake
   4-7-month-old infants. In listening to voice and non-voice sounds, there
   was robust and widespread activation in bilateral temporal cortex.
   Further, voice-selective regions of the bilateral anterior temporal
   cortex evidenced a steady increase in voice selective activation (voice
   > non-voice activation) over 4-7 months of age. These findings support a
   growing body of evidence that the emergence of cerebral specialization
   for human voice sounds evolves over the first 6 months of age.}},

Abstract = {{A core goal for marketers is effective segmentation: partitioning a
   brand's or product's consumer base into distinct and meaningful groups
   with differing needs. Traditional segmentation data include factors like
   geographic location, demographics, and shopping history. Yet, research
   into the cognitive and affective processes underlying consumption
   decisions shows that these variables can improve the matching of
   consumers with products beyond traditional demographic and benefit
   approaches. We propose, using managing a brand as an example, that
   neuroscience provides a novel way to establish mappings between
   cognitive processes and traditional marketing data. An improved
   understanding of the neural mechanisms of decision making will enhance
   the ability of marketers to effectively market their products. Just as
   neuroscience can model potential influences on the decision process
   including pricing, choice strategy, context, experience, and memory it
   can also provide new insights into individual differences in consumption
   behavior and brand preferences. We outline such a research agenda for
   incorporating neuroscience data into future attempts to match consumers

Abstract = {{The self-reference effect (SRE), by which encoding of information is
   done in a self-referential manner (e.g., ``Does the word describe
   you?{''}), enhances subsequent memory performance. It is thought to
   reflect that self-reference is a highly practiced task in everyday life.
   Accordingly, it is expected that the types of tasks that produce memory
   enhancement vary according to individual differences of past
   experiences. On the basis of neuroimaging studies, we hypothesized that
   social desirability reference ({''}Is this word socially desirable?{''})
   produces memory enhancement as with SRE in people who have chosen
   altruistic behavior frequently. Participants processed trait adjectives
   in relation to themselves, social desirability, and meaning. Then they
   performed a free recall task. The self-report altruism scale was used to
   assess the frequency of past altruistic behavior. Consistent with our
   prediction, the social desirability reference yielded the best retention
   in the high-altruism group. SRE was observed only in the low-altruism
   group.}},

Abstract = {{In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we
   investigated the role of different brain regions in separate aspects of
   mentalizing. Young females aged 18-19 years were asked to imagine a
   social situation and answer a question. Perspective, self and other, as
   well as content, emotion, and behavior, were varied. Activation was
   observed in the left precuneus, left temporoparietal junction, left
   medial prefrontal cortex and left middle temporal gyrus. Left precuneus
   and left temporoparietal junction were recruited more when taking the
   perspective of other than when taking the perspective of self. Medial
   prefrontal areas might be more involved during mentalizing about emotion
   versus baseline than about behavior versus baseline.}},

Title = {{Atypical Neural Processing of Ironic and Sincere Remarks in Children and
   Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders}},
Journal = {{METAPHOR AND SYMBOL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{70-92}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with ASD show consistent impairment in processing pragmatic
   language when attention to multiple social cues (e.g., facial
   expression, tone of voice) is often needed to navigate social
   interactions. Building upon prior fMRI work examining how facial affect
   and prosodic cues are used to infer a speaker's communicative intent,
   the authors examined whether children and adolescents with ASD differ
   from typically developing (TD) controls in their processing of sincere
   versus ironic remarks. At the behavioral level, children and adolescents
   with ASD and matched TD controls were able to determine whether a
   speaker's remark was sincere or ironic equally well, with both groups
   showing longer response times for ironic remarks. At the neural level,
   for both sincere and ironic scenarios, an extended cortical
   network-including canonical language areas in the left hemisphere and
   their right hemisphere counterparts-was activated in both groups, albeit
   to a lesser degree in the ASD sample. Despite overall similar patterns
   of activity observed for the two conditions in both groups, significant
   modulation of activity was detected when directly comparing sincere and
   ironic scenarios within and between groups. While both TD and ASD groups
   showed significantly greater activity in several nodes of this extended
   network when processing ironic versus sincere remarks, increased
   activity was largely confined to left language areas in TD controls,
   whereas the ASD sample showed a more bilateral activation profile which
   included both language and ``theory of mind{''} areas (i.e.,
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex). These findings suggest that, for
   high-functioning individuals with ASD, increased activity in right
   hemisphere homologues of language areas in the left hemisphere, as well
   as regions involved in social cognition, may reflect compensatory
   mechanisms supporting normative behavioral task performance.}},

Title = {{When family looks strange and strangers look normal: A case of impaired
   face perception and recognition after stroke}},
Journal = {{NEUROCASE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-49}},
Abstract = {{We describe a patient (JS) with impaired recognition and distorted
   visual perception of faces after an ischemic stroke. Strikingly, JS
   reports that the faces of family members look distorted, while faces of
   other people look normal. After neurological and neuropsychological
   examination, we assessed response accuracy, response times, and skin
   conductance responses on a face recognition task in which photographs of
   close family members, celebrities and unfamiliar people were presented.
   JS' performance was compared to the performance of three healthy control
   participants. Results indicate that three aspects of face perception
   appear to be impaired in JS. First, she has impaired recognition of
   basic emotional expressions. Second, JS has poor recognition of familiar
   faces in general, but recognition of close family members is
   disproportionally impaired compared to faces of celebrities. Third, JS
   perceives faces of family members as distorted. In this paper we
   consider whether these impairments can be interpreted in terms of
   previously described disorders of face perception and recent models for
   face perception.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{1-10}},
Abstract = {{The neuroscience of morality has focused on how morality works and where
   it is in the brain. In tackling these questions, researchers have taken
   both domain-specific and domain-general approaches-searching for neural
   substrates and systems dedicated to moral cognition versus
   characterizing the contributions of domain-general processes. Where in
   the brain is morality? On one hand, morality is made up of complex
   cognitive processes, deployed across many domains and housed all over
   the brain. On the other hand, no neural substrate or system that
   uniquely supports moral cognition has been found. In this review, we
   will discuss early assumptions of domain-specificity in moral
   neuroscience as well as subsequent investigations of domain-general
   contributions, taking emotion and social cognition (i.e., theory of
   mind) as case studies. Finally, we will consider possible cognitive
   accounts of a domain-specific morality: Does uniquely moral cognition
   exist?}},
