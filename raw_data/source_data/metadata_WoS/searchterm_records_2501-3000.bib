Title = {{Oxytocin reduces neural activity in the pain circuitry when seeing pain

Abstract = {{Our empathetic abilities allow us to feel the pain of others. This
   phenomenon of vicarious feeling arises because the neural circuitry of
   feeling pain and seeing pain in others is shared. The neuropeptide
   oxytocin (OXT) is considered a robust facilitator of empathy, as
   intranasal OXT studies have repeatedly been shown to improve cognitive
   empathy (e.g. mind reading and emotion recognition). However, OXT has
   not yet been shown to increase neural empathic responses to pain in
   others, a core aspect of affective empathy. Effects of OXT on empathy
   for pain are difficult to predict, because OXT evidently has
   pain-reducing properties. Accordingly, OXT might paradoxically decrease
   empathy for pain. Here, using functional neuroimaging we show robust
   activation in the neural circuitry of pain (insula and sensorimotor
   regions) when subjects observe pain in others. Crucially, this
   empathy-related activation in the neural circuitry of pain is strongly
   reduced after intranasal OXT, specifically in the left insula. OXT on
   the basis of our neuroimaging data thus remarkably decreases empathy for
   pain, but further research including behavioral measures is necessary to
   draw definite conclusions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A large family of vomeronasal receptors recognizes pheromone cues in
   many animals including most amphibia, reptiles, rhodents, and other
   mammals. Humans possess five vomeronasal-type 1 receptor genes
   (VN1R1-VN1R5), which code for proteins that are functional in
   recombinant expression systems. We used two different recombinant
   expression systems and identified Hedione as a ligand for the putative
   human pheromone receptor VN1R1 expressed in the human olfactory mucosa.
   Following the ligand identification, we employed functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy volunteers to characterize the in
   vivo action of the VN1R1 ligand Hedione. In comparison to a common
   floral odor (phenylethyl alcohol), Hedione exhibited significantly
   enhanced activation in limbic areas (amygdala, hippocampus) and elicited
   a sex-differentiated response in a hypothalamic region that is
   associated with hormonal release.
   Utilizing a novel combination of methods, our results indicate that the
   putative human pheromone receptor VN1R1 is involved in extra-olfactory
   neuronal activations induced by the odorous substance Hedione. The
   activation of VN1R1 might play a role in gender-specific modulation of
   hormonal secretion in humans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Is avolition in schizophrenia associated with a deficit of dorsal

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background. The neurobiological underpinnings of avolition in
   schizophrenia remain unclear. Most brain imaging research has focused on
   reward prediction deficit and on ventral striatum dysfunction, but
   findings are not consistent. In the light of accumulating evidence that
   both ventral striatum and dorsal caudate play a key role in motivation,
   we investigated ventral striatum and dorsal caudate activation during
   processing of reward or loss in patients with schizophrenia.
   Method. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to study brain
   activation during a Monetary Incentive Delay task in patients with
   schizophrenia, treated with second-generation antipsychotics only, and
   in healthy controls (HC). We also assessed the relationships of ventral
   striatum and dorsal caudate activation with measures of hedonic
   experience and motivation.
   Results. The whole patient group had lower motivation but comparable
   hedonic experience and striatal activation than HC. Patients with high
   avolition scores showed lower dorsal caudate activation than both HC and
   patients with low avolition scores. A lower dorsal caudate activation
   was also observed in patients with deficit schizophrenia compared to HC
   and patients with non-deficit schizophrenia. Dorsal caudate activity
   during reward anticipation was significantly associated with avolition,
   but not with anhedonia in the patient group.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest that avolition in schizophrenia is
   linked to dorsal caudate hypoactivation.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{286}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence suggests that testosterone may play a role in the
   pathophysiology of schizophrenia given that testosterone has been linked
   to cognition and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Here, we determine
   the extent to which serum testosterone levels are related to neural
   activity in affective processing circuitry in men with schizophrenia.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal changes as 32 healthy controls and
   26 people with schizophrenia performed a facial emotion identification
   task. Whole brain analyses were performed to determine regions of
   differential activity between groups during processing of angry versus
   non-threatening faces. A follow-up ROI analysis using a regression model
   in a subset of 16 healthy men and 16 men with schizophrenia was used to
   determine the extent to which serum testosterone levels were related to
   neural activity. Healthy controls displayed significantly greater
   activation than people with schizophrenia in the left inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG). There was no significant difference in circulating
   testosterone levels between healthy men and men with schizophrenia.
   Regression analyses between activation in the IFG and circulating
   testosterone levels revealed a significant positive correlation in men
   with schizophrenia (r=.63, p=.01) and no significant relationship in
   healthy men. This study provides the first evidence that circulating
   serum testosterone levels are related to IFG activation during emotion
   face processing in men with schizophrenia but not in healthy men, which
   suggests that testosterone levels modulate neural processes relevant to
   facial emotion processing that may interfere with social functioning in
   men with schizophrenia. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that brain activity is modulated by trait social
   anxiety, we measured the Hurst Exponent (HE), an index of complexity in
   time series, in healthy individuals at rest in the absence of any social
   trigger. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series were
   recorded in 36 subjects at rest. All volunteers were healthy without
   arty psychiatric, medical or neurological disorder. Subjects completed
   the Lebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and the Brief Fear of Negative
   Evaluation (BFNE) to assess social anxiety and thoughts in social
   contexts. We also obtained the fractional Amplitude of Low Frequency
   Fluctuations (fALFF) of the BOLD signal as art independent control
   measure for HE data BFNE scores correlated positively with HE in the
   posterior cingulate/precuneus, while LSAS scores correlated positively
   with HE in the precuneus, in the inferior parietal sulci and in the
   parahippocarnus. Results from fALFF were highly consistent with those
   obtained using LSAS and BFNE to predict HE. Overall our data indicate
   that spontaneous brain activity is influenced by the degree of social
   anxiety, on a continuum and in the absence of social stimuli. These
   Findings suggest that social anxiety is a trait characteristic that
   shapes brain activity and predisposes to different reactions in social
   contexts. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier lreland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In healthy individuals, direct eye contact is thought to modulate a
   cortical route eliciting social cognitive processes via activation of a
   fast subcortical pathway. This study aimed to examine functional brain
   connectivity during direct eye contact in women with posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD) related to childhood abuse as compared with
   healthy controls. We conducted psychophysiological interaction (PPI)
   analyses in Statistical Parametric Mapping-8 (SPM8) using the superior
   colliculus (SC) and locus coeruleus (LC) as seed regions while 16
   healthy subjects and 16 patients with a primary diagnosis of PTSD
   related to childhood maltreatment viewed a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) paradigm involving direct (D) versus averted (A) gaze
   (happy, sad, neutral). The PTSD group showed a significantly enhanced
   connectivity between the SC and the anterior cingulate, and between the
   LC and the thalamus, caudate, putamen, insula, cingulate gyrus, and
   amygdala, as compared with healthy individuals. Symptom severity scores
   on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) showed significant
   positive correlations with superior colliculus connectivity with the
   perigenual and posterior cingulate, insula, and sublenticular extended
   amygdala. Functional connectivity data suggest increased recruitment of
   brain regions involved in emotion processing during direct gaze in PTSD
   in association with the fast subcortical pathway. The interpretation of
   eye contact as a signal of threat may require more emotion regulatory
   capacities in patients with PTSD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Title = {{Methylation of NR3C1 is related to maternal PTSD, parenting stress and

Abstract = {{Prior research has shown that mothers with Interpersonal
   violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (IPV-PTSD) report greater
   difficulty in parenting their toddlers. Relative to their frequent early
   exposure to violence and maltreatment, these mothers display
   dysregulation of their hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA-axis),
   characterized by hypocortisolism. Considering methylation of the
   promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 as a marker
   for HPA-axis functioning, with less methylation likely being associated
   with less circulating cortisol, the present study tested the hypothesis
   that the degree of methylation of this gene would be negatively
   correlated with maternal IPV-PTSD severity and parenting stress, and
   positively correlated with medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) activity in
   response to video-stimuli of stressful versus non-stressful mother child
   interactions. Following a mental health assessment, 45 mothers and their
   children (ages 12-42 months) participated in a behavioral protocol
   involving free-play and laboratory stressors such as mother child
   separation. Maternal DNA was extracted from saliva. Interactive behavior
   was rated on the CARE-Index. During subsequent fMRI scanning, mothers
   were shown films of free-play and separation drawn from this protocol.
   Maternal PTSD severity and parenting stress were negatively correlated
   with the mean percentage of methylation of NR3C1. Maternal mPFC activity
   in response to video-stimuli of mother child separation versus play
   correlated positively to NR3C1 methylation, and negatively to maternal
   IPV-PTSD and parenting stress. Among interactive behavior variables,
   child cooperativeness in play was positively correlated with NR3C1
   methylation. Thus, the present study is the first published report to
   our knowledge, suggesting convergence of behavioral, epigenetic, and
   neuroimaging data that form a psychobiological signature of
   parenting-risk in the context of early life stress and PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{Impairment in empathy has been demonstrated in patients with
   schizophrenia and individuals with psychosis proneness. In the present
   study, we examined the neural correlates underlying theory of mind (ToM)
   and empathy and the relationships between these two social cognitive
   abilities with schizotypy. Fifty-six first-year college students (31
   males, 25 females) between 17 and 21 years of age (M = 19.3, SD = 0.9)
   from a medical university in China participated. All participants
   undertook a comic strips functional imaging task that specifically
   examined both empathy and ToM. In addition, they completed two
   self-report scales: the Chapman Psychosis Proneness scale and the
   Interpersonal Responsivity Index (IRI). Results showed that both empathy
   and ToM conditions of the task were associated with brain activity in
   the middle temporal gyrus, the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), the
   precuneus and the posterior cingulate gyrus. In addition, we found
   positive correlations between negative schizotypy and brain activity in
   regions involved in social cognition, namely, the middle temporal gyrus,
   the TPJ, as well as the medial prefrontal gyrus. These findings
   highlight that different dimensions of schizotypy may show different
   associations with brain regions involved in social cognitive abilities.
   More importantly, the positive correlation between brain activity and
   anhedonia suggests the presence of compensatory mechanisms in high-risk
   populations.}},

Title = {{Language Differences in the Brain Network for Reading in Naturalistic
   Story Reading and Lexical Decision}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Differences in how writing systems represent language raise important
   questions about whether there could be a universal functional
   architecture for reading across languages. In order to study potential
   language differences in the neural networks that support reading skill,
   we collected fMRI data from readers of alphabetic (English) and
   morpho-syllabic (Chinese) writing systems during two reading tasks. In
   one, participants read short stories under conditions that approximate
   natural reading, and in the other, participants decided whether
   individual stimuli were real words or not. Prior work comparing these
   two writing systems has overwhelmingly used meta-linguistic tasks,
   generally supporting the conclusion that the reading system is organized
   differently for skilled readers of Chinese and English. We observed that
   language differences in the reading network were greatly dependent on
   task. In lexical decision, a pattern consistent with prior research was
   observed in which the Middle Frontal Gyrus (MFG) and right Fusiform
   Gyrus (rFFG) were more active for Chinese than for English, whereas the
   posterior temporal sulcus was more active for English than for Chinese.
   We found a very different pattern of language effects in a naturalistic
   reading paradigm, during which significant differences were only
   observed in visual regions not typically considered specific to the
   reading network, and the middle temporal gyrus, which is thought to be
   important for direct mapping of orthography to semantics. Indeed, in
   areas that are often discussed as supporting distinct cognitive or
   linguistic functions between the two languages, we observed interaction.
   Specifically, language differences were most pronounced in MFG and rFFG
   during the lexical decision task, whereas no language differences were
   observed in these areas during silent reading of text for comprehension.}},

Title = {{No difference in frontal cortical activity during an executive
   functioning task after acute doses of aripiprazole and haloperidol}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic drug that is
   characterized by partial dopamine D2 receptor agonism. Its
   pharmacodynamic profile is proposed to be beneficial in the treatment of
   cognitive impairment, which is prevalent in psychotic disorders. This
   study compared brain activation characteristics produced by aripiprazole
   with that of haloperidol, a typical D2 receptor antagonist, during a
   task targeting executive functioning.
   Methods: Healthy participants received an acute oral dose of
   haloperidol, aripiprazole or placebo before performing an executive
   functioning task while blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was carried out.
   Results: There was a tendency towards reduced performance in the
   aripiprazole group compared to the two other groups. The image analysis
   yielded a strong taskrelated BOLD-fMRI response within each group. An
   uncorrected between-group analysis showed that aripiprazole challenge
   resulted in stronger activation in the frontal and temporal gyri and the
   putamen compared with haloperidol challenge, but after correcting for
   multiple testing there was no significant group difference.
   Conclusion: No significant group differences between aripiprazole and
   haloperidol in frontal cortical activation were obtained when corrected
   for multiple comparisons. This study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov
   (identifier: 2009-016222-14).(1)}},

Title = {{fMRI Study of Social Anxiety during Social Ostracism with and without
   Emotional Support}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{Social anxiety is characterized by an excessive fear of being
   embarrassed in social interactions or social performance situations.
   Emotional support can help to decrease or diminish social distress. Such
   support may play an important role at different points of social
   interaction. However, it is unclear how the beneficial effects of social
   support are represented in the brains of socially anxious individuals.
   To explore this, we used the same paradigm previously used to examine
   the effects of emotional support on social pain caused by exclusion.
   Undergraduates (n = 46) showing a wide range of social anxiety scores
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while
   participating in a Cyberball game. Participants were initially included
   and later excluded from the game. In the latter half of the session in
   which participants were excluded, they were provided with supportive
   messages. In line with our previous work, we found that social exclusion
   led to increased anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity, whereas
   emotional support led to increased left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC) activity. Despite validation of the paradigm, social anxiety was
   not associated with increased ACC activity during social exclusion, or
   during perceived emotional support. Instead, fear of negative evaluation
   as assessed by the Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation (BFNE) scale showed
   positive associations with left DLPFC activation while receiving
   emotional support, compared to while being socially excluded. The more
   socially anxious an individual was, the greater was the left DLPFC
   activity increased during receipt of messages. This suggests that highly
   socially anxious people still have the ability to perceive social
   support, but that they are nevertheless susceptible to negative
   evaluation by others.}},

Title = {{fMRI measurements of amygdala activation are confounded by stimulus
   correlated signal fluctuation in nearby veins draining distant brain
   regions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Imaging the amygdala with functional MRI is confounded by multiple
   averse factors, notably signal dropouts due to magnetic inhomogeneity
   and low signal-to-noise ratio, making it difficult to obtain consistent
   activation patterns in this region. However, even when consistent signal
   changes are identified, they are likely to be due to nearby vessels,
   most notably the basal vein of rosenthal (BVR). Using an accelerated
   fMRI sequence with a high temporal resolution (TR = 333 ms) combined
   with susceptibility-weighted imaging, we show how signal changes in the
   amygdala region can be related to a venous origin. This finding is
   confirmed here in both a conventional fMRI dataset (TR = 2000 ms) as
   well as in information of meta-analyses, implying that ``amygdala
   activations{''} reported in typical fMRI studies are likely confounded
   by signals originating in the BVR rather than in the amygdala itself,
   thus raising concerns about many conclusions on the functioning of the
   amygdala that rely on fMRI evidence alone.}},

Title = {{Functional brain networks underlying detection and integration of

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{112}},
Pages = {{138-151}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Processing evidence that disconfirms a prior interpretation is a
   fundamental aspect of belief revision, and has clear social and clinical
   relevance. This complex cognitive process requires (at minimum) an
   alerting stage and an integration stage, and in the current functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we used multivariate analysis
   methodology on two datasets in an attempt to separate these
   sequentially-activated cognitive stages and link them to distinct
   functional brain networks. Thirty-nine healthy participants completed
   one of two versions of an evidence integration experiment involving
   rating two consecutive animal images, both of which consisted of two
   intact images of animal faces morphed together at different ratios
   (e.g., 70/30 bird/dolphin followed by 10/90 bird/dolphin). The two
   versions of the experiment differed primarily in terms of stimulus
   presentation and timing, which facilitated functional interpretation of
   brain networks based on differences in the hemodynamic response shapes
   between versions. The data were analyzed using constrained principal
   component analysis for fMRI (fMRI-CPCA), which allows distinct,
   simultaneously active task-based networks to be separated, and these
   were interpreted using both temporal (task-based hemodynamic response
   shapes) and spatial (dominant brain regions) information. Three networks
   showed increased activity during integration of disconfirmatory relative
   to confirmatory evidence: (1) a network involved in alerting to the
   requirement to revise an interpretation, identified as the salience
   network (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula); (2) a
   sensorimotor response-related network (pre- and post-central gyri,
   supplementary motor area, and thalamus); and (3) an integration network
   involving rostral prefrontal, orbitofrontal and posterior parietal
   cortex. These three networks were staggered in their peak activity
   (alerting, responding, then integrating), but at certain time points
   (e.g., 17 s after trial onset) the hemodynamic responses associated with
   all three networks were simultaneously active. These findings highlight
   distinct cognitive processes and corresponding functional brain networks
   underlying stages of disconfirmatory evidence integration, and
   demonstrate the power of multivariate and multi-experiment methodology
   in cognitive neuroscience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We used fMRI to investigate neural activation in reading aloud in
   bilinguals differing in age of acquisition. Three groups were compared:
   French-English bilinguals who acquired two languages from birth
   (simultaneous), French-English bilinguals who learned their L2 after the
   age of 5 years (sequential), and English-speaking monolinguals. While
   the bilingual groups contrasted in age of acquisition, they were matched
   for language proficiency, although sequential bilinguals produced speech
   with a less native-like accent in their L2 than in their L1.
   Simultaneous bilinguals activated similar brain regions to an equivalent
   degree when reading in their two languages. In contrast, sequential
   bilinguals more strongly activated areas related to speech-motor control
   and orthographic to phonological mapping, the left inferior frontal
   gyrus, left premotor cortex, and left fusiform gyrus, when reading aloud
   in L2 compared to L1. In addition, the activity in these regions showed
   a significant positive correlation with age of acquisition. The results
   provide evidence for the engagement of overlapping neural substrates for
   processing two languages when acquired in native context from birth.
   However, it appears that the maturation of certain brain regions for
   both speech production and phonological encoding is limited by a
   sensitive period for L2 acquisition regardless of language proficiency.

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is characterized by the disorder of ``social brain{''}.
   However, the alternation of connectivity density in brain areas of
   schizophrenia patients remains largely unknown. In this study, we
   successfully created a rat model of schizophrenia by the transfection of
   EGR3 gene into rat brain. We then investigated the connectivity density
   of schizophrenia susceptible regions in rat brain using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with multivariate
   Granger causality (GC) model. We found that the average signal strength
   in prefrontal lobe and hippocampus of schizophrenia model group was
   significantly higher than the control group. Bidirectional Granger
   causality connection was observed between hippocampus and thalamic in
   schizophrenia model group. Both connectivity density and Granger
   causality connection were changed in prefrontal lobe, hippocampus and
   thalamus after risperidone treatment. Our results indicated that fMRI in
   combination with GC connection analysis may be used as an important
   method in diagnosis of schizophrenia and evaluation the effect of
   antipsychotic treatment. These findings support the connectivity
   disorder hypothesis of schizophrenia and increase our understanding of
   the neural mechanisms of schizophrenia. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Stories can elicit powerful emotions. A key emotional response to
   narrative plots (e.g., novels, movies, etc.) is suspense. Suspense
   appears to build on basic aspects of human cognition such as processes
   of expectation, anticipation, and prediction. However, the neural
   processes underlying emotional experiences of suspense have not been
   previously investigated. We acquired functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data while participants read a suspenseful literary text
   (E.T.A. Hoffmann's ``The Sandman{''}) subdivided into short text
   passages. Individual ratings of experienced suspense obtained after each
   text passage were found to be related to activation in the medial
   frontal cortex, bilateral frontal regions (along the inferior frontal
   sulcus), lateral premotor cortex, as well as posterior temporal and
   temporo-parietal areas. The results indicate that the emotional
   experience of suspense depends on brain areas associated with social
   cognition and predictive inference.}},

Abstract = {{We examined abnormalities in physiological responses to emotional
   stimuli associated with long-term chronic alcoholism. Skin conductance
   responses (SCR) and heart rate (HR) responses were measured in 32
   abstinent alcoholic (ALC) and 30 healthy nonalcoholic (NC) men and women
   undergoing an emotional memory task in an MRI scanner. The task required
   participants to remember the identity of two emotionally-valenced faces
   presented at the onset of each trial during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. After viewing the faces, participants
   saw a distractor image (an alcoholic beverage, nonalcoholic beverage, or
   scrambled image) followed by a single probe face. The task was to decide
   whether the probe face matched one of the two encoded faces. Skin
   conductance measurements (before and after the encoded faces,
   distractor, and probe) were obtained from electrodes on the index and
   middle fingers on the left hand. HR measurements (beats per minute
   before and after the encoded faces, distractor, and probe) were obtained
   by a pulse oximeter placed on the little finger on the left hand. We
   expected that, relative to NC participants, the ALC participants would
   show reduced SCR and HR responses to the face stimuli, and that we would
   identify greater reactivity to the alcoholic beverage stimuli than to
   the distractor stimuli unrelated to alcohol. While the beverage type did
   not differentiate the groups, the ALC group did have reduced skin
   conductance and HR responses to elements of the task, as compared to the
   NC group.}},

Abstract = {{Compassion is a human feeling towards an individual who is suffering.
   However, the responses toward a victim are not always compassionate and
   may, for example, be moderated by the perceived responsibility of the
   victim. In the present study, we investigated the neural correlates of
   compassion and specifically differentiated the responses to other
   individuals' misfortunes depending on whether the victim was responsible
   for the event that occurred. In particular, we identified increased
   activation of the left insula, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and
   adjacent anterior cingulate cortex when the participants read sentences
   with innocent compared with responsible victims. The reverse contrast
   revealed increased activation of the bilateral temporoparietal junction,
   right precuneus, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Using
   a psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis, we demonstrated that
   in the responsible condition, right dlPFC activation was accompanied by
   decreased activation in the left insula, anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC), and mPFC. This inverse effective connectivity illustrates the
   antagonism of the dlPFC and mPFC in compassion-related appraisal of
   external events. More specifically, our results imply that regulatory
   mechanisms of compassion are related to the perception of
   responsibility.}},

Title = {{Cognitive dissonance induction in everyday life: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{268-281}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study explored the
   neural substrates of cognitive dissonance during dissonance induction. A
   novel task was developed based on the results of a separate item
   selection study (n=125). Items were designed to generate dissonance by
   prompting participants to reflect on everyday personal experiences that
   were inconsistent with values they had expressed support for. One
   experimental condition (dissonance) and three control conditions
   (justification, consonance, and non-self-related inconsistency) were
   used for comparison. Items of all four types were presented to each
   participant (n=14) in a randomized design. The fMRI analysis used a
   whole-brain approach focusing on the moments dissonance was induced.
   Results showed that in comparison with the control conditions the
   dissonance experience led to higher levels of activation in several
   brain regions. Specifically dissonance was associated with increased
   neural activation in key brain regions including the anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus.
   This supports current perspectives that emphasize the role of anterior
   cingulate and insula in dissonance processing. Less extensive activation
   in the prefrontal cortex than in some previous studies is consistent
   with this study's emphasis on dissonance induction, rather than
   reduction. This article also contains a short review and comparison with
   other fMRI studies of cognitive dissonance.}},

Title = {{Concepts in context: Processing mental state concepts with internal or

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{294-307}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{According to embodied cognition theories, concepts are contextually
   situated and grounded in neural systems that produce experiential
   states. This view predicts that processing mental state concepts
   recruits neural regions associated with different aspects of experience
   depending on the context in which people understand a concept. This
   neuroimaging study tested this prediction using a set of sentences that
   described emotional (e.g., fear, joy) and nonemotional (e.g., thinking,
   hunger) mental states with internal focus (i.e., focusing on bodily
   sensations and introspection) or external focus (i.e., focusing on
   expression and action). Consistent with our predictions, data suggested
   that the inferior frontal gyrus, a region associated with action
   representation, was engaged more by external than internal sentences. By
   contrast, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region associated with
   the generation of internal states, was engaged more by internal emotion
   sentences than external sentence categories. Similar patterns emerged
   when we examined the relationship between neural activity and
   independent ratings of sentence focus. Furthermore, ratings of emotion
   were associated with activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, whereas
   ratings of activity were associated with activation in the inferior
   frontal gyrus. These results suggest that mental state concepts are
   represented in a dynamic way, using context-relevant interoceptive and
   sensorimotor resources.}},

Abstract = {{In contrast to abstract trait words which describe people's general
   personality, gossip is about personal affairs of others. Although neural
   correlates underlying processing self-related trait words have been well
   documented, it remains poorly understood how the human brain processes
   gossip. In the present fMRI study, participants were instructed to rate
   their online emotional states upon hearing positive and negative gossip
   about celebrities, themselves, and their best friends. Explicit
   behavioral ratings suggested that participants were happier to hear
   positive gossip and more annoyed to hear negative gossip about
   themselves than about celebrities and best friends. At the neural level,
   dissociated neural networks were involved in processing the positive
   gossip about self and the negative gossip about celebrities. On the one
   hand, the superior medial prefrontal cortex responded not only to
   self-related gossip but also to moral transgressions, and neural
   activity in the orbital prefrontal cortex increased linearly with
   pleasure ratings on positive gossip about self. On the other hand,
   although participants' ratings did not show they were particularly happy
   on hearing negative gossip about celebrities, the significantly enhanced
   neural activity in the reward system suggested that they were indeed
   amused. Moreover, via enhanced functional connectivity, the prefrontal
   executive control network was involved in regulating the reward system
   by giving explicit pleasure ratings according to social norm compliance,
   rather than natural true feelings.}},

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{In several countries natural sign languages were considered inadequate
   for education. Instead, new sign-supported systems were created, based
   on the belief that spoken/written language is grammatically superior.
   One such system called SJM (system jezykowo-migowy) preserves the
   grammatical and lexical structure of spoken Polish and since 1960s has
   been extensively employed in schools and on TV. Nevertheless, the Deaf
   community avoids using SJM for everyday communication, its preferred
   language being PJM (polski jezyk migowy), a natural sign language,
   structurally and grammatically independent of spoken Polish and
   featuring classifier constructions (CCs). Here, for the first time, we
   compare, with fMRI method, the neural bases of natural vs. devised
   communication systems. Deaf signers were presented with three types of
   signed sentences (SJM and PJM with/without CCs). Consistent with
   previous findings, PJM with CCs compared to either SJM or PJM without
   CCs recruited the parietal lobes. The reverse comparison revealed
   activation in the anterior temporal lobes, suggesting increased semantic
   combinatory processes in lexical sign comprehension. Finally, PJM
   compared with SJM engaged left posterior superior temporal gyrus and
   anterior temporal lobe, areas crucial for sentence-level speech
   comprehension. We suggest that activity in these two areas reflects
   greater processing efficiency for naturally evolved sign language. (C)

Abstract = {{The ability to perceive social intentions from people's eyes is present
   from an early age, yet little is known about whether this skill is fully
   developed in childhood or that subtle changes may still occur across
   adolescence. This fMRI study investigated the ability to read mental
   states by using an adapted version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes
   task within adolescents (aged 12-19 years) over a 2-year test-retest
   interval. This longitudinal setup provides the opportunity to study both
   stability over time as well as age-related changes. The behavioral
   results showed that participants who performed well in the mental state
   condition at the first measurement also performed well at the second
   measurement. fMRI results revealed positive test-retest correlations of
   neural activity in the right superior temporal sulcus and right inferior
   frontal gyrus for the contrast mental state > control, suggesting
   stability within individuals over time. Besides stability of activation,
   dorsal medial prefrontal cortex showed a dip in mid-adolescence for the
   mental state > control condition and right inferior frontal gyrus
   decreased linearly with age for the mental state > control condition.
   These findings underline changes in the slope of the developmental
   pattern depending on age, even in the existence of relatively stable
   activation in the social brain network.}},

Abstract = {{Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that involves
   impaired regulation of the fear response to traumatic reminders. This
   study tested how women with male-perpetrated interpersonal
   violence-related PTSD (IPV-PTSD) differed in their brain activation from
   healthy controls (HC) when exposed to scenes of male-female interaction
   of differing emotional content. Sixteen women with symptoms of IPV-PTSD
   and 19 HC participated in this study. During magnetic resonance imaging,
   participants watched a stimulus protocol of 23 different 20 s silent
   epochs of male-female interactions taken from feature films, which were
   neutral, menacing or prosocial. IPV-PTSD participants compared with HC
   showed (i) greater dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activation in response to
   menacing vs prosocial scenes and (ii) greater anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC), right hippocampus activation and lower ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC) activty in response to emotional vs neutral scenes. The
   fact that IPV-PTSD participants compared with HC showed lower activity
   of the ventral ACC during emotionally charged scenes regardless of the
   valence of the scenes suggests that impaired social perception among
   IPV-PTSD patients transcends menacing contexts and generalizes to a
   wider variety of emotionally charged male-female interactions.}},

Abstract = {{It is unclear whether reflective awareness of emotions is related to
   extent and intensity of implicit affective reactions. This study is the
   first to investigate automatic brain reactivity to emotional stimuli as
   a function of trait emotional awareness. To assess emotional awareness
   the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) was administered. During
   scanning, masked happy, angry, fearful and neutral facial expressions
   were presented to 46 healthy subjects, who had to rate the fit between
   artificial and emotional words. The rating procedure allowed assessment
   of shifts in implicit affectivity due to emotion faces. Trait emotional
   awareness was associated with increased activation in the primary
   somatosensory cortex, inferior parietal lobule, anterior cingulate
   gyrus, middle frontal and cerebellar areas, thalamus, putamen and
   amygdala in response to masked happy faces. LEAS correlated positively
   with shifts in implicit affect caused by masked happy faces. According
   to our findings, people with high emotional awareness show stronger
   affective reactivity and more activation in brain areas involved in
   emotion processing and simulation during the perception of masked happy
   facial expression than people with low emotional awareness. High
   emotional awareness appears to be characterized by an enhanced positive
   affective resonance to others at an automatic processing level.}},

Abstract = {{For successful communication, conversational partners need to estimate
   each other's current knowledge state. Nonverbal facial and bodily cues
   can reveal relevant information about how confident a speaker is about
   what they are saying. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   aimed to identify brain regions that encode how confident a speaker is
   perceived to be. Participants viewed videos of people answering general
   knowledge questions and judged each respondent's confidence in their
   answer. Our results suggest a distinct role of two neural networks known
   to support social inferences, the so-called mentalizing and the
   mirroring network. While activation in both networks underlies the
   processing of nonverbal cues, only activity in the mentalizing network,
   most notably the medial prefrontal cortex and the bilateral
   temporoparietal junction, is modulated by how confident the respondent
   is judged to be. Our results support an integrative account of the
   mirroring and mentalizing network, in which the two systems support each
   other in aiding pragmatic processing.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Attentional control difficulties likely underlie rumination, a core
   cognitive vulnerability in major depressive disorder (MDD).
   Abnormalities in the default mode, executive and salience networks are
   implicated in both rumination and attentional control difficulties in
   MDD. In the current study, individuals with MDD (n = 16) and healthy
   controls (n = 16) completed tasks designed to elicit self-focused
   (ruminative) and externally-focused thinking during fMRI scanning. The
   MDD group showed greater default mode network connectivity and less
   executive and salience network connectivity during the external-focus
   condition. Contrary to our predictions, there were no differences in
   connectivity between the groups during the self-focus condition. Thus,
   it appears that when directed to engage in self-referential thinking,
   both depressed and non-depressed individuals similarly recruit networks
   supporting this process. In contrast, when instructed to engage in
   non-self-focused thought, non-depressed individuals show a pattern of
   network connectivity indicative of minimized self-referential
   processing, whereas depressed individuals fail to reallocate neural
   resources in a manner consistent with effective down regulation of
   self-focused thought. This is consistent with difficulties in regulating
   self-focused thinking in order to engage in more goal-directed behavior
   that is seen in individuals with MDD.}},

Abstract = {{Reward seeking is ubiquitous and adaptive in humans. But excessive
   reward seeking behavior, such as chasing monetary rewards, may lead to
   diminished subjective well-being. This study examined whether
   individuals trained in mindfulness meditation show neural evidence of
   lower susceptibility to monetary rewards. Seventy-eight participants (34
   meditators, 44 matched controls) completed the monetary incentive delay
   task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The groups
   performed equally on the task, but meditators showed lower neural
   activations in the caudate nucleus during reward anticipation, and
   elevated bilateral posterior insula activation during reward
   anticipation. Meditators also evidenced reduced activations in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex during reward receipt compared with
   controls. Connectivity parameters between the right caudate and
   bilateral anterior insula were attenuated in meditators during incentive
   anticipation. In summary, brain regions involved in reward
   processing-both during reward anticipation and receipt of
   reward-responded differently in mindfulness meditators than in
   nonmeditators, indicating that the former are less susceptible to
   monetary incentives.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveDeficits in social cognition are common and significant in
   people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but the functional and
   structural underpinnings remain unclear. The present study investigated
   how the side of seizure focus impacts face-processing networks in
   temporal lobe epilepsy.
   MethodsWe used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of a
   face-processing paradigm to identify face-responsive regions in 24
   individuals with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (left=15; right=9)
   and 19 healthy controls. fMRI signals of face-responsive regions
   ipsilateral and contralateral to the side of seizure onset were
   delineated in TLE and compared to the healthy controls with right and
   left sides combined. Diffusion tensor images were acquired to
   investigate structural connectivity between face regions that differed
   in fMRI signals between the two groups.
   ResultsIn TLE, activation of the cortical face-processing networks
   varied according to side of seizure onset. In temporal lobe epilepsy,
   the laterality of amygdala activation was shifted to the side
   contralateral to the seizure focus, whereas controls showed no
   significant asymmetry. Furthermore, compared to controls, patients with
   TLE showed decreased activation of the occipital face-responsive region
   on the ipsilateral side and an increased activity of the anterior
   temporal lobe in the side contralateral to the seizure focus.
   Probabilistic tractography revealed that the occipital face area and
   anterior temporal lobe are connected via the inferior longitudinal
   fasciculus, which in individuals with TLE showed reduced integrity.
   SignificanceTaken together, these findings suggest that brain function
   and white matter integrity of networks subserving face processing are
   impaired on the side of seizure onset, accompanied by altered responses
   on the side contralateral to the seizure.}},

Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging research on the neural basis of social
   evaluation has traditionally focused on face perception paradigms. Thus,
   little is known about the neurobiology of social evaluation processes
   based on auditory cues, such as voices. To investigate the top-down
   effects of social trait judgments on voices, hemodynamic responses of 44
   healthy participants were measured during social trait (trustworthiness
   {[}TR] and attractiveness {[}AT]), emotional (happiness, HA), and
   cognitive (age, AG) voice judgments. Relative to HA and AG judgments, TR
   and AT judgments both engaged the bilateral inferior parietal cortex
   (IPC; area PGa) and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) extending
   into the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex. This dmPFC activation
   overlapped with previously reported areas specifically involved in
   social judgments on `faces.' Moreover, social trait judgments were
   expected to share neural correlates with emotional HA and cognitive AG
   judgments. Comparison of effects pertaining to social, social-emotional,
   and social-cognitive appraisal processes revealed a dissociation of the
   left IPC into 3 functional subregions assigned to distinct
   cytoarchitectonic subdivisions. In total, the dmPFC is proposed to
   assume a central role in social attribution processes across sensory
   qualities. In social judgments on voices, IPC activity shifts from
   rostral processing of more emotional judgment facets to caudal
   processing of more cognitive judgment facets.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have documented that self-determined choice does indeed
   enhance performance. However, the precise neural mechanisms underlying
   this effect are not well understood. We examined the neural correlates
   of the facilitative effects of self-determined choice using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants played a game-like task
   involving a stopwatch with either a stopwatch they selected
   (self-determined-choice condition) or one they were assigned without
   choice (forced-choice condition). Our results showed that
   self-determined choice enhanced performance on the stopwatch task,
   despite the fact that the choices were clearly irrelevant to task
   difficulty. Neuroimaging results showed that failure feedback, compared
   with success feedback, elicited a drop in the vmPFC activation in the
   forced-choice condition, but not in the self-determined-choice
   condition, indicating that negative reward value associated with the
   failure feedback vanished in the self-determined-choice condition.
   Moreover, the vmPFC resilience to failure in the self-determined-choice
   condition was significantly correlated with the increased performance.
   Striatal responses to failure and success feedback were not modulated by
   the choice condition, indicating the dissociation between the vmPFC and
   striatal activation pattern. These findings suggest that the vmPFC plays
   a unique and critical role in the facilitative effects of
   self-determined choice on performance.}},

Abstract = {{People are more sensitive to losses than to equivalent gains when making
   financial decisions. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to illuminate how the amygdala contributes to loss aversion. The
   blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response of the amygdala was mapped
   while healthy individuals were responding to 50/50 gambles with varying
   potential gain and loss amounts. Overall, subjects demanded twice as
   high potential gain as loss to accept a gamble. The individual level of
   loss aversion was expressed by the decision boundary, i.e., the
   gain-loss ratio at which subjects accepted and rejected gambles with
   equal probability. Amygdala activity increased the more the gain-loss
   ratio deviated from the individual decision boundary showing that the
   amygdala codes action value. This response pattern was more strongly
   expressed in loss aversive individuals, linking amygdala activity with
   individual differences in loss aversion. Together, the results show that
   the amygdala signals subjective appetitiveness or aversiveness of
   gain-loss ratios at the time of choice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Grey matter, an endophenotype for schizophrenia? A voxel-based

Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background Grey matter, both volume and concentration, has been proposed
   as an endophenotype for schizophrenia given a number of reports of grey
   matter abnormalities in relatives of patients with schizophrenia.
   However, previous studies on grey matter abnormalities in relatives have
   produced inconsistent results. The aim of the present study was to
   examine grey matter differences between controls and siblings of
   patients with schizophrenia and to examine whether the age, genetic
   loading or subclinical psychotic symptoms of selected individuals could
   explain the previously reported inconsistencies.
   Methods We compared the grey matter volume and grey matter concentration
   of healthy siblings of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls
   matched for age, sex and education using voxel-based morphometry (VBM).
   Furthermore, we selected subsamples based on age (< 30 yr), genetic
   loading and subclinical psychotic symptoms to examine whether this would
   lead to different results.
   Results We included 89 siblings and 69 controls in our study. The
   results showed that siblings and controls did not differ significantly
   on grey matter volume or concentration. Furthermore, specifically
   selecting participants based on age, genetic loading or subclinical
   psychotic symptoms did not alter these findings.
   Limitations The main limitation was that subdividing the sample resulted
   in smaller samples for the subanalyses. Furthermore, we used MRI data
   from 2 different scanner sites.
   Conclusion These results indicate that grey matter measured through VBM
   might not be a suitable endophenotype for schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Causally related concepts like ``virus{''} and ``epidemic{''} and

   (ERP) procedure was used to examine the representations of causal
   judgment and associative judgment in semantic memory. Participants were
   required to remember a task cue (causal or associative) presented at the
   beginning of each trial, and assess whether the relationship between
   subsequently presented words matched the initial task cue. The ERP data
   showed that an N400 effect (250-450 ms) was more negative for unrelated
   words than for all related words. Furthermore, the N400 effect elicited
   by causal relations was more positive than for associative relations in
   causal cue condition, whereas no significant difference was found in the
   associative cue condition. The centrally distributed late ERP component
   (650-750 ms) elicited by the causal cue condition was more positive than
   for the associative cue condition. These results suggested that the
   processing of causal judgment and associative judgment in semantic
   memory recruited different degrees of attentional and executive

   participated. In multiple aspects the ``typical{''} and silent room
   conditions were indistinguishable; however, typical and fMRI conditions
   differed significantly. In sum, it was not clear what previous studies

Abstract = {{Background: Social impairments are a hallmark feature of schizophrenia
   and are a key predictor of functional disability. Deficits in social
   information processing likely underlie social impairment; however, this
   relationship is understudied. We previously demonstrated that patients
   with schizophrenia fail to habituate to neutral faces, providing
   evidence for an alteration in basic social information processing. It
   remains unknown whether patients with schizophrenia also show deficits
   in processing of more complex social information. Outgroup bias provides
   an excellent opportunity to test complex social information processing
   because the bias requires basic face processing skills, the ability to
   discriminate between groups, as well as the ability to categorize
   oneself into a salient social group.
   Methods: Study participants were 23 patients with schizophrenia and 21
   controls. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, habituation of
   response to 120 s of repeated presentations of faces was assessed in
   participants who viewed either same-gender faces or opposite-gender
   faces. The interaction between face gender (same/opposite) and group was
   examined in three key regions: amygdala, hippocampus, and visual cortex.
   Social impairment was measured using the PANSS and correlations between
   social impairment and out-group effect (main effect of face type) were
   performed in patients.
   Results: Patients with schizophrenia had aberrant neural responses to
   opposite-gender faces (interaction, p < .05 corrected). Healthy controls
   showed an immediate heightened response to opposite-gender faces
   relative to same-gender faces; but in patients this effect was
   substantially delayed (similar to 70 s). In patients with schizophrenia,
   the out-group bias was significantly correlated with social impairment.
   Patients with no social impairment showed a heightened neural response
   to opposite-gender faces after 30 s, whereas patients with mild-moderate
   social impairment failed to ever show a heightened response.
   Conclusion: Alterations in neural responses during out-group processing
   predicted degree of social impairment in patients with schizophrenia;
   thus, neural responses to opposite-gender faces may provide a novel
   measure for studies of treatment response and disease outcome. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background: Social interaction requires mirroring to other people's
   mental state. Psychotic disorders have been connected to social
   interaction and emotion recognition impairment. We compared the brain
   activity between young adults with familial risk for psychosis (FR) and
   matched controls during visual exposure to emotional facial expression.
   We also investigated the role of the amygdala, the key region for social
   interaction and emotion recognition.
   Methods: 51 FR and 52 control subjects were drawn fromthe Northern
   Finland 1986 Birth Cohort (Oulu Brain and Mind Study). None of the
   included participants had developed psychosis. The FR group was defined
   as having a parent with psychotic disorder according to the Finnish
   Hospital Discharge Register. Participants underwent functional MRI
   (fMRI) using visual presentation of dynamic happy and fearful facial
   expressions. FMRI data were processed to produce maps of activation for
   happy and fearful facial expression, which were then compared between
   groups. Two spherical regions of interest (ROIs) in the amygdala were
   set to extract BOLD responses during happy and fearful facial
   expression. BOLD responses were then compared with subjects' emotion
   recognition, whichwas assessed after fMRI. Psychophysiological
   interaction (PPI) for the left and right amygdala during happy and
   fearful facial expression was conducted using the amygdala as seed
   regions.
   Results: FR subjects had increased activity in the left premotor cortex
   and reduced deactivation of medial prefrontal cortex structures during
   happy facial expression. There were no between- group differences during
   fearful facial expression. The FR group also showed a statistically
   significant linear correlation between mean amygdala BOLD response and
   facial expression recognition. PPI showed that there was a significant
   negative interaction between the amygdala and the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and superior temporal gyrus in FR subjects.
   Conclusions: Increased activations by positive valence in FR were in
   brain regions crucial to emotion recognition and social interaction.
   Increased activation of the premotor cortex may serve as a compensatory
   mechanismas FR subjectsmay have to exertmore effort on processing the
   stimuli, as has been found earlier in schizophrenia. Failure to
   deactivate PFC structures may imply error in the default mode network.
   Abnormal PFC function in FR was also suggested by PPI, as the dlPFC
   showed decreased functional connectivity with the amygdala in the FR
   group. This may indicate that in FR subjects the amygdala have to take a
   greater role in emotion recognition and social functioning. This
   inference was supported by our discovery of statistically significant
   correlations between the amygdala BOLD response and emotion recognition
   in the FR group but not in controls. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{ObjectiveConnectivity atypicalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
   have been extensively proposed. The default mode network (DMN) is
   critical in this study, given the insight it provides for long-distance
   connectivity, and the importance of regions in this network for
   introspection and social emotion processing, areas affected in ASD.
   However, study of this network has largely been limited to adults;
   research earlier in development is lacking. The objective of this study
   was to examine DMN connectivity in children/adolescents with ASD.
   MethodsA total of 115 children/adolescents, aged 6 to 17 years (71 males
   with ASD and 44 group age-matched TD males) were included in these
   analyses. We examined group differences in (1) functional connectivity
   between the posterior cingulate cortex and regions across the brain, (2)
   connectivity within the DMN as a function of age and intelligence
   quotient (IQ), and (3) the association between DMN connectivity and
   empathic accuracy.
   ResultsIndividuals with ASD, relative to controls, showed either
   stronger or weaker connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex
   (PCC) and DMN regions, depending on the region, but also showed stronger
   connectivity with non-DMN regions. A significant group-by-age
   interaction was observed in functional connectivity between the PCC and
   medial prefrontal cortex; connectivity increased with age in controls,
   but decreased in individuals with ASD. No effects of IQ were found.
   There was a significant group difference in the relation between DMN
   connectivity and empathic accuracy.
   InterpretationDifferences in functional connectivity may suggest the
   presence of neural atypicalities that impact the development of typical
   connectivity in ASD. In addition to affecting DMN dynamics, these
   atypicalities may also impact social-cognitive abilities. Ann Neurol

Abstract = {{During face-to-face communication, body orientation and coverbal
   gestures influence how information is conveyed. The neural pathways
   underpinning the comprehension of such nonverbal social cues in everyday
   interaction are to some part still unknown. During fMRI data
   acquisition, 37 participants were presented with video clips showing an
   actor speaking short sentences. The actor produced speech-associated
   iconic gestures (IC) or no gestures (NG) while he was visible either
   from an egocentric (ego) or from an allocentric (allo) position.
   Participants were asked to indicate via button press whether they felt
   addressed or not. We found a significant interaction of body orientation
   and gesture in addressment evaluations, indicating that participants
   evaluated IC-ego conditions as most addressing. The anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC) and left fusiform gyrus were stronger activated for
   egocentric versus allocentric actor position in gesture context.
   Activation increase in the ACC for IC-ego>IC-allo further correlated
   positively with increased addressment ratings in the egocentric gesture
   condition. Gesture-related activation increase in the supplementary
   motor area, left inferior frontal gyrus and right insula correlated
   positively with gesture-related increase of addressment evaluations in
   the egocentric context. Results indicate that gesture use and
   body-orientation contribute to the feeling of being addressed and
   together influence neural processing in brain regions involved in motor
   simulation, empathy and mentalizing. Hum Brain Mapp 36:1925-1936, 2015.

Abstract = {{Purpose: We aimed to determine whether Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
   would show neural abnormality of the social reward system using
   functional MRI (fMRI). Materials and Methods: 27 ASDs and 12 typically
   developing controls (TDCs) participated in this study. The social reward
   task was developed, and all participants performed the task during fMRI
   scanning. Results: ASDs and TDCs with a social reward learning effect
   were selected on the basis of behavior data. We found significant
   differences in brain activation between the ASDs and TDCs showing a
   social reward learning effect. Compared with the TDCs, the ASDs showed
   reduced activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, right
   orbitofrontal cortex, right parietal lobe, and occipital lobe; however,
   they showed increased activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus and
   superior temporal gyms. Conclusion: These findings suggest that there
   might be neural abnormality of the social reward learning system of
   ASDs. Although this study has several potential limitations, it presents
   novel findings in the different neural mechanisms of social reward
   learning in children with ASD and a possible useful biomarker of

Abstract = {{Methods for analyzing neural and computational social science data are
   usually used by different types of scientists and generally seen as
   distinct, but they strongly complement one another. Computational social
   science methodologies can strengthen and contextualize individual-level
   analysis, specifically our understanding of the brain. Neuroscience can
   help to unpack the mechanisms that lead from micro- through meso- to
   macro-level observations. Integrating levels of analysis is essential to
   unified progress in social research. We present two example areas that
   illustrate this integration. First, combining egocentric social network
   data with neural variables from the egos provides insight about why and
   for whom certain types of antismoking messages may be more or less
   effective. Second, combining tools from natural language processing with
   neuroimaging reveals mechanisms involved in successful message
   propagation, and suggests links from microscopic to macroscopic scales.}},

Abstract = {{Area F5c is a monkey premotor area housing mirror neurons which responds
   more strongly to grasping observation when the actor is visible than
   when only the actor's hand is visible. Here we used this characteristic
   fMRI signature of F5c in seven imaging experiments - one in macaque
   monkeys and six in humans - to identify the human homologue of monkey
   F5c. By presenting the two grasping actions (actor, hand) and varying
   the low level visual characteristics, we localized a putative human
   homologue of area F5c (phF5c) in the inferior part of precentral sulcus,
   bilaterally. In contrast to monkey F5c, phF5c is asymmetric, with a
   right-sided bias, and is activated more strongly during the observation
   of the later stages of grasping when the hand is close to the object.
   The latter characteristic might be related to the emergence, in humans,
   of the capacity to precisely copy motor acts performed by others, and
   thus imitation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Robust regression for large-scale neuroimaging studies}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{111}},
Pages = {{431-441}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Multi-subject datasets used in neuroimaging group studies have a complex
   structure, as they exhibit non-stationary statistical properties across
   regions and display various artifacts.
   While studies with small sample sizes can rarely be shown to deviate
   from standard hypotheses (such as the normality of the residuals) due to
   the poor sensitivity of normality tests with low degrees of freedom,
   large-scale studies (e.g. > 100 subjects) exhibit more obvious
   deviations from these hypotheses and call for more refined models for
   statistical inference. Here, we demonstrate the benefits of robust
   regression as a tool for analyzing large neuroimaging cohorts. First, we
   use an analytic test based on robust parameter estimates; based on
   simulations, this procedure is shown to provide an accurate statistical
   control without resorting to permutations. Second, we show that robust
   regression yields more detections than standard algorithms using as an
   example an imaging genetics study with 392 subjects. Third, we show that
   robust regression can avoid false positives in a large-scale analysis of
   brain-behavior relationships with over 1500 subjects. Finally we embed
   robust regression in the Randomized Parcellation Based Inference (RPBI)
   method and demonstrate that this combination further improves the
   sensitivity of tests carried out across the whole brain. Altogether, our
   results show that robust procedures provide important advantages in
   large-scale neuroimaging group studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a commonly occurring and highly
   disabling disorder. The neuropeptide oxytocin and its receptor (OXTR)
   have been implicated in social cognition and behavior. This study-for
   the first time applying a multilevel epigenetic approach-investigates
   the role of OXTR gene methylation in categorical, dimensional, and
   intermediate neuroendocrinological/neural network phenotypes of social
   anxiety. A total of 110 unmedicated patients with SAD and matched 110
   controls were analyzed for OXTR methylation by direct sequencing of
   sodium bisulfite-converted DNA extracted from whole blood. Furthermore,
   OXTR methylation was investigated regarding SAD-related traits (Social
   Phobia Scale (SPS) and Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS)),
   salivary cortisol response during the Trier social stress test (TSST),
   and amygdala responsiveness to social phobia related verbal stimuli
   using fMRI. Significantly decreased OXTR methylation particularly at CpG
   Chr3: 8 809 437 was associated with (1) the categorical phenotype of SAD
   (p<0.001, Cohen's d = 0.535), (2) increased SPS and SIAS scores
   (p<0.001), (3) increased cortisol response to the TSST (p = 0.02), and
   (4) increased amygdala responsiveness during social phobia-related word
   processing (right: p(corr) <0.001; left: p(corr) = 0.005). Assuming that
   decreased OXTR methylation confers increased OXTR expression, the
   present finding may reflect a compensatory upregulation for
   pathologically reduced oxytocin levels or a causally relevant increased
   OXTR activation in SAD and related traits. OXTR methylation patterns
   might thus serve as peripheral surrogates of oxytocin tone and aid in
   establishing accessible biomarkers of SAD risk allowing for indicated
   preventive interventions and personalized treatment approaches targeting
   the oxytocin system.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, much has been learned about the representation of
   subjective value in simple, nonstrategic choices. However, a large
   fraction of our daily decisions are embedded in social interactions in
   which value guided decisions require balancing benefits for self against
   consequences imposed by others in response to our choices. Yet, despite
   their ubiquity, much less is known about how value computation takes
   place in strategic social contexts that include the possibility of
   retribution for norm violations. Here, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that when human subjects face such a
   context connectivity increases between the temporoparietal junction
   (TPJ), implicated in the representation of other peoples' thoughts and
   intentions, and regions of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) that
   are associated with value computation. In contrast, we find no increase
   in connectivity between these regions in social nonstrategic cases where
   decision-makers are immune from retributive monetary punishments from a
   human partner. Moreover, there was also no increase in TPJ-vmPFC
   connectivity when the potential punishment was performed by a computer
   programmed to punish fairness norm violations in the same manner as a
   human would. Thus, TPJ-vmPFC connectivity is not simply a function of
   the social or norm enforcing nature of the decision, but rather occurs
   specifically in situations where subjects make decisions in a social
   context and strategically consider putative consequences imposed by
   others.}},

Abstract = {{Via mental simulation, imagined events faithfully reproduce the neural
   and behavioral activities that accompany their actual occurrence.
   However, little is known about how fundamental characteristics of mental
   imagery-notably perspectives of self-shape neurocognitive processes. To
   address this issue, we used fMRI to explore the impact that vantage
   point exerts on the neural and behavioral correlates of imaginary
   sensory experiences (i.e., pain). Participants imagined painful
   scenarios from three distinct visual perspectives: first-person self
   (1PS), third-person self (3PS), and third-person other (3PO).
   Corroborating increased ratings of pain and embodiment, 1PS (cf. 3PS)
   simulations elicited greater activity in the right anterior insula, a
   brain area that supports interoceptive and emotional awareness.
   Additionally, 1PS simulations evoked greater activity in brain areas
   associated with visual imagery and the sense of body ownership.
   Interestingly, no differences were observed between 3PS and 3PO imagery.
   Taken together, these findings reveal the neural and behavioral
   correlates of visual perspective during mental simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Does the presence of irrelevant neuroscience information make
   explanations of psychological phenomena more appealing? Do fMRI pictures
   further increase that allure? To help answer these questions, 385
   college students in four experiments read brief descriptions of
   psychological phenomena, each one accompanied by an explanation of
   varying quality (good vs. circular) and followed by superfluous
   information of various types. Ancillary measures assessed participants'
   analytical thinking, beliefs on dualism and free will, and admiration
   for different sciences. In Experiment 1, superfluous neuroscience
   information increased the judged quality of the argument for both good
   and bad explanations, whereas accompanying fMRI pictures had no impact
   above and beyond the neuroscience text, suggesting a bias that is
   conceptual rather than pictorial. Superfluous neuroscience information
   was more alluring than social science information (Experiment 2) and
   more alluring than information from prestigious ``hard sciences{''}
   (Experiments 3 and 4). Analytical thinking did not protect against the
   neuroscience bias, nor did a belief in dualism or free will. We conclude
   that the ``allure of neuroscience{''} bias is conceptual, specific to
   neuroscience, and not easily accounted for by the prestige of the
   discipline. It may stem from the lay belief that the brain is the best
   explanans for mental phenomena.}},

Title = {{Altered cortical-amygdala coupling in social anxiety disorder during the

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Background. Severe stress in social situations is a core symptom of
   social anxiety disorder (SAD). Connectivity between the amygdala and
   cortical regions is thought to be important for emotion regulation, a
   function that is compromised in SAD. However, it has never been tested
   if and how this connectivity pattern changes under conditions of
   stress-inducing social evaluative threat. Here we investigate changes in
   cortical-amygdala coupling in SAD during the anticipation of giving a
   public speech.
   Method. Twenty individuals with SAD and age-, gender-and
   education-matched controls (n = 20) participated in this study. During
   the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session, participants
   underwent three `resting-state' fMRI scans: one before, one during, and
   one after the anticipation of giving a public speech. Functional
   connectivity between cortical emotion regulation regions and the
   amygdala was investigated.
   Results. Compared to controls, SAD participants showed reduced
   functional integration between cortical emotion regulation regions and
   the amygdala during the public speech anticipation. Moreover, in SAD
   participants cortical-amygdala connectivity changes correlated with
   social anxiety symptom severity.
   Conclusions. The distinctive pattern of cortical-amygdala connectivity
   suggests less effective cortical-subcortical communication during social
   stress-provoking situations in SAD.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated differences in the intrinsic functional brain
   organization (functional connectivity) of the human reward system
   between healthy control participants and patients with social anxiety
   disorder. Functional connectivity was measured in the resting-state via
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 53 patients with social
   anxiety disorder and 33 healthy control participants underwent a
   6-minute resting-state fMRI scan. Functional connectivity of the reward
   system was analyzed by calculating whole-brain temporal correlations
   with a bilateral nucleus accumbens seed and a ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex seed. Patients with social anxiety disorder, relative to the
   control group, had (1) decreased functional connectivity between the
   nucleus accumbens seed and other regions associated with reward,
   including ventromedial prefrontal cortex; (2) decreased functional
   connectivity between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed and lateral
   prefrontal regions, including the anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortices; and (3) increased functional connectivity between both the
   nucleus accumbens seed and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex seed with
   more posterior brain regions, including anterior cingulate cortex.
   Social anxiety disorder appears to be associated with widespread
   differences in the functional connectivity of the reward system,
   including markedly decreased functional connectivity between reward
   regions and between reward regions and lateral prefrontal cortices, and
   markedly increased functional connectivity between reward regions and

Abstract = {{Empathy is thought to be a mechanism underlying prosocial behavior
   across the lifespan, yet little is known about how levels of empathy
   relate to individual differences in brain functioning among older
   adults. In this exploratory study, we examined the neural correlates of
   affective and cognitive empathy in older adults. Thirty older adults (M
   = 79 years) underwent fMRI scanning and neuropsychological testing and
   completed a test of affective and cognitive empathy. Brain response
   during processing of cognitive and emotional stimuli was measured by
   fMRI in a priori and task-related regions and was correlated with levels
   of empathy. Older adults with higher levels of affective empathy showed
   more deactivation in the amygdala and insula during a working memory
   task, whereas those with higher cognitive empathy showed greater insula
   activation during a response inhibition task. Our preliminary findings
   suggest that brain systems linked to emotional and social processing
   respond differently among older adults with more or less affective and
   cognitive empathy. That these relationships can be seen both during
   affective and non emotional tasks of ``cold{''} cognitive abilities
   suggests that empathy may impact social behavior through both emotional
   and cognitive mechanisms. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{Emerging research suggests that individuals experience vicarious social
   pain (i.e., ostracism). It has been proposed that observing ostracism
   increases activity in the insula and in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), two
   key brain regions activated by directly experiencing ostracism. Here, we
   assessed the causal role of the insula and PFC in modulating neural
   activity in these areas by applying transcutaneous Vagus Nerve
   Stimulation (tVNS), a new non-invasive and safe method to stimulate the
   vagus nerve that has been shown to activate the insula and PFC. A
   single-blind, sham-controlled, within-subjects design was used to assess
   the effect of on-line (i.e., stimulation overlapping with the critical
   task) tVNS in healthy young volunteers (n = 24) on the prosocial
   Cyberball game, a virtual ball-tossing game designed to measure
   prosocial compensation of ostracism. Active tVNS did not increase
   prosocial helping behavior toward an ostracized person, as compared to
   sham (placebo) stimulation. Corroborated by Bayesian inference, we
   conclude that tVNS does not modulate reactions to vicarious ostracism,
   as indexed by performance in a Cyberball game.}},

Abstract = {{Consensus building in a group is a hallmark of animal societies, yet
   little is known about its underlying computational and neural
   mechanisms. Here, we applied a computational framework to behavioral and
   fMRI data from human participants performing a consensus decision-making
   task with up to five other participants. We found that participants
   reached consensus decisions through integrating their own preferences
   with information about the majority group members' prior choices, as
   well as inferences about how much each option was stuck to by the other
   people. These distinct decision variables were separately encoded in
   distinct brain areas-the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior
   superior temporal sulcus/temporoparietal junction, and intraparietal
   sulcus-and were integrated in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Our
   findings provide support for a theoretical account in which collective
   decisions are made through integrating multiple types of inference about
   oneself, others, and environments, processed in distinct brain modules.}},

Title = {{EMDR therapy for PTSD after motor vehicle accidents: meta-analytic
   evidence for specific treatment}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{Motor vehicle accident (MVA) victims may suffer both acute and
   post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). With PTSD affecting social,
   interpersonal and occupational functioning, clinicians as well as the
   National Institute of Health are very interested in identifying the most
   effective psychological treatment to reduce PTSD. From research
   findings, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy
   is considered as one of the effective treatment of PTSD. In this paper,
   we present the results of a meta-analysis of fMRI studies on PTSD after
   MVA through activation likelihood estimation. We found that PTSD
   following MVA is characterized by neural modifications in the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), a cerebral structure involved in
   fear-conditioning mechanisms. Basing on previous findings in both humans
   and animals, which demonstrate that desensitization techniques and
   extinction protocols act on the limbic system, the effectiveness of EMDR
   and of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) may be related to the fact
   that during these therapies the ACC is stimulated by desensitization.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions are fundamental for human behavior, but the
   quantification of their neural underpinnings remains challenging. Here,
   we used hyperscanning functional MRI (fMRI) to study information flow
   between brains of human dyads during real-time social interaction in a
   joint attention paradigm. In a hardware setup enabling immersive
   audiovisual interaction of subjects in linked fMRI scanners, we
   characterize cross-brain connectivity components that are unique to
   interacting individuals, identifying information flow between the
   sender's and receiver's temporoparietal junction. We replicate these
   findings in an independent sample and validate our methods by
   demonstrating that cross-brain connectivity relates to a key real-world
   measure of social behavior. Together, our findings support a central
   role of human-specific cortical areas in the brain dynamics of dyadic
   interactions and provide an approach for the noninvasive examination of
   the neural basis of healthy and disturbed human social behavior with
   minimal a priori assumptions.}},

Title = {{Action Processing and Mirror Neuron Function in Patients with
   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a highly debilitating and rapidly
   fatal neurodegenerative disease. It has been suggested that social
   cognition may be affected, such as impairment in theory of mind (ToM)
   ability. Despite these findings, research in this area is scarce and the
   investigation of neural mechanisms behind such impairment is absent.
   Nineteen patients with ALS and eighteen healthy controls participated in
   this study. Because the mirror neuron system (MNS) is thought to be
   involved in theory of mind, we first implemented a straightforward
   action-execution and observation task to assess basic MNS function.
   Second, we examined the social-cognitive ability to understand actions
   of others, which is a component of ToM. We used fMRI to assess BOLD
   activity differences between groups during both experiments. Theory of
   mind was also measured behaviorally using the Reading the Mind in the
   Eyes test (RME). ALS patients displayed greater BOLD activity during the
   action-execution and observation task, especially throughout right
   anterior cortical regions. These areas included the right inferior
   operculum, premotor and primary motor regions, and left inferior
   parietal lobe. A conjunction analysis showed significantly more
   co-activated voxels during both the observation and action-execution
   conditions in the patient group throughout MNS regions. These results
   support a compensatory response in the MNS during action processing. In
   the action understanding experiment, healthy controls performed better
   behaviorally and subsequently recruited greater regions of activity
   throughout the prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus. Lastly,
   action understanding performance was able to cluster patients with ALS
   into high and lower performing groups, which then differentiated RME
   performance. Collectively, these data suggest that social cognition,
   particularly theory of mind, may be affected in a subset of patients
   with ALS. This impairment may be related to functioning of the MNS and
   other regions related to action processing and understanding.
   Implications for future research are discussed.}},

Title = {{Dual Logic and Cerebral Coordinates for Reciprocal Interaction in Eye
   Contact}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 17}},
Abstract = {{In order to scientifically study the human brain's response to
   face-to-face social interaction, the scientific method itself needs to
   be reconsidered so that both quantitative observation and symbolic
   reasoning can be adapted to the situation where the observer is also
   observed. In light of the recent development of dyadic fMRI which can
   directly observe dyadic brain interacting in one MRI scanner, this paper
   aims to establish a new form of logic, dual logic, which provides a
   theoretical platform for deductive reasoning in a complementary dual
   system with emergence mechanism. Applying the dual logic in the dfMRI
   experimental design and data analysis, the exogenous and endogenous dual
   systems in the BOLD responses can be identified; the non-reciprocal
   responses in the dual system can be suppressed; a cerebral coordinate
   for reciprocal interaction can be generated. Elucidated by dual logic
   deductions, the cerebral coordinate for reciprocal interaction suggests:
   the exogenous and endogenous systems consist of the empathy network and
   the mentalization network respectively; the default-mode network emerges
   from the resting state to activation in the endogenous system during
   reciprocal interaction; the cingulate plays an essential role in the
   emergence from the exogenous system to the endogenous system. Overall,
   the dual logic deductions are supported by the dfMRI experimental
   results and are consistent with current literature. Both the theoretical
   framework and experimental method set the stage to formally apply the
   scientific method in studying complex social interaction.}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{People often take either the role of an actor or that of recipient in
   positive and negative interpersonal events when they interact with
   others. The present study investigated how the actor-recipient role
   affected the neural responses to self in emotional situations.
   Twenty-five participants were scanned while they were presented with
   positive and negative interpersonal events and were asked to rate the
   degree to which the actor/the recipient was that kind of person who
   caused the interpersonal event. Half of the trials were self-relevant
   events and the other half were other-relevant events. Results showed
   that people were more likely to isolate self from negative events when
   they played the role of actor relative to recipient. Pregenual anterior
   cingulate cortex (pgACC) and posterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (pdACC) were more active for self than other only in negative events.
   More importantly, also in negative interpersonal events, dorsal medial
   prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) showed greater self related activations (self
   other) when participants played the role of recipient relative to actor,
   while activities in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were greater for self
   than other only when the evaluation target played the role of recipient.
   These results showed that the actor-recipient role affected neural
   responses to self in emotional situations, especially when a recipient
   role was played in negative situations.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{3-10}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have suggested differential engagement of the bilateral
   fusiform gyrus in the processing of Chinese and English. The present
   study tested the possibility that long-term experience with Chinese
   language affects the fusiform laterality of English reading by comparing
   three samples: Chinese speakers, English speakers with Chinese
   experience, and English speakers without Chinese experience. We found
   that, when reading words in their respective native language, Chinese
   and English speakers without Chinese experience differed in functional
   laterality of the posterior fusiform region (right laterality for
   Chinese speakers, but left laterality for English speakers). More
   importantly, compared with English speakers without Chinese experience,
   English speakers with Chinese experience showed more recruitment of the
   right posterior fusiform cortex for English words and pseudowords, which
   is similar to how Chinese speakers processed Chinese. These results
   suggest that long-term experience with Chinese shapes the fusiform
   laterality of English reading and have important implications for our
   understanding of the cross-language influences in terms of neural
   organization and of the functions of different fusiform subregions in
   reading. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain responds more strongly to racial ingroup than outgroup
   individuals' pain. This racial ingroup bias varies across individuals
   and has been attributed to social experiences. What remains unknown is
   whether the racial ingroup bias in brain activity is associated with a
   genetic polymorphism. We investigated genetic associations of racial
   ingroup bias in the brain activity to racial ingroup and outgroup faces
   that received painful or non-painful stimulations by scanning A/A and
   G/G homozygous of the oxytocin receptor gene polymorphism (OXTR rs53576)
   using functional MRI. We found that G/G compared to A/A individuals
   showed stronger activity in the anterior cingulate and supplementary
   motor area (ACC/SMA) in response to racial ingroup members' pain,
   whereas A/A relative to G/G individuals exhibited greater activity in
   the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in response to racial outgroup members'
   pain. Moreover, the racial ingroup bias in ACC/SMA activity positively
   predicted participants' racial ingroup bias in implicit attitudes and
   NAcc activity to racial outgroup individuals' pain negatively predicted
   participants' motivations to reduce racial outgroup members' pain. Our
   results suggest that the two variants of OXTR rs53576 are associated
   with racial ingroup bias in brain activities that are linked to implicit
   attitude and altruistic motivation, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The amygdala plays an integral role in human social cognition and
   behavior, with clear links to emotion recognition, trust judgments,
   anthropomorphization, and psychiatric disorders ranging from social
   phobia to autism. A central feature of human social cognition is a
   theory-of-mind (ToM) that enables the representation other people's
   mental states as distinct from one's own. Numerous neuroimaging studies
   of the best studied use of ToM-false-belief reasoning-suggest that it
   relies on a specific cortical network; moreover, the amygdala is
   structurally and functionally connected with many components of this
   cortical network. It remains unknown whether the cortical implementation
   of any form of ToM depends on amygdala function. Here we investigated
   this question directly by conducting functional MRI on two patients with
   rare bilateral amygdala lesions while they performed a neuroimaging
   protocol standardized for measuring cortical activity associated with
   false-belief reasoning. We compared patient responses with those of two
   healthy comparison groups that included 480 adults. Based on both
   univariate and multivariate comparisons, neither patient showed any
   evidence of atypical cortical activity or any evidence of atypical
   behavioral performance; moreover, this pattern of typical cortical and
   behavioral response was replicated for both patients in a follow-up
   session. These findings argue that the amygdala is not necessary for the
   cortical implementation of ToM in adulthood and suggest a reevaluation
   of the role of the amygdala and its cortical interactions in human
   social cognition.}},

Title = {{Cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with attention-deficit
   hyperactivity disorder: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental
   disorder beginning in childhood, and about half of patients have
   symptoms lasting into adulthood. Adult ADHD causes various impairments
   of emotional, self-esteem, and executive function and life quality
   aspects. Furthermore, adverse outcomes include academic and occupational
   failures, traffic accidents and substance abuse, which would be a family
   and social burden. A combination of medication and psychotherapy is
   recommended as the treatment for adult ADHD, and cognitive behavioral
   therapy (CBT) has been validated mostly with evidence-based researches.
   However, there has been a lack of randomized controlled trials of CBT
   for patients in China. Moreover, booster sessions of CBT for other
   disorders have proven effective in reducing recurrence and improving
   long-term outcomes, which has not been investigated for adult ADHD. This
   study will testify to the effect of CBT and explore the efficacy of
   subsequent booster sessions on adult ADHD.
   Methods/Design: It is a three-armed randomized controlled trial to
   evaluate the efficacy of 12 weeks of CBT based on the published and
   validated manual and its booster sessions. The 12 weeks of CBT will be
   conducted weekly and will end at the 12th week, and then the booster
   sessions will be conducted monthly and end at the 24th week. There are
   three randomized groups, including a CBT with booster sessions group, a
   CBT group and a waiting group. Participants are outpatients of the
   Peking University Sixth Hospital who are diagnosed as having adult ADHD.
   The Primary efficacy endpoints are the scores of ADHD core symptoms at
   12 and 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints include emotion, executive
   function, self-esteem, life quality and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data at different time points, and the change within
   every group will also be analyzed.
   Discussion: This is the first study to explore the efficacy of booster
   sessions of CBT in adult ADHD as far as we know. The results might
   increase proof of efficacy of CBT for adult ADHD in China, and the
   results showing efficacy of the booster sessions would also benefit our
   clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Several visual areas within the STS of the macaque brain respond
   strongly to faces and other biological stimuli. Determining the
   principles that govern neural responses in this region has proven
   challenging, due in part to the inherently complex stimulus domain of
   dynamic biological stimuli that are not captured by an easily
   parameterized stimulus set. Here we investigated neural responses in one
   fMRI-defined face patch in the anterior fundus (AF) of the STS while
   macaques freely view complex videos rich with natural social content.
   Longitudinal single-unit recordings allowed for the accumulation of each
   neuron's responses to repeated video presentations across sessions. We
   found that individual neurons, while diverse in their response patterns,
   were consistently and deterministically driven by the video content. We
   used principal component analysis to compute a family of eigenneurons,
   which summarized 24\% of the shared population activity in the first two
   components. We found that the most prominent component of AF activity
   reflected an interaction between visible body region and scene layout.
   Close-up shots of faces elicited the strongest neural responses, whereas
   far away shots of faces or close-up shots of hindquarters elicited weak
   or inhibitory responses. Sensitivity to the apparent proximity of faces
   was also observed in gamma band local field potential. This
   category-selective sensitivity to spatial scale, together with the known
   exchange of anatomical projections of this area with regions involved in
   visuospatial analysis, suggests that the AF face patch may be
   specialized in aspects of face perception that pertain to the layout of
   a social scene.}},

Title = {{Interpersonal touch suppresses visual processing of aversive stimuli}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Social contact is essential for survival in human society. A previous
   study demonstrated that interpersonal contact alleviates pain-related
   distress by suppressing the activity of its underlying neural network.
   One explanation for this is that attention is shifted from the cause of
   distress to interpersonal contact. To test this hypothesis, we conducted
   a functional MRI (fMRI) study wherein eight pairs of close female
   friends rated the aversiveness of aversive and non-aversive visual
   stimuli under two conditions: joining hands either with a rubber model
   (rubber-hand condition) or with a close friend (humanhand condition).
   Subsequently, participants rated the overall comfortableness of each
   condition. The rating result after fMRI indicated that participants
   experienced greater comfortableness during the human-hand compared to
   the rubber-hand condition, whereas aversiveness ratings during fMRI were
   comparable across conditions. The fMRI results showed that the two
   conditions commonly produced aversive related activation in both sides
   of the visual cortex (including V1, V2, and V5). An interaction between
   aversiveness and hand type showed rubber-hand-specific activation for
   (aversive > non-aversive) in other visual areas (including Vi, V2, V3,
   and V4v). The effect of interpersonal contact on the processing of
   aversive stimuli was negatively correlated with the increment of
   attentional focus to aversiveness measured by a pain-catastrophizing
   scale. These results suggest that interpersonal touch suppresses the
   processing of aversive visual stimuli in the occipital cortex. This
   effect covaried with aversiveness-insensitivity, such that
   aversive-insensitive individuals might require a lesser degree of
   attentional capture to aversive-stimulus processing. As joining hands
   did not influence the subjective ratings of aversiveness, interpersonal
   touch may operate by redirecting excessive attention away from aversive
   characteristics of the stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by
   impairments in diverse thinking and emotional responses, which are
   related to social perception dysfunction. This fMRI study was designed
   to investigate a neurobiological basis of social perception deficits of
   patients with schizophrenia in various social situations of daily life
   and their relationship with clinical symptoms and social dysfunction.
   Methods: Seventeen patients and 19 controls underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, during which participants performed a
   virtual social perception task, containing an avatar's speech with
   positive, negative or neutral emotion in a virtual reality space.
   Participants were asked to determine whether or not the avatar's speech
   was appropriate to each situation.
   Results: The significant group x appropriateness interaction was seen in
   the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), resulting from lower
   activity in patients in the inappropriate condition, and left DLPFC
   activity was negatively correlated with the severity of negative
   symptoms and positively correlated with the level of social functioning.
   The significant appropriateness x emotion interaction observed in the
   left superior temporal sulcus (STS) was present in controls, but absent
   in patients, resulting from the existence and absence of a difference
   between the inappropriate positive and negative conditions,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that dysfunction of the DLPFC-STS
   network may underlie patients' abnormal social perception in various
   social situations of daily life. Abnormal functioning of this network
   may contribute to increases of negative symptoms and decreases of social
   functioning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The idea-the possibility-of reading the mind, from the outside or indeed

   we could read other minds both prospectively, to discern intentions and
   plans, and retrospectively, to discover what had been ``on{''} those
   minds when various events had occurred, the implications for morality
   and for law and social policy would be immense. Recent advances in
   neuroscience have offered some, probably remote, prospects of improved
   access to the mind, but a different branch of technology seems to offer
   the most promising and the most daunting prospect for both mind reading
   and mind misreading. You can't have the possibility of the one without
   the possibility of the other. This article tells some of this story.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},

Pages = {{2376-2382}},

Abstract = {{Broca (Broca P. Bull Soc Anat Paris 36: 330-357, 1861) influentially
   argued that posterior left inferior frontal gyrus supports speech
   articulation. According to an alternative proposal (e.g., Dronkers NF.
   Nature 384: 159-161, 1996; Wise RJ, Greene J, Buchel C, Scott SK. Lancet
   353: 1057-1061, 1999; Baldo JV, Wilkins DP, Ogar J, Willock S, Dronkers
   NF. Cortex 47: 800-807, 2011), a region in the anterior insula
   {[}specifically, the superior precentral gyrus of the insula (SPGI)] is
   the seat of articulatory abilities. Moreover, Dronkers and colleagues
   have argued that the SPGI is functionally specialized for (complex)
   speech articulation. Here, we evaluate this claim using
   individual-subject functional MRI (fMRI) analyses (e.g., Fedorenko E,
   Hsieh PJ, Nieto-Castanon A, Whitfield-Gabrieli S, Kanwisher N. J
   Neurophysiol 104: 1177-1194, 2010). We find that the SPGI responds
   weakly, if at all, during articulation (parts of Broca's area respond
   3-4 times more strongly) and does not show a stronger response to higher
   articulatory demands. This holds regardless of whether the SPGI is
   defined functionally (by selecting the most articulation-responsive
   voxels in the vicinity of the SPGI in each subject individually) or
   anatomically (by using masks drawn on each individual subject's
   anatomy). Critically, nonspeech oral movements activate the SPGI more
   strongly than articulation, especially under the anatomical definition
   of the SPGI. In line with Hillis et al. (Hillis AE, Work M, Barker PB,
   Jacobs MA, Breese EL, Maurer K. Brain 127: 1479-1487, 2004; also Trupe
   L, Varma DD, Gomez Y, Race D, Leigh R, Hillis AE, Gottesman RF. Stroke
   44: 740-744, 2013), we argue that previous links between the SPGI, and
   perhaps anterior insula more generally, and articulation may be due to
   its high base rate of ischemic damage (and activation in fMRI; Yarkoni
   T, Poldrack RA, Nichols TE, Van Essen DC, Wager TD. Nat Methods 8:
   665-670, 2011), combined with its proximity to regions that more
   directly support speech articulation, such as the precentral gyrus or
   the posterior aspects of the inferior frontal gyrus (Richardson JD,
   Fillmore P, Rorden C, Lapointe LL, Fridriksson J. Brain Lang 123:
   125-130, 2012), and thus susceptibility to joint damage.}},

Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Incremental learning, in which new knowledge is acquired gradually
   through trial and error, can be distinguished from one-shot learning, in
   which the brain learns rapidly from only a single pairing of a stimulus
   and a consequence. Very little is known about how the brain transitions
   between these two fundamentally different forms of learning. Here we
   test a computational hypothesis that uncertainty about the causal
   relationship between a stimulus and an outcome induces rapid changes in
   the rate of learning, which in turn mediates the transition between
   incremental and one-shot learning. By using a novel behavioral task in
   combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from
   human volunteers, we found evidence implicating the ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in this process. The hippocampus was
   selectively ``switched{''} on when one-shot learning was predicted to
   occur, while the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex was found to encode
   uncertainty about the causal association, exhibiting increased coupling
   with the hippocampus for high-learning rates, suggesting this region may
   act as a ``switch,{''} turning on and off one-shot learning as required.}},

Title = {{The role of the amygdala during emotional processing in Huntington's
   disease: From pre-manifest to late stage disease}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{80-89}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Deficits in emotional processing can be detected in the
   pre-manifest stage of Huntington's disease and negative emotion
   recognition has been identified as a predictor of clinical diagnosis.
   The underlying neuropathological correlates of such deficits are
   typically established using correlative structural MRI studies. This
   approach does not take into consideration the impact of disruption to
   the complex interactions between multiple brain circuits on emotional
   processing. Therefore, exploration of the neural substrates of emotional
   processing in pre-manifest HD using fMRI connectivity analysis may be a
   useful way of evaluating the way brain regions interrelate in the period
   prior to diagnosis.
   Methods: We investigated the impact of predicted time to disease onset
   on brain activation when participants were exposed to pictures of faces
   with angry and neutral expressions, in 20 pre-manifest HD gene carriers
   and 23 healthy controls. On the basis of the results of this initial
   study went on to look at amygdala dependent cognitive performance in 79
   Huntington's disease patients from a cross-section of disease stages
   (pre-manifest to late disease) and 26 healthy controls, using a
   validated theory of mind task: ``the Reading the Mind in the Eyes
   Test{''} which has been previously been shown to be amygdala dependent.
   Results: Psychophysiological interaction analysis identified reduced
   connectivity between the left amygdala and right fusiform facial area in
   pre-manifest HD gene carriers compared to controls when viewing angry
   compared to neutral faces. Change in PPI connectivity scores correlated
   with predicted time to disease onset (r=0.45, p < 0.05). Furthermore,
   performance on the ``Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test{''} correlated
   negatively with proximity to disease onset and became progressively
   worse with each stage of disease.
   Conclusion: Abnormalities in the neural networks underlying social
   cognition and emotional processing can be detected prior to clinical
   diagnosis in Huntington's disease. Connectivity between the amygdala and
   other brain regions is impacted by the disease process in pre-manifest
   HD and may therefore be a useful way of identifying participants who are
   approaching a clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, the ``Reading the Mind in
   the Eyes Test{''} is a surrogate measure of amygdala function that is
   clinically useful across the entire cross-section of disease stages in
   HD. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open

Abstract = {{Internet addiction (IA) incurs significant social and financial costs in
   the form of physical side-effects, academic and occupational impairment,
   and serious relationship problems. The majority of previous studies on
   Internet addiction disorders (IAD) have focused on structural and
   functional abnormalities, while few studies have simultaneously
   investigated the structural and functional brain alterations underlying
   individual differences in IA tendencies measured by questionnaires in a
   healthy sample. Here we combined structural (regional gray matter
   volume, rGMV) and functional (resting-state functional connectivity,
   rsFC) information to explore the neural mechanisms underlying IAT in a
   large sample of 260 healthy young adults. The results showed that IAT
   scores were significantly and positively correlated with rGMV in the
   right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, one key node of the
   cognitive control network, CCN), which might reflect reduced functioning
   of inhibitory control. More interestingly, decreased anticorrelations
   between the right DLPFC and the medial prefrontal cortex/rostral
   anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/rACC, one key node of the default mode
   network, DMN) were associated with higher IAT scores, which might be
   associated with reduced efficiency of the CCN and DMN (e.g., diminished
   cognitive control and self-monitoring). Furthermore, the Stroop
   interference effect was positively associated with the volume of the
   DLPFC and with the. IA scores, as well as with the connectivity between
   DLPFC and mPFC, which further indicated that rGMV variations in the
   DLPFC and decreased anticonnections between the DLPFC and mPFC may
   reflect addiction-related reduced inhibitory control and cognitive
   efficiency. These findings suggest the combination of structural and
   functional information can provide a valuable basis for further
   understanding of the mechanisms and pathogenesis of IA. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In order to survive in a complex environment, inhabited by potentially
   threatening and noxious objects or living beings, we need to constantly
   monitor our surrounding space, especially in the vicinity of our body.
   Such a space has been commonly referred to as one's `peripersonal space'
   (PPS). In this study we investigated whether emotion-inducing
   approaching sound sources impact the boundaries of PPS. Previous studies
   have indeed showed that the boundaries of PPS are not fixed but modulate
   according to properties of stimuli in the surrounding environment. In
   Experiment 1, participants performed a simple tactile detection task of
   targets presented to their right hand. Concurrently, they were presented
   with intensity-changing task-irrelevant artificial sound sources
   perceived as approaching toward their body. The physical properties of
   the sound elicited emotional responses of either neutral or negative
   valence. Results showed larger PPS when the approaching stimulus had
   negative as compared to neutral emotional valence. In Experiment 2, we
   used ecological sounds which content (i.e., psychological associations
   to the sound producing source), rather than physical properties,
   elicited emotional responses of negative, positive or neutral valence.
   In agreement with results from experiment 1, we found larger PPS when
   the approaching stimuli had negative emotional valence as compared to
   both neutral and positive ones. Results are discussed within the
   theoretical framework that conceives PPS as a safety zone around one's
   body. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by over-reactivity of
   fear-related circuits in social or performance situations and associated
   with marked social impairment. We used dynamic causal modeling (DCM), a
   method to evaluate effective connectivity, to test our hypothesis that
   SAD patients would exhibit dysfunctions in the amygdala-prefrontal
   emotion regulation network. Thirteen unmedicated SAD patients and 13
   matched healthy controls performed a series of facial emotion and object
   discrimination tasks while undergoing fMRI. The emotion-processing
   network was identified by a task-related contrast and motivated the
   selection of the right amygdala, OFC, and DLPFC for DCM analysis.
   Bayesian model averaging for DCM revealed abnormal connectivity between
   the OFC and the amygdala in SAD patients. In healthy controls, this
   network represents a negative feedback loop. In patients, however,
   positive connectivity from OFC to amygdala was observed, indicating an
   excitatory connection. As we did not observe a group difference of the
   modulatory influence of the FACE condition on the OFC to amygdala
   connection, we assume a context-independent reduction of prefrontal
   control over amygdalar activation in SAD patients. Using DCM, it was
   possible to highlight not only the neuronal dysfunction of isolated
   brain regions, but also the dysbalance of a distributed functional
   network.}},

Abstract = {{Perceptual learning is associated with experience-based changes in
   stimulus salience. Here, we use a novel procedure to show that learning
   a new association between a self-label and a neutral stimulus produces
   fast alterations in social salience measured by interference when
   targets associated with other people have to be selected in the presence
   of self-associated distractors. Participants associated neutral shapes
   with either themselves or a friend, over a short run of training trials.
   Subsequently, the shapes had to be identified in hierarchical
   (global-local) forms. The data show that giving a shape greater personal
   significance by associating it with the self had effects on visual
   selection equivalent to altering perceptual salience. Similar to
   previously observed effects linked to when perceptually salient
   distractors are ignored, effects of a self-associated distractor also
   increased activation in the left intraparietal cortex sulcus. The
   results show that self-associations to sensory stimuli rapidly modulate
   neural responses in a manner similar to changes in perceptual saliency.
   The self-association procedure provides a new way to understand how
   personal significance affects behavior.}},

Abstract = {{We consider approaches to explanation within the cognitive sciences that
   begin with Marr's computational level (e.g., purely Bayesian accounts of
   cognitive phenomena) or Marr's implementational level (e.g.,
   reductionist accounts of cognitive phenomena based only on neural-level
   evidence) and argue that each is subject to fundamental limitations
   which impair their ability to provide adequate explanations of cognitive
   phenomena. For this reason, it is argued, explanation cannot proceed at
   either level without tight coupling to the algorithmic and
   representation level. Even at this level, however, we argue that
   additional constraints relating to the decomposition of the cognitive
   system into a set of interacting subfunctions (i.e., a cognitive
   architecture) are required. Integrated cognitive architectures that
   permit abstract specification of the functions of components and that
   make contact with the neural level provide a powerful bridge for linking
   the algorithmic and representational level to both the computational
   level and the implementational level.}},

   expression}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{50-64}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The human face transmits a wealth of signals that readily provide
   crucial information for social interactions, such as facial identity and
   emotional expression. Yet, a fundamental question remains unresolved:
   does the face information for identity and emotional expression
   categorization tap into common or distinct representational systems? To
   address this question we tested PS, a pure case of acquired
   prosopagnosia with bilateral occipitotemporal lesions anatomically
   sparing the regions that are assumed to contribute to facial expression
   (de)coding (i.e., the amygdala, the insula and the posterior superior
   temporal sulcus - pSTS). We previously demonstrated that PS does not use
   information from the eye region to identify faces, but relies on the
   suboptimal mouth region. PS's abnormal information use for identity,
   coupled with her neural dissociation, provides a unique opportunity to
   probe the existence of a dichotomy in the face representational system.
   To reconstruct the mental models of the six basic facial expressions of
   emotion in PS and age-matched healthy observers, we used a novel reverse
   correlation technique tracking information use on dynamic faces. PS was
   comparable to controls, using all facial features to (de)code facial
   expressions with the exception of fear. PS's normal (de)coding of
   dynamic facial expressions suggests that the face system relies either
   on distinct representational systems for identity and expression, or
   dissociable cortical pathways to access them. Interestingly, PS showed a
   selective impairment for categorizing many static facial expressions,
   which could be accounted for by her lesion in the right inferior
   occipital gyrus. PS's advantage for dynamic facial expressions might
   instead relate to a functionally distinct and sufficient cortical
   pathway directly connecting the early visual cortex to the spared pSTS.
   Altogether, our data provide critical insights on the healthy and
   impaired face systems, question evidence of deficits obtained from
   patients by using static images of facial expressions, and offer novel
   routes for patient rehabilitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{184-194}},

Abstract = {{The posterior Superior Temporal Suclus (pSTS) represents a central hub
   in the complex cerebral network for person perception and emotion
   recognition as also suggested by its heavy connections with face- and
   body-specific cortical (e.g., the fusiform face area, FFA and the
   extrastriate body area, EBA) and subcortical structures (e.g.,
   amygdala). Information on whether pSTS is causatively involved in
   sustaining conscious visual perception of emotions expressed by faces
   and bodies is lacking. We explored this issue by combining a binocular
   rivalry procedure (where emotional and neutral face and body postures
   rivaled with house images) with off-line, 1-Hz repetitive transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (rTMS). We found that temporary inhibition of the
   right pSTS reduced perceptual dominance of fearful faces and increased
   perceptual dominance of fearful bodies, while leaving unaffected the
   perception of neutral face and body images. Inhibition of the vertex had
   no effect on conscious visual perception of neutral or emotional face or
   body stimuli. Thus, the right pSTS plays a causal role in shortening
   conscious vision of fearful faces and in prolonging conscious vision of
   fearful bodies. These results suggest that pSTS selectively modulates
   the activity of segregated networks involved in the conscious visual
   perception of emotional faces or bodies. We speculate that the opposite
   role of the right pSTS for conscious perception of fearful face and body
   maybe explained by the different connections that this region entertains
   with face- and body-selective visual areas as well as with amygdalae and
   premotor regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional instability, difficulties in social adjustment, and
   disinhibited behavior are the most common symptoms of the psychiatric
   comorbidities in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). This psychopathology
   has been associated with dysfunctions of mesial-frontal brain circuits.
   The present work is a first direct test of this link and adapted a
   paradigm for probing frontal circuits during empathy for pain. Neural
   and psychophysiological parameters of pain empathy were assessed by
   combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with simultaneous
   pupillometry in 15 JME patients and 15 matched healthy controls. In JME
   patients, we observed reduced neural activation of the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), the anterior insula (AI), and the ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). This modulation was paralleled by reduced
   pupil dilation during empathy for pain in patients. At the same time,
   pupil dilation was positively related to neural activity of the ACC, AI,
   and VLPFC. In JME patients, the ACC additionally showed reduced
   functional connectivity with the primary and secondary somatosensory
   cortex, areas fundamentally implicated in processing the somatic cause
   of another's pain. Our results provide first evidence that alterations
   of mesial-frontal circuits directly affect psychosocial functioning in
   JME patients and draw a link of pupil dynamics with brain activity
   during emotional processing. The findings of reduced pain empathy
   related activation of the ACC and AT and aberrant functional integration
   of the ACC with somatosensory cortex areas provide further evidence for
   this network's role in social behavior and helps explaining the JME
   psychopathology and patients' difficulties in social adjustment. (C)

Abstract = {{Current neurocircuitry models of PTSD focus on the neural mechanisms
   that mediate hypervigilance for threat and fear inhibition/extinction
   learning. Less focus has been directed towards explaining social
   deficits and heightened risk of revictimization observed among
   individuals with PTSD related to physical or sexual assault. The purpose
   of the present study was to foster more comprehensive theoretical models
   of PTSD by testing the hypothesis that assault-related PTSD is
   associated with behavioral impairments in a social trust and reciprocity
   task and corresponding alterations in the neural encoding of social
   learning mechanisms. Adult women with assault-related PTSD (n = 25) and
   control women (n = 15) completed a multi-trial trust game outside of the
   MRI scanner. A subset of these participants (15 with PTSD and 14
   controls) also completed a social and non-social reinforcement learning
   task during 3T fMRI. Brain regions that encoded the computationally
   modeled parameters of value expectation, prediction error, and
   volatility (i.e., uncertainty) were defined and compared between groups.
   The PTSD group demonstrated slower learning rates during the trust game
   and social prediction errors had a lesser impact on subsequent
   investment decisions. PTSD was also associated with greater encoding of
   negative expected social outcomes in perigenual anterior cingulate
   cortex and bilateral middle frontal gyri, and greater encoding of social
   prediction errors in the left temporoparietal junction. These data
   suggest mechanisms of PTSD-related deficits in social functioning and
   heightened risk for re-victimization in assault victims; however,
   comorbidity in the PTSD group and the lack of a trauma-exposed control
   group temper conclusions about PTSD specifically. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Is neural adaptation of the N170 category-specific? Effects of adaptor
   stimulus duration and interstimulus interval}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{8-15}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Neural adaptation paradigms have been used in the electrophysiological
   and neuroimaging literature to characterise neural populations
   underlying face and object perception. It was recently reported by
   Nemrodov and Itier (2012) that adaptation of the N170 event-related
   potential (ERP) component is not stimulus category-specific over rapid
   adapting stimulus durations (Si durations) and interstimulus intervals
   (ISIs). We therefore tested the category-specificity of adaptation over
   a range of S1 durations and ISIs. Faces and chairs were presented at Si
   (for 200, 500 or 1000 ms) and S2 (for 200 ms), over a variable ISI (200
   or 500 ms). Mean amplitudes of the P1, N170 and P2 visual ERP components
   were measured following Si and S2 stimuli. Faces at Si led to the
   smallest (i.e., most adapted) N170 amplitudes to both faces and chairs
   at S2, more than chairs at Si. N170s at S2 were smallest after a 500 ms
   S1 duration; but N170 amplitude did not vary over ISI. Effects were also
   seen for the two surrounding positive components, the P1 and P2.
   Presenting faces at S1 led to enhanced P1 amplitudes evoked by S2 chair
   stimuli. The P2 showed the smallest amplitudes following the shorter 200
   ms ISI. These results indicate that adaptation of the N170 is not
   actually category-specific but instead dependent on the S1 category
   (regardless of S2 category), and may also be influenced by earlier
   effects at the P1 (i.e., not specific to the N170). This challenges the
   assumption that N170 category adaptation indexes effects on distinct
   neural populations that differ between faces and non-face objects. (C)

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{467-473}},

Abstract = {{Reward comparison in the brain is thought to be achieved through the use
   of a `common currency', implying that reward value representations are
   computed on a unique scale in the same brain regions regardless of the
   reward type. Although such a mechanism has been identified in the
   ventro-medial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum in the context of
   decision-making, it is less clear whether it similarly applies to
   non-choice situations. To answer this question, we scanned 38
   participants with fMRI while they were presented with single cues
   predicting either monetary or erotic rewards, without the need to make a
   decision. The ventral striatum was the main brain structure to respond
   to both cues while showing increasing activity with increasing expected
   reward intensity. Most importantly, the relative response of the
   striatum to monetary vs erotic cues was correlated with the relative
   motivational value of these rewards as inferred from reaction times.
   Similar correlations were observed in a fronto-parietal network known to
   be involved in attentional focus and motor readiness. Together, our
   results suggest that striatal reward value signals not only obey to a
   common currency mechanism in the absence of choice but may also serve as
   an input to adjust motivated behaviour accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{Early life experience differentially shapes later stress reactivity, as
   evidenced by both animal and human studies. However, early
   experience-related changes in the function of central visceral neural
   circuits that control stress responses have not been well characterized,
   particularly in humans. The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
   (PVN), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), amygdala (Amyg) and
   subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) form a core visceral
   stress-responsive circuit. The goal of this study is to examine how
   childhood emotional and physical abuse relates to adulthood
   stressor-evoked activity within these visceral brain regions. To evoke
   acute states of mental stress, participants (n = 155) performed
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-adapted versions of the
   multi-source interference task (MSIT) and the Stroop task with
   simultaneous monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate.
   Regression analyses revealed that childhood physical abuse correlated
   positively with stressor-evoked changes in MAP, and negatively with
   unbiased, a priori extractions of fMRI blood-oxygen level-dependent
   signal change values within the sgACC, BNST, PVN and Amyg (n = 138).
   Abuse-related changes in the function of visceral neural circuits may
   reflect neurobiological vulnerability to adverse health outcomes

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{486-493}},

Abstract = {{The neural and cognitive mechanisms by which primed constructs can
   impact on social behavior are poorly understood. In the present study,
   we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore how
   scrambled sentence priming can impact on mimicry behavior. Sentences
   involving pro/antisocial events from a first/third-person point of view
   were presented in short blocks, followed by a reaction-time assessment
   of mimicry. Behavioral results showed that both prosociality and
   viewpoint impact on mimicry, and fMRI analysis showed this effect is
   implemented by anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC). We suggest
   that social primes may subtly modulate processing in amPFC in a manner
   linked to the later behavior, and that this same region also implements
   the top-down control of mimicry responses. This priming may be linked to
   processing of self-schemas in amPFC. Our findings demonstrate how social
   priming can be studied with fMRI, and have important implications for
   our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of prime-to-behavior
   effects as well as for current theories in social psychology.}},

Abstract = {{Well-being and subjective experience of a coherent world depend on our
   sense of `self' and relations between the self and the environment (e.g.
   people, objects and ideas). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC)
   is involved in self-related processing, and disrupted vMPFC activity is
   associated with disruptions of emotional/social functioning (e.g.
   depression and autism). Clarifying precise function(s) of vMPFC in
   self-related processing is an area of active investigation. In this
   study, we sought to more specifically characterize the function of vMPFC
   in self-related processing, focusing on two alternative accounts: (i)
   assignment of positive subjective value to self-related information and
   (ii) assignment of personal significance to self-related information.
   During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants
   imagined owning objects associated with either their perceived ingroup
   or outgroup. We found that for ingroup-associated objects, vMPFC showed
   greater activity for objects with increased than decreased
   post-ownership preference. In contrast, for outgroup-associated objects,
   vMPFC showed greater activity for objects with decreased than increased
   post-ownership preference. Our findings support the idea that the
   function of vMPFC in self-related processing may not be to
   represent/evaluate the `positivity' or absolute preference of
   self-related information but to assign personal significance to it based
   on its meaning/function for the self.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibiting impulsive reactions while still defending one's vital
   resources is paramount to functional self-control and successful
   development in a social environment. However, this ability of
   successfully inhibiting, and thus controlling one's impulsivity, often
   fails, leading to consequences ranging from motor impulsivity to
   aggressive reactions following provocation. Although inhibitory failure
   represents the underlying mechanism, the neurocognition of social
   aggression and motor response inhibition have traditionally been
   investigated in separation. Here, we aimed to directly investigate and
   compare the neural mechanisms underlying the failure of inhibition
   across those different modalities of self-control. We used functional
   imaging to reveal the overlap in neural correlates between failed motor
   response inhibition (measured by a go/no-go task) and reactive
   aggression (measured by the Taylor aggression paradigm) in healthy
   males. The core overlap of neural correlates was located in the anterior
   insula, suggesting common anterior insula involvement in motor
   impulsivity as well as reactive aggression. This evidence regarding an
   overarching role of the anterior insula across different modalities of
   self-control enables an integrative perspective on insula function and a
   better integration of cognitive, social and emotional factors into a
   comprehensive model of impulsivity. Furthermore, it can eventually lead
   to a better understanding of clinical syndromes involving inhibitory
   deficits.}},

Abstract = {{Social rejection elicits distress through the brain's alarm system, the
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The distress of rejection
   facilitates subsequent inclusion. As a result, traits that blunt this
   dACC response to social rejection might then threaten group membership,
   leading to further subsequent rejection. Alexithymia, the inability to
   identify and describe affective states, is associated with social
   impairment and reduced dACC activity under conditions of negative
   affect. Thus, we expected that alexithymia would relate to less dACC
   activation during rejection and that this blunted response would explain
   an association between alexithymia and greater rejection in everyday
   life. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and daily diaries, we
   found that subclinical individual differences in the core feature of
   alexithymia, difficulty identifying affect, was associated with a
   blunted dACC response to social rejection. Deficits in affect
   identification were also associated with greater daily rejection and
   that this effect was mediated and suppressed by dACC activation to
   rejection. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of the dACC in
   response to social rejection and extend the literature on alexithymia's
   ability to dampen neural responses and contribute to poor social
   functioning. The suppressing role of the dACC suggests future directions
   for clinical interventions on those with affective disorders.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Social referencing paradigms in humans and observational learning
   paradigms in animals suggest that emotional expressions are important
   for communicating valence. It has been proposed that these expressions
   initiate stimulus-reinforcement learning. Relatively little is known
   about the role of emotional expressions in reinforcement learning,
   particularly in the context of social referencing. In this study, we
   examined object valence learning in the context of a social referencing
   paradigm. Participants viewed objects and faces that turned toward the
   objects and displayed a fearful, happy or neutral reaction to them,
   while judging the gender of these faces. Notably, amygdala activation
   was larger when the expressions following an object were less expected.
   Moreover, when asked, participants were both more likely to want to
   approach, and showed stronger amygdala responses to, objects associated
   with happy relative to objects associated with fearful expressions. This
   suggests that the amygdala plays two roles in social referencing: (i)
   initiating learning regarding the valence of an object as a function of
   prediction errors to expressions displayed toward this object and (ii)
   orchestrating an emotional response to the object when value judgments
   are being made regarding this object.}},

Abstract = {{Brain reward systems mediate liking and wanting for food reward. Here,
   we explore the differential involvement of the following structures for
   these two components: the ventral and dorsal striatopallidal area,
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior insula and anterior cingulate.
   Twelve healthy female participants were asked to rate pleasantness
   (liking of food and non-food odors) and the desire to eat (wanting of
   odor-evoked food) during event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). The subjective ratings and fMRI were performed in hunger
   and satiety states. Activations of regions of interest were compared as
   a function of task (liking vs wanting), odor category (food vs non-food)
   and metabolic state (hunger vs satiety). We found that the nucleus
   accumbens and ventral pallidum were differentially involved in liking or
   wanting during the hunger state, which suggests a reciprocal inhibitory
   influence between these structures. Neural activation of OFC subregions
   was correlated with either liking or wanting ratings, suggesting an OFC
   role in reward processing magnitude. Finally, during the hunger state,
   participants with a high body mass index exhibited less activation in
   neural structures underlying food reward processing. Our results suggest
   that food liking and wanting are two separable psychological constructs
   and may be functionally segregated within the cortico-striatopallidal
   circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Humans often evaluate their abilities by comparing their personal

   whether the comparison turns out in one's favor or against it. Here, we
   investigate how social comparisons of performance are encoded and

   resonance images while subjects answered questions in a knowledge quiz
   that was related to their profession. After each question, subjects
   received a feedback about their personal performance, followed by a
   feedback about the performance of a reference group who had been quizzed
   beforehand. Based on the subjects' personal performance, we divided
   trials in downward and upward comparisons. We found that upward
   comparisons correlated with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex and the anterior insula. Downward comparisons were associated
   with increased activation in the ventral striatum (VS), the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
   The extent to which subjects outperformed the reference group modulated
   the activity in the VS and in the dorsal ACC. We suggest that the
   co-activation of the VS and the dorsal ACC contributes to the
   integration of downward comparisons into the evaluation of personal
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Informational cascades can occur when rationally acting individuals
   decide independently of their private information and follow the
   decisions of preceding decision-makers. In the process of updating
   beliefs, differences in the weighting of private and publicly available
   social information may modulate the probability that a cascade starts in
   a decisive way. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we
   examined neural activity while participants updated their beliefs based
   on the decisions of two fictitious stock market traders and their own
   private information, which led to a final decision of buying one of two
   stocks. Computational modeling of the behavioral data showed that a
   majority of participants overweighted private information. Overweighting
   was negatively correlated with the probability of starting an
   informational cascade in trials especially prone to conformity. Belief
   updating by private information was related to activity in the inferior
   frontal gyrus/anterior insula, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
   the parietal cortex; the more a participant overweighted private
   information, the higher the activity in the inferior frontal
   gyrus/anterior insula and the lower in the parietal-temporal cortex.
   This study explores the neural correlates of overweighting of private
   information, which underlies the tendency to start an informational

Abstract = {{The neural correlates of anxious anticipation have been primarily
   studied with aversive and neutral stimuli. In this study, we examined
   the effect of valence on anticipation by using high arousal aversive and
   positive stimuli and a condition of uncertainty (i.e. either positive or
   aversive). The task consisted of predetermined cues warning participants
   of upcoming aversive, positive, `uncertain' (either aversive or
   positive) and neutral movie clips. Anticipation of all affective clips
   engaged common regions including the anterior insula, dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex, thalamus, caudate, inferior parietal and prefrontal
   cortex that are associated with emotional experience, sustained
   attention and appraisal. In contrast, the nucleus accumbens and medial
   prefrontal cortex, regions implicated in reward processing, were
   selectively engaged during anticipation of positive clips (depicting
   sexually explicit content) and the mid-insula, which has been linked to
   processing aversive stimuli, was selectively engaged during anticipation
   of aversive clips (depicting graphic medical procedures); these three
   areas were also activated during anticipation of `uncertain' clips
   reflecting a broad preparatory response for both aversive and positive
   stimuli. These results suggest that a common circuitry is recruited in
   anticipation of affective clips regardless of valence, with additional
   areas preferentially engaged depending on whether expected stimuli are
   negative or positive.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies on HIV risk perception suggest that people rely on
   impressions they have about the safety of their partner. The present
   fMRI study investigated the neural correlates of the intuitive
   perception of risk. First, during an implicit condition, participants
   viewed a series of unacquainted persons and performed a task unrelated
   to HIV risk. In the following explicit condition, participants evaluated
   the HIV risk for each presented person. Contrasting responses for high
   and low HIV risk revealed that risky stimuli evoked enhanced activity in
   the anterior insula and medial prefrontal regions, which are involved in
   salience processing and frequently activated by threatening and negative
   affect-related stimuli. Importantly, neural regions responding to
   explicit HIV risk judgments were also enhanced in the implicit
   condition, suggesting a neural mechanism for intuitive impressions of
   riskiness. Overall, these findings suggest the saliency network as
   neural correlate for the intuitive sensing of risk.}},

Title = {{Perception of Men's Beauty and Attractiveness by Women with Low Sexual
   Desire}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionDespite the high prevalence of hypoactive sexual desire
   disorder (HSDD), especially among women, this sexual disorder remains
   poorly understood. Among the multiple factors possibly involved in HSDD,
   particularities in the cognitive evaluations of social stimuli need to
   be better characterized. Especially, beauty and attractiveness
   judgments, two dimensions of interpersonal perception that are related
   but differ on their underlying motivational aspects, may vary according
   to the level of sexual desire.
   AimThe main goal of this study was to investigate whether women with and
   without HSDD differ in their evaluations of beauty and attractiveness of
   men's faces and voices.
   MethodsYoung women from the general population (controls, n=16) and with
   HSDD (patients, n=16) took part in the study. They were presented with a
   series of neutral/nonerotic voices and faces of young men from the
   GEneva Faces And Voices database.
   Main Outcome MeasuresRatings of beauty (i.e., assessments of aesthetic
   pleasure) and of attractiveness (i.e., assessments of the personal
   propensity to feel attracted to someone) and the frequency to which the
   participants pressed a key to see or listen to each stimulus again were
   the main outcome measures.
   ResultsRatings of attractiveness were lower than ratings of beauty in
   both groups of women. The dissociation between beauty and attractiveness
   was larger in women with HSDD than in control participants. Patients
   gave lower attractiveness ratings than the controls and replayed the
   stimuli significantly less often.
   ConclusionThese results suggest that women with HSDD are characterized
   by specific alterations of the motivational component of men's
   perception, very early in the process of interpersonal relationships.
   Our findings have significant implications, both in better understanding
   the specific cognitive processes underlying hypoactive sexual desire and
   more largely the evaluative processes involved in human mate choice.

Abstract = {{Polymorphisms at the rs10994336 and rs9804190 loci of the Ankyrin 3
   (ANK3) gene have been strongly associated with increased risk for
   bipolar disorder (BD). However, their potential pathogenetic effect on
   BD-relevant neural circuits remains unknown. We examined the effect of
   BD-risk polymorphisms at rs10994336 and rs9804190 on the working memory
   (WM) circuit using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
   obtained from euthymic patients with BD (n=41), their psychiatrically
   healthy first-degree relatives (n=25) and unrelated individuals without
   personal or family history of psychiatric disorders (n=46) while
   performing the N-back task. In unrelated healthy individuals, the
   rs10994336-risk-allele was associated with reduced activation of the
   ventral visual cortical components of the WM circuit while the
   rs9804190-risk-allele was associated with inefficient hyperactivation of
   the prefrontal cortical components of the WM. In patients and their
   healthy relatives, risk alleles at either loci were associated with
   hyperactivation in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex. Additionally,
   Rs9804190-risk-allele carriers with BD evidenced abnormal
   hyperactivation within the posterior cingulate cortex. This study
   provides new insights on the neurogenetic correlates of allelic
   variation at different genome-wide supported BD-risk associated ANK3
   loci that support their involvement in BD and highlight the modulatory
   influence of increased background genetic risk for BD. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Human scale functional brain networks are hypothesized to undergo
   significant changes over development. Little is known about these
   functional architectural changes, particularly during the second half of
   the first year of life. We used multivariate pattern classification of
   resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI)
   data obtained in an on-going, multi-site, longitudinal study of brain
   and behavioral development to explore whether fcMRI data contained
   information sufficient to classify infant age. Analyses carefully
   account for the effects of fcMRI motion artifact. Support vector
   machines (SVMs) classified 6 versus 12 month-old infants (128 datasets)
   above chance based on fcMRI data alone. Results demonstrate significant
   changes in measures of brain functional organization that coincide with
   a special period of dramatic change in infant motor, cognitive, and
   social development. Explorations of the most different correlations used
   for SVM lead to two different interpretations about functional
   connections that support 6 versus 12-month age categorization. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The present study sought to investigate the neural basis of implicit
   learning of task-irrelevant perceptual sequence. A novel SRT task, the
   serial syllable identification task (SSI task), was used in which the
   participants were asked to recognize which one of two Chinese syllables
   was presented. The tones of the syllables were irrelevant to the task
   but followed an underlying structured sequence. Participants were
   scanned while they performed the SSI task. Results showed that, at the
   behavioral level, faster RTs for the sequential material indicated that
   task-irrelevant sequence knowledge could be learned. In the subsequent
   prediction test of knowledge of the tonal cues using subjective
   measures, we found that the knowledge was obtained unconsciously. At the
   neural level, the left caudate, bilateral hippocampus and bilateral
   superior parietal lobule were engaged during the sequence condition
   relative to the random condition. Further analyses revealed that greater
   learning-related activation (relative to random) in the right caudate
   nucleus, bilateral hippocampus and left superior parietal lobule were
   found during the second half of the training phase compared with the
   first half. When people reported that they were guessing, the magnitude
   of the right hippocampus and left superior parietal lobule activations
   was positively related to the accuracy of prediction test, which was
   significantly better than chance. Together, the present results
   indicated that the caudate, hippocampus and superior parietal lobule
   played critical roles in the implicit perceptual sequence learning even
   when the perceptual features were task irrelevant.}},

Abstract = {{Putatively, mindfulness meditation involves the generation of a state of
   ``nonappraisal,{''} yet, little is known about how mindfulness may
   influence appraisal processes. We investigated whether the state and
   practice of mindfulness could enhance cognitive reappraisal.
   Participants (N = 44; M age = 24.44, SD = 4.00, range 19-38, 82.2 \%
   female) were randomized to either (1) mindfulness, (2) suppression, or
   (3) mind wandering induction training conditions. Cognitive reappraisal
   was assessed with the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) prior to
   experimental induction, and state mindfulness was assessed immediately
   following induction using the Toronto Mindfulness Scale. Participants
   practiced their assigned strategy for 1 week and then were reassessed
   with the ERQ reappraisal subscale. Participants receiving mindfulness
   training reported significantly higher levels of state mindfulness than
   participants in the thought suppression and mind wandering conditions.
   Although brief mindfulness training did not lead to significantly
   greater increases in reappraisal than the other two conditions, state
   mindfulness during mindfulness meditation was prospectively associated
   with increases in reappraisal. Path analysis revealed that the indirect
   effect between mindfulness training and reappraisal was significant
   through state mindfulness. Degree of state mindfulness achieved during
   the act of mindfulness meditation significantly predicted increases in
   reappraisal over time, suggesting that mindfulness may promote emotion
   regulation by enhancing cognitive reappraisal.}},

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin may be an effective therapeutic strategy for
   the currently untreatable social and communication deficits associated
   with autism. Our recent paper reported that oxytocin mitigated autistic
   behavioral deficits through the restoration of activity in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), as demonstrated with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a socio-communication task.
   However, it is unknown whether oxytocin exhibited effects at the
   neuronal level, which was outside of the specific task examined. In the
   same randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject
   cross-over clinical trial in which a single dose of intranasal oxytocin
   (24 IU) was administered to 40 men with high-functioning autism spectrum
   disorder (UMIN000002241/000004393), we measured N-acetylaspartate (NAA)
   levels, a marker for neuronal energy demand, in the vmPFC using
   H-1-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS). The differences in the
   NAA levels between the oxytocin and placebo sessions were associated
   with oxytocin-induced fMRI signal changes in the vmPFC. The
   oxytocin-induced increases in the fMRI signal could be predicted by the
   NAA differences between the oxytocin and placebo sessions (P = 0.002),
   an effect that remained after controlling for variability in the time
   between the fMRI and H-1-MRS scans (P = 0.006) and the order of
   administration of oxytocin and placebo (P = 0.001). Furthermore, path
   analysis showed that the NAA differences in the vmPFC triggered
   increases in the task-dependent fMRI signals in the vmPFC, which
   consequently led to improvements in the socio-communication difficulties
   associated with autism. The present study suggests that the beneficial
   effects of oxytocin are not limited to the autistic behavior elicited by
   our psychological task, but may generalize to other autistic behavioral
   problems associated with the vmPFC.}},

Abstract = {{Is it possible to understand the intentions of others by merely
   observing their movements? Current debate has been mainly focused on the
   role that mirror neurons and motor simulation may play in this process,
   with surprisingly little attention being devoted to how intentions are
   actually translated into movements. Here, we delineate an alternative
   approach to the problem of intention-from-movement understanding, which
   takes action execution rather than action observation as a starting
   point. We first consider whether and to what extent, during action
   execution, intentions shape movement kinematics. We then examine whether
   observers are sensitive to intention information conveyed by visual
   kinematics and can use this information to discriminate between
   different intentions. Finally, we consider the neural mechanisms that
   may contribute to intention-from-movement understanding. We argue that
   by reframing the relationship between intention and movement, this
   evidence opens new perspectives into the neurobiology of how we know
   other minds and predict others' behavior.}},

Title = {{Disorder-dissociated effects of fluoxetine on brain function of working

Abstract = {{Background. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD) are often co-morbid and share performance and
   brain dysfunctions during working memory (WM). Serotonin agonists
   modulate WM and there is evidence of positive behavioural effects in
   both disorders. We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to investigate shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions of
   WM in these disorders, and the effects of a single dose of the selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine.
   Method. Age-matched boys with ADHD (n = 17), ASD (n = 17) and controls
   (n = 22) were compared using fMRI during an N-back WM task. Patients
   were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or placebo
   in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized design.
   Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects on
   performance and brain function. To test for normalization effects of
   brain dysfunctions, patients under each drug condition were compared to
   controls.
   Results. Under placebo, relative to controls, both ADHD and ASD boys
   shared underactivation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC). Fluoxetine significantly normalized the DLPFC underactivation
   in ASD relative to controls whereas it increased posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC) deactivation in ADHD relative to control boys.
   Within-patient analyses showed inverse effects of fluoxetine on PCC
   deactivation, which it enhanced in ADHD and decreased in ASD.
   Conclusions. The findings show that fluoxetine modulates brain
   activation during WM in a disorder-specific manner by normalizing
   task-positive DLPFC dysfunction in ASD boys and enhancing task-negative
   default mode network (DMN) deactivation in ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Depression is a prevalent disorder that significantly
   affects the social functioning and interpersonal relationships of
   individuals. This highlights the need for investigation of the neural
   mechanisms underlying these social difficulties. Investigation of social
   exchanges has traditionally been challenging as such interactions are
   difficult to quantify. Recently, however, neuroeconomic approaches that
   combine multiplayer behavioural economic paradigms and neuroimaging have
   provided a framework to operationalize and quantify the study of social
   interactions and the associated neural substrates.
   Method. We investigated brain activation using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) in unmedicated depressed participants (n = 25)
   and matched healthy controls (n = 25). During scanning, participants
   played a behavioural economic paradigm, the Ultimatum Game (UG). In this
   task, participants accept or reject monetary offers from other players.
   Results. In comparison to controls, depressed participants reported
   decreased levels of happiness in response to `fair' offers. With
   increasing fairness of offers, controls activated the nucleus accumbens
   and the dorsal caudate, regions that have been reported to process
   social information and responses to rewards. By contrast, participants
   with depression failed to activate these regions with increasing
   fairness, with the lack of nucleus accumbens activation correlating with
   increased anhedonia symptoms. Depressed participants also showed a
   diminished response to increasing unfairness of offers in the medial
   occipital lobe.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest that depressed individuals differ from
   healthy controls in the neural substrates involved with processing
   social information. In depression, the nucleus accumbens and dorsal
   caudate may underlie abnormalities in processing information linked to
   the fairness and rewarding aspects of other people's decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Effective real-world communication requires the alignment of multiple
   individuals to a common perspective or mental framework. To study how
   this alignment occurs at the level of the brain, we measured BOLD
   response during fMRI while participants (n = 24) listened to a series of
   vignettes either in the presence or absence of a valid contextual cue.
   The valid contextual cue was necessary to understand the information in
   each vignette. We then examined where and to what extent the shared
   valid context led to greater intersubject similarity of neural
   processing. Regions of the default mode network including posterior
   cingulate cortex and medial pFC became more aligned when participants
   shared a valid contextual framework, whereas other regions, including
   primary sensory cortices, responded to the stimuli reliably regardless
   of contextual factors. Taken in conjunction with previous research, the
   present results suggest that default mode regions help the brain to
   organize incoming verbal information in the context of previous
   knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Major theories for explaining the organization of semantic memory in the
   human brain are premised on the often-observed dichotomous dissociation
   between living and nonliving objects. Evidence from neuroimaging has
   been interpreted to suggest that this distinction is reflected in the
   functional topography of the ventral vision pathway as lateral-to-medial
   activation gradients. Recently, we observed that similar activation
   gradients also reflect differences among living stimuli consistent with
   the semantic dimension of graded animacy. Here, we address whether the
   salient dichotomous distinction between living and nonliving objects is
   actually reflected in observable measured brain activity or whether
   previous observations of a dichotomous dissociation were the illusory
   result of stimulus sampling biases. Using fMRI, we measured neural
   responses while participants viewed 10 animal species with high to low
   animacy and two inanimate categories. Representational similarity
   analysis of the activity in ventral vision cortex revealed a main axis
   of variation with high-animacy species maximally different from
   artifacts and with the least animate species closest to artifacts.
   Although the associated functional topography mirrored activation
   gradients observed for animate-inanimate contrasts, we found no evidence
   for a dichotomous dissociation. We conclude that a central organizing
   principle of human object vision corresponds to the graded psychological
   property of animacy with no clear distinction between living and
   nonliving stimuli. The lack of evidence for a dichotomous dissociation
   in the measured brain activity challenges theories based on this
   premise.}},

Title = {{Valence Asymmetries in the Human Amygdala: Task Relevance Modulates
   Amygdala Responses to Positive More than Negative Affective Cues}},

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Organisms must constantly balance appetitive needs with vigilance for
   potential threats. Recent research suggests that the amygdala may play
   an important role in both of these goals. Although the amygdala plays a
   role in processing motivationally relevant stimuli that are positive or
   negative, negative information often appears to carry greater weight.
   From a functional perspective, this may reflect the fact that
   threatening stimuli generally require action, whereas appetitive stimuli
   can often be safely ignored. In this study, we examine whether amygdala
   activation to positive stimuli may be more sensitive to task goals than
   negative stimuli, which are often related to self-preservation concerns.
   During fMRI, participants were presented with two images that varied on
   valence and extremity and were instructed to focus on one of the images.
   Results indicated that negative stimuli elicited greater amygdala
   activity regardless of task relevance. In contrast, positive stimuli
   only led to a relative increase in amygdala activity when they were task
   relevant. This suggests that the amygdala may be more responsive to
   negative stimuli regardless of their relevance to immediate goals,
   whereas positive stimuli may only elicit amygdala activity when they are
   relevant to the perceivers' goals. This pattern of valence asymmetry in
   the human amygdala may help balance approach-related goal pursuit with
   chronic self-preservation goals.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to evaluate the empathic ability and its
   functional brain correlates in posttraumatic stress disorder subjects
   (PTSD). Seven PTSD subjects and ten healthy controls, all present in the
   L'Aquila area during the earthquake of the April 2009, underwent fMRI
   during which they performed a modified version of the Multifaceted
   Empathy Test. PTSD patients showed impairments in implicit and explicit
   emotional empathy, but not in cognitive empathy. Brain responses during
   cognitive empathy showed an increased activation in patients compared to
   controls in the right medial frontal gyrus and the left inferior frontal
   gyrus. During implicit emotional empathy responses patients with PTSD,
   compared to controls, exhibited greater neural activity in the left
   pallidum and right insula; instead the control group showed an increased
   activation in right inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, in the explicit
   emotional empathy responses the PTSD group showed a reduced neural
   activity in the left insula and the left inferior frontal gyrus. The
   behavioral deficit limited to the emotional empathy dimension,
   accompanied by different patterns of activation in empathy related brain
   structures, represent a first piece of evidence of a dissociation
   between emotional and cognitive empathy in PTSD patients. The present
   findings support the idea that empathy is a multidimensional process,
   with different facets depending on distinct anatomical substrates. (C)

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The ventral visual pathway of the primate brain is specialized to
   respond to stimuli in certain categories, such as the well-studied face
   selective patches in the macaque inferotemporal cortex. To what extent
   does response selectivity determined using brief presentations of
   isolated stimuli predict activity during the free viewing of a natural,
   dynamic scene, where features are superimposed in space and time? To
   approach this question, we obtained fMRI activity from the brains of
   three macaques viewing extended video clips containing a range of social
   and nonsocial content and compared the fMRI time courses to a family of
   feature models derived from the movie content. Starting with more than
   two dozen feature models extracted from each movie, we created
   functional maps based on features whose time courses were nearly
   orthogonal, focusing primarily on faces, motion content, and contrast
   level. Activity mapping using the face feature model readily yielded
   functional regions closely resembling face patches obtained using a
   block design in the same animals. Overall, the motion feature model
   dominated responses in nearly all visually driven areas, including the
   face patches as well as ventral visual areas V4, TEO, and TE. Control
   experiments presenting dynamic movies, whose content was free of
   animals, demonstrated that biological movement critically contributed to
   the predominance of motion in fMRI responses. These results highlight
   the value of natural viewing paradigms for studying the brain's
   functional organization and also underscore the paramount contribution
   of magnocellular input to the ventral visual pathway during natural
   vision. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{Reality TV and vicarious embarrassment: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{109-117}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Vicarious embarrassment (VE) is an emotion triggered by the
   observation of others' pratfalls or social norm violations. Several
   explanatory approaches have been suggested to explain the source of this
   phenomenon, including perspective taking abilities or ingroup
   identification. Knowledge about its biological bases, however, is
   scarce. To gain a better understanding, the present study investigated
   neural activation patterns in response to video clips from reality TV
   shows. Reality TV is well known for presenting social norm violations,
   flaws and pratfalls of its protagonists in real life situations thereby
   qualifying as an ecological valid trigger for VE.
   Methods: N = 60 healthy participants viewed stand stills from previously
   watched video clips taken from German reality TV-shows while undergoing
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. The clips were preselected for
   high versus low VE content in a pilot study. Besides the investigation
   of differences in brain activation elicited by VE versus control stand
   stills (blocked design contrast), we performed additional exploratory
   functional connectivity analyses (psychophysiological interaction; PPI)
   to detect VE related brain networks.
   Results: Compared to the low VE condition, participants in the high VE
   condition showed a higher activation in the middle temporal gyrus, the
   supramarginal gyrus, the right inferior frontal gyrus and the gyrus
   rectus. Functional connectivity analyses confirmed increased
   connectivity of these regions with the anterior cingulate in the VE
   condition. Moreover, self-ratings of VE and brain activity were
   correlated positively.
   Conclusion: Reality TV formats with high VE content activate brain
   regions associated with Theory of Mind, but also with empathic concern
   and social identity. Therefore, our results support the idea that the
   ability to put oneself in other person's shoes is a major prerequisite
   for VE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{449-457}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Pointing is a communicative gesture, commonly used for expressing two
   main intentions: imperative, to obtain a desired object/action from the
   other, or declarative, to share attention/interest about a referent with
   the other. Previous neuroimaging research on adults examined pointing
   almost exclusively as a reaching-like motor act rather than as a
   communicative gesture. Here, we used fMRI to record brain activity while
   16 participants produced either imperative or declarative pointing
   gestures within a communicative context. A network of regions (the
   bilateral ventral premotor cortex, anterior midcingulate cortex, middle
   insula and the right preSMA) showed a preference for the production of
   declarative pointing as opposed to imperative pointing. The right preSMA
   also preferred declarative intention during pointing observation.
   Instead, independently from the intention, the right pMTG was more
   active during pointing observation than production. In the bilateral
   posterior parietal reach region we also observed a side (contra > ipsi)
   effect when the intention was imperative, regardless of the subject's
   role in the communication.
   Based on these results, we propose that pointing with declarative
   intention recruits a network of regions associated with will,
   motivation, emotional/affective expression and intersubjectivity,
   whereas pointing with imperative intention recruits regions associated
   with reaching. The proposal is consistent with the developmental
   hypothesis that declarative pointing reflects social cognitive abilities
   more than imperative pointing and establishes a stimulating link for
   future interdisciplinary research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   Investigation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Youth with conduct disorder (CD) not only inflict serious physical and
   psychological harm on others, but are also at greatly increased risk of
   sustaining injuries, developing depression or substance abuse, and
   engaging in criminal behaviors. The underlying neurobiological basis of
   CD remains unclear.
   Objective
   The present study investigated whether participants with CD have altered
   hemodynamic activity under resting-state conditions.
   Methods
   Eighteen medication-naive boys with CD and 18 age-and sex-matched
   typically developing (TD) controls underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the resting state. The amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was measured and compared between the
   CD and TD groups.
   Results
   Compared with the TD participants, the CD participants showed lower ALFF
   in the bilateral amygdala/parahippocampus, right lingual gyrus, left
   cuneus and right insula. Higher ALFF was observed in the right fusiform
   gyrus and right thalamus in the CD participants compared to the TD
   group.
   Conclusions
   Youth with CD displayed widespread functional abnormalities in
   emotion-related and visual cortical regions in the resting state. These
   results suggest that deficits in the intrinsic activity of resting state
   networks may contribute to the etiology of CD.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies explore consumer perception of brands in a more or less
   passive way. This may still be representative for many situations or
   decisions we make each day. Nevertheless, sometimes we often actively
   search for and use information to make informed and reasoned choices,
   thus implying a rational and thinking consumer. Researchers suggested
   describing this distinction as low relative to high involvement consumer
   behavior. Although the involvement concept has been widely used to
   explain consumer behavior, behavioral and neural correlates of this
   concept are poorly understood. The current study aims to describe a
   behavioral measure that is associated with high involvement, the length
   of search behavior. A second aim of this study was to explore brain
   activations associated with involvement by employing functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). We presented participants information cues for
   different products and told them that they had to answer questions with
   respect to these products at the end of the experiment. Participants
   were free to stop the information search if they think they gathered
   enough information or to continue with collecting information.
   Behavioral results confirmed our hypothesis of a relationship between
   searching behavior and personal involvement by demonstrating that the
   length of search correlated significantly with the degree of personal
   involvement of the participants. fMRI data revealed that personal
   involvement was associated with activation in BA44. Since this brain
   region is known to be involved in semantic memory, the results of this
   pilot study suggest that high involvement consumer behavior may be
   linked to cognitive load and attention towards a product.}},

Title = {{Differentiating Self-Projection from Simulation during Mentalizing:
   Evidence from fMRI}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{We asked participants to predict which of two colors a similar other
   (student) and a dissimilar other (retiree) likes better. We manipulated
   if color-pairs were two hues from the same color-category (e.g. green)
   or two conceptually different colors (e.g. green versus blue). In the
   former case, the mental state that has to be represented (i.e., the
   percept of two different hues of green) is predominantly non-conceptual
   or phenomenal in nature, which should promote mental simulation as a
   strategy for mentalizing. In the latter case, the mental state (i.e. the
   percept of green versus blue) can be captured in thought by concepts,
   which facilitates the use of theories for mentalizing. In line with the
   self-projection hypothesis, we found that cortical midline areas
   including vmPFC/orbitofrontal cortex and precuneus were preferentially
   activated for mentalizing about a similar other. However, activation was
   not affected by the nature of the color-difference, suggesting that
   self-projection subsumes simulation-like processes but is not limited to
   them. This indicates that self-projection is a universal strategy
   applied in different contexts-irrespective of the availability of
   theories for mentalizing. Along with midline activations linked to
   self-projection, we also observed activation in right lateral frontal
   and dorsal parietal areas showing a theory-like pattern. Taken together,
   this shows that mentalizing does not operate based on simulation or
   theory, but that both strategies are used concurrently to predict the
   choices of others.}},

Title = {{Neuroanatomical substrates for the volitional regulation of heart rate}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{The control of physiological arousal can assist in the regulation of
   emotional state. A subset cortical and subcortical brain regions are
   implicated in autonomic control of bodily arousal during emotional
   behaviors. Here, we combined human functional neuroimaging with
   autonomic monitoring to identify neural mechanisms that support the
   volitional regulation of heart rate, a process that may be assisted by
   visual feedback. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 15
   healthy adults performed an experimental task in which they were
   prompted voluntarily to increase or decrease cardiovascular arousal
   (heart rate) during true, false, or absent visual feedback. Participants
   achieved appropriate changes in heart rate, without significant
   modulation of respiratory rate, and were overall not influenced by the
   presence of visual feedback. Increased activity in right amygdala,
   striatum and brainstem occurred when participants attempted to increase
   heart rate. In contrast, activation of ventrolateral prefrontal and
   parietal cortices occurred when attempting to decrease heart rate.
   Biofeedback enhanced activity within occipito-temporal cortices, but
   there was no significant interaction with task conditions. Activity in
   regions including pregenual anterior cingulate and ventral striatum
   reflected the magnitude of successful task performance, which was
   negatively related to subclinical anxiety symptoms. Measured changes in
   respiration correlated with posterior insula activation and heart rate,
   at a more lenient threshold, change correlated with insula, caudate, and
   midbrain activity. Our findings highlight a set of brain regions,
   notably ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, supporting volitional control
   of cardiovascular arousal. These data are relevant to understanding
   neural substrates supporting interaction between intentional and
   interoceptive states related to anxiety, with implications for
   biofeedback interventions, e.g., real-time fMRI, that target emotional
   regulation.}},

Title = {{Neural mechanisms of negative reinforcement in children and adolescents
   with autism spectrum disorders}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous research has found accumulating evidence for
   atypical reward processing in autism spectrum disorders (ASD),
   particularly in the context of social rewards. Yet, this line of
   research has focused largely on positive social reinforcement, while
   little is known about the processing of negative reinforcement in
   individuals with ASD.
   Methods: The present study examined neural responses to social negative
   reinforcement (a face displaying negative affect) and non-social
   negative reinforcement (monetary loss) in children with ASD relative to
   typically developing children, using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI).
   Results: We found that children with ASD demonstrated hypoactivation of
   the right caudate nucleus while anticipating non-social negative
   reinforcement and hypoactivation of a network of frontostriatal regions
   (including the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, and putamen) while
   anticipating social negative reinforcement. In addition, activation of
   the right caudate nucleus during non-social negative reinforcement was
   associated with individual differences in social motivation.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that atypical responding to negative
   reinforcement in children with ASD may contribute to social motivational
   deficits in this population.}},

   which participants were asked to distinguish between two different
   categories of pictures of everyday life objects and the architectures as
   soon as possible. The architectural pictures included two categories:
   noted-architect-designed and ordinary architectures. A smaller P2
   amplitude and a larger N2 amplitude were elicited by the master
   architects' works than those of ordinary architectures, which indicated
   that perceived positive emotion and novelty perception occurred in the
   aesthetic processing of architectures. Our results present two sensitive
   neural indicators, P2 and N2, to judge the delight and novelty qualities
   shown by the architecture, respectively. (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health,

   subclinical variation in autistic traits}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with autistic spectrum disorders exhibit distinct
   personality traits linked to attentional, social, and affective
   functions, and those traits are expressed with varying levels of
   severity in the neurotypical and subclinical population. Variation in
   autistic traits has been linked to reduced functional and structural
   connectivity (i.e., underconnectivity, or reduced synchrony) with neural
   networks modulated by attentional, social, and affective functions. Yet,
   it remains unclear whether reduced synchrony between these neural
   networks contributes to autistic traits. To investigate this issue, we
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record brain activation
   while neurotypical participants who varied in their subclinical scores
   on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) viewed alternating blocks of social
   and nonsocial stimuli (i.e., images of faces and of landscape scenes).
   We used independent component analysis (ICA) combined with a
   spatiotemporal regression to quantify synchrony between neural networks.
   Our results indicated that decreased synchrony between the executive
   control network (ECN) and a face-scene network (FSN) predicted higher
   scores on the AQ. This relationship was not explained by individual
   differences in head motion, preferences for faces, or personality
   variables related to social cognition. Our findings build on clinical
   reports by demonstrating that reduced synchrony between distinct neural
   networks contributes to a range of subclinical autistic traits.}},

Title = {{The Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation by Implementation Intentions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{Several studies have investigated the neural basis of effortful emotion
   regulation (ER) but the neural basis of automatic ER has been less
   comprehensively explored. The present study investigated the neural
   basis of automatic ER supported by `implementation intentions'. 40
   healthy participants underwent fMRI while viewing emotion-eliciting
   images and used either a previously-taught effortful ER strategy, in the
   form of a goal intention (e.g., try to take a detached perspective), or
   a more automatic ER strategy, in the form of an implementation intention
   (e.g., ``If I see something disgusting, then I will think these are just
   pixels on the screen!{''}), to regulate their emotional response.
   Whereas goal intention ER strategies were associated with activation of
   brain areas previously reported to be involved in effortful ER
   (including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), ER strategies based on an
   implementation intention strategy were associated with activation of
   right inferior frontal gyrus and ventro-parietal cortex, which may
   reflect the attentional control processes automatically captured by the
   cue for action contained within the implementation intention. Goal
   intentions were also associated with less effective modulation of left
   amygdala, supporting the increased efficacy of ER under implementation
   intention instructions, which showed coupling of orbitofrontal cortex
   and amygdala. The findings support previous behavioural studies in
   suggesting that forming an implementation intention enables people to
   enact goal-directed responses with less effort and more efficiency.}},

Title = {{Default Mode Network Connectivity as a Function of Familial and
   Environmental Risk for Psychotic Disorder}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Research suggests that altered interregional connectivity in specific
   networks, such as the default mode network (DMN), is associated with
   cognitive and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. In addition, frontal
   and limbic connectivity alterations have been associated with trauma,
   drug use and urban upbringing, though these environmental exposures have
   never been examined in relation to DMN functional connectivity in
   psychotic disorder.
   Methods
   Resting-state functional MRI scans were obtained from 73 patients with
   psychotic disorder, 83 non-psychotic siblings of patients with psychotic
   disorder and 72 healthy controls. Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
   seed-based correlation analysis was used to estimate functional
   connectivity within the DMN. DMN functional connectivity was examined in
   relation to group (familial risk), group x environmental exposure (to
   cannabis, developmental trauma and urbanicity) and symptomatology.
   Results
   There was a significant association between group and PCC connectivity
   with the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), the precuneus (PCu) and the
   medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Compared to controls, patients and
   siblings had increased PCC connectivity with the IPL, PCu and MPFC. In
   the IPL and PCu, the functional connectivity of siblings was
   intermediate to that of controls and patients. No significant
   associations were found between DMN connectivity and (subclinical)
   psychotic/cognitive symptoms. In addition, there were no significant
   interactions between group and environmental exposures in the model of
   PCC functional connectivity.
   Discussion
   Increased functional connectivity in individuals with (increased risk
   for) psychotic disorder may reflect trait-related network alterations.
   The within-network ``connectivity at rest{''} intermediate phenotype was
   not associated with (subclinical) psychotic or cognitive symptoms. The
   association between familial risk and DMN connectivity was not
   conditional on environmental exposure.}},

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for social
   anxiety disorder (SAD), but many patients do not respond sufficiently
   and a substantial proportion relapse after treatment has ended.
   Predicting an individual's long-term clinical response therefore remains
   an important challenge. This study aimed at assessing neural predictors
   of long-term treatment outcome in participants with SAD 1 year after
   completion of Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT). Twenty-six participants
   diagnosed with SAD underwent iCBT including attention bias modification
   for a total of 13 weeks. Support vector machines (SVMs), a supervised
   pattern recognition method allowing predictions at the individual level,
   were trained to separate long-term treatment responders from
   nonresponders based on blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to
   self-referential criticism. The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement
   scale was the main instrument to determine treatment response at the
   1-year follow-up. Results showed that the proportion of long-term
   responders was 52\% (12/23). From multivariate BOLD responses in the
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) together with the amygdala, we
   were able to predict long-term response rate of iCBT with an accuracy of
   92\% (confidence interval 95\% 73.2-97.6). This activation pattern was,
   however, not predictive of improvement in the continuous Liebowitz
   Social Anxiety Scale-Self-report version. Follow-up psychophysiological
   interaction analyses revealed that lower dACC-amygdala coupling was
   associated with better long-term treatment response. Thus, BOLD response
   patterns in the fear-expressing dACC-amygdala regions were highly
   predictive of long-term treatment outcome of iCBT, and the initial
   coupling between these regions differentiated long-term responders from
   nonresponders. The SVM-neuroimaging approach could be of particular
   clinical value as it allows for accurate prediction of treatment outcome
   at the level of the individual.}},

Title = {{Similarity hypothesis: understanding of others with autism spectrum

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are generally thought
   to lack empathy. However, according to recent empirical and
   self-advocacy studies, individuals with ASD identify with others with
   ASD. Based on mutual understanding, individuals with ASD respond
   empathically to others with these disorders. Results have shown that
   typically developing (TD) adults identify with TD fictional characters,
   and that such identification plays a critical role in social cognition.
   TD individuals retrieve episodes involving TD individuals faster than
   they retrieve episodes involving ASD individuals. Individuals with ASD
   also show a ``similarity effect{''} whereby they retrieve stories
   involving ASD individuals more effectively when the stories have
   consistent outcomes than when they have inconsistent outcomes. In this
   context, I hypothesized that similarities between a perceiver and a
   target facilitate cognitive processing. This hypothesis was named the
   ``similarity hypothesis{''}. Perceivers empathize with targets similar
   to themselves, which facilitates subsequent cognitive processing.
   Behavioral and neuroimaging studies are reviewed based on the similarity
   hypothesis.}},

Title = {{Plasma oxytocin explains individual differences in neural substrates of
   social perception}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin plays a critical role in social cognition and
   behavior. A number of studies using intranasal administration have
   demonstrated that oxytocin improves social perception. However, little
   is known about the relationship between individual differences in
   endogenous levels of oxytocin and social cognition. In the current
   study, we assessed the relationship between endogenous oxytocin and
   brain activity during an animacy perception paradigm. Thirty-seven male
   participants underwent scanning and provided a blood sample for oxytocin
   analysis. In line with previous research, perception of animacy was
   associated with activations in superior temporal sulcus, inferior
   frontal gyrus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Notably,
   participants' levels of plasma oxytocin robustly predicted activation in
   areas critical for social cognitive processes, such that higher oxytocin
   levels were related to increased activity in dorsal mPFC, ventral mPFC,
   dorsolateral PFC, superior temporal gyrus, and temporoparietal junction
   (TPJ), suggesting differential processing of social stimuli. Together
   these results show that stable variations in endogenous oxytocin levels
   explain individual differences in social perception.}},

Abstract = {{In humans, the neuropeptide oxytocin plays a critical role in social and
   emotional behavior. The actions of this molecule are dependent on a
   protein that acts as its receptor, which is encoded by the oxytocin
   receptor gene (OXTR). DNA methylation of OXTR, an epigenetic
   modification, directly influences gene transcription and is variable in
   humans. However, the impact of this variability on specific social
   behaviors is unknown. We hypothesized that variability in OXTR
   methylation impacts social perceptual processes often linked with
   oxytocin, such as perception of facial emotions. Using an imaging
   epigenetic approach, we established a relationship between OXTR
   methylation and neural activity in response to emotional face
   processing. Specifically, high levels of OXTR methylation were
   associated with greater amounts of activity in regions associated with
   face and emotion processing including amygdala, fusiform, and insula.
   Importantly, we found that these higher levels of OXTR methylation were
   also associated with decreased functional coupling of amygdala with
   regions involved in affect appraisal and emotion regulation. These data
   indicate that the human endogenous oxytocin system is involved in
   attenuation of the fear response, corroborating research implicating
   intranasal oxytocin in the same processes. Our findings highlight the
   importance of including epigenetic mechanisms in the description of the
   endogenous oxytocin system and further support a central role for
   oxytocin in social cognition. This approach linking epigenetic
   variability with neural endophenotypes may broadly explain individual
   differences in phenotype including susceptibility or resilience to
   disease.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{780-785}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{Formal computational models of human memory posit a central role of
   feature representations in episodic memory encoding and retrieval
   {[}1-4]. Correspondingly, fMRI studies have found that, in addition to
   activity level {[}5, 6], the neural activation pattern similarity across
   repetitions (i.e., self-similarity) was greater for subsequently
   remembered than forgotten items {[}7-9]. This self-similarity has been
   suggested to reflect pattern reinstatement due to study-phase retrieval
   {[}7, 10, 11]. However, the low temporal resolution of fMRI measures
   could determine neither the temporal precision of study-phase
   reinstatement nor the processing stage at which the reinstatement
   supported subsequent memory {[}12]. Meanwhile, although self-similarity
   has been shown to correlate with the activity level in the left lateral
   prefrontal cortex (LPFC) {[}10, 13], a causal link between left LPFC
   function and pattern similarity remains to be established. Combining
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and EEG, we found that
   greater spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS) across repetitions of
   the same item (i.e., self-STPS) during encoding predicted better
   subsequent memory. The self-STPS located in the right frontal electrodes
   occurred approximately 500 ms after stimulus onset, reflected
   item-specific encoding, and contributed to memory above and beyond the
   effects of ERP amplitude and global pattern similarity (i.e., similarity
   to all other items in memory space). Anodal stimulation over the left
   LPFC specifically enhanced memory performance and item-specific STPS in
   the right frontal electrodes. These results support a causal role of
   LPFC in enhancing STPS and memory and contribute to a mechanistic
   understanding of memory formation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent studies on resting state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) have found an abnormal temporal correlation
   between low frequency oscillations (LFO) in social anxiety disorder
   (SAD). However, alterations in the amplitudes of these LFO remain
   unclear.
   Methods: This study included 20 SAD patients and 20 age-, gender-, and
   education matched healthy controls. Resting state fMRI data were
   acquired using a gradient echo echo planar imaging sequence, and the
   amplitudes of LFO were investigated using the amplitude of low frequency
   fluctuation (ALFF) approach. Two frequency bands (slow-5. 0.01-0.027 Hz;
   slow-4. 0.027-0.073 Hz) were analyzed.
   Results: Significant differences in ALFF were observed between the two
   bands in widespread regions including the poslceraral gyros, preceraral
   gyros, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), orbilofrontal cortex,
   hippocampus, thalamus, caudate, pill:amen, and insula. Compared with the
   healthy controls, the SAD patients showed lower ALFF. in the
   dorsolaleral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), MPFC, superior temporal gyrus,
   and insula but higher ALFF in the middle occipital gyrus. Furthermore,
   we found that the SAD patients had reduced ALFF in the MPFC in the
   slow-5 band.
   Limitation: The small sample size may decrease the statistical power of
   the results.
   Conclusions: SAD patients had frequency-dependent alteration in
   intrinsic brain activity. This finding may provide insights into the
   understanding of the pathophysiology of SAD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The ability to empathize with other people is a critical component of
   human social relationships. Empathic processing varies across the human
   population, however it is currently unclear how personality traits are
   associated with empathic processing. This study was designed to test the
   hypothesis that specific personality traits are associated with
   behavioral and biological indicators of improved empathy. Extraversion
   and Agreeableness are personality traits designed to measure individual
   differences in social-cognitive functioning, however each
   trait-dimension includes elements that represent interpersonal social
   functioning and elements that do not represent interpersonal social
   functioning. We tested the prediction that interpersonal elements of
   Extraversion (Warmth) and Agreeableness (Altruism) are associated with
   empathy and non-interpersonal elements of Extraversion and Agreeableness
   are not associated with empathy. We quantified empathic processing
   behaviorally (empathic accuracy task using video vignettes) and within
   the brain (fMRI and an emotional perspective taking task) in 50 healthy
   subjects. Converging evidence shows that highly warm and altruistic
   people are well skilled in recognizing the emotional states of other
   people and exhibit greater activity in brain regions important for
   empathy (temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex) during
   emotional perspective taking. A mediation analysis further supported the
   association between warm-altruistic personality and empathic processing;
   indicating that one reason why highly warm-altruistic individuals may be
   skilled empathizers is that they engage the temporoparietal junction and
   medial prefrontal cortex more. Together, these findings advance the way
   the behavioral and neural basis of empathy is understood and
   demonstrates the efficacy of personality scales to measure individual
   differences in interpersonal social function.}},

   variety of views unless faces are presented upside-down. Whether this
   face inversion effect (FIE) results from qualitative (distinct
   mechanisms) or quantitative processing differences (a matter of degree
   within common mechanisms) between upright and inverted faces has been
   intensely debated. Studies have focused on preferential responses to
   faces in face-specific brain areas, although face recognition also
   involves nonpreferential responses in non-face-specific brain areas. By
   using dynamic causal modeling with Bayesian model selection, here we
   show that dissociable cortical pathways are responsible for qualitative
   and quantitative mechanisms in the FIE in the distributed network for
   face recognition. When faces were upright, the early visual cortex (VC)
   and occipital and fusiform face areas (OFA, FFA) suppressed couplings to
   the lateral occipital cortex (LO), a primary locus of object processing.
   In contrast, they did not inhibit the LO when faces were inverted but
   increased couplings to the intraparietal sulcus, which has been
   associated with visual working memory. Furthermore, we found that
   upright and inverted face processing together involved the face network
   consisting of the VC, OFA, FFA, and inferior frontal gyrus.
   Specifically, modulatory connectivity within the common pathways
   (VC-OFA), implicated in the parts-based processing of faces, strongly
   correlated with behavioral FIE performance. The orientation-dependent
   dynamic reorganization of effective connectivity indicates that the FIE
   is mediated by both qualitative and quantitative differences in upright
   and inverted face processing, helping to resolve a central debate over
   the mechanisms of the FIE.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous research has shown that emotion can significantly
   impact decision-making in humans. The current study examined whether or
   not and how situationally induced emotion influences people to make
   inter-temporal choices.
   Methods: Affective pictures were used as experiment stimuli to provoke
   emotion, immediately followed by subjects' performance of a
   delay-discounting task to measure impulsivity during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging.
   Results: Results demonstrate a subsequent process of increased impulsive
   decision-making following a prior exposure to both high positive and
   negative arousal stimuli, compared to the experiment subjects'
   experiences with neutral stimuli. Findings indicate that increased
   impulsive decision-making behaviors can occur with high arousal and can
   be characterized by decreased activities in the cognitive control
   regions such as prefronto-parietal regions.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that `stabilization of high emotional
   arousal' may facilitate a reduction of impulsive decision-making and
   implementation of longer term goals.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) comprise a heterogeneous set of
   neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by dramatic impairments of
   interpersonal behavior, communication, and empathy. Recent neuroimaging
   studies suggested that ASD are disorders characterized by widespread
   abnormalities involving distributed brain network, though clear evidence
   of differences in large-scale brain network interactions underlying the
   cognitive and behavioral symptoms of ASD are still lacking. Consistent
   findings of anterior insula cortex hypoactivation and dysconnectivity
   during tasks related to emotional and social processing indicates its
   dysfunctional role in ASD. In parallel, increasing evidence showed that
   successful control of anterior insula activity can be attained using
   real-time fMRI paradigms. More importantly, successful regulation of
   this region was associated with changes in behavior and brain
   connectivity in both healthy individuals and psychiatric patients.
   Building on these results we here propose and discuss the use of
   real-time fMRI neurofeedback in ASD aiming at improving emotional and

Title = {{Neural correlates of decision making after unfair treatment}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Empirical evidence indicates that people are inequity averse. However,
   it is unclear whether and how suffering unfairness impacts subsequent
   behavior. We investigated the consequences of unfair treatment in
   subsequent interactions with new interaction partners and the associated
   neural mechanisms. Participants were experimentally manipulated to
   experience fair or unfair treatment in the ultimatum game (UG), and
   subsequently, they were given the opportunity to retaliate in the
   dictator game (DG) in their interactions with players who had not played
   a role in the previous fair or unfair treatment. The results showed that
   participants dictated less money to unrelated partners after frequently
   receiving unfair offers in the previous UG (vs. frequently receiving
   fair offers in the previous UG), but only when they were first exposed
   to unfair UG/DG. Stronger activation in the right dorsal anterior insula
   was found during receiving unfair offers and during the subsequent
   offer-considering phase. The regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of
   the local synchronization of neighboring voxels in resting-state brain
   activity, in the left ventral anterior insula and left superior temporal
   pole was positively correlated with the behavior change. These findings
   suggest that unfair treatment may encourage a spread of unfairness, and
   that the anterior insula may be not only engaged in signaling social
   norm violations, but also recruited in guiding subsequent adaptive
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{While there is accumulating evidence for the existence of distinct
   neural systems supporting goal-directed and habitual action selection in
   the mammalian brain, much less is known about the nature of the
   information being processed in these different brain regions.
   Associative learning theory predicts that brain systems involved in
   habitual control, such as the dorsolateral striatum, should contain
   stimulus and response information only, but not outcome information,
   while regions involved in goal-directed action, such as ventromedial and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial striatum, should be
   involved in processing information about outcomes as well as stimuli and
   responses. To test this prediction, human participants underwent fMRI
   while engaging in a binary choice task designed to enable the separate
   identification of these different representations with a multivariate
   classification analysis approach. Consistent with our predictions, the
   dorsolateral striatum contained information about responses but not
   outcomes at the time of an initial stimulus, while the regions
   implicated in goal-directed action selection contained information about
   both responses and outcomes. These findings suggest that differential
   contributions of these regions to habitual and goal-directed behavioral
   control may depend in part on basic differences in the type of
   information that these regions have access to at the time of decision
   making.}},

Abstract = {{The prefrontal cortex houses representations critical for ongoing and
   future behavior expressed in the form of patterns of neural activity.
   Dopamine has long been suggested to play a key role in the integrity of
   such representations, with D2-receptor activation rendering them
   flexible but weak. However, it is currently unknown whether and how
   D2-receptor activation affects prefrontal representations in humans. In
   the current study, we use dopamine receptor-specific pharmacology and
   multivoxel pattern-based functional magnetic resonance imaging to test
   the hypothesis that blocking D2-receptor activation enhances prefrontal
   representations. Human subjects performed a simple reward prediction
   task after double-blind and placebo controlled administration of the
   D2-receptor antagonist amisulpride. Using a whole-brain searchlight
   decoding approach we show that D2-receptor blockade enhances decoding of
   reward signals in the medial orbitofrontal cortex. Examination of
   activity patterns suggests that amisulpride increases the separation of
   activity patterns related to reward versus no reward. Moreover,
   consistent with the cortical distribution of D2 receptors, post hoc
   analyses showed enhanced decoding of motor signals in motor cortex, but
   not of visual signals in visual cortex. These results suggest that
   D2-receptor blockade enhances content-specific representations in
   frontal cortex, presumably by a dopamine-mediated increase in pattern
   separation. These findings are in line with a dual-state model of
   prefrontal dopamine, and provide new insights into the potential
   mechanism of action of dopaminergic drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Decision-making in social dilemmas is suggested to rely on three
   factors: the valuation of a choice option, the relative judgment of two
   or more choice alternatives, and individual factors affecting the ease
   at which judgments and decisions are made. Here, we test whether
   empathy-an individual's relative ability to understand others' thoughts,
   emotions, and intentions-acts as an individual factor that alleviates
   conflict resolution in social decision-making. We test this by using a
   framed, iterated prisoners' dilemma (PD) game in two settings. In a
   behavioral experiment, we find that individual differences in empathic
   ability (the Empathy Quotient, EQ) were related to lower response times
   in the PD game, suggesting that empathy is related to faster social
   choices, independent of whether they choose to cooperate or defect. In a
   subsequent neuroimaging experiment, using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we find that EQ is positively related to individual differences
   in the engagement of brain structures implemented in mentalizing,
   including the precuneus, superior temporal sulcus, and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that empathy is related to the
   individual difference in the engagement of mentalizing in social
   dilemmas and that this is related to the efficiency of decision-making
   in social dilemmas.}},

Abstract = {{Processes through which parental ideology is transmitted to
   children-especially at a young age prior to the formation of political
   beliefs-remain poorly understood. Given recent evidence that political
   ideology is associated with neural responses to cognitive conflict in
   adults, we tested the exploratory hypothesis that children's
   neurocognitive responses to conflict may also differ depending on their
   parents' ideology. We assessed relations between parental political
   ideology and children's neurocognitive responses to conflict, as
   measured by the N2 component of the event-related potential. Children
   aged 5-7 completed an age-appropriate flanker task while
   electroencephalography was recorded, and the N2 was scored to
   incongruent versus congruent flankers to index conflict processing.
   Because previous research documents heightened liberal-conservative
   differences in threat-relevant contexts, each trial of the task was
   preceded by an angry face (threat-relevant) or comparison face (happy or
   neutral). An effect of parental ideology on the conflict-related N2
   emerged in the threat condition, such that the N2 was larger among
   children of liberals compared with children of moderates and
   conservatives. These findings suggest that individual differences in
   neurocognitive responses to conflict, heightened in the context of
   threat, may reflect a more general pattern of individual differences
   that, in adults, relates to political ideology.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathology is worthy of consideration to inform the application of
   functional neuroimaging to the study of mental disorders. By promoting
   an approach based on mental processes underlying disorders rather than
   an approached based on diagnostic categories, it offers the opportunity
   to identify biomarkers that could be used as nosological tools. Such
   biomarkers may eventually inform treatment strategies. However, the
   question of whether functional brain imaging can be used to learn
   something about psychopathology, that is understanding the nature and
   the relationships of mental processes that underlie psychiatric
   disorders, remains controversial. A potential advantage of functional
   brain imaging could be the examination of non-conscious mental processes
   that could be both non reportable by the subject and difficult to
   capture with behavioral measures. As an example, several studies found
   depression and anxiety to be associated with amygdala aberrant
   reactivity to masked emotional stimuliThis might be interpreted as
   signaling automatic cognitive biases such as those proposed by cognitive
   theory. But when trying to deduce the presence of a mental process M
   from a specific pattern of brain activity A, frequently referred to as
   reverse inference, one has to consider several issues, regardless of the
   nature of the mental process. These issues can be best formalized with a
   Bayesian approach where the probability of the presence of M according
   to A, P(M/A) depends on the a priori probability of M to be present,
   P(M), as well as on conditional probabilities P(RIM) and P(P(R/(M) over
   bar). Obviously, P(M) depends on the specificity of the experimental
   paradigm used. However, reverse inference usually takes place when A was
   unexpected (i.e. not supposed to be engaged by the experimental task).
   Conditional probabilities regarding the probability of A according to
   the presence or the absence of M, P(AIM) and p(A/(M) over bar) can be
   estimated using methods of data mining based on growing databases. The
   less A is specific to M, that is to say the higher p(A/(M) over bar) is,
   the less valid the reverse inference will be. This is even worse when
   the definition of R is loose. Despite these limitations, reverse
   inference is nevertheless a powerful heuristic tool when it comes to
   generate testable hypotheses about the nature of mental processes and
   their relationships. Combined with carefully designed experimental
   paradigms, functional brain imaging is thus likely to bring new
   knowledge to psychopathology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Although oxytocin is one of the most widely studied
   neuropeptides in recent times, the mechanistic process by which it
   modulates social-affective behavior in the brain is not yet clearly
   understood. Thus, to understand the neurophysiological basis of oxytocin
   effects, we used resting-state functional MRI to examine the effects of
   intranasal oxytocin on brain connectivity in healthy males.
   Methods: Using a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
   crossover design, 15 healthy male volunteers received 24 IU intranasal
   oxytocin or placebo prior to resting-state functional MRI acquisition at
   3T.
   Results: We found that oxytocin significantly reduced the degree
   centrality of the right precuneus (P<.05). Oxytocin also reduced
   connectivity between the bilateral amygdalae and between the right
   precuneus and the right and left amygdala (P<.05). Although there were
   no significant changes in regional homogeneity at the whole brain level,
   posthoc results showed a reduction involving the right precuneus
   (P<.05).
   Conclusions: These results show that oxytocin affects one of the key
   centers in the brain for social cognition and introspective processing,
   the precuneus, and enhances our understanding of how oxytocin can
   modulate brain networks at rest. An improved understanding of the
   neurophysiological effects of oxytocin can be important in terms of
   evaluating the mechanisms that are likely to underlie the clinical
   responses observed upon long-term oxytocin administration.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical treatment of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) patients
   involves the removal either of the left or the right hippocampus. Since
   the mesial temporal lobe is responsible for emotion recognition
   abilities, we aimed to assess facial emotion recognition (FER) in two
   homogeneous patient cohorts that differed only in the administered
   surgery design since anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) or selective
   amygdalohippocampectomy (SAH) were performed independently of the
   underlying electroclinical conditions.
   The patient selection for the two respective surgical procedures was
   carried out retrospectively between 2000 and 2009 by two independent
   epilepsy centres, the Kork Epilepsy Centre, Germany and the University
   Hospital of Strasbourg, France. All included patients had presented with
   unilateral hippocampus sclerosis (HS) without associated dysplasia or
   white matter blurring and had become seizure-free postoperatively.
   Psychometric evaluation was carried out with the Ekman 60 Faces Test and
   screened for depression and psychosomatic symptoms with the SCL-90 R and
   the BDI. Thirty healthy volunteers participated as control subjects.
   Sixty patients were included, 27 had undergone SAN and 33 ATL. Patients
   and controls obtained comparable scores in FER for surprise, happiness,
   anger and sadness. Concerning fear and disgust the patient group scored
   significantly worse. Left-sided operations led to the the most
   pronounced impairment. The ATL group scored significantly worse for
   recognition of fear compared with SAH patients. Inversely, after SAH
   scores for disgust were significantly lower than after ATL,
   independently of the side of resection. Unilateral temporal damage
   impairs FER. Different neurosurgical procedures may affect FER
   differently. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Much remains unknown regarding the relationship between anxiety, worry,
   sustained attention, and frontal function. Here, we addressed this using
   a sustained attention task adapted for functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Participants responded to presentation of simple stimuli,
   withholding responses to an infrequent ``No Go{''} stimulus.
   Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity to ``Go{''} trials, and
   dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) activity to ``No Go{''} trials were
   associated with faster error-free performance; consistent with DLPFC and
   dACC facilitating proactive and reactive control, respectively. Trait
   anxiety was linked to reduced recruitment of these regions, slower
   error-free performance, and decreased frontal-thalamo-striatal
   connectivity. This indicates an association between trait anxiety and
   impoverished frontal control of attention, even when external
   distractors are absent. In task blocks where commission errors were
   made, greater DLPFC-precuneus and DLPFC-posterior cingulate connectivity
   were associated with both trait anxiety and worry, indicative of
   increased off-task thought. Notably, unlike trait anxiety, worry was not
   linked to reduced frontal-striatal-thalamo connectivity, impoverished
   frontal recruitment, or slowed responding during blocks without
   commission errors, contrary to accounts proposing a direct causal link
   between worry and impoverished attentional control. This leads us to
   propose a new model of the relationship between anxiety, worry and
   frontal engagement in attentional control versus off-task thought.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Individuals with schizophrenia and people with depression both show
   abnormal behavioural and neural responses when perceiving and responding
   to emotional stimuli, but pathology-specific differences and
   commonalities remain mostly unclear.
   Aims
   To directly compare empathic responses to dynamic multimodal emotional
   stimuli in a group with schizophrenia and a group with depression, and
   to investigate their neural correlates using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Method
   The schizophrenia group (n=20), the depression group (n=24) and a
   control group (n=24) were presented with portrait-shot video clips
   expressing emotion through three possible communication channels: facial
   expression, prosody and content. Participants rated their own and the
   actor's emotional state as an index of empathy.
   Results
   Although no group differences were found in empathy ratings,
   characteristic differences emerged in the fMRI activation patterns. The
   schizophrenia group demonstrated aberrant activation patterns during the
   neutral speech content condition in regions implicated in multimodal
   integration and formation of semantic constructs. Those in the
   depression group were most affected during conditions with trimodal
   emotional and trimodal neutral stimuli, in key regions of the
   mentalising network.
   Conclusions
   Our findings reveal characteristic differences in patients with
   schizophrenia compared with those with depression in their cortical
   responses to dynamic affective stimuli. These differences indicate that
   impairments in responding to emotional stimuli may be caused by
   pathology-specific problems in social cognition.}},

Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{8-19}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Although several studies have shown that language exposure crucially
   influence the cerebral representation of bilinguals, the effects of
   short-term change of language exposure in daily life upon language
   control areas in bilinguals are less known. To explore this issue, we
   employed follow-up fMRI to investigate whether differential exposure
   induces neuroplastic changes in the language control network in
   high-proficient Cantonese (L1)-Mandarin (L2) early bilinguals. The same
   10 subjects underwent twice BOLD-fMRI scans while performing a silent
   narration task which corresponded to two different language exposure
   conditions, CON-1 (L1/L2 usage percentage, 50\%:50\%) and CON-2 (L1/L2
   usage percentage, 90\%:10\%). We report a strong effect of language
   exposure in areas related to language control for the less exposed
   language. Interestingly, these significant effects were present after
   only a 30-day period of differential language exposure. In detail, we
   reached the following results: (1) the interaction effect of language
   and language exposure condition was found significantly in the left pars
   opercularis (BA 44) and marginally in the left MFG (BA 9); (2) in CON-2,
   increases of activation values in L2 were found significantly in
   bilateral BA 46 and BA 9, in the left BA44, and marginally in the left
   caudate; and (3) in CON-2, we found a significant negative correlation
   between language exposure to L2 and the BOLD activation value
   specifically in the left ACC. These findings strongly support the
   hypothesis that even short periods of differential exposure to a given
   language may induce significant neuroplastic changes in areas
   responsible for language control. The language which a bilingual is less
   exposed to and is also less used will be in need of increased mental
   control as shown by the increased activity of language control areas.

Journal = {{CORTEX}},

Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{310-317}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Brain stimulation studies have previously demonstrated a causal link
   between general pitch memory processes and activity within the left
   supramarginal gyms (SMG). Building on this evidence, the present study
   tested the impact of left SMG stimulation on two distinct pitch memory
   phases, retention and encoding. Repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (rTMS) was employed during the retention stage (Experiment
   1) and the encoding phase (Experiment 2) of a pitch recognition task.
   Stimulation was applied on a trial-by-trial basis over the left SMG
   (target site) or the vertex (control site). A block without TMS was also
   completed. In Experiment 1, rTMS over the left SMG during pitch
   retention led to significantly increased reaction times compared to
   control conditions. In Experiment 2 no rTMS modulation effects were
   found during encoding. Experiment 3 was conducted as a control for
   non-specific stimulation effects; no effects were found when rTMS was
   applied over the left SMG at the two different time points during a
   perceptual task. Taken together, these findings highlight a
   phase-specific involvement of the left SMG in the retention phase of
   pitch memory, thereby indicating that the left SMG is involved in the
   maintenance of pitch information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{CORTEX}},

Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{380-393}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Alien control phenomena are symptoms reported by patients with
   schizophrenia whereby feelings of control and ownership of thoughts and
   movements are lost. Comparable alien control experiences occur in
   culturally influenced dissociative states. We used fMRI and suggestions
   for automatic writing in highly hypnotically suggestible individuals to
   investigate the neural underpinnings of alien control. Targeted
   suggestions selectively reduced subjective ratings of control and
   ownership for both thought and movement. Thought insertion (TI) was
   associated with reduced activation of networks supporting language,
   movement, and self-related processing. In contrast, alien control of
   writing movement was associated with increased activity of a
   left-lateralised cerebellar-parietal network and decreased activity in
   brain regions involved in voluntary movement, including sensory-motor
   hand areas and the thalamus. Both experiences involved a reduction in
   activity of left supplementary motor area (SMA) and were associated with
   altered functional connectivity (FC) between SMA and brain regions
   involved in language processing and movement implementation.
   Collectively these results indicate the SMA plays a central role in
   alien control phenomena as a high level executive system involved in the
   sense that we control and own our thoughts and movements. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) has been associated with
   reduced amygdala responsiveness to fearful faces. However, the effect of
   unilateral MTLE on empathy-related brain responses in extra-amygdalar
   regions has not been investigated. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we measured empathy-related brain responses to dynamic fearful
   faces in 34 patients with unilateral MTLE (18 right sided), in an
   epilepsy (extra-MTLE; n = 16) and in a healthy control group (n = 30).
   The primary finding was that right MTLE (RMTLE) was associated with
   decreased activity predominantly in the right amygdala and also in
   bilateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) but normal activity in the right
   anterior insula. The results of the extra-MTLE group demonstrate that
   these reduced amygdala and PAG responses go beyond the attenuation
   caused by antiepileptic and antidepressant medication. These findings
   clearly indicate that RMTLE affects the function of mesial temporal and
   midbrain structures that mediate basic interoceptive input necessary for
   the emotional awareness of empathic experiences of fear. Together with
   the decreased empathic concern found in the RMTLE group, this study
   provides neurobehavioral evidence that patients with RMTLE are at
   increased risk for reduced empathy towards others' internal states and
   sheds new light on the nature of social-cognitive impairments frequently
   accompanying MTLE.}},

Abstract = {{A heightened sense of self-esteem is associated with a reduced risk for
   several types of affective and psychiatric disorders, including
   depression, anxiety and eating disorders. However, little is known about
   how brain systems integrate self-referential processing and positive
   evaluation to give rise to these feelings. To address this, we combined
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to test how frontostriatal connectivity reflects long-term trait
   and short-term state aspects of self-esteem. Using DTI, we found
   individual variability in white matter structural integrity between the
   medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum was related to trait
   measures of self-esteem, reflecting long-term stability of self-esteem
   maintenance. Using fMRI, we found that functional connectivity of these
   regions during positive self-evaluation was related to current feelings
   of self-esteem, reflecting short-term state self-esteem. These results
   provide convergent anatomical and functional evidence that self-esteem
   is related to the connectivity of frontostriatal circuits and suggest
   that feelings of self-worth may emerge from neural systems integrating
   information about the self with positive affect and reward. This
   information could potentially inform the etiology of diminished
   self-esteem underlying multiple psychiatric conditions and inform future
   studies of evaluative self-referential processing.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescents' peer culture plays a key role in the development and
   maintenance of risk-taking behavior. Despite recent advances in
   developmental neuroscience suggesting that peers may increase neural
   sensitivity to rewards, we know relatively little about how the quality
   of peer relations impact adolescent risk taking. In the current 2-year
   three-wave longitudinal study, we examined how chronic levels of peer
   conflict relate to risk taking behaviorally and neurally, and whether
   this is modified by high-quality peer relationships. Forty-six
   adolescents completed daily diaries assessing peer conflict across 2
   years as well as a measure of peer support. During a functional brain
   scan, adolescents completed a risk-taking task. Behaviorally, peer
   conflict was associated with greater risk-taking behavior, especially
   for adolescents reporting low peer support. High levels of peer support
   buffered this association. At the neural level, peer conflict was
   associated with greater activation in the striatum and insula,
   especially among adolescents reporting low peer support, whereas this
   association was buffered for adolescents reporting high peer support.
   Results are consistent with the stress-buffering model of social
   relationships and underscore the importance of the quality of
   adolescents' peer relationships for their risk taking.}},

Abstract = {{Intrinsic emotional expressions such as those communicated by faces and
   vocalizations have been shown to engage specific brain regions, such as
   the amygdala. Although music constitutes another powerful means to
   express emotions, the neural substrates involved in its processing
   remain poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown whether brain
   regions typically associated with processing `biologically relevant'
   emotional expressions are also recruited by emotional music. To address
   this question, we conducted an event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study in 47 healthy volunteers in which we directly
   compared responses to basic emotions (fear, sadness and happiness, as
   well as neutral) expressed through faces, non-linguistic vocalizations
   and short novel musical excerpts. Our results confirmed the importance
   of fear in emotional communication, as revealed by significant blood
   oxygen level-dependent signal increased in a cluster within the
   posterior amygdala and anterior hippocampus, as well as in the posterior
   insula across all three domains. Moreover, subject-specific amygdala
   responses to fearful music and vocalizations were correlated, consistent
   with the proposal that the brain circuitry involved in the processing of
   musical emotions might be shared with the one that have evolved for
   vocalizations. Overall, our results show that processing of fear
   expressed through music, engages some of the same brain areas known to
   be crucial for detecting and evaluating threat-related information.}},

Abstract = {{Stressful life events increase vulnerability to problematic alcohol use,
   and they may do this by disrupting reward-related neural circuitry. This
   is particularly relevant for adolescents because alcohol use rises
   sharply after mid-adolescence and alcohol abuse peaks at age 20.
   Adolescents also report more stressors compared with children, and
   neural reward circuitry may be especially vulnerable to stressors during
   adolescence because of prefrontal cortex remodeling. Using a large
   sample of male participants in a longitudinal functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study (N = 157), we evaluated whether cumulative
   stressful life events between the ages of 15 and 18 were associated with
   reward-related brain function and problematic alcohol use at age 20
   years. Higher cumulative stressful life events during adolescence were
   associated with decreased response in the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) during monetary reward anticipation and following the receipt of
   monetary rewards. Stress-related decreases in mPFC response during
   reward anticipation and following rewarding outcomes were associated
   with the severity of alcohol dependence. Furthermore, mPFC response
   mediated the association between stressful life events and later
   symptoms of alcohol dependence. These data are consistent with
   neurobiological models of addiction that propose that stressors during
   adolescence increase risk for problematic alcohol use by disrupting
   reward circuit function.}},

Abstract = {{Talking about emotion and sharing emotional experiences is a key
   component of human interaction. Specifically, individuals often consider
   the reactions of other people when evaluating the meaning and impact of
   an emotional stimulus. It has not yet been investigated, however, how
   emotional arousal ratings and physiological responses elicited by
   affective stimuli are influenced by the rating of an interaction
   partner. In the present study, pairs of participants were asked to rate
   and communicate the degree of their emotional arousal while viewing
   affective pictures. Strikingly, participants adjusted their arousal
   ratings to match up with their interaction partner. In anticipation of
   the affective picture, the interaction partner's arousal ratings
   correlated positively with activity in anterior insula and prefrontal
   cortex. During picture presentation, social influence was reflected in
   the ventral striatum, that is, activity in the ventral striatum
   correlated negatively with the interaction partner's ratings. Results of
   the study show that emotional alignment through the influence of another
   person's communicated experience has to be considered as a complex
   phenomenon integrating different components including emotion
   anticipation and conformity.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggested that the emotional connotation of single
   words automatically recruits attention. We investigated the potential of
   words to induce emotional engagement when reading texts. In an fMRI
   experiment, we presented 120 text passages from the Harry Potter book
   series. Results showed significant correlations between affective word
   (lexical) ratings and passage ratings. Furthermore, affective lexical
   ratings correlated with activity in regions associated with emotion,
   situation model building, multi-modal semantic integration, and Theory
   of Mind. We distinguished differential influences of affective lexical,
   inter-lexical, and supra-lexical variables: differential effects of
   lexical valence were significant in the left amygdala, while effects of
   arousal-span (the dynamic range of arousal across a passage) were
   significant in the left amygdala and insula. However, we found no
   differential effect of passage ratings in emotion-associated regions.
   Our results support the hypothesis that the emotion potential of short
   texts can be predicted by lexical and inter-lexical affective variables.

Abstract = {{We investigated the mechanisms by which Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT)
   improves social communication in a case series of 10 preschool-aged
   children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) identified brain responses during a biological
   motion perception task conducted prior to and following 16 weeks of PRT
   treatment. Overall, the neural systems supporting social perception in
   these 10 children were malleable through implementation of PRT;
   following treatment, neural responses were more similar to those of
   typically developing children (TD). However, at baseline, half of the
   children exhibited hypoactivation, relative to a group of TD children,
   in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), and half
   exhibited hyperactivation in this region. Strikingly, the groups
   exhibited differential neural responses to treatment: The five children
   who exhibited hypoactivation at baseline evidenced increased activation
   in components of the reward system including the ventral striatum and
   putamen. The five children who exhibited hyperactivation at baseline
   evidenced decreased activation in subcortical regions critical for
   regulating the flow of stimulation and conveying signals of salience to
   the cortex-the thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. Our results support
   further investigation into the differential effects of particular
   treatment strategies relative to specific neural targets. Identification
   of treatment strategies that address the patterns of neural
   vulnerability unique to each patient is consistent with the priority of
   creating individually tailored interventions customized to the
   behavioral and neural characteristics of a given person.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundPedophilia is a disorder recognized for its impairment to the
   individual and for the harm it may cause to others. However, the
   neurobiology of pedophilia and a possible propensity to sexually abuse
   children are not well understood. In this study, we thus aimed at
   providing new insights in how functional integration of brain regions
   may relate to pedophilia or child sexual abuse (CSA).
   MethodBy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique,
   we compared functional connectivity at rest (RSFC) between pedophiles
   who engaged (P+CSA; N=12) or did not engage (P-CSA; N=14) in CSA and
   healthy controls (HCs; N=14) within two networks: (i) the default mode
   network and (ii) the limbic network that has been linked to pedophilia
   before.
   ResultsPedophiles who engaged in CSA show diminished RSFC in both
   networks compared with HC and P-CSA. Most importantly, they showed
   diminished RSFC between the left amygdala and orbitofrontal as well as
   anterior prefrontal regions. Though significant age differences between
   groups could not be avoided, correlation control analysis did not
   provide evidence for the assumption that the RSFC effects were related
   to age differences.
   ConclusionWe found significantly diminished RSFC in brain networks
   critically involved in widespread motivational and socio-emotional
   processes. These results extend existing models of the functional
   neuroanatomy of pedophilia and CSA as altered RSFC between these regions
   were related to CSA rather than pedophilia and thus may account for an
   increased propensity to engage in CSA in people suffering from
   pedophilia. Kargel C, Massau C, Wei ss S, Walter M, Kruger THC, and

Volume = {{34}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Alcoholism is associated with abnormal anger processing. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate brain regions involved in the
   evaluation of angry facial expressions in patients with alcohol
   dependency.
   Methods: Brain blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) responses to
   angry faces were measured and compared between patients with alcohol
   dependency and controls.
   Results: During intensity ratings of angry faces, significant
   differences in BOLD were observed between patients with alcohol
   dependency and controls. That is, patients who were alcohol-dependent
   showed significantly greater activation in several brain regions,
   including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC).
   Conclusions: Following exposure to angry faces, abnormalities in dACC
   and MPFC activation in patients with alcohol dependency indicated
   possible inefficiencies or hypersensitivities in social cognitive
   processing.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN TOPOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The EEG acquired simultaneously with fMRI is distorted by a number of
   artefacts related to the presence of strong magnetic fields, which must
   be reduced in order to allow for a useful interpretation and
   quantification of the EEG data. For the two most prominent artefacts,
   associated with magnetic field gradient switching and the heart beat,
   reduction methods have been developed and applied successfully. However,
   a number of artefacts related to the MR-environment can be found to
   distort the EEG data acquired even without ongoing fMRI acquisition. In
   this paper, we investigate the most prominent of those artefacts, caused
   by the Helium cooling pump, and propose a method for its reduction and
   respective validation in data collected from epilepsy patients. Since
   the Helium cooling pump artefact was found to be repetitive, an average
   template subtraction method was developed for its reduction with
   appropriate adjustments for minimizing the degradation of the
   physiological part of the signal. The new methodology was validated in a
   group of 15 EEG-fMRI datasets collected from six consecutive epilepsy
   patients, where it successfully reduced the amplitude of the artefact
   spectral peaks by 95 +/- A 2 \% while the background spectral amplitude
   within those peaks was reduced by only -5 +/- A 4 \%. Although the
   Helium cooling pump should ideally be switched off during simultaneous
   EEG-fMRI acquisitions, we have shown here that in cases where this is
   not possible the associated artefact can be effectively reduced in post
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of ceiling height and perceived enclosure
   defined as perceived visual and locomotive permeability on aesthetic
   judgments and approach-avoidance decisions in architectural design.
   Furthermore, to gain traction on the mechanisms driving the observed
   effects, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   explore their neural correlates. Rooms with higher ceilings were more
   likely to be judged as beautiful, and activated structures involved in
   visuospatial exploration and attention in the dorsal stream. Open rooms
   were more likely to be judged as beautiful, and activated structures
   underlying perceived visual motion. Additionally, enclosed rooms were
   more likely to elicit exit decisions and activated the anterior
   midcingulate cortex (aMCC)-the region within the cingulate gyrus with
   direct projections from the amygdala. This suggests that a reduction in
   perceived visual and locomotive permeability characteristic of enclosed
   spaces might elicit an emotional reaction that accompanies exit
   decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the effect of contingency on reward function in
   anxiety. We define contingency as the aspect of a situation in which the
   outcome is determined by one's action-that is, when there is a direct
   link between one's action and the outcome of the action. Past findings
   in adolescents with anxiety or at risk for anxiety have revealed
   hypersensitive behavioral and neural responses to higher value rewards
   with correct performance. This hypersensitivity to highly valued
   (salient) actions suggests that the value of actions is determined not
   only by outcome magnitude, but also by the degree to which the outcome
   is contingent on correct performance. Thus, contingency and incentive
   value might each modulate reward responses in unique ways in anxiety.
   Using fMRI with a monetary reward task, striatal response to cue
   anticipation is compared in 18 clinically anxious and 20 healthy
   adolescents. This task manipulates orthogonally reward contingency and
   incentive value. Findings suggest that contingency modulates the neural
   response to incentive magnitude differently in the two groups.
   Specifically, during the contingent condition, right-striatal response
   tracks incentive value in anxious, but not healthy, adolescents. During
   the noncontingent condition, striatal response is bilaterally stronger
   to low than to high incentive in anxious adolescents, while healthy
   adolescents exhibit the expected opposite pattern. Both contingency and
   reward magnitude differentiate striatal activation in anxious versus
   healthy adolescents. These findings may reflect exaggerated concern
   about performance and/or alterations of striatal coding of reward value
   in anxious adolescents. Abnormalities in reward function in anxiety may
   have treatment implications.}},

   joint attention bids}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{34-46}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Joint attention is a fundamental cognitive ability that supports daily
   interpersonal relationships and communication. The Parallel Distributed
   Processing model (PDPM) postulates that responding to (RJA) and
   initiating (IJA) joint attention are predominantly supported by
   posterior-parietal and frontal regions respectively. It also argues that
   these neural networks integrate during development, supporting the
   parallel processes of self-and other-attention representation during
   interactions. However, direct evidence for the PDPM is limited due to a
   lack of ecologically valid experimental paradigms that can capture both
   RJA and IJA. Building on existing interactive approaches, we developed a
   virtual reality paradigm where participants engaged in an online
   interaction to complete a cooperative task. By including tightly
   controlled baseline conditions to remove activity associated with
   non-social task demands, we were able to directly contrast the neural
   correlates of RJA and IJA to determine whether these processes are
   supported by common brain regions. Both RJA and IJA activated broad
   frontotemporoparietal networks. Critically, a conjunction analysis
   identified that a subset of these regions were common to both RJA and
   IJA. This right-lateralised network included the dorsal portion of the
   middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle
   temporal gyrus (MTG), precentral gyrus, posterior superior temporal

Volume = {{108}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The ability to regulate temptation and manage appetitive cravings is an
   important aspect of healthy adolescent development, but the neural
   systems underlying this process are understudied. In the present study,
   60 healthy females evenly distributed from 10 to 23 years of age used
   reappraisal to regulate the desire to consume personally-craved and not
   craved unhealthy foods. Reappraisal elicited activity in common
   self-regulation regions including the dorsal and ventral lateral
   prefrontal cortex (specifically superior and inferior frontal gyri),
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule. Viewing
   personally-craved foods (versus not craved foods) elicited activity in
   regions including the ventral striatum, as well as more rostral and
   ventral anterior cingulate cortex extending into the orbitofrontal
   cortex. Age positively correlated with regulation-related activity in
   the right inferior frontal gyrus, and negatively correlated with
   reactivity-related activity in the right superior and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortices. Age-adjusted BMI negatively correlated with
   regulation-related activity in the predominantly left lateralized
   frontal and parietal regions. These results suggest that the age-related
   changes seen in the reappraisal of negative emotion may not be as
   pronounced in the reappraisal of food craving. Therefore, reappraisal of
   food craving in particular may be an effective way to teach teenagers to
   manage cravings for other temptations encountered in adolescence,
   including alcohol, drugs, and unhealthy food. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Citalopram and Escitalopram are gold standard pharmaceutical treatment
   options for affective, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders.
   However, their neurophysiologic function on cortico-limbic circuits is
   incompletely characterized. Here we studied the neuropharmacological
   influence of Citalopram and Escitalopram on cortico-limbic regulatory
   processes by assessing the effective connectivity between orbitofrontal
   cortex (OFC) and amygdala using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) applied to
   functional MRI data. We investigated a cohort of 15 healthy subjects in
   a randomized, crossover, double-blind design after 10 days of
   Escitalopram(10 mg/d (S)-citalopram), Citalopram(10 mg/d
   (S)-citalopramand 10 mg/d (R)-citalopram), or placebo. Subjects
   performed an emotional face discrimination task, while undergoing
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning at 3 Tesla. As
   hypothesized, the OFC, in the context of the emotional face
   discrimination task, exhibited a down-regulatory effect on amygdala
   activation. This modulatory effect was significantly increased by
   (S)-citalopram, but not (R)-citalopram. For the first time, this study
   shows that (1) the differential effects of the two enantiomers (S)- and
   (R)-citalopram on cortico-limbic connections can be demonstrated by
   modeling effective connectivity methods, and (2) one of their mechanisms
   can be linked to an increased inhibition of amygdala activation by the
   orbitofrontal cortex. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{343-353}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The interpersonal model of loss of control (LOC) eating proposes that
   socially distressing situations lead to anxious states that trigger
   excessive food consumption. Self-reports support these links, but the
   neurobiological underpinnings of these relationships remain unclear. We
   therefore examined brain regions associated with anxiety in relation to
   LOC eating and energy intake in the laboratory. Twenty-two overweight
   and obese (BMIz: 1.9 +/- 0.4) adolescent (15.8 +/- 1.6 y) girls with LOC
   eating (LOC+, n = 10) and without LOC eating (LOC-, n = 12) underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a simulated peer
   interaction chatroom paradigm. Immediately after the fMRI scan, girls
   consumed lunch ad libitum from a 10,934-kcal laboratory buffet meal with
   the instruction to ``let yourself go and eat as much as you want.{''}
   Pre-specified hypotheses regarding activation of five regions of
   interest were tested. Analysis of fMRI data revealed a significant group
   by peer feedback interaction in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC), such that LOC+ had less activity following peer rejection (vs.
   acceptance), while LOC-had increased activity (p < .005). Moreover,
   functional coupling between vmPFC and striatum for peer rejection (vs.
   acceptance) interacted with LOC status: coupling was positive for LOC+,
   but negative in LOC-(p < .005). Activity of fusiform face area (FFA)
   during negative peer feedback from high-value peers also interacted with
   LOC status (p < .005). A positive association between FFA activation and
   intake during the meal was observed among only those with LOC eating. In
   conclusion, overweight and obese girls with LOC eating may be
   distinguished by a failure to engage regions of prefrontal cortex
   implicated in emotion regulation in response to social distress. The
   relationship between FFA activation and food intake supports the notion
   that heightened sensitivity to incoming interpersonal cues and
   perturbations in socio-emotional neural circuits may lead to overeating
   in order to cope with negative affect elicited by social discomfort in
   susceptible youth. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The anterior temporal lobe (ATL) sits at the confluence of auditory,
   visual, olfactory, transmodal, and limbic processing hierarchies. In
   keeping with this anatomical heterogeneity, the ATL has been implicated
   in numerous functional domains, including language, semantic memory,
   social cognition, and facial identification. One question that has
   attracted considerable discussion is whether the ATL contains a mosaic
   of differentially specialized areas or whether it provides a
   domain-independent amodal hub. In the current study, based on task-free
   fMRI in right-handed neurologically intact participants, we found that
   the left lateral ATL is interconnected with hubs of the temporosylvian
   language network, including the inferior frontal gyrus and middle
   temporal gyrus of the ipsilateral hemisphere and, to a lesser extent,
   with homotopic areas of the contralateral hemisphere. In contrast, the
   right lateral ATL had much weaker functional connectivity with these
   regions in either hemisphere. Together with evidence that has been
   gathered in lesion-mapping and event-related neuroimaging studies, this
   asymmetry of functional connectivity supports the inclusion of the left
   ATL within the language network, a relationship that had been overlooked
   by classic aphasiology. The asymmetric domain selectivity for language
   of the left ATL, together with the absence of such an affiliation in the
   right ATL, is inconsistent with a strict definition of
   domain-independent amodal functionality in this region of the brain.}},

   anorexia nervosa}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental disorder characterized by food
   restriction and weight loss. This study aimed to test the model posed by
   Brooks et al. (2012a,b) that women suffering from chronic AN show
   decreased food-cue processing activity in brain regions associated with
   energy balance and food reward (bottom-up; BU) and increased activity in
   brain regions associated with cognitive control (top-down; TD) when
   compared with long-term recovered AN (REC) and healthy controls (HC).
   Three groups of women, 15 AN (mean illness duration 7.8 +/- 4.1 years),
   14 REC (mean duration of recovery 4.7 +/- 2.7 years) and 15 HC viewed
   alternating blocks of food and non-food images preceded by a short
   instruction during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), after
   fasting overnight. Functional region of interests (fROIs) were defined
   in BU (e.g., striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and
   cerebellum), TD (e.g., medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, and
   anterior cingulate), the insula, and visual processing areas (VPA).
   Food-cue processing activation was extracted from all fROls and compared
   between the groups. In addition, functional connectivity between the
   fROls was examined by modular partitioning of the correlation matrix of
   all fROls. We could not confirm the hypothesis that BU areas are
   activated to a lesser extent in AN upon visual processing of food
   images. Among the BU areas the caudate showed higher activation in both
   patient groups compared to HC. In accordance with Brooks et al.'s model,
   we did find evidence for increased TD control in AN and REC. The
   functional connectivity analysis yielded two clusters in HC and REC, but
   three clusters in AN. In HC, fROls across BU, TD, and VPA areas
   clustered; in AN, one cluster span across BU, TD, and insula; one across
   BU, TD, and VPA areas; and one was confined to the VPA network. In REC,
   BU, TD, and VPA or VPA and insula clustered. In conclusion, despite
   weight recovery, neural processing of food cues is also altered in
   recovered AN patients.}},

Abstract = {{The intention behind another's action and the impact of the outcome are
   major determinants of human economic behavior. It is poorly understood,
   however, whether the two systems share a core neural computation. Here,
   we investigated whether the two systems are causally dissociable in the
   brain by integrating computational modeling, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, and transcranial direct current stimulation
   experiments in a newly developed trust game task. We show not only that
   right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity is correlated with
   intention-based economic decisions and that ventral striatum and
   amygdala activity are correlated with outcome-based decisions, but also
   that stimulation to the DLPFC selectively enhances intention-based
   decisions. These findings suggest that the right DLPFC is involved in
   the implementation of intention-based decisions in the processing of
   cooperative decisions. This causal dissociation of cortical and
   subcortical backgrounds may indicate evolutionary and developmental
   differences in the two decision systems.}},

Title = {{Neuronal correlates of social decision making are influenced by social
   value orientation-an fMRI study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Our decisions often have consequences for other people. Hence,
   self-interest and other-regarding motives are traded off in many
   daily-life situations. Interindividually, people differ in their
   tendency to behave prosocial. These differences are captured by the
   concept of social value orientation (SVO), which assumes stable,
   trait-like tendencies to act selfish or prosocial. This study
   investigates group differences in prosocial decision making and
   addresses the question of whether prosocial individuals act intuitively
   and selfish individuals instead need to control egoistic impulses to
   behave prosocially. We address this question via the interpretation of
   neuronal and behavioral indicators. In the present fMRI-study
   participants were grouped into prosocial- and selfish participants. They
   made decisions in multiple modified Dictator-Games (DG) that addressed
   self- and other-regarding motives to a varying extent (self gain,
   non-costly social gain, mutual gain, costly social gain). Selfish
   participants reacted faster than prosocial participants in all
   conditions, except for decisions in the non-costly social condition, in
   which selfish participants displayed the longest decision times. In the
   total sample we found enhanced neural activity in the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC/BA 9)
   during decisions that resulted in non-costly social benefits. These
   areas have been implicated in cognitive control processes and
   deliberative value integration. Decisively, these effects were stronger
   in the group of selfish individuals. We believe that selfish individuals
   require more explicit and deliberative processing during prosocial
   decisions. Our results are compatible with the assumption that prosocial
   decisions in prosocials are more intuitive, whereas they demand more
   active reflection in selfish individuals.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{The present study examined directional connections in the brain among
   resting-state networks (RSNs) when the participant had their eyes open
   (E0) or had their eyes closed (EC). The resting state fMRI data were
   collected from 20 healthy participants (9 males, 20.17 +/- 2.74 years)
   under the EO and EC states. Independent component analysis (ICA) was
   applied to identify the separated RSNs (i.e., the primary/high-level
   visual, primary sensory-motor, ventral motor, salience/dorsal attention,
   and anterior/posterior default-mode networks), and the Gaussian Bayesian
   network (BN) learning approach was then used to explore the conditional
   dependencies among these RSNs. The network-to-network directional
   connections related to EO and EC were depicted, and a support vector
   machine (SVM) was further employed to identify the directional
   connection patterns that could effectively discriminate between the two
   states. The results indicated that the connections among RSNs are
   directionally connected within a BN during the EO and EC states. The
   directional connections from the salience network (SN) to the
   anterior/posterior default-mode networks and the high-level to
   primary-level visual network were the obvious characteristics of both
   the EO and EC resting-state BNs. Of the directional connections in BN,
   the directional connections of the salience and dorsal attention network
   (DAN) were observed to be discriminative between the EO and EC states.
   In particular, we noted that the properties of the salience and DANs
   were in opposite directions. Overall, the present study described the
   directional connections of RSNs using a BN learning approach during the
   E0 and EC states, and the results suggested that the directionality of
   the attention systems (i.e., mainly for the salience and the DAN) in
   resting state might have Important roles in switching between the EO and
   EC conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforcement learning (RI.) theory posits that learning is driven by
   discrepancies between the predicted and actual outcomes of actions
   (prediction errors {[}PEs]). In social environments, learning is often
   guided by similar RL mechanisms. For example, teachers monitor the
   actions of students and provide feedback to them. This feedback evokes
   PEs in students that guide their learning. We report the first study
   that investigates the neural mechanisms that underpin RL signals in the
   brain of a teacher. Neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   signal PEs when learning from the outcomes of one's own actions but also
   signal infonuation when outcomes are received by others. Does a
   teacher's ACC signal PEs when monitoring a student's learning? Using
   fMRI, we studied brain activity in human subjects (teachers) as they
   taught a confederate (student) action outcome associations by p ro v
   iding pos it ive or negative feedback. We examined activity time-locked
   to the students' responses, when teachers infer student predictions and
   know actual outcomes. We fitted a RL-based computational model to the
   behavior of the student to characterize their learning, and examined
   whether a teacher's ACC signals when a student's predictions are wrong.
   In line with our hypothesis, activity in the teacher's ACC covaried with
   the PE values in the model. Additionally, activity in the teacher's
   insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex covaried with the predicted
   value according to the student. Our findings highlight that the ACC
   signals PEs vicariously for others' erroneous predictions, when
   monitoring and instructing their learning. These results su : :est that
   RL mechanisms, processed vicariously, may underpin and facilitate
   teaching behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Incidental negative emotions unrelated to the current task, such as
   background anxiety, can strongly influence decisions. This is most
   evident in psychiatric disorders associated with generalized emotional
   disturbances. However, the neural mechanisms by which incidental
   emotions may affect choices remain poorly understood. Here we study the
   effects of incidental anxiety on human risky decision making, focusing
   on both behavioral preferences and their underlying neural processes.
   Although observable choices remained stable across affective contexts
   with high and low incidental anxiety, we found a clear change in neural
   valuation signals: during high incidental anxiety, activity in
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum showed a marked
   reduction in (1) neural coding of the expected subjective value (ESV) of
   risky options, (2) prediction of observed choices, (3) functional
   coupling with other areas of the valuation system, and (4) baseline
   activity. At the same time, activity in the anterior insula showed an
   increase in coding the negative ESV of risky lotteries, and this neural
   activity predicted whether the risky lotteries would be rejected. This
   pattern of results suggests that incidental anxiety can shift the focus
   of neural valuation from possible positive consequences to anticipated
   negative consequences of choice options. Moreover, our findings show
   that these changes in neural value coding can occur in the absence of
   changes in overt behavior. This suggest a possible pathway by which
   background anxiety may lead to the development of chronic reward
   desensitization and a maladaptive focus on negative cognitions, as
   prevalent in affective and anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The subjective values of choice options can impact on behavior in two
   fundamentally different types of situations: first, when people
   explicitly base their actions on such values, and second, when values
   attract attention despite being irrelevant for current behavior. Here we
   show with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that these two
   behavioral functions of values are encoded in distinct regions of the
   human brain. In the medial prefrontal cortex, value-related activity is
   enhanced when subjective value becomes choice-relevant, and the
   magnitude of this increase relates directly to the outcome and
   reliability of the value-based choice. In contrast, activity in the
   posterior cingulate cortex represents values similarly when they are
   relevant or irrelevant for the present choice, and the strength of this
   representation predicts attentional capture by choice-irrelevant values.
   Our results suggest that distinct components of the brain's valuation
   network encode value in context-dependent manners that serve
   fundamentally different behavioral aims.}},

Title = {{Helping or punishing strangers: neural correlates of altruistic
   decisions as third-party and of its relation to empathic concern}},

Abstract = {{Social norms are a cornerstone of human society. When social norms are
   violated (e.g., fairness) people can either help the victim or punish
   the violator in order to restore justice. Recent research has shown that
   empathic concern influences this decision to help or punish. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we investigated the neural
   underpinnings of third-party help and punishment and the involvement of
   empathic concern. Participants saw a person violating a social norm,
   i.e., proposing unfair offers in a dictator game, at the expense of
   another person. The participants could then decide to either punish the
   violator or help the victim. Our results revealed that both third-party
   helping as well as third-party punishing activated the bilateral
   striatum, a region strongly related with reward processing, indicating
   that both altruistic decisions share a common neuronal basis. In
   addition, also different networks were involved in the two processes
   compared with control conditions; bilateral striatum and the right
   lateral prefrontal cortex (IPFC) during helping and bilateral striatum
   as well as left IPFC and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during
   punishment. Further we found that individual differences in empathic
   concern influenced whether people prefer to help or to punish. People
   with high empathic concern helped more frequently, were faster in their
   decision and showed higher activation in frontoparietal regions during
   helping compared with punishing. Our findings provide insights into the
   neuronal basis of human altruistic behavior and social norm enforcement
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Health communications can be an effective way to increase positive
   health behaviors and decrease negative health behaviors; however, those
   at highest risk are often most defensive and least open to such
   messages. For example, increasing physical activity among sedentary
   individuals affects a wide range of important mental and physical health
   outcomes, but has proven a challenging task. Affirming core values
   (i.e., self-affirmation) before message exposure is a psychological
   technique that can increase the effectiveness of a wide range of
   interventions in health and other domains; however, the neural
   mechanisms of affirmation's effects have not been studied. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine neural processes
   associated with affirmation effects during exposure to potentially
   threatening health messages. We focused on an a priori defined region of
   interest (ROI) in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), a brain region
   selected for its association with self-related processing and positive
   valuation. Consistent with our hypotheses, those in the self-affirmation
   condition produced more activity in VMPFC during exposure to health
   messages and went on to increase their objectively measured activity
   levels more. These findings suggest that affirmation of core values may
   exert its effects by allowing at-risk individuals to see the
   self-relevance and value in otherwise-threatening messages.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{279}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive reappraisal has been associated with increased activation in
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cingulate regions implicated in cognitive
   control and affect regulation. To date, neuroimaging studies of
   reappraisal have primarily used emotionally evocative scenes, and it
   remains unclear whether the same cognitive strategy applied to emotional
   facial expressions would involve similar or different neural
   underpinnings. The present study used fMRI to examine brain activation
   during cognitive reappraisal of negatively valenced facial expressions
   relative to passive viewing of negative and neutral facial-expressions.
   Twenty-two healthy adults completed a cognitive reappraisal task
   comprised of three different conditions (Look-Neutral,
   Maintain-Negative, Reappraise-Negative). Results indicated that
   reappraisal was associated with a decrease in negative affect and
   engagement of PFC brain regions implicated in cognitive control and
   affect regulation (DLPFC, mPFC, and VLPFC). Furthermore, individual
   differences in habitual reappraisal use were associated with greater
   DLPFC and mPFC activation, while suppression use was associated with
   greater amygdala activation. The present study provides preliminary
   evidence that facial expressions are effective alternative `targets' of
   prefrontal engagement during cognitive reappraisal. These findings are
   particularly relevant for future research probing the neural bases of
   emotion regulation in populations for whom aversive scenes may be less
   appropriate (e.g., children) and illnesses in which aberrant responses
   to social signals of threat and negative feedback are cardinal
   phenotypes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of the happy life: The amplitude of spontaneous low
   frequency fluctuations predicts subjective well-being}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{136-145}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Subjective well-being is assumed to be distributed in the hedonic
   hotspots of subcortical and cortical structures. However, the precise
   neural correlates underlying this construct, especially how it is
   maintained during the resting state, are still largely unknown. Here, we
   explored the neural basis of subjective well-being by correlating the
   regional fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) with
   the self-reported subjective well-being of healthy individuals.
   Behaviorally, we demonstrated that subjective well-being contained two
   related but distinct components: cognitive and affective well-being.
   Neurally, we showed that the fALFF in the bilateral posterior superior
   temporal gyrus (pSTG), right posterior mid-cingulate cortex (pMCC),
   right thalamus, left postcentral gyrus (PCG), right lingual gyrus, and
   left planum temporale (PT) positively predicted cognitive well-being,
   whereas the fALFF in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), right
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG)
   negatively predicted cognitive well-being. In contrast, only the fALFF
   in the right amygdala reliably predicted affective well-being.
   Furthermore, emotional intelligence partiallymediated the effects of the
   right pSTG and thalamus on cognitive well-being, as well as the effect
   of the right amygdala on affectivewell-being. In summary, we provide the
   first evidence that spontaneous brain activity inmultiple regions
   associated with sensation, social perception, cognition, and emotion
   contributes to cognitive well-being, whereas the spontaneous brain
   activity in only one emotion-related region contributes to affective
   well-being, suggesting that the spontaneous activity of the human brain
   reflect the efficiency of subjective well-being. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Peripheral neuropathy of ten manifests clinically with symptoms of
   mechanical and cold allodynia. However, the neuroplastic changes
   associated with peripheral neuropathic pain and the onset and
   progression of allodynic symptoms remain unclear. Here, we used a
   chronic neuropathic pain model (spared nerve injury; SNI) to examine
   functional and metabolic brain changes associated with the development
   and maintenance of mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, the latter
   which we assessed both behaviorally and during a novel acetone
   application paradigm using functional MRI (fMRI). Female Sprague-Dawley
   rats underwent SNI (n=7) or sham (n=5) surgery to the left hindpaw. Rats
   were anesthetized and scanned using a 7 T MRI scanner 1 week prior to
   (preinjury) and 4 (early/subchronic) and 20 weeks (late/chronic)
   post-injury. Functional scans were acquired during acetone application
   to the left hindpaw. H-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopy was also
   performed to assess SN-Iinduced metabolic changes in the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) pre-and 4 weeks post-injury. Mechanical and cold
   sensitivity, as well as anxiety-like behaviors, were assessed 2 weeks
   pre-injury, and 2, 5, 9, 14, and 19 weeks post-injury. Stimulus-evoked
   brain responses (acetone application to the left hindpaw) were analyzed
   across the pre-and post-injury time points. In response to acetone
   application during fMRI, SNI rats showed widespread and functionally
   diverse changes within pain-related brain regions including
   somatosensory and cingulate cortices and subcortically within the
   thalamus and the periaqueductal gray. These functional brain changes
   temporally coincided with early and sustained increases in both
   mechanical and cold sensitivity. SNI rats also showed increased
   glutamate within the ACC that correlated with behavioral measures of
   cold hypersensitivity. Together, our findings suggest that extensive
   functional reorganization within pain-related brain regions may underlie
   the development and chronification of allodynic-like behaviors. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Acupuncture can be regarded as a complex somatosensory stimulation.
   Here, we evaluate whether the point locations chosen for a somatosensory
   stimulation with acupuncture needles differently change the brain
   activity in healthy volunteers. We used EEG, event-related fMRI, and
   resting-state functional connectivity fMRI to assess neural responses to
   standardized needle stimulation of the acupuncture point ST36 (lower
   leg) and two control point locations (CP1 same dermatome, CP2 different
   dermatome). Cerebral responses were expected to differ for stimulation
   in two different dermatomes (CP2 different from ST36 and CP1), or
   stimulation at the acupuncture point vs. the control points. For EEG, mu
   rhythm power increased for ST36 compared to CP1 or CP2, but not when
   comparing the two control points. The fMRI analysis found more
   pronounced insula and S2 (secondary somatosensory cortex) activation, as
   well as precuneus deactivation during ST36 stimulation. The S2
   seed-based functional connectivity analysis revealed increased
   connectivity to right precuneus for both comparisons, ST36 vs. CP1 and
   ST36 vs. CP2, however in different regions. Our results suggest that
   stimulation at acupuncture points may modulate somatosensory and
   saliency processing regions more readily than stimulation at
   non-acupuncture point locations. Also, our findings suggest potential

Abstract = {{Romantic love is a motivational state associated with a desire to enter
   or maintain a close relationship with a specific other person.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have found
   activation increases in brain regions involved in the processing of
   reward, motivation and emotion regulation, when romantic lovers view
   photographs of their partners. However, not much is known about whether
   romantic love affects the brains functional architecture during rest. In
   the present study, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rsfMRI) data was collected to compare the regional homogeneity (ReHo)
   and functional connectivity (FC) across an in-love group (LG, N = 34,
   currently intensely in love), an ended-love group (ELG, N = 34, ended
   romantic relationship recently), and a single group (SG, N = 32, never
   fallen in love). Results show that: (1) ReHo of the left dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) was significantly increased in the LG (in
   comparison to the ELG and the SG); (2) ReHo of the left dACC was
   positively correlated with length of time in love in the LG, and
   negatively correlated with the lovelorn duration since breakup in the
   ELG; (3) FC within the reward, motivation, and emotion regulation
   network (dACC, insula, caudate, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens) as well
   as FC in the social cognition network {[}temporo-parietal junction
   (TPJ), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC), inferior parietal, precuneus, and temporal lobe] was
   significantly increased in the LG (in comparison to the ELG and SG); (4)
   in most regions within both networks FC was positively correlated with
   the duration of love in the LG but negatively correlated with the
   lovelorn duration of time since breakup in the ELG. This study provides
   first empirical evidence of love-related alterations in brain functional
   architecture. Furthermore, the results shed light on the underlying
   neural mechanisms of romantic love, and demonstrate the possibility of
   applying a resting-state fMRI approach for investigating romantic love.}},

   in Clinical Anxiety and Depression}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Serotonin transporter gene variants are known to interact with stressful
   life experiences to increase chances of developing affective symptoms,
   and these same variants have been shown to influence amygdala reactivity
   to affective stimuli in non-psychiatric populations. The impact of these
   gene variants on affective neurocircuitry in anxiety and mood disorders
   has been studied less extensively. Utilizing a triallelic assay
   (5-HTTLPR and rs25531) to assess genetic variation linked with altered
   serotonin signaling, this fMRI study investigated genetic influences on
   amygdala and anterior insula activity in 50 generalized anxiety disorder
   patients, 26 of whom also met DSM-IV criteria for social anxiety
   disorder and/or major depressive disorder, and 39 healthy comparison
   subjects. A Group x Genotype interaction was observed for both the
   amygdala and anterior insula in a paradigm designed to elicit responses
   in these brain areas during the anticipation of and response to aversive
   pictures. Patients who are S/L-G carriers showed less activity than
   their L-A/L-A counterparts in both regions and less activity than S/L-G
   healthy comparison subjects in the amygdala. Moreover, patients with
   greater insula responses reported higher levels of intolerance of
   uncertainty, an association that was particularly pronounced for
   patients with two L-A alleles. A genotype effect was not established in
   healthy controls. These findings link the serotonin transporter gene to
   affective circuitry findings in anxiety and depression psychopathology
   and further suggest that its impact on patients may be different from
   effects typically observed in healthy populations.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Communication based on informational asymmetries abounds in politics,
   business, and almost any other form of social interaction. Informational
   asymmetries may create incentives for the better-informed party to
   exploit her advantage by misrepresenting information. Using a
   game-theoretic setting, we investigate the neural basis of deception in
   human interaction. Unlike in most previous fMRI research on deception,
   the participants decide themselves whether to lie or not. We find
   activation within the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ), the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the (pre)cuneus (CUN), and the anterior
   frontal gyrus (aFG) when contrasting lying with truth telling. Notably,
   our design also allows for an investigation of the neural foundations of
   sophisticated deception through telling the truth-when the sender does
   not expect the receiver to believe her (true) message. Sophisticated
   deception triggers activation within the same network as plain lies,
   i.e., we find activity within the rTPJ, the CUN, and aFG. We take this
   result to show that brain activation can reveal the sender's veridical
   intention to deceive others, irrespective of whether in fact the sender
   utters the factual truth or not.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Real-time functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rtfMRI) is used mainly
   for neurofeedback or for brain-computer interfaces (BCI). But multi-site
   rtfMRI could in fact help in the application of new interactive
   paradigms such as the monitoring of mutual information flow or the
   controlling of objects in shared virtual environments. For that reason,
   a previously developed framework that provided an integrated control and
   data analysis of rtfMRI experiments was extended to enable multi-site
   rtfMRI. Important new components included a data exchange platform for
   analyzing the data of both MR scanners independently and/or jointly.
   Information related to brain activation can be displayed separately or
   in a shared view. However, a signal calibration procedure had to be
   developed and integrated in order to permit the connecting of sites that
   had different hardware and to account for different inter-individual
   brain activation levels. The framework was successfully validated in a
   proof-of-principle study with twelve volunteers. Thus the overall
   concept, the calibration of grossly differing signals, and BCI
   functionality on each site proved to work as required. To model
   interactions between brains in real-time, more complex rules utilizing
   mutual activation patterns could easily be implemented to allow for new
   kinds of social fMRI experiments.}},

Title = {{The Magical Activation of Left Amygdala when Reading Harry Potter: An
   fMRI Study on How Descriptions of Supra-Natural Events Entertain and
   Enchant}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{Literature containing supra-natural, or magical events has enchanted
   generations of readers. When reading narratives describing such events,
   readers mentally simulate a text world different from the real one. The
   corresponding violation of world-knowledge during this simulation likely
   increases cognitive processing demands for ongoing discourse
   integration, catches readers' attention, and might thus contribute to
   the pleasure and deep emotional experience associated with ludic
   immersive reading. In the present study, we presented participants in an
   MR scanner with passages selected from the Harry Potter book series,
   half of which described magical events, while the other half served as
   control condition. Passages in both conditions were closely matched for
   relevant psycholinguistic variables including, e.g., emotional valence
   and arousal, passage-wise mean word imageability and frequency, and
   syntactic complexity. Post-hoc ratings showed that readers considered
   supra-natural contents more surprising and more strongly associated with
   reading pleasure than control passages. In the fMRI data, we found
   stronger neural activation for the supra-natural than the control
   condition in bilateral inferior frontal gyri, bilateral inferior
   parietal lobules, left fusiform gyrus, and left amygdala. The increased
   activation in the amygdala (part of the salience and emotion processing
   network) appears to be associated with feelings of surprise and the
   reading pleasure, which supra-natural events, full of novelty and
   unexpectedness, brought about. The involvement of bilateral inferior
   frontal gyri likely reflects higher cognitive processing demand due to
   world knowledge violations, whereas increased attention to supra-natural
   events is reflected in inferior frontal gyri and inferior parietal
   lobules that are part of the fronto-parietal attention network.}},

Title = {{Simulating Fiction: Individual Differences in Literature Comprehension
   Revealed with fMRI}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{When we read literary fiction, we are transported to fictional places,
   and we feel and think along with the characters. Despite the importance
   of narrative in adult life and during development, the neurocognitive
   mechanisms underlying fiction comprehension are unclear. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how
   individuals differently employ neural networks important for
   understanding others' beliefs and intentions (mentalizing), and for
   sensori-motor simulation while listening to excerpts from literary
   novels. Localizer tasks were used to localize both the cortical motor
   network and the mentalizing network in participants after they listened
   to excerpts from literary novels. Results show that participants who had
   high activation in anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC; part of the
   mentalizing network) when listening to mentalizing content of literary
   fiction, had lower motor cortex activity when they listened to
   action-related content of the story, and vice versa. This qualifies how
   people differ in their engagement with fiction: some people are mostly
   drawn into a story by mentalizing about the thoughts and beliefs of
   others, whereas others engage in literature by simulating more concrete
   events such as actions. This study provides on-line neural evidence for
   the existence of qualitatively different styles of moving into literary
   worlds, and adds to a growing body of literature showing the potential
   to study narrative comprehension with neuroimaging methods.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{In contrast to the assumption of efficiency wage models, which state
   that wage incentives should be positively correlated with productivity,
   high incentives may produce performance decrements in real life
   scenarios. Such a ``choking under pressure{''} phenomenon exemplifies
   how psychological stress can profoundly shape human behavior, for good
   or for had Previous theories suggest that individual choking under
   pressure because that high pressure may distract individuals' attention
   away from the task (the distraction account), raise the attention paid
   to step-by-step skill processes (the explicit monitoring account), or
   elevate the arousal in general (the over-arousal account). Recent
   neuroimaging studies have shown that several brain regions implicated in
   motivation and top-down control of attention also play a key role in
   stress induced choking, supporting for the over arousal and distraction
   theories of choking. This review aims to identify psychological factors
   that determine choking and the neural underpinnings of these processes.
   Insights into how incentives influence performance may aid engineering
   training regimens and interventions that equip individuals to better
   handle high-stakes-induced psychological stress, and to thrive under
   stress.}},

Title = {{Seeking pleasant touch: neural correlates of behavioral preferences for
   skin stroking}},
Journal = {{Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Affective touch is a dynamic process. In this fMRI study we investigated
   affective touch by exploring its effects on overt behavior. Arm and palm
   skin were stroked with a soft brush at five different velocities (0.3,
   1, 10, 3, and 30 cm s(-1)), using a novel feedback-based paradigm.
   Following stimulation in each trial, participants actively chose whether
   the caress they would receive in the next trial would be the same speed
   ({''}repeat{''}) or different ({''}change{''}). Since preferred stroking
   speeds should be sought with greater frequency than non-preferred
   speeds, this paradigm provided a measure of such preferences in the form
   of active choices. The stimulation velocities were implemented with
   respect to the differential subjective pleasantness ratings they elicit
   in healthy subjects, with intermediate velocities (1, 10, and 3 cm
   s(-1)) considered more pleasant than very slow or very fast ones. Such
   pleasantness ratings linearly correlate with changes in mean firing
   rates of unmyelinated low-threshold C-tactile (CT) afferent nerves in
   the skin. Here, gentle, dynamic stimulation optimal for activating
   CT-afferents not only affected behavioral choices, but engaged brain
   regions involved in reward-related behavior and decision-making. This
   was the case for both hairy skin of the arm, where CTs are abundant, and
   glabrous skin of the palm, where CTs are absent. These findings provide
   insights on central and behavioral mechanisms underlying the perception
   of affective touch, and indicate that seeking affective touch involves
   value-based neural processing that is ultimately reflected in behavioral
   preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Most people are generous, but not toward everyone alike: generosity
   usually declines with social distance between individuals, a phenomenon
   called social discounting. Despite the pervasiveness of social
   discounting, social distance between actors has been surprisingly
   neglected in economic theory and neuroscientific research. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural basis
   of this process to understand the neural underpinnings of social
   decision making. Participants chose between selfish and generous
   alternatives, yielding either a large reward for the participant alone,
   or smaller rewards for the participant and another individual at a
   particular social distance. We found that generous choices engaged the
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ). In particular, the TPJ activity was
   scaled to the social-distance-dependent conflict between selfish and
   generous motives during prosocial choice, consistent with ideas that the
   TPJ promotes generosity by facilitating overcoming egoism bias. Based on
   functional coupling data, we propose and provide evidence for a
   biologically plausible neural model according to which the TPJ supports
   social discounting by modulating basic neural value signals in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex to incorporate social-distance-dependent
   other-regarding preferences into an otherwise exclusively own-reward
   value representation.}},

Abstract = {{From an observer's perspective, pain is a fairly nebulous concept-it is
   not externally visible, its cause is not obvious, and perceptions of its
   intensity are mainly subjective. If difficulties in understanding the
   source and degree of pain are troublesome in contexts requiring social
   empathy, they are especially problematic in the legal setting. Tort law
   applies to both acute and chronic pain cases, but the lack of objective
   measures demands high thresholds of proof. However, recent developments
   in pain neuroimaging may clarify some of these inherent uncertainties,
   as studies purport detection of pain on an individual level. In
   analyzing the scientific and legal barriers of utilizing pain
   neuroimaging in court, it is prudent to discuss neuroimaging for
   deception, a topic that has garnered significant controversy due to
   premature attempts at introduction in the courtroom. Through comparing
   and contrasting the two applications of neuroimaging to the legal
   setting, this paper argues that the nature of tort law, the distinct
   features of pain, and the reduced vulnerability to countermeasures
   distinguish pain neuroimaging in a promising way. This paper further
   contends that the mistakes and lessons involving deception detection are
   essential to consider for pain neuroimaging to have a meaningful future
   in court.}},

Title = {{The role of the ventral striatum in inflammatory-induced approach toward
   support figures}},
Journal = {{BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{247-252}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Although considerable research has shown that inflammation leads to
   social withdrawal more generally, it is also possible that inflammation
   leads to social approach when it comes to close others. Whereas it may
   be adaptive to withdraw from strangers when sick, it may be beneficial
   to seek out close others for assistance, protection, or care when sick
   However, this possibility has never been explored in humans nor have the
   neural substrates of these behavioral changes. Based on the role of the
   ventral striatum (VS) in responding to: (1) the anticipation of and
   motivation to approach rewarding outcomes and (2) viewing social support
   figures, the VS may also be involved in sickness-induced approach toward
   support figures. Thus, the goal of the present study was to examine
   whether inflammation leads to a greater desire to approach support
   figures and greater VS activity to viewing support figures. To examine
   this, 63 participants received either placebo or low-dose endotoxin,
   which safely triggers an inflammatory response. Participants reported
   how much they desired to be around a self-identified support figure, and
   viewed pictures of that support figure while undergoing an fMRI scan to
   assess reward-related neural activity. In line with hypotheses,
   endotoxin (vs. placebo) led participants to report a greater desire to
   be around their support figure. In addition, endotoxin (vs. placebo) led
   to greater VS activity to images of support figures (vs. strangers), and
   greater increases in inflammation (IL-6 levels) were associated with
   greater increases in VS activity. Together, these results reveal a
   possible neural mechanism important for sickness-induced social approach
   and highlight the need for a more nuanced view of changes in social
   behavior during sickness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{From only brief exposure to a face, individuals spontaneously categorize
   another's race. Recent behavioral evidence suggests that visual context
   may affect such categorizations. We used fMRI to examine the neural
   basis of contextual influences on the race categorization of faces.
   Participants categorized the race of faces that varied along a
   White-Asian morph continuum and were surrounded by American, neutral, or
   Chinese scene contexts. As expected, the context systematically
   influenced categorization responses and their efficiency (response
   times). Neuroimaging results indicated that the retrosplenial cortex
   (RSC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) exhibited highly sensitive, graded
   responses to the compatibility of facial and contextual cues. These
   regions showed linearly increasing responses as a face became more White
   when in an American context, and linearly increasing responses as a face
   became more Asian when in a Chinese context. Further, RSC activity
   partially mediated the effect of this face-context compatibility on the
   efficiency of categorization responses. Together, the findings suggest a
   critical role of the RSC and OFC in driving contextual influences on
   face categorization, and highlight the impact of extraneous cues beyond
   the face in categorizing other people.}},

Abstract = {{Non-competitive and non-threatening aspects of social hierarchy, such as
   politeness, are universal among human cultures, and might have evolved
   from ritualized submission in primates; however, these behaviors have
   rarely been studied. Honorific language is a type of polite linguistic
   communication that plays an important role in human social interactions
   ranging from everyday conversation to international diplomacy. Here,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed selective
   precuneus activation during a verbal politeness judgment task, but not
   other linguistic-judgment or social-status recognition tasks. The
   magnitude of the activation was correlated with the task performance.
   Functional suppression of the activation using cathodal transcranial
   direct-current stimulation reduced performance in the politeness task.
   These results suggest that the precuneus is an essential hub of the
   verbal politeness judgment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan

Abstract = {{Face perception plays a foundational role in the social world. This
   perceptual ability is deficient in schizophrenia. A noise-filtering
   mechanism is essential for perceptual processing. It remains unclear as
   to whether a specific noise-filtering mechanism is implicated in the
   face perception problem or a general noise-filtering mechanism is
   involved which also mediates non-face visual perception problems
   associated with this psychiatric disorder. This study examined and
   compared the effects of external noise on the performance of face
   discrimination and car discrimination in schizophrenia patients (n=25)
   and healthy controls (n=27). Superimposing the external visual noise on
   face or car stimuli elevated perceptual thresholds (i.e. degraded
   performance levels) for both face and car discrimination. However, the
   effect of noise was significantly larger on face than on car
   discrimination, both in patients and controls. This pattern of results
   suggests specific vulnerability of face processing to noise in healthy
   individuals and those with schizophrenia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are thought to lack
   self-awareness and to experience difficulty empathizing with others.
   Although these deficits have been demonstrated in previous studies, most
   of the target stimuli were constructed for typically developing (TD)
   individuals. We employed judgment tasks capable of indexing
   self-relevant processing in individuals with and without ASD. Fourteen
   Japanese men and 1 Japanese women with high-functioning ASD (17-41 years
   of age) and 13 Japanese men and 2 TD Japanese women (22-40 years of
   age), all of whom were matched for age and full and verbal intelligence
   quotient scores with the ASD participants, were enrolled in this study.
   The results demonstrated that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was
   significantly activated in individuals with ASD in response to autistic
   characters and in TD individuals in response to non-autistic characters.
   Although the frontal-posterior network between the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus participated in the
   processing of non-autistic characters in TD individuals, an alternative
   network was involved when individuals with ASD processed autistic
   characters. This suggests an atypical form of empathy in individuals
   with ASD toward others with ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that experiencing events that represent a
   significant threat to social bonds activates a network of brain areas
   associated with the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain. In the
   present study, we investigated whether the same brain areas are involved
   when witnessing social exclusion threats experienced by others. Using a
   within-subject design, we show that an ecologically valid experience of
   social exclusion recruits areas coding the somatosensory components of
   physical pain (posterior insular cortex and secondary somatosensory
   cortex). Furthermore, we show that this pattern of activation not only
   holds for directly experienced social pain, but also during empathy for
   social pain. Finally, we report that subgenual cingulate cortex is the
   only brain area conjointly active during empathy for physical and social
   pain. This supports recent theories that affective processing and
   homeostatic regulation are at the core of empathic responses.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional speech comprises of complex multimodal verbal and non-verbal
   information that allows deducting others' emotional states or thoughts
   in social interactions. While the neural correlates of verbal and
   non-verbal aspects and their interaction in emotional speech have been
   identified, there is very little evidence on how we perceive and resolve
   incongruity in emotional speech, and whether such incongruity extends to
   current concepts of task-specific prediction errors as a consequence of
   unexpected action outcomes ('negative surprise'). Here, we explored this
   possibility while participants listened to congruent and incongruent
   angry, happy or neutral utterances and categorized the expressed
   emotions by their verbal (semantic) content. Results reveal
   valence-specific incongruity effects: negative verbal content expressed
   in a happy tone of voice increased activation in the dorso-medial
   prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) extending its role from conflict moderation to
   appraisal of valence-specific conflict in emotional speech. Conversely,
   the caudate head bilaterally responded selectively to positive verbal
   content expressed in an angry tone of voice broadening previous accounts
   of the caudate head in linguistic control to moderating valence-specific
   control in emotional speech. Together, these results suggest that
   control structures of the human brain (dmPFC and subcompartments of the
   basal ganglia) impact emotional speech differentially when conflict
   arises.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most effective strategies for regulating emotional responses
   is cognitive reappraisal. While prior work has made great strides in
   characterizing reappraisal's neural mechanisms and behavioral outcomes,
   the key issue of how regulation varies as a function of emotional
   intensity remains unaddressed. We compared the behavioral and neural
   correlates of reappraisal of high- and low-intensity emotional responses
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that
   successful reappraisal of both high- and low-intensity emotions depends
   upon recruitment of dorsomedial (dmPFC) as well as left dorsolateral
   (dlPFC) and ventrolateral (vlPFC) prefrontal cortex. However,
   reappraisal of high-intensity emotions more strongly activated left
   dlPFC, and in addition, activated right lateral and dorsomedial PFC
   regions not recruited by low-intensity reappraisal. No brain regions
   were more strongly recruited during reappraisal of low when compared
   with high-intensity emotions. Taken together, these results suggest that
   reappraisal of high-intensity emotion requires greater cognitive
   resources as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative differences in
   prefrontal recruitment. These data have implications for understanding
   how and when specific PFC systems are needed to regulate different types
   of emotional responses.}},

Abstract = {{Inertia, together with intensity and valence, is an important component
   of emotion. We tested whether positive and negative events generate
   lingering changes in subsequent brain responses to unrelated threat
   stimuli and investigated the impact of individual anxiety. We acquired
   fMRI data while participants watched positive or negative movie-clips
   and subsequently performed an unrelated task with fearful and neutral
   faces. We quantified changes in amygdala reactivity to fearful faces as
   a function of the valence of preceding movies and cumulative neural
   activity evoked during them. We demonstrate that amygdala responses to
   emotional movies spill over to subsequent processing of threat
   information in a valence-specific manner: negative movies enhance later
   amygdala activation whereas positive movies attenuate it. Critically,
   the magnitude of such changes is predicted by a measure of cumulative
   amygdala responses to the preceding positive or negative movies. These
   effects appear independent of overt attention, are regionally limited to
   amygdala, with no changes in functional connectivity. Finally,
   individuals with higher state anxiety displayed stronger modulation of
   amygdala reactivity by positive movies. These results suggest that
   intensity and valence of emotional events as well as anxiety levels
   promote local changes in amygdala sensitivity to threat, highlighting
   the importance of past experience in shaping future affective
   reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{Social phobia (SP) has been associated with amygdala hyperreactivity to
   fear-relevant stimuli. However, little is known about the neural basis
   of SP individuals' capacity to downregulate their responses to such
   stimuli and how such regulation varies as a function of comorbid
   depression and anxiety. We completed an functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study wherein SP participants without comorbidity (n =
   30), with comorbid depression (n = 18) and with comorbid anxiety (n =
   19) and healthy controls (n = 15) were scanned while completing an
   affect labeling emotion regulation task. Individuals with SP as a whole
   exhibited a reversal of the pattern observed in healthy controls in that
   they showed upregulation of amygdala activity during affect labeling.
   However, subsequent analyses revealed a more complex picture based on
   comorbidity type. Although none of the SP subgroups showed the normative
   pattern of amygdala downregulation, it was those with comorbid
   depression specifically who showed significant upregulation. Effects
   could not be attributed to differences in task performance, amygdala
   reactivity or right ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (RVLPFC)
   engagement, but may stem from dysfunctional communication between
   amygdala and RVLPFC. Furthermore, the particularly altered emotion
   regulation seen in those with comorbid depression could not be fully
   explained by symptom severity or state anxiety. Results reveal altered
   emotion regulation in SP, especially when comorbid with depression.}},

Abstract = {{This functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined the neural
   correlates of punishment and forgiveness of initiators of social
   exclusion (i.e. `excluders'). Participants divided money in a modified
   Dictator Game between themselves and people who previously either
   included or excluded them during a virtual ball-tossing game
   (Cyberball). Participants selectively punished the excluders by
   decreasing their outcomes; even when this required participants to give
   up monetary rewards. Punishment of excluders was associated with
   increased activation in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) and
   bilateral anterior insula. Costly punishment was accompanied by higher
   activity in the pre-SMA compared with punishment that resulted in gains
   or was non-costly. Refraining from punishment (i.e. forgiveness) was
   associated with self-reported perspective-taking and increased
   activation in the bilateral temporoparietal junction, dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and ventrolateral
   and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that social
   exclusion can result in punishment as well as forgiveness of excluders
   and that separable neural networks implicated in social cognition and
   cognitive control are recruited when people choose either to punish or
   to forgive those who excluded them.}},

Abstract = {{Remembering emotional autobiographical memories (AMs) is important for
   emotional well-being, and investigation of the role of emotion
   regulation (ER) during AM recollection has relevance for understanding
   mental health issues. Although significant progress has been made in
   understanding the brain mechanisms underlying ER and AM, less is known
   about the role of ER during AM recollection. The present study
   investigated how focusing away (or `distracting') from the emotional
   content during AM recollection influences the subjective re-experiencing
   of emotions and the associated neural correlates, by manipulating the
   retrieval focus of participants who remembered emotional AMs while fMRI
   data were recorded. First, focusing away from emotion led to decreased
   self-reported emotional responses, along with increased engagement of
   ER-related regions (ventro-medial prefrontal cortex, vmPFC), and reduced
   activity in emotion-related regions (amygdala, AMY). Second, increased
   vmPFC activity was linked to reduced emotional ratings, during the
   non-emotional focus. Third, mediation analysis identified vmPFC as a
   functional hub integrating affective signals from AMY and mediating
   their impact on the subjective re-experiencing of emotion, according to
   the current retrieval focus. Collectively, these findings shed light on
   the neural mechanisms underlying the ability to effectively switch
   attentional focus away from emotions during AM recollections and have
   direct relevance for understanding, preventing and treating affective
   disorders, characterised by reduced ability to regulate emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Recipients process information from speech and co-speech gestures, but
   it is currently unknown how this processing is influenced by the
   presence of other important social cues, especially gaze direction, a
   marker of communicative intent. Such cues may modulate neural activity
   in regions associated either with the processing of ostensive cues, such
   as eye gaze, or with the processing of semantic information, provided by
   speech and gesture. Participants were scanned (fMRI) while taking part
   in triadic communication involving two recipients and a speaker. The
   speaker uttered sentences that were and were not accompanied by
   complementary iconic gestures. Crucially, the speaker alternated her
   gaze direction, thus creating two recipient roles: addressed (direct
   gaze) vs unaddressed (averted gaze) recipient. The comprehension of
   Speech\&Gesture relative to SpeechOnly utterances recruited middle
   occipital, middle temporal and inferior frontal gyri, bilaterally. The
   calcarine sulcus and posterior cingulate cortex were sensitive to
   differences between direct and averted gaze. Most importantly,
   Speech\&Gesture utterances, but not SpeechOnly utterances, produced
   additional activity in the right middle temporal gyrus when participants
   were addressed. Marking communicative intent with gaze direction
   modulates the processing of speech-gesture utterances in cerebral areas
   typically associated with the semantic processing of multi-modal
   communicative acts.}},

Abstract = {{The core feature of separation anxiety is excessive distress when faced
   with actual or perceived separation from people to whom the individual
   has a strong emotional attachment. So far little is known about the
   neurobiological underpinnings of separation anxiety. Therefore, we
   investigated functional (amygdala responsiveness and functional
   connectivity during threat-related emotion processing) and structural
   (grey matter volume) imaging markers associated with separation anxiety
   as measured with the Relationship Scale Questionnaire in a large sample
   of healthy adults from the Munster Neuroimaging Cohort (N = 320). We
   used a robust emotional face-matching task and acquired high-resolution
   structural images for morphometric analyses using voxel-based
   morphometry. The main results were positive associations of separation
   anxiety scores with amygdala reactivity to emotional faces as well as
   increased amygdala grey matter volumes. A functional connectivity
   analysis revealed positive associations between separation anxiety and
   functional coupling of the amygdala with areas involved in visual
   processes and attention, including several occipital and somatosensory
   areas. Taken together, the results suggest a higher emotional
   involvement in subjects with separation anxiety while watching negative
   facial expressions, and potentially secondary neuro-structural adaptive
   processes. These results could help to understand and treat (adult)
   separation anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Alexithymia is a psychological construct that can be divided into a
   cognitive and affective dimension. The cognitive dimension is
   characterized by difficulties in identifying, verbalizing and analysing
   feelings. The affective dimension comprises reduced levels of emotional
   experience and imagination. Alexithymia is widely regarded to arise from
   an impairment of emotion regulation. This is the first functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to critically evaluate this by
   investigating the neural correlates of emotion regulation as a function
   of alexithymia levels. The aim of the current study was to investigate
   the neural correlates underlying the two alexithymia dimensions during
   emotion perception and emotion regulation. Using fMRI, we scanned 51
   healthy subjects while viewing, reappraising or suppressing negative
   emotional pictures. The results support the idea that cognitive
   alexithymia, but not affective alexithymia, is associated with lower
   activation in emotional attention and recognition networks during
   emotion perception. However, in contrast with several theories, no
   alexithymia-related differences were found during emotion regulation
   (neither reappraisal nor suppression). These findings suggest that
   alexithymia may result from an early emotion processing deficit rather
   than compromised frontal circuits subserving higher-order emotion
   regulation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Gaze and arrow cues automatically orient visual attention, even when
   they have no predictive value, but the neural circuitry by which they
   direct attention is not clear. Recent evidence has indicated that the
   ventral frontoparietal attention network is primarily engaged by
   breaches of a viewer's cue-related expectations. Accordingly, we
   hypothesized that to the extent that non-predictive gaze and arrow cues
   automatically engender expectations with regard to cue location, they
   should activate the ventral attention network when they cue attention
   invalidly. Using event-related fMRI, we found that invalid gaze but not
   arrow cues activated the ventral attention network, specifically in the
   area of the right temporal parietal junction (TPJ), as well as nodes
   along the dorsal attention network associated with a redirection of
   attention to the correct target location. In additional whole-brain
   analyses, facilitation of behavioral response time by valid gaze cues
   was linearly associated with the degree of activation in the right TPJ.
   We conclude from our findings that gaze direction elicits potent
   expectations in humans with regard to an actor's intention that engage
   attention networks if not differently from, at least more robustly than,
   arrow cues.}},

Abstract = {{Humans often judge others egocentrically, assuming that they feel or
   think similarly to themselves. Emotional egocentricity bias (EEB) occurs
   in situations when others feel differently to oneself. Using a novel
   paradigm, we investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the
   developmental capacity to overcome such EEB in children compared with
   adults. We showed that children display a stronger EEB than adults and
   that this correlates with reduced activation in right supramarginal
   gyrus (rSMG) as well as reduced coupling between rSMG and left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) in children compared with
   adults. Crucially, functional recruitment of rSMG was associated with
   age-related differences in cortical thickness of this region. Although
   in adults the mere presence of emotional conflict occurs between self
   and other recruited rSMG, rSMG-lDLPFC coupling was only observed when
   implementing empathic judgements. Finally, resting state analyses
   comparing connectivity patterns of rSMG with that of right
   temporoparietal junction suggested a unique role of rSMG for self-other
   distinction in the emotional domain for adults as well as for children.
   Thus, children's difficulties in overcoming EEB may be due to late
   maturation of regions distinguishing between conflicting socio-affective
   information and relaying this information to regions necessary for
   implementing accurate judgments.}},

Abstract = {{Drugs of abuse elicit dopamine release in the ventral striatum, possibly
   biasing dopamine-driven reinforcement learning towards drug-related
   reward at the expense of non-drug-related reward. Indeed, in
   alcohol-dependent patients, reactivity in dopaminergic target areas is
   shifted from non-drug-related stimuli towards drug-related stimuli. Such
   hijacked' dopamine signals may impair flexible learning from
   non-drug-related rewards, and thus promote craving for the drug of
   abuse. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure
   ventral striatal activation by reward prediction errors (RPEs) during a
   probabilistic reversal learning task in recently detoxified
   alcohol-dependent patients and healthy controls (N=27). All participants
   also underwent 6-{[}F-18]fluoro-DOPA positron emission tomography to
   assess ventral striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. Neither ventral
   striatal activation by RPEs nor striatal dopamine synthesis capacity
   differed between groups. However, ventral striatal coding of RPEs
   correlated inversely with craving in patients. Furthermore, we found a
   negative correlation between ventral striatal coding of RPEs and
   dopamine synthesis capacity in healthy controls, but not in
   alcohol-dependent patients. Moderator analyses showed that the magnitude
   of the association between dopamine synthesis capacity and RPE coding
   depended on the amount of chronic, habitual alcohol intake. Despite the
   relatively small sample size, a power analysis supports the reported
   results. Using a multimodal imaging approach, this study suggests that
   dopaminergic modulation of neural learning signals is disrupted in
   alcohol dependence in proportion to long-term alcohol intake of
   patients. Alcohol intake may perpetuate itself by interfering with
   dopaminergic modulation of neural learning signals in the ventral
   striatum, thus increasing craving for habitual drug intake.}},

   and ERP study}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A dishonest person often utilizes another person's obliviousness to
   appropriate the property that belongs to the other person. Previous
   researchers have studied the making of a dishonest choice and the
   manipulation of truthful information. Here, we have investigated the
   neural correlates of processing the outcomes of dishonest decisions.
   Participants in this study were asked to interact with counterparts in
   an economic game. They could accept the counterparts' proposals on how
   to divide the profits (honest choice) or choose the alternative plan
   that was advantageous to themselves (dishonest choice), playing to the
   ignorance of their counterparts who had a 50\% chance of detecting the
   situation. Successful dishonest choices (not being detected) would bring
   large rewards, whereas honest choices would lead to less of a reward,
   and failed dishonest choices (being caught) would result in no reward.
   Participants' neural responses during the outcome presentations were
   recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   event-related potential (ERP) methods in different sessions. We found
   that the outcomes of successful dishonest (vs. honest) choices elicited
   stronger activations in the ventral striatum and posterior cingulate
   cortex and a smaller ERP component called feedback-related negativity
   (FRN), which suggests that positive outcome evaluation and attention
   processing were aroused by successful dishonest choices. Moreover, the
   outcomes of failed dishonest (relative to honest) choices were
   associated with different neural response patterns in the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex and P3b ERP component between human and computer
   counterparts, suggesting that processing the output of social decision
   making (playing human) is different from that of risk taking (playing
   computer). The findings advanced our understanding about the neural
   processing of outcome presentation after a dishonest choice has been
   made. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Intranasal oxytocin has been shown to affect human social and
   emotional processing, but its potential to affect pain remains elusive.
   This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial
   investigated the effect of intranasal oxytocin on the perception and
   processing of noxious experimental heat in 36 healthy male volunteers.
   Methods Thermal thresholds were determined according to the Quantitative
   Sensory Testing protocol. A functional magnetic resonance imaging
   experiment including intensity and unpleasantness ratings of tonic heat
   was used to investigate the effects of oxytocin within the brain.
   Results Thirty men (aged 18-50 years) were included in the study.
   Intranasal oxytocin had no significant effect on thermal thresholds, but
   significantly (t = -2.06, p = .046) reduced heat intensity ratings
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The effect on intensity
   ratings was small (-3.46 points on a 100-point visual analog scale
   {[}95\% confidence interval \{CI\} = -6.86 to -0.07] and independent of
   temperature. No effects of oxytocin on stimulus- or temperature-related
   processing were found at the whole-brain level at a robust statistical
   threshold. A region of interest analysis indicated that oxytocin caused
   small but significant decreases in left (-0.045\%, 95\% CI = -0.087 to
   -0.003, t = -2.19, p = .037) and right (-0.051\%, 95\% CI = -0.088 to
   -0.014], t = -2.82, p = .008) amygdala activity across all temperatures.
   Conclusions The present study provides evidence for a significant but
   subtle inhibitory effect of oxytocin on thermal stimulus ratings and
   concurrent amygdala activity. Neither of the two effects significantly
   depended of temperature; therefore, the hypothesis of a pain-specific
   effect of oxytocin could not be confirmed. Trial Registration: EUDRA-CT

Title = {{Compensation or inhibitory failure? Testing hypotheses of age-related

Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging studies report increased right prefrontal cortex
   (PFq involvement during verbal memory tasks amongst low-scoring older
   individuals, compared to younger controls and their higher-scoring
   contemporaries. Some propose that this reflects inefficient use of
   neural resources through failure of the left PFC to inhibit
   non-task-related right PFC activity, via the anterior corpus callosum
   (CC). For others, it indicates partial compensation that is, the right
   PFC cannot completely supplement the failing neural network, but
   contributes positively to performance. We propose that combining
   structural and diffusion brain MRI can be used to test predictions from
   these theories which have arisen from fMRI studies. We test these
   hypotheses in immediate and delayed verbal memory ability amongst 90
   healthy older adults of mean age 73 years. Right hippocampus and left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) volumes, and fractional
   anisotropy (FA) in the splenium made unique contributions to verbal
   memory ability in the whole group. There was no significant effect of
   anterior callosal white matter integrity on performance. Rather,
   segmented linear regression indicated that right DLPFC volume was a
   significantly stronger positive predictor of verbal memory for
   lower-scorers than higher-scorers, supporting a compensatory explanation
   for the differential involvement of the right frontal lobe in verbal
   memory tasks in older age. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by

Volume = {{63}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Although the neurodevelopmental and genetic underpinnings of autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD) have been investigated, the etiology of the
   disorder has remained elusive, and clinical diagnosis continues to rely
   on symptom-based criteria. In this study, to classify both control
   subjects and a large sample of patients with ASD, we used resting state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and a neural network.
   Imaging data from 312 subjects with ASD and 328 subjects with typical
   development was downloaded from the multi-center research project. Only
   subjects under 20 years of age were included in this analysis.
   Correlation matrices computed from rs-fMRI time-series data were entered
   into a probabilistic neural network (PNN) for classification. The PNN
   classified the two groups with approximately 90\% accuracy (sensitivity
   = 92\%, specificity = 87\%). The accuracy of classification did not
   differ among the institutes, or with respect to experimental and imaging
   conditions, sex, handedness, or intellectual level. Medication status
   and degree of head movement did not affect accuracy values. The present
   study indicates that an intrinsic connectivity matrix produced from
   rs-fMRI data could yield a possible biomarker of ASD. These results
   support the view that altered network connectivity within the brain
   contributes to the neurobiology of ASD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Differing contributions of inferior prefrontal and anterior temporal
   cortex to concrete and abstract conceptual knowledge}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{250-266}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Semantic cognition is underpinned by regions involved in representing
   conceptual knowledge and executive control areas that provide regulation
   of this information according to current task requirements. Using
   distortion-corrected fMRI, we investigated the contributions of these
   two systems to abstract and concrete word comprehension. We contrasted
   semantic decisions made either with coherent contextual support, which
   encouraged retrieval of a rich conceptual representation, or with
   irrelevant contextual information, which instead maximised demands on
   control processes. Inferior prefrontal cortex was activated more when
   decisions were made in the presence of irrelevant context, suggesting
   that this region is crucial for the semantic control functions required
   to select appropriate aspects of meaning in the face of competing
   information. It also exhibited greater activation for abstract words,
   which reflects the fact that abstract words tend to have variable,
   context-dependent meanings that place higher demands on control
   processes. In contrast, anterior temporal regions (ATL) were most active
   when decisions were made with the benefit of a coherent context,
   suggesting a representational role. There was a graded shift in
   concreteness effects in this region, with dorsolateral areas
   particularly active for abstract words and ventromedial areas
   preferentially activated by concrete words. This supports the idea that
   concrete concepts are closely associated with visual experience and
   abstract concepts with auditory-verbal information; and that sub-regions
   of the ATL display graded specialisation for these two types of
   knowledge. Between these two extremes, we identified significant
   activations for both word types in ventrolateral ATL. This area is known
   to be involved in representing knowledge for concrete concepts; here we
   established that it is also activated by abstract concepts. These
   results converge with data from rTMS and neuropsychological
   investigations in demonstrating that representational content and task
   demands influence recruitment of different areas in the semantic
   network. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Can Harry Potter still put a spell on us in a second language? An fMRI
   study on reading emotion-laden literature in late bilinguals}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{282-295}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this fMRI study we contrasted emotional responses to literary reading
   in late bilinguals' first or second language. German participants with
   adequate English proficiency in their second language (L2) English read
   short text passages from Harry Potter books characterized by a
   ``negative{''} or ``positive{''} versus ``neutral{''} emotional valence
   manipulation. Previous studies have suggested that given sufficient L2
   proficiency, neural substrates involved in L1 versus L2 do not differ
   (Fabbro, 2001). On the other hand, the question of attenuated
   emotionality of L2 language processing is still an open debate (see
   Conrad, Recio, \& Jacobs, 2011). Our results revealed a set of neural
   structures involved in the processing of emotion-laden literature,
   including emotion-related amygdala and a set of lateral prefrontal,
   anterior temporal, and temporo-parietal regions associated with
   discourse comprehension, high-level semantic integration, and
   Theory-of-Mind processing. Yet, consistent with post-scan emotion
   ratings of text passages, factorial fMRI analyses revealed stronger
   hemodynamic responses to ``happy{''} than to ``neutral{''} in bilateral
   amygdala and the left precentral cortex that were restricted to L1
   reading. Furthermore, multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) demonstrated
   better classifiability of differential patterns of brain activity
   elicited by passages of different emotional content in L1 than in L2 for
   the whole brain level. Overall, our results suggest that reading
   emotion-laden texts in our native language provides a stronger and more
   differentiated emotional experience than reading in a second language.

Abstract = {{The theory-of-mind (TOM) network refers to a specific group of brain
   regions implicated in the thinking of people's mental states. It remains
   unclear how this network contributes to verb comprehension. In the
   present study, we compared brain activations evoked by verbs that refer
   to social actions, private actions, and nonhuman events. All classic
   regions of the ToM network, including the posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (pSTS) whose activation during word comprehension is typically
   interpreted as the processing of motion properties, showed stronger
   activations to social action verbs than the others. These findings
   indicate that the ToM network is involved in the processing of
   social/mental knowledge of verb meanings. Furthermore, the activation of
   the pSTS during word comprehension mainly reflects the processing of
   social/mental properties but not that of biological-motion properties.

Abstract = {{Prior research suggests that increased adolescent risk-taking in the
   presence of peers may be linked to the influence of peers on the
   valuation and processing of rewards during decision-making. The current
   study explores this idea by examining how peer observation impacts the
   processing of rewards when such processing is isolated from other facets
   of risky decision-making (e.g. risk-perception and preference,
   inhibitory processing, etc.). In an fMRI paradigm, a sample of
   adolescents (ages 14-19) and adults (ages 25-35) completed a modified
   High/Low Card Guessing Task that included rewarded and un-rewarded
   trials. Social context was manipulated by having participants complete
   the task both alone and while being observed by two, same-age, same-sex
   peers. Results indicated an interaction of age and social context on the
   activation of reward circuitry during the receipt of reward; when
   observed by peers adolescents exhibited greater ventral striatal
   activation than adults, but no age-related differences were evinced when
   the task was completed alone. These findings suggest that, during
   adolescence, peers influence recruitment of reward-related regions even
   when they are engaged outside of the context of risk-taking.
   Implications for engagement in prosocial, as well as risky, behaviors
   during adolescence are discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Noradrenaline interacts with stress hormones in the amygdala and
   hippocampus to enhance emotional memory consolidation, but the
   noradrenergic-glucocorticoid interaction at retrieval, where stress
   impairs memory, is less understood.
   We used a genetic neuroimaging approach to investigate whether a genetic
   variation of the noradrenergic system impacts stress-induced neural
   activity in amygdala and hippocampus during recognition of emotional
   memory.
   This study is based on genotype-dependent reanalysis of data from our
   previous publication (Li et al. Brain Imaging Behav 2014). Twenty-two
   healthy male volunteers were genotyped for the ADRA2B gene encoding the
   alpha 2B-adrenergic receptor. Ten deletion carriers and 12 noncarriers
   performed an emotional face recognition task, while their brain activity
   was measured with fMRI. During encoding, 50 fearful and 50 neutral faces
   were presented. One hour later, they underwent either an acute stress
   (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control procedure which was followed
   immediately by the retrieval session, where participants had to
   discriminate between 100 old and 50 new faces.
   A genotype-dependent modulation of neural activity at retrieval was
   found in the bilateral amygdala and right hippocampus. Deletion carriers
   showed decreased neural activity in the amygdala when recognizing
   emotional faces in control condition and increased amygdala activity
   under stress. Noncarriers showed no differences in emotional modulated
   amygdala activation under stress or control. Instead, stress-induced
   increases during recognition of emotional faces were present in the
   right hippocampus.
   The genotype-dependent effects of acute stress on neural activity in
   amygdala and hippocampus provide evidence for
   noradrenergic-glucocorticoid interaction in emotional memory retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{Amotivation in schizophrenia is assumed to involve dysfunctional
   dopaminergic signaling of reward prediction or anticipation. It is
   unclear, however, whether the translation of neural representation of
   reward value to behavioral drive is affected in schizophrenia. In order
   to examine how abnormal neural processing of response valuation and
   initiation affects incentive motivation in schizophrenia, we conducted
   functional MRI using a deterministic reinforcement learning task with
   variable intervals of contingency reversals in 20 clinically stable
   patients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy controls. Behaviorally, the
   advantage of positive over negative reinforcer in reinforcement-related
   responsiveness was not observed in patients. Patients showed altered
   response valuation and initiation-related striatal activity and
   deficient rostro-ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation during
   reward approach initiation. Among these neural abnormalities,
   rostro-ventral anterior cingulate cortex activation was correlated with
   positive reinforcement-related responsiveness in controls and social
   anhedonia and social amotivation subdomain scores in patients. Our
   findings indicate that the central role of the anterior cingulate cortex
   is in translating action value into driving force of action, and
   underscore the role of the cingulo-striatal network in amotivation in
   schizophrenia. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) often make aberrant cause and effect
   inferences in non-social and social situations. Likewise, patients may
   perceive cause-and-effect relationships abnormally as a result of an
   alteration in the physiology of perception. The neural basis for
   dysfunctions in causality judgements in the context of both physical
   motion and social motion is unknown. The current study used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate a group of patients
   with SZ and a group of control subjects performing judgements of
   causality on animated collision sequences (launch-events, Michotte,
   1963) and comparable ``social{''} motion stimuli. In both types of
   animations, similar motion trajectories of the affected object were
   configured, using parametrical variations of space (angle deviation) and
   time (delay).
   At the behavioural level, SZ patients made more physical and less social
   causal judgements than control subjects, and their judgements were less
   influenced by motion attributes (angle/time delay). In the patients
   group, fMRI revealed greater BOLD-responses, during both physical and
   social causality judgements (group x task interaction), in the left
   inferior frontal gyrus (L.IFG). Across conditions (main effect),
   L.IFG-interconnectivity with bilateral occipital cortex was reduced in
   the patient group.
   This study provides the first insight into the neural correlates of
   altered causal judgements in SZ. Patients with SZ tended to
   over-estimate physical and under-estimate social causality. In both
   physical and social contexts, patients are influenced less by motion
   parameters (space and time) than control subjects. Imaging findings of
   L.IFG-disconnectivity and task-related hyper-activation in the patient
   group could indicate common dysfunctions in the neural activations
   needed to integrate external cue-information (space/time) with explicit
   (top-down) cause-effect judgements of object motions in physical and
   social settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Remote brain regions show correlated spontaneous activity at rest within
   well described intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Meta-analytic
   coactivation studies have uncovered networks similar to resting ICNs,
   suggesting that in task states connectivity modulations may occur
   principally within ICNs. However, it has also been suggested that
   specific hub regions dynamically link networks under different task
   conditions. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging at rest
   and a continuous visual attention task in 16 participants to investigate
   whether a shift from rest to attention was reflected by within-network
   connectivity modulation, or changes in network topography. Our analyses
   revealed evidence for both modulation of connectivity within the
   default-mode (DMN) and dorsal attention networks (DAN) between
   conditions, and identified a set of regions including the
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and posterior middle frontal gyrus (MFG)
   that switched between the DMN and DAN depending on the task. We further
   investigated the temporal nonstationarity of flexible (TPJ and MFG)
   regions during both attention and rest. This showed that
   moment-to-moment differences in connectivity at rest mirrored the
   variation in connectivity between tasks. Task-dependent changes in
   functional connectivity of flexible regions may, therefore, be
   understood as shifts in the proportion of time specific connections are
   engaged, rather than a switch between networks per se. This ability of
   specific regions to dynamically link ICNs under different task
   conditions may play an important role in behavioral flexibility. Hum

Abstract = {{The willingness to incur personal costs to enforce prosocial norms
   represents a hallmark of human civilization. Although recent
   neuroscience studies have used the ultimatum game to understand the
   neuropsychological mechanisms that underlie the enforcement of fairness
   norms; however, a precise characterization of the neural systems
   underlying fairness-related norm enforcement remains elusive. In this
   study, we used a coordinate-based meta-analysis on functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies using the ultimatum game with the goal
   to provide an additional level of evidence for the refinement of the
   underlying neural architecture of this human puzzling behavior. Our
   results demonstrated a convergence of reported activation foci in brain
   networks associated with psychological components of fairness-related
   normative decision making, presumably reflecting a reflexive and
   intuitive system (System 1) and a reflective and deliberate system
   (System 2). System 1 (anterior insula, ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   {[}PFC]) may be associated with the reflexive and intuitive responses to
   norm violations, representing a motivation to punish norm violators.
   Those intuitive responses conflict with economic self-interest, encoded
   in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which may engage
   cognitive control from a reflective and deliberate System 2 to resolve
   the conflict by either suppressing (ventrolateral PFC, dorsomedial PFC,
   left dorsolateral PFC, and rostral ACC) the intuitive responses or
   over-riding self-interest (right dorsolateral PFC). Taken together, we
   suggest that fairness-related norm enforcement recruits an intuitive
   system for rapid evaluation of norm violations and a deliberate system
   for integrating both social norms and self-interest to regulate the
   intuitive system in favor of more flexible decision making. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{Smoking is associated with increased incidence of chronic pain. However,
   the evidence is cross-sectional in nature, and underlying mechanisms
   remain unclear. In a longitudinal observational study, we examined the
   relationship between smoking, transition to chronic pain, and brain
   physiology. In 160 subjects with subacute back pain (SBP: back pain
   lasting 4-12 weeks, and no prior back pain {[}BP] for at least 1 year)
   pain characteristics, smoking status, and brain functional properties
   were measured repeatedly over 1 year. Sixty-eight completed the study,
   subdivided into recovering (SBPr, n=31) and persisting (SBPp, n=37),
   based on >20\% decrease in BP over the year. Thirty-two chronic back
   pain (CBP: duration>5 years) and 35 healthy controls were similarly
   monitored. Smoking prevalence was higher in SBP and CBP but not related
   to intensity of BP. In SBP, smoking status at baseline was predictive of
   persistence of BP 1 year from symptom onset (differentiating SBPp and
   SBPr with 0.62 accuracy). Smoking status combined with affective
   properties of pain and medication use improved prediction accuracy
   (0.82). Mediation analysis indicated the prediction of BP persistence by
   smoking was largely due to synchrony of fMRI activity between two brain
   areas (nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, NAc-mPFC). In SBP
   or CBP who ceased smoking strength of NAc-mPFC decreased from
   precessation to postcessation of smoking. We conclude that smoking
   increases risk of transitioning to CBP, an effect mediated by
   corticostriatal circuitry involved in addictive behavior and motivated
   learning. Hum Brain Mapp 36:683-694, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Objectives: Anticipatory processes prepare the organism for upcoming
   experiences. The aim of this study was to investigate neural responses
   related to anticipation and processing of painful stimuli occurring with
   different levels of uncertainty. Experimental design: Twenty-five
   participants (13 females) took part in an electroencephalography and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment at separate
   times. A visual cue announced the occurrence of an electrical painful or
   nonpainful stimulus, delivered with certainty or uncertainty (50\%
   chance), at some point during the following 15 s. Principal
   observations: During the first 2 s of the anticipation phase, a strong
   effect of uncertainty was reflected in a pronounced frontal
   stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) and increased fMRI activation in
   higher visual processing areas. In the last 2 s before stimulus
   delivery, we observed stimulus-specific preparatory processes indicated
   by a centroparietal SPN and posterior insula activation that was most
   pronounced for the certain pain condition. Uncertain anticipation was
   associated with attentional control processes. During stimulation, the
   results revealed that unexpected painful stimuli produced the strongest
   activation in the affective pain processing network and a more
   pronounced offset-P2. Conclusions: Our results reflect that during early
   anticipation uncertainty is strongly associated with affective
   mechanisms and seems to be a more salient event compared to certain
   anticipation. During the last 2 s before stimulation, attentional
   control mechanisms are initiated related to the increased salience of
   uncertainty. Furthermore, stimulus-specific preparatory mechanisms
   during certain anticipation also shaped the response to stimulation,
   underlining the adaptive value of stimulus-targeted preparatory activity
   which is less likely when facing an uncertain event. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{High-functioning individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),and
   age- and verbal IQ-matched controls (CTL) were fMRI scanned when playing
   ``stone paper scissors{''}. They believed they were playing against
   three different opponents: a Human, a Robot endowed with an artificial
   intelligence attempting to win the game, and a Computer running a random
   number generator. No differences between ASD and CTL reached
   significance in canonical mentalizing regions, in the medial prefrontal
   cortex and right temporoparietal junction. In contrast, activity in a
   cluster located in the left hypothalamus, attributed to the
   paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PHN), increased in the CTL, but
   not ASD, group when participants played against the human compared to
   the artificial agent. The left temporoparietal junction (ITPJ), that has
   been previously associated with anthropomorphization, influenced this
   PHN cluster activity differently between groups, with a significantly
   negative functional connectivity when CTL played against the robot and
   when ASD participants played against the human. Brain activity results
   are consistent with the hypothesis that hypothalamus-secreted
   neurohormones, including oxytocin, could support motivation for social
   interactions and be impaired in autism. Brain connectivity results
   suggest that cortical encoding of social context information, putatively
   related to anthropomorphism, has a reversed effect on hypothalamus
   activity in autism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Psychometric studies suggest that observed self-concept deficits in
   addicted massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) are
   compensated through the replacement of their ideal (i. e., how an
   individual would like to be) by their own avatar (i. e., graphical agent
   in the virtual world). Neurobiological studies indicate that increased
   identification with their own avatar in regular MMORPG gamers is
   possibly reflected by enhanced avatar-referential brain activation in
   the left angular gyrus (AG). However, the neurobiological correlates
   reflecting the relations of the avatar to addicted gamers' self and
   ideal are still unexplored. Therefore, we compare these relations
   between addicted and nonaddicted MMORPG gamers. A sample of n = 15
   addicted and n = 17 nonaddicted players underwent functional MRI (fMRI)
   while completing a Giessen-Test (GT)-derived paradigm assessing self-,
   ideal-, and avatar-related self-concept domains. Neurobiological
   analyses included the comparisons avatar versus self, avatar versus
   ideal, and avatar versus self, ideal. Psychometrically, addicts showed
   significantly lower scores on the self-concept subscale of `social
   resonance,' that is, social popularity. In all avatar-related contrasts,
   within-group comparisons showed addicted players to exhibit
   significantly higher brain activations in the left AG. The
   between-groups comparisons revealed avatar-related left AG
   hyperactivations in addicts. Our results may suggest that addicted
   MMORPG players identify significantly more with their avatar than
   nonaddicted gamers. The concrete avatar might increasingly replace the
   rather abstract ideal in the transition from normal-controlled to
   addictive-compulsive MMORPG usage.}},

Title = {{Differences in grammatical processing strategies for active and passive

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROLINGUISTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have used a neuroscience-based approach towards examination
   of writing and reading skills and how these might differ between
   languages. However, few studies have focused on differences in
   grammatical processing that may be specific to certain languages.
   Studies have shown that grammar for active and passive sentences differs
   between Chinese and English. Chinese, a morphologically non-inflectional
   language, is visibly different from inflectional languages in terms of
   verb morphology changes but similar in terms of subject and object
   transformation movements. We used a blocked design functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) study to examine brain activations during
   processing of three types of Chinese sentences: active sentences,
   passive sentences, and general declarative sentences in native Chinese
   speakers. We found similar brain activations for picture-active,
   picture-passive, and declarative sentences. However, differences in
   neural activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior
   superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) were observed between active and passive
   conditions. Since the Chinese language does not require inflection of
   verbs when switching from active to passive sentences, it is possible
   that subject and object inversion led to the syntactic processing
   observed in the present study. These results provide evidence suggesting
   that different strategies are used for Chinese as compared to English
   for grammatical passive sentence inversions. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Title = {{Elevated amygdala activity during reappraisal anticipation predicts
   anxiety in avoidant personality disorder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{1-7}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by pervasive
   anxiety, fear of criticism, disapproval, and rejection, particularly in
   anticipation of exposure to social situations. An important but
   underexplorecl question concerns whether anxiety in avoidant patients is
   associated with an impaired ability to engage emotion regulatory
   strategies in anticipation of and during appraisal of negative social
   stimuli.
   Methods: We examined the use of an adaptive emotion regulation strategy,
   cognitive reappraisal, in avoidant patients. In addition to assessing
   individual differences in state and trait anxiety levels, self-reported
   affect as well as measures of neural activity were compared between 17
   avoidant patients and 21 healthy control participants both in
   anticipation of and during performance of a reappraisal task.
   Results: Avoidant patients showed greater state and trait related
   anxiety relative to healthy participants. In addition, relative to
   healthy participants, avoidant patients showed pronounced amygdala
   hyper-reactivity during reappraisal anticipation, and this hyper
   reactivity effect was positively associated with increasing self
   reported anxiety levels. Limitations: Our finding of exaggerated
   amygdala activity during reappraisal anticipation could reflect anxiety
   about the impending need to reappraise, anxiety about the certainty of
   an upcoming negative image, or anxiety relating to anticipated scrutiny
   of task responses by the experimenters. While we believe that all of
   these possibilities are consistent with the phenomenology of avoidant
   personality disorder, future research may clarify this ambiguity.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that amygclala reactivity in
   anticipation of receiving negative social information may represent a
   key component of the neural mechanisms underlying the heightened anxiety
   present in avoidant patients. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Microstructure of frontoparietal connections predicts individual

Abstract = {{Sleep deprivation (SD) can degrade cognitive functioning, but growing
   evidence suggests that there are large individual differences in the
   vulnerability to this effect. Some evidence suggests that baseline
   differences in the responsiveness of a fronto-parietal attention system
   that is activated during working memory (WM) tasks may be associated
   with the ability to sustain vigilance during sleep deprivation. However,
   the neurocircuitry underlying this network remains virtually unexplored.
   In this study, we employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate
   the association between the microstructure of the axonal pathway
   connecting the frontal and parietal regions-i.e., the superior
   longitudinal fasciculus (SLF)-and individual resistance to SD. Thirty
   healthy participants (15 males) aged 20-43 years underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at
   rested wakefulness prior to a 28-hour period of SD. Task-related
   fronto-parietal fMRI activation clusters during a Sternberg WM Task were
   localized and used as seed regions for probabilistic fiber tractography.
   DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial
   and radial diffusivity were measured in the SLF. The psychomotor
   vigilance test (PVT) was used to evaluate resistance to SD. We found
   that activation in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) positively correlated with
   resistance. Higher fractional anisotropy of the left SLF comprising the
   primary axons connecting IPL and DLPFC was also associated with better
   resistance. These findings suggest that individual differences in
   resistance to SD are associated with the functional responsiveness of a
   fronto-parietal attention system and the microstructural properties of
   the axonal interconnections. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) commonly display
   deficits in emotion regulation, but findings in the area of social
   cognitive (e.g., theory of mind, ToM) capacities have been
   heterogeneous. The aims of the current study were to investigate
   differences between patients with BPD and controls in functional
   connectivity (1) between the emotion and ToM network and (2) in the
   default mode network (DMN). Functional magnetic resonance imaging was
   used to investigate 19 healthy controls and 17 patients with BPD at rest
   and during ToM processing. Functional coupling was analysed.
   Significantly decreased functional connectivity was found for patients
   compared with controls between anterior cingulate cortex and three brain
   areas involved in ToM processes: the left superior temporal lobe, right
   supramarginal/inferior parietal lobes, and right middle cingulate
   cortex. Increased functional connectivity was found in patients compared
   with controls between the precuneus as the DMN seed and the left
   inferior frontal lobe, left precentral/middle frontal, and left middle
   occipital/superior parietal lobes during rest. Reduced functional
   coupling between the emotional and the ToM network during ToM processing
   is in line with emotion-regulation dysfunctions in BPD. The increased
   connectivity between precuneus and frontal regions during rest might be
   related to extensive processing of internal thoughts and
   self-referential information in BPD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Patients with mania show alterations of social behaviour.
   Neuropsychological studies in euthymic bipolar disorder (BD) have
   revealed deficits in cognitive, but not emotional aspects of social
   cognition (SC). Here, we studied the neural signature of social stimulus
   processing in mania. We expected alterations in regions associated with
   cognitive SC (dorsal-medial prefrontal cortex, dMPFC). Participants
   comprised 14 manic patients and 14 matched healthy controls who viewed
   standardized pictures with social and non-social content during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Region-of-interest-analyses focused on areas related to SC
   (dorsal/ventral medial prefrontal cortex; temporo-parietal junction),
   determined by a quantitative meta analysis, Between group comparisons
   ('social > non-social') revealed reduced BOLD responses in the right
   dMPFC in manic patients, but no significant group difference in the
   ventral MPFC. In addition, manic patients showed elevated BOLD
   activation in the right temporo-parietal junction during perception of
   social stimuli, which was correlated with increased delusional ideation.
   Patients with mania show diminished BOLD responses to social stimuli in
   the right dMPFC, associated with cognitive SC and this may be related to
   reported deficits in understanding others' mental states. At the same
   Lime, manic patients show hyperactivation of the right temporo-parietal
   junction, likely related to exaggerated attribution of meaning to social
   stimuli. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Musical training has been shown to have positive effects on several

Abstract = {{Most of human daily social interactions rely on the ability to
   successfully recognize faces. Yet similar to 2\% of the human population
   suffers from face blindness without any acquired brain damage {[} this
   is also known as developmental prosopagnosia (DP) or congenital
   prosopagnosia]). Despite the presence of severe behavioral face
   recognition deficits, surprisingly, a majority of DP individuals exhibit
   normal face selectivity in the right fusiform face area (FFA), a key
   brain region involved in face configural processing. This finding,
   together with evidence showing impairments downstream from the right FFA
   in DP individuals, has led some to argue that perhaps the right FFA is
   largely intact in DP individuals. Using fMRI multivoxel pattern
   analysis, here we report the discovery of a neural impairment in the
   right FFA of DP individuals that may play a critical role in mediating
   their face-processing deficits. In seven individuals with DP, we
   discovered that, despite the right FFA's preference for faces and it
   showing decoding for the different face parts, it exhibited impaired
   face configural decoding and did not contain distinct neural response
   patterns for the intact and the scrambled face configurations. This
   abnormality was not present throughout the ventral visual cortex, as
   normal neural decoding was found in an adjacent object-processing
   region. To our knowledge, this is the first direct neural evidence
   showing impaired face configural processing in the right FFA in
   individuals with DP. The discovery of this neural impairment provides a
   new clue to our understanding of the neural basis of DP.}},

Abstract = {{When watching another person's actions, a network of sensorimotor brain
   regions, collectively termed the action observation network (AON), is
   engaged. Previous research suggests that the AON is more responsive when
   watching familiar compared with unfamiliar actions. However, most
   research into AON function is premised on comparisons of AON engagement
   during different types of task using univariate, magnitude- based
   approaches. To better understand the relationship between action
   familiarity and AON engagement, here we examine how observed movement
   familiarity modulates AON activity in humans using dynamic causal
   modeling, a type of effective connectivity analysis. Twenty- one
   subjects underwent fMRI scanning while viewing whole- body dance
   movements that varied in terms of their familiarity. Participants' task
   was to either predict the next posture the dancer's body would assume or
   to respond to a nonaction- related attentional control question. To
   assess individuals' familiarity with each movement, participants rated
   each video on a measure of visual familiarity after being scanned.
   Parametric analyses showed more activity in left middle temporal gyrus,
   inferior parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus as videos were
   rated as increasingly familiar. These clusters of activity formed the
   regions of interest for dynamic causal modeling analyses, which revealed
   attenuation of effective connectivity bidirectionally between parietal
   and temporalAONnodes when participants observed videos they rated as
   increasingly familiar. As such, the findings provide partial support for
   a predictive coding model of the AON, as well as illuminate how action
   familiarity manipulations can be used to explore simulation based
   accounts of action understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying potentially unique features of the human cerebral cortex is
   a first step to understanding how evolution has shaped the brain in our
   species. By analyzing MR images obtained from 177 humans and 73
   chimpanzees, we observed a human-specific asymmetry in the superior
   temporal sulcus at the heart of the communication regions and which we
   have named the ``superior temporal asymmetrical pit{''} (STAP). This
   45-mm-long segment ventral to Heschl's gyrus is deeper in the right
   hemisphere than in the left in 95\% of typical human subjects, from
   infanthood till adulthood, and is present, irrespective of handedness,
   language lateralization, and sex although it is greater in males than in
   females. The STAP also is seen in several groups of atypical subjects
   including persons with situs inversus, autistic spectrum disorder,
   Turner syndrome, and corpus callosum agenesis. It is explained in part
   by the larger number of sulcal interruptions in the left than in the
   right hemisphere. Its early presence in the infants of this study as
   well as in fetuses and premature infants suggests a strong genetic
   influence. Because this asymmetry is barely visible in chimpanzees, we
   recommend the STAP region during midgestation as an important phenotype
   to investigate asymmetrical variations of gene expression among the
   primate lineage. This genetic target may provide important insights
   regarding the evolution of the crucial cognitive abilities sustained by
   this sulcus in our species, namely communication and social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive evidence indicates that women outperform men in episodic
   memory tasks. Furthermore, women are known to evaluate emotional stimuli
   as more arousing than men. Because emotional arousal typically increases
   episodic memory formation, the females' memory advantage might be more
   pronounced for emotionally arousing information than for neutral
   information. Here, we report behavioral data from 3398 subjects, who
   performed picture rating and memory tasks, and corresponding fMRI data
   from up to 696 subjects. We were interested in the interaction between
   sex and valence category on emotional appraisal, memory performances,
   and fMRI activity. The behavioral results showed that females evaluate
   in particular negative (p < 10(-16)) and positive (p = 2 x 10(-4)), but
   not neutral pictures, as emotionally more arousing (p(interaction) <
   10(-16)) than males. However, in the free recall females outperformed
   males not only in positive (p < 10(-16)) and negative (p < 5 x 10(-5)),
   but also in neutral picture recall (p < 3.4 x 10(-8)), with a particular
   advantage for positive pictures (p(interaction) < 4.4 x 10(-10)).
   Importantly, females' memory advantage during free recall was absent in
   a recognition setting. We identified activation differences in fMRI,
   which corresponded to the females' stronger appraisal of especially
   negative pictures, but no activation differences that reflected the
   interaction effect in the free recall memory task. In conclusion,
   females' valence-category-specific memory advantage is only observed in
   a free recall, but not a recognition setting and does not depend on
   females' higher emotional appraisal.}},

Abstract = {{The cerebral cortex of humans and macaques has specialized regions for
   processing faces and other visual stimulus categories. It is unknown
   whether a similar functional organization exists in New World monkeys,
   such as the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a species of growing
   interest as a primate model in neuroscience. To address this question,
   we measured selective neural responses in the brain of four awake
   marmosets trained to fix their gaze upon images of faces, bodies,
   objects, and control patterns. In two of the subjects, we measured high
   gamma-range field potentials from electrocorticography arrays implanted
   over a large portion of the occipital and inferotemporal cortex. In the
   other two subjects, we measured BOLD fMRI responses across the entire
   brain. Both techniques revealed robust, regionally specific patterns of
   category-selective neural responses. We report that at least six
   face-selective patches mark the occipitotemporal pathway of the
   marmoset, with the most anterior patches showing the strongest
   preference for faces over other stimuli. The similar appearance of these
   patches to previous findings in macaques and humans, including their
   apparent arrangement in two parallel pathways, suggests that core
   elements of the face processing network were present in the common
   anthropoid primate ancestor living similar to 35 million years ago. The
   findings also identify the marmoset as a viable animal model system for
   studying specialized neural mechanisms related to high-level social
   visual perception in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Learning induces plasticity in neuronal networks. As neuronal
   populations contribute to multiple representations, we reasoned
   plasticity in one representation might influence others. We used human
   fMRI repetition suppression to show that plasticity induced by learning
   another individual's values impacts upon a value representation for
   oneself in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a plasticity also evident
   behaviorally in a preference shift. We show this plasticity is driven by
   a striatal ``prediction error,'' signaling the discrepancy between the
   other's choice and a subject's own preferences. Thus, our data highlight
   that mPFC encodes agent-independent representations of subjective value,
   such that prediction errors simultaneously update multiple agents' value
   representations. As the resulting change in representational similarity
   predicts interindividual differences in the malleability of subjective
   preferences, our findings shed mechanistic light on complex human
   processes such as the powerful influence of social interaction on
   beliefs and preferences.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Previous functional MRI (fMRI) studies have demonstrated
   group differences in brain activity between deceptive and honest
   responses. The functional connectivity network related to lie-telling
   remains largely uncharacterized.
   Methods: In this study, we designed a lie-telling experiment that
   emphasized strategy devising. Thirty-two subjects underwent fMRI while
   responding to questions in a truthful, inverse, or deceitful manner. For
   each subject, whole-brain functional connectivity networks were
   constructed from correlations among brain regions for the lie-telling
   and truth-telling conditions. Then, a multivariate pattern analysis
   approach was used to distinguish lie-telling from truth-telling based on
   the functional connectivity networks.
   Results: The classification results demonstrated that lie-telling could
   be differentiated from truth-telling with an accuracy of 82.81\%
   (85.94\% for lie-telling, 79.69\% for truth-telling). The connectivities
   related to the fronto-parietal networks, cerebellum and
   cingulo-opercular networks are most discriminating, implying crucial
   roles for these three networks in the processing of deception.
   Conclusions: The current study may shed new light on the neural pattern
   of deception from a functional integration viewpoint.}},

Abstract = {{When social animals communicate, the onset of informative content in one
   modality varies considerably relative to the other, such as when visual
   orofacial movements precede a vocalization. These naturally occurring
   asynchronies do not disrupt intelligibility or perceptual coherence.
   However, they occur on time scales where they likely affect integrative
   neuronal activity in ways that have remained unclear, especially for
   hierarchically downstream regions in which neurons exhibit temporally
   imprecise but highly selective responses to communication signals. To
   address this, we exploited naturally occurring face- and voice-onset
   asynchronies in primate vocalizations. Using these as stimuli we
   recorded cortical oscillations and neuronal spiking responses from
   functional MRI (fMRI)-localized voice-sensitive cortex in the anterior
   temporal lobe of macaques. We show that the onset of the visual face
   stimulus resets the phase of low-frequency oscillations, and that the
   face- voice asynchrony affects the prominence of two key types of
   neuronal multisensory responses: enhancement or suppression. Our
   findings show a three-way association between temporal delays in
   audiovisual communication signals, phase-resetting of ongoing
   oscillations, and the sign of multisensory responses. The results reveal
   how natural onset asynchronies in cross-sensory inputs regulate network
   oscillations and neuronal excitability in the voice-sensitive cortex of
   macaques, a suggested animal model for human voice areas. These findings
   also advance predictions on the impact of multisensory input on neuronal
   processes in face areas and other brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{An imbalance in the neural motivational system may underlie Social
   Anxiety Disorder (SAD). This study examines social reward and punishment
   anticipation in SAD, predicting a valence-specific effect: increased
   striatal activity for punishment avoidance compared to obtaining a
   reward. Individuals with SAD (n = 20) and age, gender, and education
   case-matched controls (n = 20) participated in a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) study. During fMRI scanning, participants
   performed a Social Incentive Delay (SID) task to measure the
   anticipation of social reward and punishment. The left putamen (part of
   the striatum) showed a valence-specific interaction with group after
   correcting for medication use and comorbidity. The control group showed
   a relatively stronger activation for reward vs. punishment trials,
   compared to the social anxiety group. However, post-hoc pairwise
   comparisons were not significant, indicating that the effect is driven
   by a relative difference. A connectivity analysis (Psychophysiological
   interaction) further revealed a general salience effect: SAD patients
   showed decreased putamen-ACC connectivity compared to controls for both
   reward and punishment trials. Together these results suggest that the
   usual motivational preference for social reward is absent in SAD. In
   addition, cortical control processes during social incentive
   anticipation may be disrupted in SAD. These results provide initial
   evidence for altered striatal involvement in both valence-specific and
   valence-nonspecific processing of social incentives, and stress the
   relevance of taking motivational processes into account when studying
   social anxiety.}},

Title = {{An fMRI study of facial emotion processing in children and adolescents
   with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS, velo-cardio-facial
   syndrome {[}VCFS]) is a genetic disorder associated with interstitial
   deletions of chromosome 22q11.2. In addition to high rates of
   neuropsychiatric disorders, children with 22q11DS have impairments of
   face processing, as well as IQ-independent deficits in visuoperceptual
   function and social and abstract reasoning. These face-processing
   deficits may contribute to the social impairments of 22q11DS. However,
   their neurobiological basis is poorly understood.
   Methods: We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to examine neural responses when children with 22q11DS (aged 9-17
   years) and healthy controls (aged 8-17 years) incidentally processed
   neutral expressions and mild (50\%) and intense (100\%) expressions of
   fear and disgust. We included 28 right-handed children and adolescents:
   14 with 22q11DS and 14 healthy (including nine siblings) controls.
   Results: Within groups, contrasts showed that individuals significantly
   activated `face responsive' areas when viewing neutral faces, including
   fusiform-extrastriate cortices. Further, within both groups, there was a
   significant positive linear trend in activation of fusiform-extrastriate
   cortices and cerebellum to increasing intensities of fear. There were,
   however, also between-group differences. Children with 22q11DS generally
   showed reduced activity as compared to controls in brain regions
   involved in social cognition and emotion processing across emotion types
   and intensities, including fusiform-extrastriate cortices, anterior
   cingulate cortex (Brodmann area (BA) 24/32), and superomedial prefrontal
   cortices (BA 6). Also, an exploratory correlation analysis showed that
   within 22q11DS children reduced activation was associated with
   behavioural impairment-social difficulties (measured using the Total
   Difficulties Score from the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
   {[}SDQ]) were significantly negatively correlated with brain activity
   during fear and disgust processing (respectively) in the left precentral
   gyrus (BA 4) and in the left fusiform gyrus (FG, BA 19), right lingual
   gyrus (BA 18), and bilateral cerebellum.
   Conclusions: Regions involved in face processing, including
   fusiform-extrastriate cortices, anterior cingulate gyri, and
   superomedial prefrontal cortices (BA 6), are activated by facial
   expressions of fearful, disgusted, and neutral expressions in children
   with 22q11DS but generally to a lesser degree than in controls.
   Hypoactivation in these regions may partly explain the social
   impairments of children with 22q11DS.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{7-15}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT)
   facilitates various forms of sensitivity to others, but the mechanism by
   which OT enhances empathy in humans is unclear. In this study, we
   examined whether OT increases empathy by the way of blurring the
   distinction between self and other, or by enhancing the difference
   between self and other. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled,
   within-subject crossover design, empathic responses of healthy
   participants were compared when imagining oneself (i.e.,
   self-perspective empathy) versus when imagining the other (i.e.,
   other-perspective empathy) in painful and nonpainful situations. Under
   OT treatment, participants expressed more empathy when imagining others
   than when imagining oneself in pain. This was in contrast to the placebo
   condition where there were no differences between the empathic responses
   during the self- and the other-perspective. We propose that the
   modulatory effect of OT on empathy when taking the other-perspective may
   be mediated by its role in self- and other-distinctiveness and corollary
   by its role in increasing salience to social agents and cues.}},

Abstract = {{Although active listening is an influential behavior, which can affect
   the social responses of others, the neural correlates underlying its
   perception have remained unclear. Sensing active listening in social
   interactions is accompanied by an improvement in the recollected
   impressions of relevant experiences and is thought to arouse positive
   feelings. We therefore hypothesized that the recognition of active
   listening activates the reward system, and that the emotional appraisal
   of experiences that had been subject to active listening would be
   improved. To test these hypotheses, we conducted functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) on participants viewing assessments of their
   own personal experiences made by evaluators with or without active
   listening attitude. Subjects rated evaluators who showed active
   listening more positively. Furthermore, they rated episodes more
   positively when they were evaluated by individuals showing active
   listening. Neural activation in the ventral striatum was enhanced by
   perceiving active listening, suggesting that this was processed as
   rewarding. It also activated the right anterior insula, representing
   positive emotional reappraisal processes. Furthermore, the mentalizing
   network was activated when participants were being evaluated,
   irrespective of active listening behavior. Therefore, perceiving active
   listening appeared to result in positive emotional appraisal and to
   invoke mental state attribution to the active listener.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is consensus that the left hemisphere plays a critical
   role in language processing, some questions remain. Here we examine the
   influence of overt versus covert speech production on lateralization,
   the relationship between lateralization and behavioural measures of
   language performance and the strength of lateralization across the
   subcomponents of language. The present study used functional
   transcranial Doppler sonography (fTCD) to investigate lateralization of
   phonological and semantic fluency during both overt and covert word
   generation in right-handed adults. The laterality index (LI) was left
   lateralized in all conditions, and there was no difference in the
   strength of LI between overt and covert speech. This supports the
   validity of using overt speech in fTCD studies, another benefit of which
   is a reliable measure of speech production.}},

   be premature, as it is feared that the evidence could have a very
   persuasive effect on jurors. The current study assessed the veracity of
   these beliefs and explored whether this effect is more prominent amongst

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the paradox that while human music making evolved
   and spread in an environment where it could only occur in groups, it is
   now often apparently an enjoyable asocial phenomenon. Here I argue that
   music is, by definition, sound that we believe has been in some way
   organized by a human agent, meaning that listening to any musical sounds
   can be a social experience. There are a number of distinct mechanisms by
   which we might associate musical sound with agency. While some of these
   mechanisms involve learning motor associations with that sound, it is
   also possible to have a more direct relationship from musical sound to
   agency, and the relative importance of these potentially independent
   mechanisms should be further explored. Overall, I conclude that the
   apparent paradox of solipsistic musical engagement is in fact
   unproblematic, because the way that we perceive and experience musical
   sounds is inherently social.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{223-232}},
Abstract = {{Functional pathology of the default mode network is posited to be
   central to social-cognitive impairment in autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD). Altered functional connectivity of the default mode network's
   midline core may be a potential endophenotype for social deficits in
   ASD. Generalizability from prior studies is limited by inclusion of
   medicated participants and by methods favoring restricted examination of
   network function. This study measured resting-state functional
   connectivity in 22 8-13 year-old non-medicated children with ASD and 22
   typically developing controls using seed-based and network segregation
   functional connectivity methods. Relative to controls the ASD group
   showed both under-and over-functional connectivity within default mode
   and non default-mode regions, respectively. ASD symptoms correlated
   negatively with the connection strength of the default mode midline
   core-medial prefrontal cortex-posterior cingulate cortex. Network
   segregation analysis with the participation coefficient showed a higher
   area under the curve for the ASD group. Our findings demonstrate that
   the default mode network in ASD shows a pattern of poor segregation with
   both functional connectivity metrics. This study confirms the potential
   for the functional connection of the midline core as an endophenotype
   for social deficits. Poor segregation of the default mode network is
   consistent with an excitation/inhibition imbalance model of ASD. (C)

Title = {{Abnormalities in personal space and parietal-frontal function in
   schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{233-243}},
Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is associated with subtle abnormalities in day-to-day
   social behaviors, including a tendency in some patients to ``keep their
   distance{''} from others in physical space. The neural basis of this
   abnormality, and related changes in social functioning, is unknown. Here
   we examined, in schizophrenic patients and healthy control subjects, the
   functioning of a parietal-frontal network involved in monitoring the
   space immediately surrounding the body ({''}personal space{''}). Using
   fMRI, we found that one region of this network, the dorsal intraparietal
   sulcus (DIPS), was hyper-responsive in schizophrenic patients to face
   stimuli appearing to move towards the subjects, intruding into personal
   space. This hyper-responsivity was predicted both by the size of
   personal space (which was abnormally elevated in the schizophrenia
   group) and the severity of negative symptoms. In contrast, in a second
   study, the activity of two lower-level visual areas that send
   information to DIPS (the fusiform face area and middle temporal area)
   was normal in schizophrenia. Together, these findings suggest that
   changes in parietal-frontal networks that support the sensory-guided
   initiation of behavior, including actions occurring in the space
   surrounding the body, contribute to social dysfunction and negative
   symptoms in schizophrenia. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Affective mentalizing and brain activity at rest in the behavioral
   variant of frontotemporal dementia}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{484-497}},
Abstract = {{Background: bvFTD patients display an impairment in the attribution of
   cognitive and affective states to others, reflecting GM atrophy in brain
   regions associated with social cognition, such as amygdala, superior
   temporal cortex and posterior insula. Distinctive patterns of abnormal
   brain functioning at rest have been reported in bvFTD, but their
   relationship with defective attribution of affective states has not been
   investigated.
   Objective: To investigate the relationship among resting-state brain
   activity, gray matter ( GM) atrophy and the attribution of mental states
   in the behavioral variant of fronto-temporal degeneration ( bvFTD).
   Methods: We compared 12 bvFTD patients with 30 age-and education-matched
   healthy controls on a) performance in a task requiring the attribution
   of affective vs. cognitive mental states; b) metrics of resting-state
   activity in known functional networks; and c) the relationship between
   task-performances and resting state metrics. In addition, we assessed a
   connection between abnormal resting-state metrics and GM atrophy.
   Results: Compared with controls, bvFTD patients showed a reduction of
   intra-network coherent activity in several components, as well as
   decreased strength of activation in networks related to attentional
   processing. Anomalous resting-state activity involved networks which
   also displayed a significant reduction of GM density. In patients,
   compared with controls, higher affective mentalizing performance
   correlated with stronger functional connectivity between medial
   prefrontal sectors of the default-mode and attentional/performance
   monitoring networks, as well as with increased coherent activity in
   components of the executive, sensorimotor and fronto-limbic networks.
   Conclusions: Some of the observed effects may reflect specific
   compensatory mechanisms for the atrophic changes involving regions in
   charge of affective mentalizing. The analysis of specific resting-state
   networks thus highlights an intermediate level of analysis between
   abnormal brain structure and impaired behavioral performance in bvFTD,
   reflecting both dysfunction and compensation mechanisms. (C) 2015 The

Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{607-616}},
Abstract = {{Background: Dysconnectivity in schizophrenia can be understood in terms
   of dysfunctional integration of a distributed network of brain regions.
   Here we propose a new methodology to analyze complex networks based on
   semi-metric behavior, whereby higher levels of semi-metricity may
   represent a higher level of redundancy and dispersed communication. It
   was hypothesized that individuals with (increased risk for) psychotic
   disorder would have more semi-metric paths compared to controls and that
   this would be associated with symptoms.
   Methods: Resting-state functional MRI scans were obtained from 73
   patients with psychotic disorder, 83 unaffected siblings and 72
   controls. Semi-metric percentages (SMP) at the whole brain, hemispheric
   and lobar level were the dependent variables in a multilevel random
   regression analysis to investigate group differences. SMP was further
   examined in relation to symptomatology (i.e., psychotic/cognitive
   symptoms).
   Results: At the whole brain and hemispheric level, patients had a
   significantly higher SMP compared to siblings and controls, with no
   difference between the latter. In the combined sibling and control
   group, individuals with high schizotypy had intermediate SMP values in
   the left hemisphere with respect to patients and individuals with low
   schizotypy. Exploratory analyses in patients revealed higher SMP in 12
   out of 42 lobar divisions compared to controls, of which some were
   associated with worse PANSS symptomatology (i.e., positive symptoms,
   excitement and emotional distress) and worse cognitive performance on
   attention and emotion processing tasks. In the combined group of
   patients and controls, working memory, attention and social cognition
   were associated with higher SMP.
   Discussion: The results are suggestive of more dispersed network
   communication in patients with psychotic disorder, with some evidence
   for trait-based network alterations in high-schizotypy individuals.
   Dispersed communication may contribute to the clinical phenotype in
   psychotic disorder. In addition, higher SMP may contribute to neuro-and
   social cognition, independent of psychosis risk. (C) 2015 The Authors.

   activation during face processing in adolescents with autism}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{53-67}},
Abstract = {{Despite the impressive literature describing atypical neural activation
   in visuoperceptual face processing regions in autism, almost nothing is
   known about whether these perturbations extend to more affective regions
   in the circuitry and whether they bear any relationship to symptom
   severity or atypical behavior. Using fMRI, we compared face-, object-,
   and house-related activation in adolescent males with high-functioning
   autism (HFA) and typically developing (TD) matched controls. HFA
   adolescents exhibited hypo-activation throughout the core
   visuoperceptual regions, particularly in the right hemisphere, as well
   as in some of the affective/motivational face-processing regions,
   including the posterior cingulate cortex and right anterior temporal
   lobe. Conclusions about the relative hyper-or hypo-activation of the
   amygdala depended on the nature of the contrast that was used to define
   the activation. Individual differences in symptom severity predicted the
   magnitude of face activation, particularly in the right fusiform gyrus.
   Also, among the HFA adolescents, face recognition performance predicted
   the magnitude of face activation in the right anterior temporal lobe, a
   region that supports face individuation in TD adults. Our findings
   reveal a systematic relation between the magnitude of neural
   dysfunction, severity of autism symptoms, and variation in face
   recognition behavior in adolescents with autism. In so doing, we uncover
   brain-behavior relations that underlie one of the most prominent social
   deficits in autism and help resolve discrepancies in the literature. (C)

Title = {{Evoked itch perception is associated with changes in functional brain
   connectivity}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{213-221}},
Abstract = {{Chronic itch, a highly debilitating condition, has received relatively
   little attention in the neuroimaging literature. Recent studies suggest
   that brain regions supporting itch in chronic itch patients encompass
   sensorimotor and salience networks, and corticostriatal circuits
   involved in motor preparation for scratching. However, how these
   different brain areas interact with one another in the context of itch
   is still unknown. We acquired BOLD fMRI scans in 14 atopic dermatitis
   patients to investigate resting-state functional connectivity before and
   after allergen-induced itch exacerbated the clinical itch perception in
   these patients. A seed-based analysis revealed decreased functional
   connectivity from baseline resting state to the evoked-itch state
   between several itch related brain regions, particularly the insular and
   cingulate cortices and basal ganglia, where decreased connectivity was
   significantly correlated with increased levels of perceived itch. In
   contrast, evoked itch increased connectivity between key nodes of the
   frontoparietal control network (superior parietal lobule and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), where higher increase in connectivity
   was correlated with a lesser increase in perceived itch, suggesting that
   greater interaction between nodes of this executive attention network
   serves to limit itch sensation via enhanced top-down regulation.
   Overall, our results provide the first evidence of itch-dependent
   changes in functional connectivity across multiple brain regions. (C)

Title = {{Functional connectivity classification of autism identifies highly
   predictive brain features but falls short of biomarker standards}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{359-366}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are diagnosed based on
   early-manifesting clinical symptoms, including markedly impaired social
   communication. We assessed the viability of resting-state functional MR1
   (rs-IMRI) connectivity measures as diagnostic biomarkers for ASD and
   investigated which connectivity features are predictive of a diagnosis.
   Methods: Rs-fMRI scans from 59 high functioning males with ASD and 59
   age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) males were used to build a
   series of machine learning classifiers. Classification features were
   obtained using 3 sets of brain regions. Another set of classifiers was
   built from participants' scores on behavioral metrics. An additional age
   and IQ-matched cohort of 178 individuals (89 ASD; 89 TD) from the Autism
   Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) open-access dataset
   (http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrcorg/incli/abidc/) were included for
   replication.
   Results: High classification accuracy was achieved through several
   rs-IMRI methods (peak accuracy 76.67\%). However, classification via
   behavioral measures consistently surpassed rs-fMRI classifiers (peak
   accuracy 95.19\%). The class probability estimates, P(ASDIfMRI data),
   from brain-based classifiers significantly correlated with scores on a
   measure of social functioning, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), as
   did the most informative features from 2 of the 3 sets of brain-based
   features. The most informative connections predominantly originated from
   regions strongly associated with social functioning.
   Conclusions: While individuals can be classified as having ASD with
   statistically significant accuracy from their rs-fMRI scans alone, this
   method falls short of biomarker standards. Classification methods
   provided further evidence that ASD functional connectivity is
   characterized by dysfunction of large-scale functional networks,
   particularly those involved in social information processing. Published

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{678-687}},
Abstract = {{The current study is the first to use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to
   examine how individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD) process
   emotional facial expressions (EFEs). We expected that, compared to
   healthy controls (HCs), participants with SAD will show an early (<200
   ms post-stimulus) over-activation in the insula and the fusiform gyrus
   (FG, associated with the N170/M170 component), and later (>200 ms
   post-stimulus) overactivation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC). Individuals with SAD (n = 12) and healthy controls (HCs, n =
   12) were presented with photographs of facial displays during MEG
   recording. As compared to the HC group, the SAD group showed a reduced
   M170 (right FG under-activation around 130-200ms); early reduced
   activation in the right insula, and lower insular sensitivity to the
   type of EFE displayed. In addition, the SAD group showed a late
   over-activation in the right DLPFC. This unique EFE processing pattern
   in SAD suggests an early under-activation of cortical areas, possibly
   related to reduced emphasis on high spatial frequency information and
   greater early emphasis on low spatial frequency information. The late
   DLPFC over-activation in the SAD group may correlate to failures of
   cognitive control in this disorder. The importance of a temporal
   perspective for the understanding of facial processing in
   psychopathology is underlined. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{Developmental changes in large-scale network connectivity in autism}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{732-741}},
Abstract = {{Background: Disrupted cortical connectivity is thought to underlie the
   complex cognitive and behavior profile observed in individuals with
   autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous neuroimaging research has
   identified patterns of both functional hypo-and hyper-connectivity in
   individuals with ASD. A recent theory attempting to reconcile
   conflicting results in the literature proposes that hyper-connectivity
   of brain networks may be more characteristic of young children with ASD,
   while hypo-connectivity may be more prevalent in adolescents and adults
   with the disorder when compared to typical development (TD) (Uddin et
   al., 2013). Previous work has examined only young children, mixed groups
   of children and adolescents, or adult cohorts in separate studies,
   leaving open the question of developmental influences on functional
   brain connectivity in ASD.
   Methods: The current study tests this developmental hypothesis by
   examining within-and between-network resting state functional
   connectivity in a large sample of 26 children, 28 adolescents, and 18
   adults with ASD and age-and IQ-matchedTD individuals for the first time
   using an entirely data-driven approach. Independent component analyses
   (ICA) and dual regression was applied to data from three age cohorts to
   examine the effects of participant age on patterns of within-network
   whole-brain functional connectivity in individuals with ASD compared
   with TD individuals. Between-network connectivity differences were
   examined for each age cohort by comparing correlations between ICA
   components across groups.
   Results: We find that in the youngest cohort (age 11 and under),
   children with ASD exhibit hyper-connectivity within large-scale brain
   networks as well as decreased between-network connectivity compared with
   age-matched TD children. In contrast, adolescents with ASD (age 11-18)
   do not differ from TD adolescents in within-network connectivity, yet
   show decreased between-network connectivity compared with TD
   adolescents. Adults with ASD show no within-or between-network
   differences in functional network connectivity compared with
   neurotypical age-matched individuals.
   Conclusions: Characterizing within-and between-network functional
   connectivity in age-stratified cohorts of individuals with ASD and TD
   individuals demonstrates that functional connectivity atypicalities in
   the disorder are not uniform across the lifespan. These results
   demonstrate how explicitly characterizing participant age and adopting a
   developmental perspective can lead to a more nuanced understanding of
   atypicalities of functional brain connectivity in autism. (C) 2015 The

Title = {{Brain activation during self- and other-reflection in bipolar disorder
   with a history of psychosis: Comparison to schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{202-209}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Reflecting on the self and on others activates specific
   brain areas and contributes to metacognition and social cognition. The
   aim of the current study is to investigate brain activation during
   self-and other-reflection in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In
   addition, we examined whether potential abnormal brain activation in BD
   patients could distinguish BD from patients with schizophrenia (SZ).
   Methods: During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 17 BD
   patients, 17 SZ patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs) performed a
   self-reflection task. The task consisted of sentences divided into three
   conditions: self-reflection, other-reflection and semantic control.
   Results: BD patients showed less activation in the posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC) extending to the precuneus during other-reflection compared
   to HCs (p = 0.028 FWE corrected on cluster-level within the regions of
   interest). In SZ patients, the level of activation in this area was in
   between BD patients and HCs, with no significant differences between
   patients with SZ and BD. There were no group differences in brain
   activation during self-reflection. Moreover, there was a positive
   correlation between the PCC/precuneus activation during other-reflection
   and cognitive insight in SZ patients, but not in BD patients.
   Conclusions: BD patients showed less activation in the PCC/precuneus
   during other-reflection. This-may support an account of impaired
   integration of emotion and memory (evaluation of past and current
   other-related information) in BD patients. Correlation differences of
   the PCC/precuneus activation with the cognitive insight in patients with
   BD and SZ might reflect an important difference between these disorders,
   which may help to further explore potentially distinguishing markers.

Title = {{An unbiased Bayesian approach to functional connectomics implicates
   social-communication networks in autism}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},

Pages = {{356-366}},
Abstract = {{Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies
   reveal a complex pattern of hyper- and hypo-connectivity in children
   with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Whereas rsfMRI findings tend to
   implicate the default mode network and subcortical areas in ASD, task
   fMRI and behavioral experiments point to social dysfunction as a
   unifying impairment of the disorder. Here, we leverage a novel Bayesian
   framework for whole-brain functional connectomics that aggregates
   population differences in connectivity to localize a subset of foci that
   are most affected by ASD. Our approach is entirely data-driven and does
   not impose spatial constraints on the region foci or dictate the
   trajectory of altered functional pathways. We apply our method to data
   from the openly shared Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and
   pinpoint two intrinsic functional networks that distinguish ASD patients
   from typically developing controls. One network involves foci in the
   right temporal pole, left posterior cingulate cortex, left supramarginal
   gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus. Automated decoding of this
   network by the Neurosynth meta-analytic database suggests high-level
   concepts of ``language{''} and ``comprehension{''} as the likely
   functional correlates. The second network consists of the left banks of
   the superior temporal sulcus, right posterior superior temporal sulcus
   extending into temporo-parietal junction, and right middle temporal
   gyrus. Associated functionality of these regions includes ``social{''}
   and ``person{''}. The abnormal pathways emanating from the above foci
   indicate that ASD patients simultaneously exhibit reduced long-range or
   interhemispheric connectivity and increased short-range or
   intra-hemispheric connectivity. Our findings reveal new insights into
   ASD and highlight possible neural mechanisms of the disorder. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{It has been reported that a functional near-infrared spectroscopy
   (fNIRS) signal can be contaminated by extracerebral contributions. Many
   algorithms using multidistance separations to address this issue have
   been proposed, but their spatial separation performance has rarely been
   validated with simultaneous measurements of fNIRS and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We previously proposed a method for
   discriminating between deep and shallow contributions in fNIRS signals,
   referred to as the multidistance independent component analysis (MD-ICA)
   method. In this study, to validate the MD-ICA method from the spatial
   aspect, multidistance fNIRS, fMRI, and laser-Doppler-flowmetry signals
   were simultaneously obtained for 12 healthy adult males during three
   tasks. The fNIRS signal was separated into deep and shallow signals by
   using the MD-ICA method, and the correlation between the waveforms of
   the separated fNIRS signals and the gray matter blood oxygenation
   level-dependent signals was analyzed. A three-way analysis of variance
   (signal depth x Hb kind x task) indicated that the main effect of fNIRS
   signal depth on the correlation is significant {[}F(1,286) = 5.34, p <
   0.05]. This result indicates that the MD-ICA method successfully
   separates fNIRS signals into spatially deep and shallow signals, and the
   accuracy and reliability of the fNIRS signal will be improved with the
   method. (C) The Authors.}},

Journal = {{NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{322-330}},
Abstract = {{Background: Leukoaraiosis (LA) patients may suffer from sensorimotor
   dysfunctions. The relationship between behavioral disturbances and
   changes in the sensorimotor network (SMN) has not been thoroughly
   elucidated. Objective: This study investigated the hypothesized
   breakdown of communication of SMN and its behavioral consequences in LA.
   Methods: Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images,
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) and behavioral
   data were collected from 30 LA patients and 26 healthy individuals
   (normal controls, NC). The subjects were grouped according to LA
   severity, as indicated by their FLAIR images. Group independent
   component analysis was applied to the fMRI data to map the functional
   connectivity of SMN for NC and LA patients. A whole-brain, voxel-wise
   analysis was employed to investigate the functional connectivity
   alteration of SMN in LA. The relationships between LA severity,
   functional connectivity alteration of the SMN and behavioral clinical
   symptoms were examined by correlation analysis. Results: The right
   cingulate motor area (rCMA), left posterior insula and left ventral
   premotor area showed attenuated functional connectivity in the LA
   patients. The extent of the attenuation was related to the severity of
   the disease. Furthermore, the attenuation in the rCMA was associated
   with worse sensorimotor integration performance. Conclusions: These
   results suggest that LA impairs sensorinnotor integration by interfering
   with the communication or coordination of these aforementioned regions
   related to the SMN. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Aims: (1) To determine the brain regions activated by dentoalveolar
   pressure stimulation in persistent dentoalveolar pain disorder (PDAP)
   patients, and (2) to compare these activation patterns to those seen in
   pain-free control subjects. Methods: A total of 13 PDAP patients and 13
   matched controls completed the study. Clinical pain characteristics and
   psychosocial data were collected. Dentoalveolar mechanical pain
   thresholds were determined with a custom-made device over the painful
   area for patients and were used as the stimulation level during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquisition. Control
   subjects received two stimulation levels over matched locations during
   fMRI scanning: one determined (as above) that evoked equally subjective
   pain ratings matching those of patients (subjective-pain match) and
   another nonpainful stimulation level matching the average stimulus
   intensity provided to patients (stimulus-intensity match). Clinical and
   psychosocial data were analyzed using independent samples t tests,
   Mann-Whitney U test, and Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient.
   fMRI data were analyzed using validated neuroimaging software and tested
   using a general linear model. Results: PDAP patients had greater anxiety
   (P <.0001) and depression scores (P =.001), more jaw function impairment
   (P <.0001), and greater social impact (P <.0001) than controls. No
   significant differences were found for brain activation spatial extent
   (PDAP X Controls subjective pain: P =.48; PDAP X Controls stimulus
   intensity: P =.12). Brain activations were significantly increased for
   PDAP patients compared to control subjects when matched to stimulus
   intensity in several regions related to the sensory-discriminative and
   cognitive components of pain perception, including the primary and
   secondary somatosensory cortices, inferior parietal lobule, insula,
   premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and thalamus. When matched to
   subjective pain ratings, increased brain activations were still present
   for PDAP patients compared to controls, although to a lesser extent.
   Conclusion: The present results suggest that dentoalveolar pressure is
   processed differently in the brain of PDAP patients, and the increased
   activation in several brain areas is consistent with amplified pain
   processing.}},

Title = {{Greater amygdala activity and dorsomedial prefrontal-amygdala coupling
   are associated with enhanced inflammatory responses to stress}},

Abstract = {{Psychological stress is implicated in the etiology of many common
   chronic diseases and mental health disorders. Recent research suggests
   that inflammation may be a key biological mediator linking stress and
   health. Nevertheless, the neurocognitive pathways underlying
   stress-related increases in inflammatory activity are largely unknown.
   The present study thus examined associations between neural and
   inflammatory responses to an acute laboratory-based social stressor.
   Healthy female participants (n = 31) were exposed to a brief episode of
   stress while they underwent an fMRI scan. Blood samples were taken
   before and after the stressor, and plasma was assayed for markers of
   inflammatory activity. Exposure to the stressor was associated with
   significant increases in feelings of social evaluation and rejection,
   and with increases in levels of inflammation. Analyses linking the
   neural and inflammatory data revealed that heightened neural activity in
   the amygdala in response to the stressor was associated with greater
   increases in inflammation. Functional connectivity analyses indicated
   that individuals who showed stronger coupling between the amygdala and
   the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) also showed a heightened
   inflammatory response to the stressor. Interestingly, activity in a
   different set of neural regions was related to increases in feelings of
   social rejection. These data show that greater amygdala activity in
   response to a stressor, as well as tighter coupling between the amygdala
   and the DMPFC, are associated with greater increases in inflammatory
   activity. Results from this study begin to identify neural mechanisms
   that might link stress with increased risk for inflammation-related
   disorders such as cardiovascular disease and depression. (C) 2014

   randomized trial}},
Journal = {{DRUG DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{3853-3862}},
Abstract = {{Background: Paracetamol's (APAP) mechanism of action suggests the
   implication of supraspinal structures but no neuroimaging study has been
   performed in humans.
   Methods and results: This randomized, double-blind, crossover,
   placebo-controlled trial in 17 healthy volunteers (NCT01562704) aimed to
   evaluate how APAP modulates pain-evoked functional magnetic resonance
   imaging signals. We used behavioral measures and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to investigate the response to experimental thermal
   stimuli with APAP or placebo administration. Region-of-interest analysis
   revealed that activity in response to noxious stimulation diminished
   with APAP compared to placebo in prefrontal cortices, insula, thalami,
   anterior cingulate cortex, and periaqueductal gray matter.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest an inhibitory effect of APAP on
   spinothalamic tracts leading to a decreased activation of higher
   structures, and a top-down influence on descending inhibition. Further
   binding and connectivity studies are needed to evaluate how APAP
   modulates pain, especially in the context of repeated administration to
   patients with pain.}},

Title = {{Diagnostic Prediction for Social Anxiety Disorder via Multivariate
   Pattern Analysis of the Regional Homogeneity}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Although decades of efforts have been spent studying the pathogenesis of
   social anxiety disorder (SAD), there are still no objective biological
   markers that could be reliably used to identify individuals with SAD.
   Studies using multivariate pattern analysis have shown the potential
   value in clinically diagnosing psychiatric disorders with neuroimaging
   data. We therefore examined the diagnostic potential of regional
   homogeneity (ReHo) underlying neural correlates of SAD using support
   vector machine (SVM), which has never been studied. Forty SAD patients
   and pairwise matched healthy controls were recruited and scanned by
   resting-state fMRI. The ReHo was calculated as synchronization of fMRI
   signals of nearest neighboring 27 voxels. A linear SVM was then adopted
   and allowed the classification of the two groups with diagnostic
   accuracy of ReHo that was 76.25\% (sensitivity = 70\%, and specificity =
   82.5\%, P <= 0.001). Regions showing different discriminating values
   between diagnostic groups were mainly located in default mode network,
   dorsal attention network, self-referential network, and sensory
   networks, while the left medial prefrontal cortex was identified with
   the highest weight. These results implicate that ReHo has good
   diagnostic potential in SAD, and thus may provide an initial step
   towards the possible use of whole brain local connectivity to inform the
   clinical evaluation.}},

   should enhance the negative effects of ostracism. We conducted a field
   experiment in a bar, exposing individuals to ostracism or inclusion
   using Cyberball on an iPad. Subjective intoxication, but not blood
   alcohol concentration, was associated with less distress for
   participants who were ostracized, and more distress in participants who
   were included. We conclude that alcohol reduces both the pain of
   ostracism and the pleasure of inclusion. Keywords: ostracism, alcohol,

Pages = {{4111-4122}},
Abstract = {{Recently, age-related changes in functional connectivity have gained
   more attention for investigating functional changes across development.
   In this study, we examine functional connectivity, as derived from
   resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI), in 90
   cortical and subcortical regions in two healthy groups in young
   adulthood (ages 18-28 years) and late adulthood (ages 63-73 years).
   Comparing the processes for constructing a functional network, we found
   that the network in young adulthood was more easily fully connected than
   that in late adulthood, indicating that the central regions, frontal
   lobe, parietal lobe and limbic lobe possibly occupy more resources in
   late adulthood. We confirmed that the brain in both young adulthood and
   late adulthood had a ``small-world{''} organization, and that there was
   a further loss of small-world characteristics in late adulthood.
   Additionally, we found that late adulthood exhibited a more social-like
   organization of the brain functional network than young adulthood.
   Furthermore, the connectivity density showed a general decrease in most
   brain areas, but only the temporal lobe and occipital lobe showed a
   decrease in connectivity strength in late adulthood. Conversely, the
   parietal lobe showed an increase in connectivity density in late
   adulthood. Our study provides additional support for elucidating the
   functional changes of the brain across development, and characterizing
   these changes will lead to a better understanding of the cognitive
   decline that occurs with advancing age.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research on aesthetic preferences demonstrates that people are
   more likely to judge a stimulus as pleasing if it is familiar. Although
   general familiarity and liking are related, it is less clear how motor
   familiarity, or embodiment, relates to a viewer's aesthetic appraisal.
   This study directly compared how learning to embody an action impacts
   the neural response when watching and aesthetically evaluating the same
   action. Twenty-two participants trained for 4 days on dance sequences.
   Each day they physically rehearsed one set of sequences, passively
   watched a second set, listened to the music of a third set, and a fourth
   set remained untrained. Functional MRI was obtained prior to and
   immediately following the training period, as were affective and
   physical ability ratings for each dance sequence. This approach enabled
   precise comparison of self-report methods of embodiment with nonbiased,
   empirical measures of action performance. Results suggest that after
   experience, participants most enjoy watching those dance sequences they
   danced or observed. Moreover, brain regions involved in mediating the
   aesthetic response shift from subcortical regions associated with
   dopaminergic reward processing to posterior temporal regions involved in
   processing multisensory integration, emotion, and biological motion.}},

Abstract = {{Frontotemporal dementia is an important neurodegenerative disorder of
   younger life led by profound emotional and social dysfunction. Here we
   used fMRI to assess brain mechanisms of music emotion processing in a
   cohort of patients with frontotemporal dementia (n=15) in relation to
   healthy age-matched individuals (n=11). In a passive-listening paradigm,
   we manipulated levels of emotion processing in simple arpeggio chords
   (mode versus dissonance) and emotion modality (music versus human
   emotional vocalizations). A complex profile of disease-associated
   functional alterations was identified with separable signatures of
   musical mode, emotion level, and emotion modality within a common,
   distributed brain network, including posterior and anterior superior
   temporal and inferior frontal cortices and dorsal brainstem effector
   nuclei. Separable functional signatures were identified post-hoc in
   patients with and without abnormal craving for music (musicophilia): a
   model for specific abnormal emotional behaviors in frontotemporal
   dementia. Our findings indicate the potential of music to delineate
   neural mechanisms of altered emotion processing in dementias, with
   implications for future disease tracking and therapeutic strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disorder,
   characterized by impairments in one's capacity for joint attention. In
   this study, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was applied to
   study the differences in activation and functional connectivity in the
   prefrontal cortex between children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
   and typically developing (TD) children. 21 ASD and 20 TD children were
   recruited to perform joint and non-joint attention tasks. Compared with
   TD children, children with ASD showed reduced activation and atypical
   functional connectivity pattern in the prefrontal cortex during joint
   attention. The atypical development of left prefrontal cortex might play
   an important role in social cognition defects of children with ASD. (C)

Abstract = {{We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the ability to cope in
   atypical or novel situations using tools. We hypothesized that two
   cognitive components support this ability: adaptive coordination (for
   adapting to situational demands) and cognitive inhibition (for
   inhibiting the incongruent actions afforded by tools). We had subjects
   choose novel tools for a given task or choose among familiar tools in an
   atypical situation, during which we examined cortical activation in
   their brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Neural
   activation during adaptive coordination was observed in the left lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus and sulcus, middle and
   medial frontal gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, precentral sulcus, inferior
   temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, the bilateral insula, anterior
   cingulate cortex, and the right callosal sulcus. Activation indicating
   cognitive inhibition was observed in the right middle and inferior
   frontal gyrus. These findings demonstrate that the left parietal region
   shapes basic action, whereas the right frontal region inhibits
   stereotypical action. The left frontal regions are thought to be linked
   to the processing of ambiguous actions and play key roles in
   coordinating actions, whereas other regions are involved in processing
   situational contexts. Our results may be important for understanding the
   neural systems underlying adaptability to daily social situations. (C)

Abstract = {{Both schizophrenia (SCZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are
   characterized by mentalizing problems and associated neural dysfunction
   of the social brain. However, the deficits in mental state attribution
   are somehow opposed: Whereas patients with SCZ tend to over-attribute
   intentions to agents and physical events ({''}hyper-intentionality{''}),
   patients with autism treat people as devoid of intentions
   ({''}hypo-intentionality{''}). Here we aimed to investigate whether this
   hypo-hyper-intentionality hypothesis can be supported by neural evidence
   during a mentalizing task. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI), we investigated the neural responses and functional connectivity
   during reading others intention. Scanning was performed in 23
   individuals with ASD, 18 with paranoid SCZ and 23 gender and IQ matched
   control subjects. Both clinical groups showed reduced brain activation
   compared to controls for the contrast intentional vs physical
   information processing in left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS)
   and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) for SCZ, and right pSTS in
   ASD. As predicted, these effects were caused in a group specific way:
   Relative increased activation for physical information processing in SCZ
   that was also correlated with positive PANNS score and relative
   decreased activation for intentional information processing in ASD.
   Additionally, we could demonstrate opposed connectivity patterns between
   the right pSTS and vMPFC in the clinical groups, ie, increased for SCZ,
   decreased for ASD. These findings represent opposed neural signatures in
   key regions of the social brain as predicted by the
   hyper-hypo-intentionality hypothesis.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{10-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Although numerous neuroimaging studies have examined what happens when
   individuals are instructed to regulate their emotions, we rarely receive
   such instruction in everyday life. This study sought to examine what
   underlies uninstructed modulation of negative affect by examining neural
   responses when `responding naturally' to negative stimuli-and for
   comparison-during instructed reappraisal of negative stimuli as well.
   Two analyses were conducted to identify how variability in negative
   affect related to neural responses when responding naturally. First, in
   a within-participant analysis, lower levels of self-reported negative
   affect on a given trial were associated with recruitment of dorsolateral
   and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC)-brain regions also active during
   instructed reappraisal-whereas higher levels of negative affect were
   associated with recruitment of the amygdala-a region that responded more
   strongly overall to negative than neutral stimuli. Second, in a
   between-participant analysis, lower levels of average self-reported
   negative affect were associated with recruitment of ventromedial PFC.
   These results suggest that uninstructed modulation of emotion involves a
   combination of two types of regulatory processes, with moment-to-moment
   modulation depending on prefrontal regions that support reappraisal and
   individual differences in modulation depending on ventromedial PFC, a
   region involved in fear extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Most theories of emotion hold that negative stimuli are threatening and
   aversive. Yet in everyday experiences some negative sights (e.g. car
   wrecks) attract curiosity, whereas others repel (e.g. a weapon pointed
   in our face). To examine the diversity in negative stimuli, we employed
   four classes of visual images (Direct Threat, Indirect Threat, Merely
   Negative and Neutral) in a set of behavioral and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging studies. Participants reliably discriminated between
   the images, evaluating Direct Threat stimuli most quickly, and Merely
   Negative images most slowly. Threat images evoked greater and earlier
   blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activations in the amygdala and
   periaqueductal gray, structures implicated in representing and
   responding to the motivational salience of stimuli. Conversely, the
   Merely Negative images evoked larger BOLD signal in the
   para-hippocampal, retrosplenial, and medial prefrontal cortices, regions
   which have been implicated in contextual association processing.
   Ventrolateral as well as medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices were
   activated by both threatening and Merely Negative images. In conclusion,
   negative visual stimuli can repel or attract scrutiny depending on their
   current threat potential, which is assessed by dynamic shifts in
   large-scale brain network activity.}},

Abstract = {{Trait impulsivity is characterized by behavioral disinhibition and rash
   decision-making that contribute to many maladaptive behaviors. Previous
   research demonstrates that trait impulsivity is related to the activity
   of brain regions underlying reward sensitivity and emotion regulation,
   but little is known about this relationship in the context of
   immediately available primary reward. This is unfortunate, as
   impulsivity in these contexts can lead to unhealthy behaviors, including
   poor food choices, dangerous drug use and risky sexual practices. In
   addition, little is known about the relationship between integration of
   reward and affective neurocircuitry, as measured by resting-state
   functional connectivity, and trait impulsivity in everyday life, as
   measured with a commonly used personality inventory. We therefore asked
   healthy adults to undergo a functional magnetic resonance imaging task
   in which they saw cues indicating the imminent oral administration of
   rewarding taste, as well as a resting-state scan. Trait impulsivity was
   associated with increased activation during anticipation of primary
   reward in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and amygdala.
   Additionally, resting-state functional connectivity between the ACC and
   the right amygdala was negatively correlated with trait impulsivity.
   These findings demonstrate that trait impulsivity is related not only to
   ACC-amygdala activation but also to how tightly coupled these regions
   are to one another.}},

Abstract = {{The tremendous variability within categories of human emotional
   experience receives little empirical attention. We hypothesized that
   atypical instances of emotion categories (e.g. pleasant fear of
   thrill-seeking) would be processed less efficiently than typical
   instances of emotion categories (e.g. unpleasant fear of violent threat)
   in large-scale brain networks. During a novel fMRI paradigm,
   participants immersed themselves in scenarios designed to induce
   atypical and typical experiences of fear, sadness or happiness (scenario
   immersion), and then focused on and rated the pleasant or unpleasant
   feeling that emerged (valence focus) in most trials. As predicted,
   reliably greater activity in the `default mode' network (including
   medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate) was observed for
   atypical (vs typical) emotional experiences during scenario immersion,
   suggesting atypical instances require greater conceptual processing to
   situate the socio-emotional experience. During valence focus, reliably
   greater activity was observed for atypical (vs typical) emotional
   experiences in the `salience' network (including anterior insula and
   anterior cingulate), suggesting atypical instances place greater demands
   on integrating shifting body signals with the sensory and social
   context. Consistent with emerging psychological construction approaches
   to emotion, these findings demonstrate that is it important to study the
   variability within common categories of emotional experience.}},

Abstract = {{It is not clear whether self-stimuli are processed by the brain as
   highly familiar overlearned stimuli or as self-specific stimuli. This
   study examined the neural processes underlying discrimination of one's
   own voice (OV) compared with a familiar voice (FV) using
   electrophysiological methods. Event-related potentials were recorded
   while healthy subjects (n = 15) listened passively to oddball sequences
   composed of recordings of the French vowel /a/ pronounced either by the
   participant her/himself, or by a familiar person or an unknown person.
   The results indicated that, although mismatch negativity displayed
   similar peak latency and amplitude in both conditions, the amplitude of
   the subsequent P3a was significantly smaller in response to OV compared
   with a FV. This study therefore indicated that fewer pre-attentional
   processes are involved in the discrimination of one's OV than in the
   discrimination of FVs.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares brain activation during causal attribution to three
   different loci, the self, another person and the situation; and further
   explores correlations with clinical scales (i.e. depression, anxiety and
   autism) in a typical population. While they underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, 20 participants read short sentences about
   another person ('someone') who engaged in behaviors with the participant
   or made comments about the participant. The participants then attributed
   these behaviors to three attribution loci: themselves, the other person
   or the situation. The results revealed common activation across the
   three attribution loci in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ),
   left posterior superior temporal sulcus, precuneus and right temporal
   pole (TP). Comparisons between the attribution loci revealed very little
   differences, except for increased activation of the right TP while
   making attributions to the situation compared with the self. In
   addition, when making attributions to the situation or other persons for
   negative events, there were reliable correlations between low activity
   in the left TPJ and high levels of anxiety and problematic social
   interaction in autism. The results indicate that attributions to
   different loci are based on the same underlying brain process, which
   might be atypical among persons with anxiety or autism symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is
   accompanied by abnormalities in brain functional connections. However,
   these findings are based on group comparisons, and, therefore, little is
   known about whether functional connections could be used in the
   diagnosis of an individual patient with SAD. Here, we explored the
   potential of the functional connectivity to be used for SAD diagnosis.
   Twenty patients with SAD and 20 healthy controls were scanned using
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The whole brain was
   divided into 116 regions based on automated anatomical labeling atlas.
   The functional connectivity between each pair of regions was computed
   using Pearson's correlation coefficient and used as classification
   feature. Multivariate pattern analysis was then used to classify
   patients from healthy controls. The pattern classifier was designed
   using linear support vector machine. Experimental results showed a
   correct classification rate of 82.5 \% (p < 0.001) with sensitivity of
   85.0 \% and specificity of 80.0 \%, using a leave-one-out
   cross-validation method. It was found that the consensus connections
   used to distinguish SAD were largely located within or across the
   default mode network, visual network, sensory-motor network, affective
   network, and cerebellar regions. Specifically, the right orbitofrontal
   region exhibited the highest weight in classification. The current study
   demonstrated that functional connectivity had good diagnostic potential
   for SAD, thus providing evidence for the possible use of whole brain
   functional connectivity as a complementary tool in clinical diagnosis.
   In addition, this study confirmed previous work and described novel
   pathophysiological mechanisms of SAD.}},

   increases in sensitivity. Participants were 77 heterosexual
   college-student couples who completed daily diary measures of previous
   night's sleep quality, as well as daily experiences of rejection and
   hurt feelings over a period of 7 days. During this time, participants
   also wore an actigraph in order to obtain objective measures of sleep
   quality and duration. The association between perceived rejection and
   hurt feelings was manifest only under conditions of poor sleep (lower
   quality and quantity). Results highlight the importance of sleep for
   coping with daily interpersonal events and improve understanding of
   intra-individual differences in sensitivity to rejection.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding dogs' perceptual experience of both conspecifics and
   humans is important to understand how dogs evolved and the nature of
   their relationships with humans and other dogs. Olfaction is believed to
   be dogs' most powerful and perhaps important sense and an obvious place
   to begin for the study of social cognition of conspecifics and humans.
   We used fMRI in a cohort of dogs (N=12) that had been trained to remain
   motionless while unsedated and unrestrained in the MRI. By presenting
   scents from humans and conspecifics, we aimed to identify the dimensions
   of dogs' responses to salient biological odors - whether they are based
   on species (dog or human), familiarity, or a specific combination of
   factors. We focused our analysis on the dog's caudate nucleus because of
   its well-known association with positive expectations and because of its
   clearly defined anatomical location. We hypothesized that if dogs'
   primary association to reward, whether it is based on food or social
   bonds, is to humans, then the human scents would activate the caudate
   more than the conspecific scents. Conversely, if the smell of
   conspecifics activated the caudate more than the smell of humans, dogs'
   association to reward would be stronger to their fellow canines. Five
   scents were presented (self, familiar human, strange human, familiar
   dog, strange dog). While the olfactory bulb/peduncle was activated to a
   similar degree by all the scents, the caudate was activated maximally to
   the familiar human. Importantly, the scent of the familiar human was not
   the handler, meaning that the caudate response differentiated the scent
   in the absence of the person being present. The caudate activation
   suggested that not only did the dogs discriminate that scent from the
   others, they had a positive association with it. This speaks to the
   power of the dog's sense of smell, and it provides important clues about
   the importance of humans in dogs' lives.

Abstract = {{Cannabis use can induce acute psychotic symptoms and increase the risk
   of schizophrenia. Impairments in inhibitory control and processing are
   known to occur both under the influence of cannabis and in
   schizophrenia. Whether cannabis-induced impairment in inhibitory
   processing is related to the acute induction of psychotic symptoms under
   its influence is unclear.
   We investigated the effects of acute oral administration of 10 mg of
   delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the main psychoactive
   ingredient of cannabis, on inhibitory control and regional brain
   activation during inhibitory processing in humans and examined whether
   these effects are related to the induction of psychotic symptoms under
   its influence using a repeated-measures, placebo-controlled,
   double-blind, within-subject design. We studied thirty-six healthy,
   English-speaking, right-handed men with minimal previous exposure to
   cannabis and other illicit drugs twice using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) while they performed a response inhibition
   (Go/No-Go) task. Relative to placebo, delta-9-THC caused transient
   psychotic symptoms, anxiety, intoxication and sedation, inhibition
   errors and impaired inhibition efficiency. Severity of psychotic
   symptoms was directly correlated with inhibition error frequency and
   inversely with inhibition efficiency under the influence of delta-9-THC.
   Delta-9-THC attenuated Left inferior frontal activation which was
   inversely correlated with the frequency of inhibition errors and
   severity of psychotic symptoms and positively with inhibition efficiency
   under its influence. These results provide experimental evidence that
   impairments in cognitive processes involved in the inhibitory control of
   thoughts and actions and inferior frontal function under the influence
   of cannabis may have a role in the emergence of transient psychotic
   symptoms under its influence. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All

Title = {{Fronto-limbic disconnection in bipolar disorder}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a severe, disabling and
   life-threatening illness. Disturbances in emotion and affective
   processing are core features of the disorder with affective instability
   being paralleled by mood-congruent biases in information processing that
   influence evaluative processes and social judgment. Several lines of
   evidence, coming from neuropsychological and imaging studies, suggest
   that disrupted neural connectivity could play a role in the mechanistic
   explanation of these cognitive and emotional symptoms. The aim of the
   present study is to investigate the effective connectivity in a sample
   of bipolar patients.
   Methods: Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) technique was used to study 52
   inpatients affected by bipolar disorders consecutively admitted to San
   Raffaele hospital in Milano and forty healthy subjects. A facematching
   task was used as activation paradigm.
   Results: Patients with BD showed a significantly reduced endogenous
   connectivity in the DLPFC to Amy connection. There was no significant
   group effect upon the endogenous connection from Amy to ACC, from ACC to
   Amy and from DLPFC to ACC.
   Conclusions: Both DLPFC and ACC are part of a network implicated in
   emotion regulation and share strong reciprocal connections with the
   amygdale. The pattern of abnormal or reduced connectivity between DLPFC
   and amygdala may reflect abnormal modulation of mood and emotion typical
   of bipolar patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of self-deception and impression-management}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{159-174}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Self-deception and impression-management comprise two types of
   deceptive, but generally socially acceptable behaviours, which are
   common in everyday life as well as being present in a number of
   psychiatric disorders. We sought to establish and dissociate the
   `normal' brain substrates of self-deception and impression-management.
   Twenty healthy participants underwent fMRI scanning at 3T whilst
   completing the `Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding' test under
   two conditions: `fake good', giving the most desirable impression
   possible and `fake bad' giving an undesirable impression.
   Impression-management scores were more malleable to manipulation via
   `faking' than self-deception scores. Response times to self-deception
   questions and `fake bad' instructions were significantly longer than to
   impression-management questions and `fake good' instructions
   respectively. Self-deception and impression-management manipulation and
   `faking bad' were associated with activation of medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vIPFC).
   Impression-management manipulation was additionally associated with
   activation of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left posterior
   middle temporal gyrus. `Faking bad' was additionally associated with
   activation of right vIPFC, left temporo-parietal junction and right
   cerebellum. There were no supra-threshold activations associated with
   `faking good'. Our neuroimaging data suggest that manipulating
   self-deception and impression-management and more specifically `faking
   bad' engages a common network comprising mPFC and left vIPFC. Shorter
   response times and lack of dissociable neural activations suggests that
   `faking good', particularly when it comes to impression-management, may
   be our most practiced `default' mode. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{183-192}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) has been implicated in
   studies of both executive and social functions. Recent meta-analyses
   suggest that vlPFC plays an important but little understood role in
   Theory of Mind (ToM). Converging neuropsychological and functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) evidence suggests that this may
   reflect inhibition of self-perspective. The present study adapted an
   extensively published ToM localizer to evaluate the role of vlPFC in
   inhibition of self-perspective. The classic false belief, false
   photograph vignettes that comprise the localizer were modified to
   generate high and low salience of self-perspective. Using a factorial
   design, the present study identified a behavioural and neural cost
   associated with having a highly salient self-perspective that was
   incongruent with the representational content. Importantly, vlPFC only
   differentiated between high versus low salience of self-perspective when
   representing mental state content. No difference was identified for
   non-mental representation. This result suggests that different control
   processes are required to represent competing mental and non-mental
   content. (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Loneliness is an unpleasant and distressing feeling that a person
   experiences when he/she perceives that his/her social relationships are
   lacking in someway, either quantitatively or qualitatively; this can be
   linked to anxiety, depression, and suicide risk. Previous studies have
   found that certain personality traits ( which are temporally stable and
   heritable) are predictors of loneliness. However, little empirical
   evidence is available on the brain structures associated with
   loneliness, as well as how personality traits impact the relationship
   between loneliness and brain structure. Thus, the current study used
   voxel-based morphometry to identify the brain structures underlying
   individual differences in loneliness ( as measured by the UCLA
   Loneliness Scale) in a large sample, and then, applied multiple
   mediation analyses to explore the nature of the influence of personality
   traits on the relationship between loneliness and brain structure. The
   results showed that lonely individuals had greater regional gray matter
   volume in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC), which might
   reflect immature functioning in terms of emotional regulation. More
   importantly, we found that neuroticism and extraversion partially
   mediated the relationship between the left DLPFC and loneliness. In
   summary, through morphometric and multiple mediation analyses, this
   paper further validates the influence of both neuroticism and
   extraversion on loneliness.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Communicative speech is a type of language use that involves
   goal-directed action targeted at another person based on social
   interactive knowledge. Previous studies regarding one's first language
   (L1) have treated the theory of mind system, which is associated with
   understanding others, and the sensorimotor system, which is associated
   with action simulation, as important contributors to communication.
   However, little is known about the neural basis of communication in a
   second language (L2), which is limited in terms of its use as a
   communication tool. In this fMRI study, we manipulated the type of
   speech (i.e., communication vs. description) and the type of language
   (L1 vs. L2) to identify the specific brain areas involved in L2
   communication. We also attempted to examine how the cortical mechanisms
   underlying L2 speech production are influenced by oral proficiency and
   anxiety regarding L2. Thirty native Japanese speakers who had learned
   English as an 12, performed communicative and descriptive
   speech-production tasks in both L1 and L2 while undergoing fMRI
   scanning. We found that the only the L2 communication task recruited the
   left posterior supramarginal gyrus (pSMG), which may be associated with
   the action simulation or prediction involved in generating goal-directed
   actions. Furthermore, the neural mechanisms underlying L2 communication,
   but not L2 description, were sensitive to both oral proficiency and
   anxiety levels; (a) activation in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG)
   increased as oral proficiency levels increased, and (b) activation in
   the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), including the left insula, decreased as
   L2 anxiety levels increased. These results reflect the successful
   retrieval of lexical information in a pragmatic context and an inability
   to monitor social behaviors due to anxiety. Taken together, the present
   results suggest that L2 communication relies on social skills and is
   mediated by anxiety and oral proficiency. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective The aim of this study is to investigate abnormal findings of
   social brain network in Korean children with autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) compared with typically developing children (TDC).
   Methods Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fiVIRI) was performed to
   examine brain activations during the processing of emotional faces
   (happy, fearful, and neutral) in 17 children with ASD, 24 TDC.
   Results When emotional face stimuli were given to children with ASD,
   various areas of the social brain relevant to social cognition showed
   reduced activation. Specifically, ASD children exhibited less activation
   in the right amygdala (AMY), right superior temporal sulcus (STS) and
   right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) than TDC group when fearful faces
   were shown. Activation of left insular cortex and right IFG in response
   to happy faces was less in the ASD group. Similar findings were also
   found in left superior insular gyrus and right insula in case of neutral
   stimulation.
   Conclusion These findings suggest that children with ASD have different
   processing of social and emotional experience at the neural level. In
   other words, the deficit of social cognition in ASD could be explained
   by the deterioration of the capacity for visual analysis of emotional
   faces, the subsequent inner imitation through mirror neuron system
   (MNS), and the ability to transmit it to the limbic system and to
   process the transmitted emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Psychological and behavioral economic theories have shown that people
   often make irrational and suboptimal decisions. To describe certain
   decisions, people often use words related to pain ({''}hurt,{''}
   ``painful{''}). Neuroscientific evidence suggests common overlap between
   systems involved in physical pain and decision-making. Yet no prior
   studies have explored whether a pharmacological intervention aimed at
   reducing physical pain could reduce the pain of decision-making. The
   current investigation filled this gap by assigning participants to
   consume the physical painkiller acetaminophen or placebo and then
   exposing them to situations known to produce cognitive dissonance
   (Experiment 1) or loss aversion (Experiment 2). Both experiments showed
   that acetaminophen reduced the pain of decision-making, as indicated by
   lower attitude change that accompanies cognitive dissonance and lower
   selling prices when selling personal possessions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease
   characterized by motor and nonmotor signs and symptoms. To date, many
   studies of PD have focused on its cardinal motor symptoms. To study the
   nonmotor signs of early PD, we investigated the reactions solicited by
   heat pain stimuli in early untreated PD patients without pain using
   fMRI. The activation patterns of contact heat stimuli (51 degrees C)
   were assessed in 14 patients and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy
   controls. Patients with PD showed significant decreases in activation of
   the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and insula compared with controls. In
   addition, a significant relationship between activation of the insula
   and STG and the pain scores was observed in healthy controls but not in
   PD. This study provided further support that the insula and STG are
   important parts of the somatosensory circuitry recruited during the
   period of pain. The hypoactivity of the STG and insula in PD implied
   that functions including affective, cognitive, and
   sensory-discriminative processes, which are associated with the insula
   and STG, were disturbed. This finding supports the view that leaving
   early PD untreated could be tied directly to central nervous system
   dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Successful social interaction hinges on accurate perception of emotional
   signals. These signals are typically conveyed multi-modally by the face
   and voice. Previous research has demonstrated uni-modal contrastive
   aftereffects for emotionally expressive faces or voices. Here we were
   interested in whether these aftereffects transfer across modality as
   theoretical models predict. We show that adaptation to facial
   expressions elicits significant auditory aftereffects. Adaptation to
   angry facial expressions caused ambiguous vocal stimuli drawn from an
   anger-fear morphed continuum to be perceived as less angry and more
   fearful relative to adaptation to fearful faces. In a second experiment,
   we demonstrate that these aftereffects are not dependent on learned
   face-voice congruence, i.e. adaptation to one facial identity
   transferred to an unmatched voice identity. Taken together, our findings
   provide support for a supra-modal representation of emotion and suggest
   further that identity and emotion may be processed independently from
   one another, at least at the supra-modal level of the processing
   hierarchy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nothing provides as strong a sense of self as seeing one's face.
   Nevertheless, it remains unknown how the brain processes the sense of
   self during the multisensory experience of looking at one's face in a
   mirror. Synchronized visuo-tactile stimulation on one's own and
   another's face, an experience that is akin to looking in the mirror but
   seeing another's face, causes the illusory experience of ownership over
   the other person's face and changes in self-recognition. Here, we
   investigate the neural correlates of this enfacement illusion using
   fMRI. We examine activity in the human brain as participants experience
   tactile stimulation delivered to their face, while observing either
   temporally synchronous or asynchronous tactile stimulation delivered to
   another's face on either a specularly congruent or incongruent location.
   Activity in the multisensory right temporo-parietal junction,
   intraparietal sulcus, and the unimodal inferior occipital gyrus showed
   an interaction between the synchronicity and the congruency of the
   stimulation and varied with the self-reported strength of the illusory
   experience, which was recorded after each stimulation block. Our results
   highlight the important interplay between unimodal and multimodal
   information processing for self-face recognition, and elucidate the
   neurobiological basis for the plasticity required for identifying with
   our continuously changing visual appearance.}},

Abstract = {{Obese adolescents suffer negative social experiences, but no studies
   have examined whether obesity is associated with dysfunction of the
   social brain or whether social brain abnormalities relate to
   disadvantageous traits and social decisions. We aimed at mapping
   functional activation differences in the brain circuitry of social
   decision making in adolescents with excess versus normal weight, and at
   examining whether these separate patterns correlate with
   reward/punishment sensitivity, disordered eating features, and
   behavioral decisions. In this fMRI study, 80 adolescents aged 12 to 18
   years old were classified in two groups based on age adjusted body mass
   index (BMI) percentiles: normal weight (n=44, BMI percentiles 5th-84th)
   and excess weight (n=36, BMI percentile85th). Participants were scanned
   while performing a social decision-making task (ultimatum game) in which
   they chose to accept or reject offers to split monetary stakes made by
   another peer. Offers varied in fairness (Fair vs. Unfair) but in all
   cases accepting meant both players win the money, whereas rejecting
   meant both lose it. We showed that adolescents with excess weight
   compared to controls display significantly decreased activation of
   anterior insula, anterior cingulate, and midbrain during decisions about
   Unfair versus Fair offers. Moreover, excess weight subjects show lower
   sensitivity to reward and more maturity fears, which correlate with
   insula activation. Indeed, blunted insula activation accounted for the
   relationship between maturity fears and acceptance of unfair offers.
   Excess weight adolescents have diminished activation of brain regions
   essential for affective tracking of social decision making, which
   accounts for the association between maturity fears and social
   decisions. Hum Brain Mapp, 36:-237, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Background. The growing social emergency represented by Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and the lack of medical treatments able to modify the
   disease course have kindled the interest in nonpharmacological
   therapies. Objective. We introduced a novel nonpharmacological approach
   for people with AD (PWA) named Multidimensional Stimulation group
   Therapy (MST) to improve PWA condition in different disease domains:
   cognition, behavior, and motor functioning. Methods. Enrolling 60 PWA in
   a mild to moderate stage of the disease, we evaluated the efficacy of
   MST with a randomized-controlled study. Neuropsychological and
   neurobehavioral measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) data were considered as outcome measures. Results. The following
   significant intervention-related changes were observed: reduction in
   Neuropsychiatric Inventory scale score, improvement in language and
   memory subscales of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive
   subscale, and increased fMRI activations in temporal brain areas, right
   insular cortex, and thalamus. Conclusions. Cognitive-behavioral and fMRI
   results support the notion that MST has significant effects in improving
   PWA cognitive-behavioral status by restoring neural functioning.}},

Pages = {{30-40}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss the possible
   explanations for deficits in social understanding evident in individuals
   with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A potential intervention technique
   is proposed that has not yet been examined in this population: viewing
   and drawing portraits. This portraiture-based intervention seeks to
   address some of the core issues set forth in each of the theories
   explaining impaired social functioning. Furthermore, this intervention
   is intended to specifically increase exposure to facial stimuli in a
   safe and controlled environment. Instructions about how to look closely
   at a social partner's face and how to glean salient emotional
   information from the facial expression displayed can be developed
   through a focused exploration of drawing and viewing portraits. Current
   techniques such as eye tracking and fMRI are discussed in the context of
   this proposed intervention.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews existing research about
   ASD and seeks to present a new proposal for an intervention using
   portraiture. First the paper discusses existing interventions and
   reviews the current research about potential causes/areas of deficiency
   in individuals on the spectrum. This paper subsequently proposes a new
   type of intervention and discusses the reasons underpinning its
   potential success in the context of existing research.
   Findings - This was a proposed study so no empirical findings have been
   reported. However, observations of individuals on the spectrum engaging
   with artwork are discussed in this paper.
   Originality/value - No other research or study has been proposed in
   current literature relating specifically to the use of portraits
   (looking at and creating) to help individuals with ASD.}},

Title = {{Neural substrates of inhibitory and emotional processing in adolescents
   with traumatic brain injury}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC REHABILITATION MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{321-333}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE: Disturbances of emotional regulation and social difficulties
   are common in children and adolescents with traumatic brain injury
   (TBI). Recent research suggests that developments within
   ``socio-emotional{''} brain systems during early adolescence and more
   protracted development of ``cognitive control{''} systems have
   implications for emotional and behavioral regulation during adolescence.
   However, few functional neuroimaging studies have directly examined the
   interaction of these neuropsychological processes in adolescents with
   TBI. The current study examined how affective processing might modulate
   inhibitory processing in an Emotional Go/NoGo paradigm.
   METHOD: The study uses a cross-sectional, age, gender, and maternal
   education matched design. A response inhibition paradigm (i.e., the
   Go/NoGo task with emotional faces) was used to examine
   emotional-cognition interaction in 11 adolescents with complicated mild
   to moderate TBI, at least 12 months post injury, and 14
   typically-developing (TD) adolescents using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants saw adult facial expressions of
   emotions (happy, sad, fearful, and angry) and were instructed to respond
   ({''}go{''}) on all expressions other than angry ({''}no-go{''}).
   RESULTS: Preliminary results (p = 0.001 uncorrected, cluster size = 50)
   showed higher levels of inhibition-related activation in TD adolescents
   than in adolescents with TBI in several brain regions including anterior
   cingulate and motor/premotor regions.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TBI in adolescence might alter
   brain activation patterns and interrupt the development of brain
   networks governing emotion-cognition interactions.}},

Title = {{Brain activation underlying turning in Parkinson's disease patients with
   and without freezing of gait: a virtual reality fMRI study}},
Journal = {{NPJ PARKINSONS DISEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Freezing of gait is a debilitating symptom affecting many
   patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), causing severe immobility and
   decreased quality of life. Turning is known to be the most common
   trigger for freezing and also causes the highest rates of falls.
   However, the pathophysiological basis for these effects is not well
   understood.
   METHODS: This study used a virtual reality paradigm in combination with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the neural correlates
   underlying turning in 17 PD patients with freezing of gait (FOG) and 10
   PD patients without FOG while off their dopaminergic medication.
   Participants used foot pedals to navigate a virtual environment, which
   allowed for blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses and footstep
   latencies to be compared between periods of straight ``walking{''} and
   periods of turning through 90 degrees. BOLD data were then analyzed
   using a mixed effects analysis.
   RESULTS: Within group similarities revealed that overall, PD patients
   with freezing relied heavily on cortical control to enable effective
   stepping with increased visual cortex activation during turning. Between
   groups differences showed that when turning, patients with freezing
   preferentially activated inferior frontal regions that have been
   implicated in the recruitment of a putative stopping network. In
   addition, freezers failed to activate premotor and superior parietal
   cortices. Finally, increased task-based functional connectivity was
   found in subcortical regions associated with gait and stopping within
   the freezers group during turning.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that an increased propensity towards
   stopping in combination with reduced sensorimotor integration may
   underlie the neurobiology of freezing of gait during turning.}},

Title = {{Lower prefrontal activation during emotion regulation in subjects at
   ultrahigh risk for psychosis: an fMRI-study}},
Journal = {{NPJ SCHIZOPHRENIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown that patients with schizophrenia
   experience difficulties with emotion regulation and activate prefrontal
   regions to a lesser extent during reappraisal of emotional information.
   It has been suggested that problems in emotion regulation might precede
   the onset of psychosis. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that also
   individuals at ultrahigh risk (UHR) for developing psychosis experience
   difficulties with emotion regulation.
   AIMS: The aim of the current study was to investigate whether
   individuals at UHR for developing psychosis show abnormal brain
   activation during reappraisal of negative pictures.
   METHODS: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we scanned
   15 UHR participants and 16 matched healthy controls while performing an
   emotion regulation task. During this task, participants had to
   reappraise their negative emotion elicited by International Affective
   Picture System pictures. Furthermore, the reported use of reappraisal
   was examined with the emotion regulation questionnaire (ERQ).
   RESULTS: Individuals at UHR for psychosis showed less activation in the
   left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during reappraisal compared with
   healthy controls. Furthermore, they reported less use of reappraisal in
   daily life (P = 0.01; 95\% CI (0.24-1.63)).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that dysfunctional emotion
   regulation may already occur in individuals at risk for psychosis. These
   regulation difficulties are underpinned by less ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex activation, and may result in high negative affect, lower social
   functioning, and high rates of psychotic symptoms.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Although research on theory of mind has strongly implicated the
   dorsomedial pFC (incuding medial BA 8 and BA 9), the unique
   contributions of medial pFC (MPFC; corresponding to medial BA 10) to
   mentalizing remain uncertain. The extant literature has considered the
   possibility that these regions may be specialized for self-related
   cognition or for reasoning about close others, but evidence for both
   accounts has been inconclusive. We propose a novel theoretical
   framework: MPFC selectively implements ``person-specific theories of
   mind{''} (ToM(p)) representing the unique, idiosyncratic traits or
   attributes of well-known individuals. To test this hypothesis, we used
   fMRI to assess MPFC responses in Democratic and Republican participants
   as they evaluated more or less subjectively well-known political
   figures. Consistent with the ToMp account, MPFC showed greater activity
   to subjectively well-known targets, irrespective of participants'
   reported feelings of closeness or similarity. MPFC also demonstrated
   greater activity on trials in which targets (whether politicians or
   oneself) were judged to be relatively idiosyncratic, making a generic
   theory of mind inapplicable. These results suggest that MPFC may
   supplement the generic theory of mind process, with which dorsomedial
   pFC has been associated, by contributing mentalizing capacities tuned to
   individuated representations of specific well-known others.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescent decision-making is a topic of great public and scientific
   interest. However, much of the neuroimaging research in this area
   contrasts only one facet of decision-making (e.g., neural responses to
   anticipation or receipt of monetary rewards). Few studies have directly
   examined the processes that occur immediately before making a decision
   between two options that have varied and unpredictable potential rewards
   and penalties. Understanding adolescent decision-making from this
   vantage point may prove critical to ameliorating risky behavior and
   improving developmental outcomes. In this study, participants aged 14-16
   years engaged in a driving simulation game while undergoing fMRI.
   Results indicated activity in ventral striatum preceded risky decisions
   and activity in right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) preceded safe
   decisions. Furthermore, participants who reported higher
   sensation-seeking and sensitivity to reward and punishment demonstrated
   lower rIFG activity during safe decisions. Finally, over successive
   games, rIFG activity preceding risky decisions decreased, whereas
   thalamus and caudate activity increased during positive feedback (taking
   a risk without crashing). These results indicate that regions
   traditionally associated with reward processing and inhibition not only
   drive risky decision-making in the moment but also contribute to
   learning about risk tradeoffs during adolescence.}},

Title = {{Representational Similarity of Social and Valence Information in the

Pages = {{73-82}},

Abstract = {{The human brain is remarkably adept at integrating complex information
   to form unified psychological representations of agents, objects, and
   events in the environment. Two domains in which this ability is
   particularly salient are the processing of social and valence
   information and are supported by common cortical areas in the medial pFC
   (MPFC). Because social information is often embedded within valenced
   emotional contexts, it is possible that activation patterns within the
   MPFC may represent both of these types of cognitive processes when
   presented simultaneously. The current study tested this possibility by
   employing a large-scale automated meta-analysis tool, together with
   multivoxel pattern analysis to investigate the representational
   similarity of social and valence information in the MPFC during fMRI.
   Using a representational similarity analysis, we found a high degree of
   representational similarity both within social dimensions and within
   valence dimensions, but not across them (e.g., positive social
   information was highly dissimilar to negative non-social information),
   in a ventral portion of the MPFC. These results were significantly
   correlated with a behaviorally measured similarity structure of the same
   stimuli, suggesting that a psychologically meaningful representation of
   social and valence information is reflected by multivoxel activation
   patterns in the ventral MPFC.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a period characterized by increased sensitivity to social
   cues, as well as increased risk-taking in the presence of peers. For
   example, automobile crashes are the leading cause of death for
   adolescents, and driving with peers increases the risk of a fatal crash.
   Growing evidence points to an interaction between neural systems
   implicated in cognitive control and social and emotional context in
   predicting adolescent risk. We tested such a relationship in recently
   licensed teen drivers. Participants completed an fMRI session in which
   neural activity was measured during a response inhibition task, followed
   by a separate driving simulator session 1 week later. Participants drove
   alone and with a peer who was randomly assigned to express
   risk-promoting or risk-averse social norms. The experimentally
   manipulated social context during the simulated drive moderated the
   relationship between individual differences in neural activity in the
   hypothesized cognitive control network (right inferior frontal gyrus,
   BG) and risk-taking in the driving context a week later. Increased
   activity in the response inhibition network was not associated with
   risk-taking in the presence of a risky peer but was significantly
   predictive of safer driving in the presence of a cautious peer, above
   and beyond self-reported susceptibility to peer pressure. Individual
   differences in recruitment of the response inhibition network may allow
   those with stronger inhibitory control to override risky tendencies when
   in the presence of cautious peers. This relationship between social
   context and individual differences in brain function expands our
   understanding of neural systems involved in top-down cognitive control
   during adolescent development.}},

Title = {{Social gating of sensory information during ongoing communication}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{189-198}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Social context plays an important role in human communication. Depending
   on the nature of the source, the same communication signal might be
   processed in fundamentally different ways. However, the selective
   modulation (or ``gating{''}) of the flow of neural information during
   communication is not fully understood. Here, we use multivoxel pattern
   analysis (MVPA) and multivoxel connectivity analysis (MVCA), a novel
   technique that allows to analyse context-dependent changes of the
   strength interregional coupling between ensembles of voxels, to examine
   how the human brain differentially gates content-specific sensory
   information during ongoing perception of communication signals. In a
   simulated electronic communication experiment, participants received two
   alternative text messages during fMRI ({''}happy{''} or ``sad{''}) which
   they believed had been sent either by their real-life friend outside the
   scanner or by a computer. A region in the dorsal medial prefrontal
   cortex (dmPFC) selectively increased its functional coupling with
   sensory-content encoding regions in the visual cortex when a text
   message was perceived as being sent by the participant's friend, and
   decreased its functional coupling with these regions when a text message
   was perceived as being sent by the computer. Furthermore, the strength
   of neural encoding of content-specific information of text messages in
   the dmPFC was modulated by the social tie between the participant and
   her friend: the more of her spare time a participant reported to spend
   with her friend the stronger was the neural encoding. This suggests that
   the human brain selectively gates sensory information into the relevant
   network for processing the mental states of others, depending on the
   source of the communication signal. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{326-335}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In social environments, it is crucial that decision-makers take account
   of the impact of their actions not only for oneself, but also on other
   social agents. Previous work has identified neural signals in the
   striatum encoding value-based prediction errors for outcomes to oneself;
   also, recent work suggests that neural activity in prefrontal cortex may
   similarly encode value-based prediction errors related to outcomes to
   others. However, prior work also indicates that social valuations are
   not isomorphic, with social value orientations of decision-makers
   ranging on a cooperative to competitive continuum; this variation has
   not been examined within social learning environments. Here, we combine
   a computational model of learning with functional neuroimaging to
   examine how individual differences in orientation impact neural
   mechanisms underlying `other-value' learning. Across four experimental
   conditions, reinforcement learning signals for other-value were
   identified in medial prefrontal cortex, and were distinct from
   self-value learning signals identified in striatum. Critically, the
   magnitude and direction of the other-value learning signal depended
   strongly on an individual's cooperative or competitive orientation
   toward others. These data indicate that social decisions are guided by a
   social orientation-dependent learning system that is computationally
   similar but anatomically distinct from self-value learning. The
   sensitivity of the medial prefrontal learning signal to social
   preferences suggests a mechanism linking such preferences to biases in
   social actions and highlights the importance of incorporating
   heterogeneous social predispositions in neurocomputational models of
   social behavior. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{336-346}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Does the processing of social category-related versus trait-related
   information generate a different pattern of brain activation? In this
   fMRI study, we compared the processing of behaviors performed by a
   member of a social category versus an individual, both possessing
   similar personality traits. Based on previous behavioral studies we
   predicted that the processing of social category-related information
   would recruit more activation in brain areas related to mentalizing than
   individual trait-related information. Participants read sentences
   describing behaviors performed by a member of a social category (of
   which the stereotype involves a given trait) or by an individual
   possessing the same trait. These behavioral sentences varied on both
   valence (positive versus negative) and consistency (consistent versus
   inconsistent) with regard to the social category or trait. The results
   revealed that social category-related behavioral information showed more
   activation in mentalizing areas (medial prefrontal cortex, anterior
   temporal lobe, bilateral temporo-parietal junction, posterior cingulate
   cortex) than trait-related information. This increased activation is
   interpreted in terms of the impact of autobiographical memories, greater
   variance among members of social categories than individual traits, a
   higher construal level (i.e., abstractness), and larger perceived group
   size. Additionally, inconsistent as opposed to consistent information
   showed more activation in the right temporo-parietal junction and left
   lingual gyrus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are characterised by deficits in
   understanding and expressing emotions and are frequently accompanied by
   alexithymia, a difficulty in understanding and expressing emotion words.
   Words are differentially represented in the brain according to their
   semantic category and these difficulties in ASC predict reduced
   activation to emotion-related words in limbic structures crucial for
   affective processing. Semantic theories view `emotion actions' as
   critical for learning the semantic relationship between a word and the
   emotion it describes, such that emotion words typically activate the
   cortical motor systems involved in expressing emotion actions such as
   facial expressions. As ASC are also characterised by motor deficits and
   atypical brain structure and function in these regions, motor structures
   would also be expected to show reduced activation during
   emotion-semantic processing. Here we used event-related fMRI to compare
   passive processing of emotion words in comparison to abstract verbs and
   animal names in typically-developing controls and individuals with ASC.
   Relatively reduced brain activation in ASC for emotion words, but not
   matched control words, was found in motor areas and cingulate cortex
   specifically. The degree of activation evoked by emotion words in the
   motor system was also associated with the extent of autistic traits as
   revealed by the Autism Spectrum Quotient. We suggest that hypoactivation
   of motor and limbic regions for emotion word processing may underlie
   difficulties in processing emotional language in ASC. The role that
   sensorimotor systems and their connections might play in the affective
   and social-communication difficulties in ASC is discussed. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Noninvasive functional imaging holds great promise for serving as a
   translational bridge between human and animal models of various
   neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, despite a depth of
   knowledge of the cellular and molecular underpinnings of atypical
   processes in mouse models, little is known about the large-scale
   functional architecture measured by functional brain imaging, limiting
   translation to human conditions. Here, we provide a robust processing
   pipeline to generate high-resolution, whole-brain resting-state
   functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) images in the mouse. Using a
   mesoscale structural connectome (i.e., an anterograde tracer mapping of
   axonal projections across the mouse CNS), we show that rs-fcMRI in the
   mouse has strong structural underpinnings, validating our procedures. We
   next directly showthat large-scale network properties previously
   identified in primates are present in rodents, although they differ in
   several ways. Last, we examine the existence of the so-called default
   mode network (DMN)-adistributed functional brain system identified in
   primates as being highly important for social cognition and overall
   brain function and atypically functionally connected across a multitude
   of disorders. We show the presence of a potential DMN in the mouse brain
   both structurally and functionally. Together, these studies confirm the
   presence of basic network properties and functional networks of high
   translational importance in structural and functional systems in the
   mouse brain. This work clears the way for an important bridge
   measurement between human and rodent models, enabling us to make
   stronger conclusions about how regionally specific cellular and
   molecular manipulations in mice relate back to humans.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, fMRI data are analyzed using statistical parametric
   mapping approaches. Regardless of the precise thresholding procedure,
   these approaches ultimately divide the brain in regions that do or do
   not differ significantly across experimental conditions. This binary
   classification scheme fosters the so-called imager's fallacy, where
   researchers prematurely conclude that region A is selectively involved
   in a certain cognitive task because activity in that region reaches
   statistical significance and activity in region B does not. For such a
   conclusion to be statistically valid, however, a test on the differences
   in activation across these two regions is required. Here we propose a
   simple GLM-based method that defines an ``in-between{''} category of
   brain regions that are neither significantly active nor inactive, but
   rather ``in limbo{''}. For regions that are in limbo, the activation
   pattern is inconclusive: it does not differ significantly from baseline,
   but neither does it differ significantly from regions that do show
   significant changes from baseline. This pattern indicates that
   measurement was insufficiently precise. By directly testing differences
   in activation, our procedure helps reduce the impact of the imager's
   fallacy. The method is illustrated using concrete examples.}},

Abstract = {{How can we understand each other during communicative interactions? An
   influential suggestion holds that communicators are primed by each
   other's behaviors, with associative mechanisms automatically
   coordinating the production of communicative signals and the
   comprehension of their meanings. An alternative suggestion posits that
   mutual understanding requires shared conceptualizations of a signal's
   use, i.e., ``conceptual pacts{''} that are abstracted away from specific
   experiences. Both accounts predict coherent neural dynamics across
   communicators, aligned either to the occurrence of a signal or to the
   dynamics of conceptual pacts. Using coherence spectral-density analysis
   of cerebral activity simultaneously measured in pairs of communicators,
   this study shows that establishing mutual understanding of novel signals
   synchronizes cerebral dynamics across communicators' right temporal
   lobes. This interpersonal cerebral coherence occurred only within pairs
   with a shared communicative history, and at temporal scales independent
   from signals' occurrences. These findings favor the notion that meaning
   emerges from shared conceptualizations of a signal's use.}},

Abstract = {{A community is a set of nodes with dense inter-connections, while there
   are sparse connections between different communities. A hub is a highly
   connected node with high centrality. It has been shown that both
   ``communities{''} and ``hubs{''} exist simultaneously in the brain's
   functional connectivity network (FCN), as estimated by correlations
   among low-frequency spontaneous fluctuations in functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) signal changes (0.01-0.10 Hz). This indicates
   that the brain has a spatial organization that promotes both segregation
   and integration of information. Here, we demonstrate that
   frequency-specific network topologies that characterize segregation and
   integration also exist within this frequency range. In investigating the
   coherence spectrum among 87 brain regions, we found that two frequency
   bands, 0.01-0.03 Hz (very low frequency {[}VLF] band) and 0.07-0.09 Hz
   (low frequency {[}LF] band), mainly contributed to functional
   connectivity. Comparing graph theoretical indices for the VLF and LF
   bands revealed that the network in the former had a higher capacity for
   information segregation between identified communities than the latter.
   Hubs in the VLF band were mainly located within the anterior cingulate
   cortices, whereas those in the LF band were located in the posterior
   cingulate cortices and thalamus. Thus, depending on the timescale of
   brain activity, at least two distinct network topologies contributed to
   information segregation and integration. This suggests that the brain
   intrinsically has timescale-dependent functional organizations.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Anthropomorphism encompasses the attribution of human characteristics to
   non-living objects. In particular the human tendency to see faces in
   cars has long been noticed, yet its neural correlates are unknown. We
   set out to investigate whether the fusiform face area (FFA) is
   associated with seeing human features in car fronts, or whether, the
   higher-level theory of mind network (ToM), namely temporoparietal
   junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) show a link to
   anthropomorphism. Twenty participants underwent fMRI scanning during a
   passive car-front viewing task. We extracted brain activity from FFA,
   TPJ and MPFC. After the fMRI session participants were asked to
   spontaneously list adjectives that characterize each car front. Five
   raters judged the degree to which each adjective can be applied as a
   characteristic of human beings. By means of linear mixed models we found
   that the implicit tendency to anthropomorphize individual car fronts
   predicts FFA, but not TPJ or MPFC activity. The results point to an
   important role of FFA in the phenomenon of ascribing human attributes to
   non-living objects. Interestingly, brain regions that have been
   associated with thinking about beliefs and mental states of others (TPJ,
   MPFC) do not seem to be related to anthropomorphism of car fronts.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Along with the development of distributed EEG source modeling methods,
   basic approaches to local brain activity (LBA-) neurofeedback (NF) have
   been suggested. Meanwhile several attempts using LORETA and sLORETA have
   been published. This article specifically reports on ``EEG-based
   LBA-feedback training{''} developed by Bauer et al. (2011). Local brain
   activity-feedback has the advantage over other sLORETA-based approaches
   in the way that feedback is exclusively controlled by EEG-generating
   sources within a selected cortical region of training (ROT): feedback is
   suspended if there is no source. In this way the influence of sources in
   the vicinity of the ROT is excluded. First applications have yielded
   promising results: aiming to enhance activity in left hemispheric
   linguistic areas, five experimental subjects increased significantly the
   feedback rate whereas five controls receiving sham feedback did not,
   both after 13 training runs (U-test, p < 0.01). Preliminary results of
   another study that aims to document effects of LBA-feedback training of
   the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) and Dorso-Lateral Prefrontal Cortex
   (DLPFC) by fMRI revealed more local ACC-activity after successful
   training (Radke et al., 2014).}},

Title = {{Lateralization of music processing auditory cortex: an fNIRS study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{The present study is to determine the effects of background noise on the
   hemispheric lateralization in music processing by exposing 14 subjects
   to four different auditory environments: music segments only, noise
   segments only, music + noise segments, and the entire music interfered
   by noise segments. The hemodynamic responses in both hemispheres caused
   by the perception of music in 10 different conditions were measured
   using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. As a feature to distinguish
   stimulus-evoked hemodynamics, the difference between the mean and the
   minimum value of the hemodynamic response for a given stimulus was used.
   The right-hemispheric lateralization in music processing was about 75\%
   (instead of continuous music, only music segments were heard). If the
   stimuli were only noises, the lateralization was about 65\%. But, if the
   music was mixed with noises, the right-hemispheric lateralization has
   increased. Particularly, if the noise was a little bit lower than the
   music (i.e., music level 10-15\%, noise level 10\%), the entire subjects
   showed the right-hemispheric lateralization: This is due to the
   subjects' effort to hear the music in the presence of noises. However,
   too much noise has reduced the subjects' discerning efforts.}},

Title = {{Steady-State BOLD Response Modulates Low Frequency Neural Oscillations}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Neural oscillations are the intrinsic characteristics of brain
   activities. Traditional electrophysiological techniques (e.g., the
   steady-state evoked potential, SSEP) have provided important insights
   into the mechanisms of neural oscillations in the high frequency ranges
   (>1 Hz). However, the neural oscillations within the low frequency
   ranges (<1 Hz) and deep brain areas are rarely examined. Based on the
   advantages of the low frequency blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
   fluctuations, we expected that the steady-state BOLD responses (SSBRs)
   would be elicited and modulate low frequency neural oscillations. Twenty
   six participants completed a simple reaction time task with the constant
   stimuli frequencies of 0.0625 Hz and 0.125 Hz. Power analysis and
   hemodynamic response function deconvolution method were used to extract
   SSBRs and recover neural level signals. The SSEP-like waveforms were
   observed at the whole brain level and at several task-related brain
   regions. Specifically, the harmonic phenomenon of SSBR was task-related
   and independent of the neurovascular coupling. These findings suggested
   that the SSBRs represent non-linear neural oscillations but not brain
   activations. In comparison with the conventional general linear model,
   the SSBRs provide us novel insights into the non-linear brain
   activities, low frequency neural oscillations, and neuroplasticity of
   brain training and cognitive activities.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of a multimodal intervention on
   spontaneous brain activity in healthy older adults. Seventeen older
   adults received a six-week intervention that consisted of cognitive
   training, Tai Chi exercise, and group counseling, while 17 older adults
   in a control group attended health knowledge lectures. The intervention
   group demonstrated enhanced memory and social support compared to the
   control group. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the
   middle frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and anterior cerebellum
   lobe was enhanced for the intervention group, while the control group
   showed reduced ALFF in these three regions. Moreover, changes in
   trail-making performance and well-being could be predicted by the
   intervention-induced changes in ALFF. Additionally, individual
   differences in the baseline ALFF were correlated with
   intervention-related changes in behavioral performance. These findings
   suggest that a multimodal intervention is effective in improving
   cognitive functions and well-being and can induce functional changes in
   the aging brain. The study extended previous training studies by
   suggesting resting-state ALFF as a marker of intervention-induced
   plasticity in older adults.}},

   Neurocognitive Markers of Autism}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Autism is a psychiatric/neurological condition in which alterations in
   social interaction (among other symptoms) are diagnosed by behavioral
   psychiatric methods. The main goal of this study was to determine how
   the neural representations and meanings of social concepts (such as to
   insult) are altered in autism. A second goal was to determine whether
   these alterations can serve as neurocognitive markers of autism. The
   approach is based on previous advances in fMRI analysis methods that
   permit (a) the identification of a concept, such as the thought of a
   physical object, from its fMRI pattern, and (b) the ability to assess
   the semantic content of a concept from its fMRI pattern. These factor
   analysis and machine learning methods were applied to the fMRI
   activation patterns of 17 adults with high-functioning autism and
   matched controls, scanned while thinking about 16 social interactions.
   One prominent neural representation factor that emerged (manifested
   mainly in posterior midline regions) was related to self-representation,
   but this factor was present only for the control participants, and was
   near-absent in the autism group. Moreover, machine learning algorithms
   classified individuals as autistic or control with 97\% accuracy from
   their fMRI neurocognitive markers. The findings suggest that psychiatric
   alterations of thought can begin to be biologically understood by
   assessing the form and content of the altered thought's underlying brain
   activation patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal periods during early development facilitate the formation of
   perceptual representations, laying the framework for future learning. A
   crucial question is whether such early representations are maintained in
   the brain over time without continued input. Using functional MRI, we
   show that internationally adopted (IA) children from China, exposed
   exclusively to French since adoption (mean age of adoption, 12.8 mo),
   maintained neural representations of their birth language despite
   functionally losing that language and having no conscious recollection
   of it. Their neural patterns during a Chinese lexical tone
   discrimination task matched those observed in Chinese/French bilinguals
   who have had continual exposure to Chinese since birth and differed from
   monolingual French speakers who had never been exposed to Chinese. They
   processed lexical tone as linguistically relevant, despite having no
   Chinese exposure for 12.6 y, on average, and no conscious recollection
   of that language. More specifically, IA participants recruited left
   superior temporal gyrus/planum temporale, matching the pattern observed
   in Chinese/French bilinguals. In contrast, French speakers who had never
   been exposed to Chinese did not recruit this region and instead
   activated right superior temporal gyrus. We show that neural
   representations are not overwritten and suggest a special status for
   language input obtained during the first year of development.}},

   differentially responds to fairness in loss and gain domains.
   Participants (responders) received offers from anonymous partners
   indicating a division of an amount of monetary gain or loss. If they
   accept, both get their shares according to the division; if they reject,
   both get nothing or lose the entire stake. We used a computational model
   to derive perceived fairness of offers and participant-specific inequity
   aversion. Behaviorally, participants were more likely to reject unfair
   offers in the loss (vs gain) domain. Neurally, the positive correlation
   between fairness and activation in ventral striatum was reduced, whereas
   the negative correlations between fairness and activations in
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were enhanced in the loss domain.
   Moreover, rejection-related dorsal striatum activation was higher in the
   loss domain. Furthermore, the gain-loss domain modulates costly
   punishment only when unfair behavior was directed toward the
   participants and not when it was directed toward others. These findings
   provide neural and computational accounts of increased costly norm
   enforcement under adversity and advanced our understanding of the
   context-dependent nature of fairness preference.}},

Abstract = {{Past research suggests that feeling understood enhances both personal
   and social well-being. However, little research has examined the
   neurobiological bases of feeling understood and not understood. We
   addressed these gaps by experimentally inducing felt understanding and
   not understanding as participants underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. The results demonstrated that feeling understood
   activated neural regions previously associated with reward and social
   connection (i.e. ventral striatum and middle insula), while not feeling
   understood activated neural regions previously associated with negative
   affect (i.e. anterior insula). Both feeling understood and not feeling
   understood activated different components of the mentalizing system
   (feeling understood: precuneus and temporoparietal junction; not feeling
   understood: dorsomedial prefrontal cortex). Neural responses were
   associated with subsequent feelings of social connection and
   disconnection and were modulated by individual differences in rejection
   sensitivity. Thus, this study provides insight into the psychological
   processes underlying feeling understood (or not) and may suggest new
   avenues for targeted interventions that amplify the benefits of feeling
   understood or buffer individuals from the harmful consequences of not
   feeling understood.}},

Abstract = {{Theory-of-mind (ToM) ability is foundational for successful social
   relationships, and dependent on a neurocognitive system, which includes
   temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex. Schizophrenia is
   associated with ToM impairments, and initial studies demonstrate
   similar, though more subtle deficits, in unaffected first-degree
   relatives, indicating that ToM deficits are a potential biomarker for
   the disorder. Importantly, the social consequences of ToM deficits could
   create an additional vulnerability factor for individuals at familial
   high risk (FHR). However, behavioral studies of ToM are inconsistent and
   virtually nothing is known about the neural basis of ToM in FHR or the
   relationship between ToM and social functioning. Here, FHR and non-FHR
   control participants underwent functional MRI scanning while reasoning
   about a story character's thoughts, emotions or physical appearance.
   Afterwards, participants completed a 28-day online `daily-diary'
   questionnaire in which they reported daily social interactions and
   degree of ToM reasoning. FHR participants demonstrated less neural
   activity in bilateral temporoparietal junction when reasoning about
   thoughts and emotions. Moreover, across all participants, the degree of
   neural activity during ToM reasoning predicted several aspects of daily
   social behavior. Results suggest that vulnerability for schizophrenia is
   associated with neurocognitive deficits in ToM and the degree of deficit
   is related to day-to-day social functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is a genetic syndrome characterized by the
   presence of an extra X chromosome that appears to increase the risk of
   psychopathology, such as autism symptoms. This study used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to determine underlying mechanisms related to
   this risk, with the aim of gaining insight into neural mechanisms behind
   social-cognitive dysfunction in KS and autism, and understanding
   similarities and differences in social information processing deficits.
   Fourteen boys with KS, seventeen boys with autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD) and nineteen non-clinical male controls aged 10-18 years were
   scanned while matching and labeling facial expressions (i.e. face
   processing and affect labeling, respectively). No group differences in
   neural activation were found during face processing. However, during
   affect labeling, the ASD group showed increased activation in the
   amygdala compared with controls, while the KS group showed increased
   activation in frontal areas compared with both controls and the ASD
   group. No group differences in task performance were found. Although
   behavioral symptoms of social dysfunction appear similar both in boys
   with KS and ASD, this is the first study to demonstrate different
   underlying etiologies. These results may aid in identifying different
   pathways to autism symptoms, which may help understanding variability
   within the ASD spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{We spend much of our daily lives imagining how we can reach future goals
   and what will happen when we attain them. Despite the prevalence of such
   goal-directed simulations, neuroimaging studies on planning have mainly
   focused on executive processes in the frontal lobe. This experiment
   examined the neural basis of process simulations, during which
   participants imagined themselves going through steps toward attaining a
   goal, and outcome simulations, during which participants imagined events
   they associated with achieving a goal. In the scanner, participants
   engaged in these simulation tasks and an odd/even control task. We
   hypothesized that process simulations would recruit default and
   frontoparietal control network regions, and that outcome simulations,
   which allow us to anticipate the affective consequences of achieving
   goals, would recruit default and reward-processing regions. Our analysis
   of brain activity that covaried with process and outcome simulations
   confirmed these hypotheses. A functional connectivity analysis with
   posterior cingulate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior
   inferior parietal lobule seeds showed that their activity was correlated
   during process simulations and associated with a distributed network of
   default and frontoparietal control network regions. During outcome
   simulations, medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala seeds covaried
   together and formed a functional network with default and
   reward-processing regions.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have investigated the neural substrates supporting
   cognitive reappraisal, identifying the importance of cognitive control
   processes implemented by prefrontal cortex (PFC). This study examined
   how valence and attention affect the processes used for cognitive
   reappraisal by asking participants to passively view or to cognitively
   reappraise positive and negative images with full or divided attention.
   When participants simply viewed these images, results revealed few
   effects of valence or attention. However, when participants engaged in
   reappraisal, there was a robust effect of valence, with the reappraisal
   of negative relative to positive images associated with more widespread
   activation, including within regions of medial and lateral PFC. There
   also was an effect of attention, with more lateral PFC recruitment when
   regulating with full attention and more medial PFC recruitment when
   regulating with divided attention. Within two regions of medial PFC and
   one region of ventrolateral PFC, there was an interaction between
   valence and attention: in these regions, divided attention reduced
   activity during reappraisal of positive but not negative images.
   Critically, participants continued to report reappraisal success even
   during the Divided Attention condition. These results suggest multiple
   routes to successful cognitive reappraisal, depending upon image valence
   and the availability of attentional resources.}},

Abstract = {{Deficits in facial mimicry have been widely reported in autism. Some
   studies have suggested that these deficits are restricted to spontaneous
   mimicry and do not extend to volitional mimicry. We bridge these
   apparently inconsistent observations by testing the impact of reward
   value on neural indices of mimicry and how autistic traits modulate this
   impact. Neutral faces were conditioned with high and low reward.
   Subsequently, functional connectivity between the ventral striatum (VS)
   and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was measured while neurotypical adults
   (n = 30) watched happy expressions made by these conditioned faces. We
   found greater VS-IFG connectivity in response to high reward vs low
   reward happy faces. This difference was negatively proportional to
   autistic traits, suggesting that reduced spontaneous mimicry of social
   stimuli seen in autism, may be related to a failure in the modulation of
   the mirror system by the reward system rather than a circumscribed
   deficit in the mirror system.}},

Abstract = {{According to many studies, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)
   encodes the subjective value of disparate rewards on a common scale.
   Yet, a host of other reward factors-likely represented outside of
   VMPFC-must be integrated to construct such signals for valuation. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we tested whether the
   interactions between posterior VMPFC and functionally connected brain
   regions predict subjective value. During fMRI scanning, participants
   rated the attractiveness of unfamiliar faces. We found that activation
   in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior VMPFC and caudate
   increased with higher attractiveness ratings. Using data from a
   post-scan task in which participants spent money to view attractive
   faces, we quantified each individual's subjective value for
   attractiveness. We found that connectivity between posterior VMPFC and
   regions frequently modulated by social information-including the
   temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) and middle temporal gyrus-was
   correlated with individual differences in subjective value. Crucially,
   these additional regions explained unique variation in subjective value
   beyond that extracted from value regions alone. These findings indicate
   not only that posterior VMPFC interacts with additional brain regions
   during valuation, but also that these additional regions carry
   information employed to construct the subjective value for social
   reward.}},

Abstract = {{Neurobiological and behavioral findings suggest that the development of
   delinquent behavior is associated with atypical social-affective
   processing. However, to date, no study has examined neural processes
   associated with social interactions in severely antisocial adolescents.
   In this study we investigated the behavioral and neural processes
   underlying social interactions of juvenile delinquents and a matched
   control group. Participants played the mini-Ultimatum Game as a
   responder while in the MRI scanner. Participants rejected unfair offers
   significantly less when the other player had `no alternative' compared
   with a `fair' alternative, suggesting that they took the intentions of
   the other player into account. However, this effect was reduced in the
   juvenile delinquents. The neuroimaging results revealed that juvenile
   delinquents showed less activation in the temporal parietal junction
   (TPJ) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). However, the groups showed
   similar activation levels in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
   and the right anterior insula (AI) when norms were violated. These
   results indicate that juvenile delinquents with severe antisocial
   behavior process norm violations adequately, but may have difficulties
   with attending spontaneously to relevant features of the social context
   during interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The arousal-biased competition model predicts that arousal increases the
   gain on neural competition between stimuli representations. Thus, the
   model predicts that arousal simultaneously enhances processing of
   salient stimuli and impairs processing of relatively less-salient
   stimuli. We tested this model with a simple dot-probe task. On each
   trial, participants were simultaneously exposed to one face image as a
   salient cue stimulus and one place image as a non-salient stimulus. A
   border around the face cue location further increased its bottom-up
   saliency. Before these visual stimuli were shown, one of two tones
   played: one that predicted a shock (increasing arousal) or one that did
   not. An arousal-by-saliency interaction in category-specific brain
   regions (fusiform face area for salient faces and parahippocampal place
   area for non-salient places) indicated that brain activation associated
   with processing the salient stimulus was enhanced under arousal whereas
   activation associated with processing the non-salient stimulus was
   suppressed under arousal. This is the first functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study to demonstrate that arousal can enhance
   information processing for prioritized stimuli while simultaneously
   impairing processing of non-prioritized stimuli. Thus, it goes beyond
   previous research to show that arousal does not uniformly enhance
   perceptual processing, but instead does so selectively in ways that
   optimizes attention to highly salient stimuli.}},

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Serotonin receptor 1A gene (HTR1A) knockout mice show pronounced
   defensive behaviour and increased fear conditioning to ambiguous
   conditioned stimuli. Such behaviour is a hallmark of pathological human
   anxiety, as observed in panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG). Thus,
   variations in HTR1A might contribute to neurophysiological differences
   within subgroups of PD/AG patients. Here, we tested this hypothesis by
   combining genetic with behavioural techniques and neuroimaging. In a
   clinical multicentre trial, patients with PD/AG received 12 sessions of
   manualized cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and were genotyped for
   HTR1A rs6295. In four subsamples of this multicentre trial, exposure
   behaviour (n = 185), defensive reactivity measured using a behavioural
   avoidance test (BAT; before CBT: n = 245; after CBT: n = 171) and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data during fear
   conditioning were acquired before and after CBT (n = 39). HTR1A risk
   genotype (GG) carriers more often escaped during the BAT before
   treatment. Exploratory fMRI results suggest increased activation of the
   amygdala in response to threat as well as safety cues before and after
   treatment in GG carriers. Furthermore, GG carriers demonstrated reduced
   effects of CBT on differential conditioning in regions including the
   bilateral insulae and the anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, risk
   genotype carriers demonstrated reduced self-initiated exposure behaviour
   to aversive situations. This study demonstrates the effect of HTR1A
   variation on defensive behaviour, amygdala activity, CBT-induced neural
   plasticity and normalization of defence behaviour in PD/AG. Our results,
   therefore, translate evidence from animal studies to humans and suggest
   a central role for HTR1A in differentiating subgroups of patients with
   anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Learning a new language entails interactions with one's prior
   language(s). Much research has shown how native language affects the
   cognitive and neural mechanisms of a new language, but little is known
   about whether and how learning a new language shapes the neural
   mechanisms of prior language(s). In two experiments in the current
   study, we used an artificial language training paradigm in combination
   with an fMRI to examine (1) the effects of different linguistic
   components (phonology and semantics) of a new language on the neural
   process of prior languages (i.e., native and second languages), and (2)
   whether such effects were modulated by the proficiency level in the new
   language. Results of Experiment 1 showed that when the training in a new
   language involved semantics (as opposed to only visual forms and
   phonology), neural activity during word reading in the native language
   (Chinese) was reduced in several reading-related regions, including the
   left pars opercularis, pars triangularis, bilateral inferior temporal
   gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and inferior occipital gyrus. Results of
   Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1 and further found
   that semantic training also affected neural activity during word reading
   in the subjects' second language (English). Furthermore, we found that
   the effects of the new language were modulated by the subjects'
   proficiency level in the new language. These results provide critical
   imaging evidence for the influence of learning to read words in a new
   language on word reading in native and second languages. (C) 2014

Title = {{Controlling the self: The role of the dorsal frontomedian cortex in
   intentional inhibition}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{247-254}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Intentional inhibition refers to the suppression of ongoing behavior on
   the basis of internally-generated decisions. This ability to cancel
   planned actions at the last moment is thought to be critical for
   self-control and has been related to activation in a circumscribed
   region of the dorsal frontomedian cortex (dFMC). Preliminary theories of
   intentional inhibition were based on studies that exclusively examined
   the cancellation of motor responses, and consequently concluded that
   this region serves the suppression of motor output. Yet recent evidence
   suggests that the dFMC is also involved in inhibitory control over more
   abstract internal states such as emotions or desires that have no
   immediate behavioral output. In this review, we therefore wish to put
   forth a new integrative perspective on the role of the dFMC in human
   self-control. We will argue that by virtue of its anatomical location
   and functional connections, this area may subserve the disengagement
   from current urges and impulses, thus facilitating successful exertions
   of self-control across a wide range of contexts by overcoming a
   self-focused perspective. We will discuss the fit of this view of the
   dFMC with the existing literature, identify critical experimental
   determinants for engaging the dFMC in intentional inhibition, and
   outline promising perspectives for future research. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{18-26}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Findings from neuroimaging are increasingly being cited in policy
   debates to strengthen the case for early identification of, and
   intervention with, children at risk of maltreatment and poor outcomes.
   While agreeing that neuroscientific research into the risks of
   maltreatment is a very valuable and exciting area of study, this article
   challenges the confidence with which these findings are used in policy
   discussions. It critically discusses the reliability and validity of the
   relevant findings and the contribution they can currently make to our
   understanding of the causes and consequences of maltreatment. In
   addition, it is argued that this type of evidence, which is new in
   policy debates, is often being used in ways that are problematic. Many
   participants in the relevant policy debates seem to subscribe either to
   an implicit version of dualism about the relationship between the mind
   and the body, or to reductionism - the view that the mental can be
   reduced to the physical. Such assumptions threaten the way we think
   about human agency and moral responsibility but it is argued that they
   are misguided for conceptual reasons. It is concluded that neuroscience
   has the potential to contribute to our understanding of the causes and
   effects of maltreatment but cannot do so in isolation from the social
   sciences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Altered neural correlates of reward and loss processing during simulated

Journal = {{DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{77-86}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with gambling or substance-use disorders exhibit
   similar functional alterations in reward circuitry suggestive of a
   shared underlying vulnerability in addictive disorders. Additional
   research into common and unique alterations in reward-processing in
   substance-related and non-substance-related addictions may identify
   neural factors that could be targeted in treatment development for these
   disorders.
   Methods: To investigate contextual reward-processing in pathological
   gambling, a slot-machine fMRI task was performed by three groups (with
   pathological gambling, cocaine dependence and neither disorder; N = 24
   each) to determine the extent to which two groups with addictions
   (non-substance-related and substance-related) showed similarities and
   differences with respect to each other and a non-addicted group during
   anticipatory periods and following the delivery of winning, losing and
   `near-miss' outcomes.
   Results: Individuals with pathological gambling or cocaine dependence
   compared to those with neither disorder exhibited exaggerated
   anticipatory activity in mesolimbic and ventrocortical regions, with
   pathological-gambling participants displaying greater positive
   possible-reward anticipation and cocaine-dependent participants
   displaying more negative certain-loss anticipation. Neither clinical
   sample exhibited medial frontal or striatal responses that were observed
   following near-miss outcomes in healthy comparison participants.
   Conclusions: Alterations in anticipatory processing maybe sensitive to
   the valence of rewards and content-disorder-specific. Common and unique
   findings in pathological gambling and cocaine dependence with respect to
   anticipatory reward and near-miss loss processing suggest shared and
   unique elements that might be targeted through behavioral or
   pharmacological interventions in the treatment of addictions. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The study aimed to test the potential of functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS) in combination with electrodermal activity (EDA) in
   a decision paradigm by means of the Columbia Card Task (CCT). The CCT is
   a dynamic decision task characterized by assessing subjects' risk-taking
   via eliciting voluntary stopping points in a series of incrementally
   increasingly risky choices. Using the combined fNIRS-EDA approach, we
   aim to examine the hemodynamic and affective correlates of both decision
   and outcome responses during performance on the CCT. Twenty healthy
   subjects completed the Cold and Hot CCT version while fNIRS over
   prefrontal cortex and EDA were recorded. Results showed that (1) in the
   decision phase fNIRS revealed larger total hemoglobin concentration
   changes {[}tHb] in the Cold as compared to the Hot CCT, whereas EDA
   revealed an opposite pattern with larger skin conductance responses
   (SCRs) to the Hot as compared to the Cold CCT. (2) No significant
   {[}tHb] signals or SCRs were found in the outcome phase. (3) Coherence
   calculations between fNIRS and EDA in the heart rate frequency showed a
   significant increase during the Hot as compared to the Cold CCT. Our
   findings designate fNIRS as suitable tool for monitoring decision-making
   processes. The combination of fNIRS and EDA demonstrates the potential
   of simultaneously assessing the interaction between hemodynamic and
   affective responses which can provide additional information concerning
   the relationship between these two physiological systems for various
   research areas.}},

Title = {{Effects of acute psychosocial stress on neural activity to emotional and

Journal = {{BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{598-610}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that acute psychosocial stress impairs
   recognition of declarative memory and that emotional material is
   especially sensitive to this effect. Animal studies suggest a central
   role of the amygdala which modulates memory processes in hippocampus,
   prefrontal cortex and other brain areas. We used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate neural correlates of
   stress-induced modulation of emotional recognition memory in humans.
   Twenty-seven healthy, right-handed, non-smoker male volunteers performed
   an emotional face recognition task. During encoding, participants were
   presented with 50 fearful and 50 neutral faces. One hour later, they
   underwent either a stress (Trier Social Stress Test) or a control
   procedure outside the scanner which was followed immediately by the
   recognition session inside the scanner, where participants had to
   discriminate between 100 old and 50 new faces. Stress increased salivary
   cortisol, blood pressure and pulse, and decreased the mood of
   participants but did not impact recognition memory. BOLD data during
   recognition revealed a stress condition by emotion interaction in the
   left inferior frontal gyrus and right hippocampus which was due to a
   stress-induced increase of neural activity to fearful and a decrease to
   neutral faces. Functional connectivity analyses revealed a
   stress-induced increase in coupling between the right amygdala and the
   right fusiform gyrus, when processing fearful as compared to neutral
   faces. Our results provide evidence that acute psychosocial stress
   affects medial temporal and frontal brain areas differentially for
   neutral and emotional items, with a stress-induced privileged processing
   of emotional stimuli.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN AND LANGUAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{58-67}},

Abstract = {{Learning to read involves associating abstract visual shapes with
   familiar meanings. Embodiment theories suggest that word meaning is at
   least partially represented in distributed sensorimotor networks in the
   brain (Barsalou, 2008; Pulvermueller, 2013). We explored how reading
   comprehension develops by tracking when and how printed words start
   activating these ``semantic{''} sensorimotor representations as children
   learn to read. Adults and children aged 7-10 years showed clear
   category-specific cortical specialization for tool versus animal
   pictures during a one-back categorisation task. Thus, sensorimotor
   representations for these categories were in place at all ages. However,
   co-activation of these same brain regions by the visual objects' written
   names was only present in adults, even though all children could read
   and comprehend all presented words, showed adult-like task performance,
   and older children were proficient readers. It thus takes years of
   training and expert reading skill before spontaneous processing of
   printed words' sensorimotor meanings develops in childhood. (C) 2014 The

   laboratory. Of these, 96 twins (60 MZ, 28 male; 36 DZ, 22 male)
   subsequently underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   during antisaccades. Variation in antisaccade direction errors in the
   laboratory showed significant heritability (47\%; 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 22-65). In fMRI, the contrast of antisaccades with
   prosaccades yielded BOLD signal in fronto-parietal-subcortical networks.
   Twin modelling provided tentative evidence of significant heritability
   (50\%, 95\% CI: 18-72) of BOLD in the left thalamus only. However, due
   to the limited power to detect heritability in this study, replications
   in larger samples are needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Simulation studies on emotion have shown that facial actions can
   initiate and modulate particular emotions. However, the neural
   mechanisms of these initiating and modulating functions are unclear. In
   this study, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and task-based fMRI to explore these processes by examining
   spontaneous cerebral activities and brain activations under two
   conditions: holding a pen using only the teeth (HPT: facilitating the
   muscles typically associated with smiling) and holding a pen using only
   the lips (HPL: inhibiting the muscles typically associated with
   smiling). The resting-state fMRI results showed that compared with the
   HPL condition, significant increases in the amplitudes of low-frequency
   fluctuations were found in the right posterior cingulate gyrus {[}PCG;
   Brodmann area 31 (BA31)] and in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG; BA9)
   in the HPT condition. These findings might be related to the initiation
   of positive emotions (PCG) and to the control and allocation of
   attention (MFG). The task-based fMRI results showed that the inferior
   parietal lobule, left supplementary motor area, superior parietal
   lobule, precuneus, and bilateral middle cingulum were active when facial
   manipulation influenced the recognition of emotional facial expressions.
   These results demonstrate that facial actions might not only initiate a
   particular emotion and draw attention, but also influence face-based
   emotion recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The authors sought to model the unique and common variance
   across conduct disorder, substance misuse, and attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to investigate the neurocognitive
   factors that relate generally or uniquely to externalizing problems in
   adolescence.
   Method: Personality and behavioral measures and functional imaging
   responses to reward sensitivity and response inhibition tasks were
   assessed in 1,778 European adolescents at age 14 and, using structural
   equation modeling, were related to the unique and common variance across
   externalizing problems assessed and modeled at ages 14 and 16.
   Results: Externalizing problems best fit a general-specific model made
   up of a specific factor representing ADHD and conduct disorder symptoms,
   a specific factor representing substance misuse symptoms, and a common
   externalizing factor representing the variance shared among all
   symptoms. Common variance across externalizing problems was associated
   with high impulsivity and delay discounting as well as low
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response in the substantia nigra and
   subthalamic nucleus but high BOLD response in the presupplementary motor
   area and precentral gyrus during successful inhibition. Unique variance
   for ADHD/conduct disorder was associated with impulsivity, poor response
   inhibition, and high delay discounting, as well as low BOLD response in
   frontal brain areas bilaterally during failed inhibition. In contrast,
   unique variance for substance misuse was associated with high sensation
   seeking and delay discounting, as well as differential brain response to
   reward anticipation: high BOLD response in the left orbitofrontal cortex
   but low BOLD response in the left inferior frontal gyrus.
   Conclusions: Personality, behavioral, and fMRI findings suggest that
   abnormalities in response inhibition, error processing, and reward
   processing are differentially implicated in underlying vulnerability
   specific to ADHD/conduct disorder and substance misuse and general to
   externalizing problems.}},

Abstract = {{Fear of negative evaluation, such as negative social performance
   feedback, is the core symptom of social anxiety. The present study
   investigated the neural correlates of anticipation and perception of
   social performance feedback in social anxiety. High (HSA) and low (LSA)
   socially anxious individuals were asked to give a speech on a personally
   relevant topic and received standardized but appropriate expert
   performance feedback in a succeeding experimental session in which
   neural activity was measured during anticipation and presentation of
   negative and positive performance feedback concerning the speech
   performance, or a neutral feedback-unrelated control condition. HSA
   compared to LSA subjects reported greater anxiety during anticipation of
   negative feedback. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results showed
   deactivation of medial prefrontal brain areas during anticipation of
   negative feedback relative to the control and the positive condition,
   and medial prefrontal and insular hyperactivation during presentation of
   negative as well as positive feedback in HSA compared to LSA subjects.
   The results indicate distinct processes underlying feedback processing
   during anticipation and presentation of feedback in HSA as compared to
   LSA individuals. In line with the role of the medial prefrontal cortex
   in self-referential information processing and the insula in
   interoception, social anxiety seems to be associated with lower
   self-monitoring during feedback anticipation, and an increased
   self-focus and interoception during feedback presentation, regardless of
   feedback valence. Hum Brain Mapp 35:6023-6031, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD) are two of the most common and vexing neurodevelopmental
   disorders among children. Although the two disorders share many
   behavioral and neuropsychological characteristics, most MRI studies
   examine only one of the disorders at a time. Using graph theory combined
   with structural and functional connectivity, we examined the large-scale
   network organization among three groups of children: a group with ADHD
   (8-12 years, n=20), a group with ASD (7-13 years, n=16), and typically
   developing controls (TD) (8-12 years, n=20). We apply the concept of the
   rich-club organization, whereby central, highly connected hub regions
   are also highly connected to themselves. We examine the brain into two
   different network domains: (1) inside a rich-club network phenomena and
   (2) outside a rich-club network phenomena. The ASD and ADHD groups had
   markedly different patterns of rich club and non rich-club connections
   in both functional and structural data. The ASD group exhibited higher
   connectivity in structural and functional networks but only inside the
   rich-club networks. These findings were replicated using the autism
   brain imaging data exchange dataset with ASD (n=85) and TD (n=101). The
   ADHD group exhibited a lower generalized fractional anisotropy and
   functional connectivity inside the rich-club networks, but a higher
   number of axonal fibers and correlation coefficient values outside the
   rich club. Despite some shared biological features and frequent
   comorbity, these data suggest ADHD and ASD exhibit distinct large-scale
   connectivity patterns in middle childhood. Hum Brain Mapp 35:6032-6048,

Abstract = {{Current perspectives on the evolutionary roots of human morality suggest
   it arose to incentivize social cooperation by promoting feelings of
   disgust toward selfish behavior, although the underlying neural
   mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate whether the ancient mammalian
   neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) influences self-referential processing in
   the domains of emotion evaluation and moral decision making, we
   conducted a pharmaco-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a
   behavioral experiment involving 157 healthy women and men who were
   treated with either OXT (24 IU) or placebo (PLC) intranasally. Our
   results show that OXT facilitated cortical midline responses during
   self-processing of disgust and selectively promoted self-interest moral
   judgments in men. In contrast, in women OXT increased the reaction time
   difference between accepted and rejected moral dilemmas and led them to
   suppress their self-interest and respond more altruistically for the
   benefit of others. Taken together, these findings suggest an OXT-related
   sexual dimorphism in human moral behavior which evolved adaptively to
   optimize both protection and nurturing of offspring by promoting selfish
   behavior in men and altruistic behavior in women. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Objective: Nonhuman and human studies have documented the adverse
   effects of early life stress (ELS) on emotion regulation and underlying
   neural circuitry. Less is known about how these experiences shape social
   processes and neural circuitry. In this study, we thus investigated how
   ELS affects children's perception of, and neural response to, negative
   social experiences in a social exclusion paradigm (Cyberball). Method:
   Twenty-five foster or adopted children with ELS (age 10.6 +/- 1.8 years,
   13 male and 12 female) and 26 matched nonseparated controls (age 10.38
   +/- 1.7 years, 12 male and 14 female) took part in a Cyberball paradigm
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results: During
   peer rejection, children with ELS reported significantly more feelings
   of exclusion and frustration than nonseparated controls. On the neural
   level, children with ELS showed reduced activation in the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (dlPFC), and reduced connectivity between dlPFC-dACC, areas previously
   implicated in affect regulation. Conversely, children with ELS showed
   increased neural activation in brain regions involved in memory,
   arousal, and threat-related processing (middle temporal gyrus, thalamus,
   ventral tegmental area) relative to controls during social exclusion.
   The number of separation experiences before entering the permanent
   family predicted reductions in fronto-cingulate recruitment. The
   relationship between early separations and self-reported exclusion was
   mediated by dlPFC activity. Conclusion: The findings suggest that ELS
   leads to alterations in neural circuitry implicated in the regulation of
   socioemotional processes. This neural signature may underlie foster
   children's differential reactivity to rejection in everyday life and
   could increase risk for developing affective disorders.}},

Title = {{Amygdala habituation: A reliable fMRI phenotype}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{103}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Amygdala function is of high interest for cognitive, social and
   psychiatric neuroscience, emphasizing the need for reliable assessments
   in humans. Previous work has indicated unsatisfactorily low
   within-subject reliability of amygdala activation fMRI measures. Based
   on basic science evidence for strong habituation of amygdala response to
   repeated stimuli, we investigated whether a quantification of
   habituation provides additional information beyond the usual estimate of
   the overall mean activity. We assessed the within-subject reliability of
   amygdala habituation measures during a facial emotion matching paradigm
   in 25 healthy subjects. We extracted the amygdala signal decrement
   across the course of the fMRI run for the two test-retest measurement
   sessions and compared reliability estimates with previous findings based
   on mean response amplitude. Retest-reliability of the session-wise
   amygdala habituation was significantly higher than the evoked amygdala
   mean amplitude (intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) = 0.53 vs.
   0.16). To test the task-specificity of this finding, we compared the
   retest-reliability of amygdala habituation across two different tasks.
   Significant amygdala response decrement was also seen in a cognitive
   task (n-back working memory) that did not per se activate the amygdala,
   but was totally unreliable in that context (ICC similar to 0.0), arguing
   for task-specificity. Together the results show that emotion-dependent
   amygdala habituation is a robust and considerably more reliable index
   than the mean amplitude, and provides a robust potential endpoint for
   within-subject designs including pharmaco-fMRI studies. (C) 2014 The

Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{401-410}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The problemof ``voodoo{''} correlations-exceptionally high observed
   correlations in selected regions of the brain-is well recognized in
   neuroimaging. It arises when quantities of interest are estimated from
   the same data that was used to select them as interesting. In
   statistical terminology, the problem of inference following selection
   from the same data is that of selective inference. Motivated by the
   unwelcome side-effects of splitting the data-the recommended remedy-we
   adapt the recent developments in selective inference in order to
   construct confidence intervals (CIs) with good reproducibility
   prospects, even if selection and estimation are done with the same data.
   These intervals control the expected proportion of non-covered
   correlations in the selected voxels-the False Coverage Rate (FCR). They
   extend further toward zero than standard intervals, thus attenuating the
   impression made by highly biased observed correlations. They do so
   adaptively, in that they coincide with the standard CIs when far away
   from the selection point. We complement existing analytic proofs with a
   simulation, showing that the proposed intervals control the FCR in
   realistic social neuroscience problems. We also suggest a ``confidence
   calibration plot{''}, to allow the intervals to be reported in a clear
   and interpretable way. Applying the proposed methodology on a
   loss-aversion study, we demonstrate that with the sample size and
   selection type employed, selection bias is considerable. Finally,
   selective intervals are compared to the currently recommended
   data-splitting approach. We discover that our approach has more power
   and typically more informative, as no data is discarded. Computation of
   the intervals is implemented in an accompanying software package. (C)

Abstract = {{BackgroundDepression is prevalent and typically has its onset in
   adolescence. Resting-state fMRI could help create a better understanding
   of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms during this critical
   period. In this study, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) is
   examined using seed regions-of-interest (ROIs) associated with three
   networks: the limbic network, the default mode network (DMN) and the
   salience network.
   MethodsTwenty-six treatment-naive, clinically depressed adolescents of
   whom 18 had comorbid anxiety, and 26 pair-wise matched healthy controls
   underwent resting-state fMRI. The three networks were investigated using
   a seed-based ROI approach with seeds in the bilateral amygdala (limbic
   network), bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC; salience
   network) and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (default mode
   network).
   ResultsCompared to healthy controls, clinically depressed adolescents
   showed increased RSFC of the left amygdala with right parietal cortical
   areas, and decreased right amygdala RSFC with left frontal cortical
   areas including the ACC, as well as with right occipito-parietal areas.
   The bilateral dACC showed decreased RSFC with the right middle frontal
   gyrus, frontal pole, and inferior frontal gyrus in clinically depressed
   adolescents. No abnormalities in DMN RSFC were found, and differences in
   RSFC did not correlate with clinical measures.
   ConclusionsThe aberrant RSFC of the amygdala network and the dACC
   network may be related to altered emotion processing and regulation in
   depressed adolescents. Our results provide new insights into RSFC in
   clinically depressed adolescents and future models on adolescent
   depression may include abnormalities in the connectivity of salience
   network.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals misuse oxycodone, a widely prescribed opioid analgesic, in
   part to self-medicate physical and emotional pain. Physical and
   emotional pain is thought to be represented in the brain by a pain
   matrix,' consisting of the insula, thalamus, and somatosensory cortices,
   with processing of the affective dimension of pain in the dorsal and
   rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The current study examined
   oxycodone's effects on resting-state functional connectivity between the
   dorsal ACC, rostral ACC, and other regions of the pain matrix using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a within-subjects,
   randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response design, 14
   healthy subjects completed a resting-state scan following ingestion of
   placebo, 10 mg, or 20 mg of oxycodone. Functional correlations between
   the dorsal and rostral ACC seed regions and the pain matrix were
   examined and compared across sessions. Both doses of oxycodone reduced
   functional coupling between the dorsal ACC and bilateral anterior
   insula/putamen and the rostral ACC and right insula relative to placebo
   (no differences between doses). The findings do not withstand correction
   for multiple comparisons, and thus should be considered preliminary.
   However, they are consistent with the idea that oxycodone may produce
   its physical and emotional analgesic' effects through disruption of
   ACC-insula and ACC-putamen connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have suggested that the endowment effect may actually be
   a type of self-referent cognitive bias due to the mere ownership of an
   object. However, it is not adequately understood how the ownership of an
   object affects the endowment effect. The current research is the first
   to explore if the endowment effect could be extended to different
   ownerships. The results suggest that the endowment effect extends to
   goods owned by their mothers, romantic partners and close friends, but
   not acquaintances. Furthermore, the level of intimacy between
   individuals and mothers/romantic partners/close friends/acquaintances
   mediates the relationship between the effect of ownership and the
   extensibility of the endowment effect. These findings are consistent
   with the mere ownership effect that ownership increases valuation by
   enhancing the salience of the self.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Psychosis is characterized by a profound lack of trust and
   disturbed social interactions. Investigating the neural basis of these
   deficits is difficult because of medication effects but first-degree
   relatives show qualitatively similar abnormalities to patients with
   psychosis on various tasks. This study aimed to investigate neural
   activation in siblings of patients in response to an interactive task.
   We hypothesized that, compared to controls, siblings would show i) less
   basic trust at the beginning of the task and ii) reduced activation of
   the brain reward and mentalizing systems.
   Method. Functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI) data were acquired
   on 50 healthy siblings of patients with psychosis and 33 healthy
   controls during a multi-round trust game with a cooperative counterpart.
   An a priori region-of-interest ROI) analysis of the caudate,
   temporoparietal junction TPJ), superior temporal sulcus STS), insula and
   medial prefrontal cortex mPFC) was performed focusing on the investment
   and repayment phases. An exploratory whole-brain analysis was run to
   test for group-wise differences outside these ROIs.
   Results. The siblings' behaviour during the trust game did not differ
   significantly from that of the controls. At the neural level, siblings
   showed reduced activation of the right caudate during investments, and
   the left insula during repayments. In addition, the whole-brain analysis
   revealed reduced putamen activation in siblings during investments.
   Conclusions. The findings suggest that siblings show aberrant
   functioning of regions traditionally involved in reward processing in
   response to cooperation, which may be associated with the social reward
   deficits observed in psychosis.}},

Abstract = {{External circumstances and internal bodily states often change and
   require organisms to flexibly adapt valuation processes to select the
   optimal action in a given context. Here, we investigate the neurobiology
   of context-dependent valuation in 22 human subjects using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects made binary choices between visual
   stimuli with three attributes (shape, color, and pattern) that were
   associated with monetary values. Context changes required subjects to
   deviate from the default shape valuation and to integrate a second
   attribute to comply with the goal to maximize rewards. Critically, this
   binary choice task did not involve any conflict between opposing
   monetary, temporal, or social preferences. We tested the hypothesis that
   interactions between regions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)
   and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) implicated in self-control
   choices would also underlie the more general function of
   context-dependent valuation. Consistent with this idea, we found that
   the degree to which stimulus attributes were reflected in vmPFC activity
   varied as a function of context. In addition, activity in dlPFC
   increased when context changes required a reweighting of stimulus
   attribute values. Moreover, the strength of the functional connectivity
   between dlPFC and vmPFC was associated with the degree of
   context-specific attribute valuation in vmPFC at the time of choice. Our
   findings suggest that functional interactions between dlPFC and vmPFC
   are a key aspect of context-dependent valuation and that the role of
   this network during choices that require self-control to adjudicate
   between competing outcome preferences is a specific application of this
   more general neural mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Our ability to read other people's non-verbal signals gets refined
   throughout childhood and adolescence. How this is paralleled by brain
   development has been investigated mainly with regards to face
   perception, showing a protracted functional development of the
   face-selective visual cortical areas. In view of the importance of
   whole-body expressions in interpersonal communication it is important to
   understand the development of brain areas sensitive to these social
   signals. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMR1) to
   compare brain activity in a group of 24 children (age 6-11) and 26
   adults while they passively watched short videos of body or object
   movements. We observed activity in similar regions in both groups;
   namely the extra-striate body area (EBA), fusiform body area (FBA),
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), amygdala and premotor
   regions. Adults showed additional activity in the inferior frontal gyrus
   (IFG). Within the main body-selective regions (EBA, FBA and pSTS), the
   strength and spatial extent of fMRI signal change was larger in adults
   than in children. Multivariate Bayesian (MVB) analysis showed that the
   spatial pattern of neural representation within those regions did not
   change over age. Our results indicate, for the first time, that body
   perception, like face perception, is still maturing through the second
   decade of life.}},

Pages = {{370-380}},

Abstract = {{Humans often project their own beliefs, desires and emotions onto
   others, indicating an inherent egocentrism. In five studies we
   investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying emotional
   egocentricity bias (EEB) and specifically an offline EEB, defined as the
   projection of one's own tendency to react with a certain emotional
   response pattern in a given situation onto other people. We used a
   competitive reaction time game associated with monetary gains and losses
   that allowed inducing feelings of envy and Schadenfreude. While we found
   evidence for the first hand experience of envy and Schadenfreude, we
   also observed an offline bias, that is participants on average projected
   feelings of envy and Schadenfreude when having to judge others.
   Importantly the extent of experienced and projected social emotions were
   highly correlated. This bias was observed when participants were both
   directly involved and also as an uninvolved party, suggesting the
   offline bias to be independent of the presently experienced emotion.
   Under increased time pressure however an online bias emerged whereby
   participants just projected their presently experienced emotions onto
   the other. Finally, we show that on the neural level shared neuronal
   networks underlie the offline EEB at least for envy. Thus, for envy,
   activity of the same part of anterior insula was sensitive to individual
   differences both in the experience and the projection of envy. These
   findings outline the set of circumstances leading to specific types of
   empathic attribution biases and show that individual differences in the
   experience of social emotions are predictive of the offline
   egocentricity bias both on a behavioral as well as a neural level. These
   data extend present models on the neurocognitive mechanisms of
   interpersonal understanding in the socio-affective domain. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Facial movement conveys important information for social interactions,
   yet its neural processing is poorly understood. Computational models
   propose that shape-and temporal sequence sensitive mechanisms interact
   in processing dynamic faces. While face processing regions are known to
   respond to facial movement, their sensitivity to particular temporal
   sequences has barely been studied. Here we used fMRI to examine the
   sensitivity of human face-processing regions to two aspects of
   directionality in facial movement trajectories. We presented genuine
   movie recordings of increasing and decreasing fear expressions, each of
   which were played in natural or reversed frame order. This two-by-two
   factorial design matched low-level visual properties, static content and
   motion energy within each factor, emotion-direction (increasing or
   decreasing emotion) and timeline (natural versus artificial). The
   results showed sensitivity for emotion-direction in FFA, which was
   timeline-dependent as it only occurred within the natural frame order,
   and sensitivity to timeline in the STS, which was
   emotion-direction-dependent as it only occurred for decreased fear. The
   occipital face area (OFA) was sensitive to the factor timeline. These
   findings reveal interacting temporal sequence sensitive mechanisms that
   are responsive to both ecological meaning and to prototypical unfolding
   of facial dynamics. These mechanisms are temporally directional, provide
   socially relevant information regarding emotional state or naturalness
   of behavior, and agree with predictions from modeling and predictive
   coding theory. (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

   was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while
   they listened to 45-s narratives describing unpleasant, neutral, and
   pleasant events spoken in neutral voice. After scanning, participants
   listened to the narratives again and rated continuously their feelings
   of pleasantness-unpleasantness (valence) and of arousal-calmness.
   Instantaneous intersubject phase synchronization (ISPS) measures were
   computed to derive both multi-subject voxel-wise similarity measures of
   hemodynamic activity and inter-area functional dynamic connectivity
   (seed-based phase synchronization, SBPS). Valence and arousal time
   series were subsequently used to predict the ISPS and SBPS time series.
   High arousal was associated with increased ISPS in the auditory cortices
   and in Broca's area, and negative valence was associated with enhanced
   ISPS in the thalamus, anterior cingulate, lateral prefrontal, and
   orbitofrontal cortices. Negative valence affected functional
   connectivity of fronto-parietal, limbic (insula, cingulum) and
   fronto-opercular circuitries, and positive arousal affected the
   connectivity of the striatum, amygdala, thalamus, cerebellum, and dorsal
   frontal cortex. Positive valence and negative arousal had markedly
   smaller effects. We propose that high arousal synchronizes the
   listeners' sound-processing and speech-comprehension networks, whereas
   negative valence synchronizes circuitries supporting emotional and
   self-referential processing. (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Limbic hyperactivation and an impaired functional interplay between the
   amygdala and the prefrontal cortex are discussed to go along with, or
   even cause, pathological anxiety. Within the multi-faceted group of
   anxiety disorders, the highly prevalent social phobia (SP) is
   characterized by excessive fear of being negatively evaluated. Although
   there is widespread evidence for amygdala hypersensitivity to emotional
   faces in SP, verbal material has rarely been used in imaging studies, in
   particular with an eye on disorder-specificity. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a block design consisting of (1)
   overall negative, (2) social-phobia related, (3) positive, and (4)
   neutral words, we studied 25 female patients with social phobia and 25
   healthy female control subjects (HC). Results demonstrated amygdala
   hyperactivation to disorder-relevant but not to generally negative words
   in SP patients, with a positive correlation to symptom severity. A
   functional connectivity analysis revealed a weaker coupling between the
   amygdala and the left middle frontal gyrus in patients. Symptom severity
   was negatively related to connectivity strength between the amygdala and
   the ventromedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 10
   and 11). The findings clearly support the view of a hypersensitive
   threat-detection system, combined with disorder-related alterations in
   amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity in pathological anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Whenever we interact with others, we judge them and whenever we make
   such judgments, we compare them with ourselves, other people, or
   internalized standards. Countless social psychological experiments have
   shown that comparative thinking plays a ubiquitous role in person
   perception and social cognition as a whole. The topic of social
   comparison has recently aroused the interest of social neuroscientists,
   who have begun to investigate its neural underpinnings. The present
   article provides an overview of these neuroimaging and
   electrophysiological studies. We discuss recent findings on the
   consequences of social comparison on the brain processing of outcomes
   and highlight the role of the brain's reward system. Moreover, we
   analyze the relationship between the brain networks involved in social
   comparisons and those active during other forms of cognitive and
   perceptual comparison. Finally, we discuss potential future questions
   that research on the neural correlates of social comparison could

Abstract = {{Odors are surprisingly difficult to name, but the mechanism underlying
   this phenomenon is poorly understood. In experiments using event-related
   potentials (ERPs) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we
   investigated the physiological basis of odor naming with a paradigm
   where olfactory and visual object cues were followed by target words
   that either matched or mismatched the cue. We hypothesized that word
   processing would not only be affected by its semantic congruency with
   the preceding cue, but would also depend on the cue modality (olfactory
   or visual). Performance was slower and less precise when linking a word
   to its corresponding odor than to its picture. The ERP index of semantic
   incongruity (N400), reflected in the comparison of nonmatching versus
   matching target words, was more constrained to posterior electrode sites
   and lasted longer on odor-cue (vs picture-cue) trials. In parallel, fMRI
   cross-adaptation in the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the left
   anterior temporal lobe (ATL) was observed in response to words when
   preceded by matching olfactory cues, but not by matching visual cues.
   Time-series plots demonstrated increased fMRI activity in OFC and ATL at
   the onset of the odor cue itself, followed by response habituation after
   processing of a matching (vs nonmatching) target word, suggesting that
   predictive perceptual representations in these regions are already
   established before delivery and deliberation of the target word.
   Together, our findings underscore the modality-specific anatomy and
   physiology of object identification in the human brain.}},

Abstract = {{While there is a growing body of functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) evidence implicating a corpus of brain regions in value-based
   decision-making in humans, the limited temporal resolution of fMRI
   cannot address the relative temporal precedence of different brain
   regions in decision-making. To address this question, we adopted a
   computational model-based approach to electroencephalography (EEG) data
   acquired during a simple binary choice task. fMRI data were also
   acquired from the same participants for source localization.
   Post-decision value signals emerged 200 ms post-stimulus in a
   predominantly posterior source in the vicinity of the intraparietal
   sulcus and posterior temporal lobe cortex, alongside a weaker anterior
   locus. The signal then shifted to a predominantly anterior locus 850 ms
   following the trial onset, localized to the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex. Comparison signals between
   unchosen and chosen options emerged late in the trial at 1050 ms in
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that such comparison signals
   may not be directly associated with the decision itself but rather may
   play a role in post-decision action selection. Taken together, these
   results provide us new insights into the temporal dynamics of
   decision-making in the brain, suggesting that for a simple binary choice
   task, decisions may be encoded predominantly in posterior areas such as
   intraparietal sulcus, before shifting anteriorly.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbed emotion processing and difficulty with social interactions are
   present to variable degrees in dementia. They are characteristic
   features of frontotemporal dementia, whereas these deficits tend to be
   mild in Alzheimer's disease, reflecting the different patterns of
   neurodegeneration seen in these disorders. Corticobasal syndrome is an
   atypical parkinsonian disorder clinically and pathologically related to
   frontotemporal dementia. Corticobasal syndrome typically presents as a
   motor disturbance, although cognitive and behavioural changes are now
   recognized. Pathological changes are found in frontoparietal cortical
   regions and in the basal ganglia; regions that are heavily involved in
   emotion processing. Despite the overlap with frontotemporal dementia and
   the observed regions of brain atrophy, emotion processing has not been
   systematically explored in corticobasal syndrome. This study aimed to
   (i) comprehensively examine emotion processing in corticobasal syndrome
   in comparison to Alzheimer's disease, to determine whether emotion
   processing deficits exist in this syndrome, beyond those seen in
   Alzheimer's disease; and (ii) identify the neural correlates underlying
   emotion processing in corticobasal syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.
   Sixteen patients with corticobasal syndrome, 18 patients with
   Alzheimer's disease and 22 matched healthy control subjects were
   assessed on a comprehensive battery of face and emotion processing
   tasks. Behavioural analyses revealed deficits in both basic face
   processing and high-level emotion processing tasks in patients with
   corticobasal syndrome. Notably, the emotion processing disturbance
   persisted even after controlling for face processing deficits. In
   contrast, patients with Alzheimer's disease were impaired on high-level
   complex and cognitively demanding emotion recognition tasks (Ekman 60,
   The Awareness of Social Inference Test) only. Neuroimaging analyses
   using FreeSurfer revealed that emotion processing deficits in
   corticobasal syndrome were associated with basal ganglia volume loss as
   well as cortical thinning of the left paracentral gyrus/precuneus
   region. In Alzheimer's disease, however, emotion processing deficits
   were associated with atrophy in a different set of brain regions,
   including the right cingulate and the bilateral insulae, as well as the
   hippocampi, right amygdala and nucleus accumbens bilaterally. Our
   results demonstrate that patients with corticobasal syndrome experience
   widespread deficits in emotion processing, and these deficits are
   related to changes in brain regions known to be crucial for emotion
   processing. These findings have important clinical implications for the
   treatment and management of these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Androgens, estrogens, and sex chromosomes are the major influences
   guiding sex differences in brain development, yet their relative roles
   and importance remain unclear. Individuals with complete androgen
   insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) offer a unique opportunity to address
   these issues. Although women with CAIS have a Y chromosome, testes, and
   produce male-typical levels of androgens, they lack functional androgen
   receptors preventing responding to their androgens. Thus, they develop a
   female physical phenotype, are reared as girls, and develop into women.
   Because sexually differentiated brain development in primates is
   determined primarily by androgens, but may be affected by sex chromosome
   complement, it is currently unknown whether brain structure and function
   in women with CAIS is more like that of women or men. In the first
   functional neuroimaging study of (46,XY) women with CAIS, typical
   (46,XX) women, and typical (46, XY) men, we found that men showed
   greater amygdala activation to sexual images than did either typical
   women or women with CAIS. Typical women and women with CATS had highly
   similar patterns of brain activation, indicating that a Y chromosome is
   insufficient for male-typical human brain responses. Because women with
   CAIS produce male-typical or elevated levels of testosterone which is
   aromatized to estradiol these results rule out aromatization of
   testosterone to estradiol as a determinate of sex differences in
   patterns of brain activation to sexual images. We cannot, however, rule
   out an effect of social experience on the brain responses of women with
   CAIS as all were raised as girls. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights

Abstract = {{Managers may rely on emotional reactions to a setting to the detriment
   of economic considerations ({''}System 1 processing{''}), resulting in
   decisions that are costly for firms. While economic theory prescribes
   performance-based incentives to align goals and induce effort,
   psychology theory suggests that the salience of emotions is difficult to
   overcome without also inducing more deliberate consideration of both
   emotional and economic factors ({''}System 2 processing{''}). We link
   these perspectives by investigating whether performance-based incentives
   mitigate the costly influence of emotion by inducing more System 2
   processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and traditional
   experiments, we investigate managers' brain activity and choices under
   fixed wage and performance-based contracts. Under both, brain regions
   associated with System 1 processing are more active when emotion is
   present. Relative to fixed wage contracts, performance-based contracts
   induce System 2 processing in emotional contexts beyond that observed
   absent emotion, and decrease the proportion of economically costly
   choices.}},

Title = {{Separate neural representations for physical pain and social rejection}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Current theories suggest that physical pain and social rejection share
   common neural mechanisms, largely by virtue of overlapping functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity. Here we challenge this
   notion by identifying distinct multivariate fMRI patterns unique to pain
   and rejection. Sixty participants experience painful heat and warmth and
   view photos of ex-partners and friends on separate trials. FMRI pattern
   classifiers discriminate pain and rejection from their respective
   control conditions in out-of-sample individuals with 92\% and 80\%
   accuracy. The rejection classifier performs at chance on pain, and vice
   versa. Pain- and rejection-related representations are uncorrelated
   within regions thought to encode pain affect (for example, dorsal
   anterior cingulate) and show distinct functional connectivity with other
   regions in a separate resting-state data set (N = 91). These findings
   demonstrate that separate representations underlie pain and rejection
   despite common fMRI activity at the gross anatomical level. Rather than
   co-opting pain circuitry, rejection involves distinct affective
   representations in humans.}},

Title = {{Automatic processing of taxonomic and thematic relations in semantic
   priming - Differentiation by early N400 and late frontal negativity}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Most current models of knowledge organization are based on hierarchical
   (plant-pine) or taxonomic categories (animal-plant). Another important
   organizational pattern is thematic categories, which performs external
   or complementary roles in the same scenario or event (bee-honey). The
   goal of this study was to explore the processing of hierarchical
   categories and thematic categories under automatic processing conditions
   that minimize strategic influences. The Evoked response potential (ERP)
   procedure was used to examine the time course of semantic priming for
   category members with a short stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 300 ms
   as participants performed a lexical decision task. Six experimental
   conditions were compared: hierarchical relations (offspring-grandson),
   internal features (gold-golden), productive relations (bee-honey),
   script relations (room-tenant), unrelated (star-spoon), and non-word
   trials (star-derf). We found faster reaction times for related
   prime-target pairs than unrelated pairs except for productive relations.
   The ERP data showed that an early N400 effect (200-400 ms) was more
   negative for unrelated words than for all related words. Furthermore, a
   frontal negativity (400-550 ms) elicited by productive relations was
   smaller (more positive) than other related words. We suggest that the
   smaller frontal negativity in the processing of productive relations
   indicates their increased salience in knowledge structure compared to
   less prominent hierarchical relations. Indeed, the allocation of
   attentional resources and subsequent recruitment of additional memory
   processing might be two of the hallmarks of thematic relations. (C) 2014

Title = {{Role of the precuneus in the detection of incongruency between tactile
   and visual texture information: A functional MRI study}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{252-262}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Visual clues as to the physical substance of manufactured objects can be
   misleading. For example, a plastic ring can appear to be made of gold.
   However, we can avoid misidentifying an object's substance by comparing
   visual and tactile information. As compared to the spatial properties of
   an object (e.g., orientation), however, little information regarding
   physical object properties (material properties) is shared between
   vision and touch. How can such different kinds of information be
   compared in the brain? One possibility is that the visuo-tactile
   comparison of material information is mediated by associations that are
   previously learned between the two modalities. Previous studies suggest
   that a cortical network involving the medial temporal lobe and precuneus
   plays a critical role in the retrieval of information from long-term
   memory. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   test whether these brain regions are involved in the visuo-tactile
   comparison of material properties. The stimuli consisted of surfaces in
   which an oriented plastic bar was placed on a background texture.
   Twenty-two healthy participants determined whether the orientations of
   visually- and tactually-presented bar stimuli were congruent in the
   orientation conditions, and whether visually- and tactually-presented
   background textures were congruent in the texture conditions. The
   texture conditions revealed greater activation of the fusiform gyrus,
   medial temporal lobe and lateral prefrontal cortex compared with the
   orientation conditions. In the texture conditions, the precuneus showed
   greater response to incongruent stimuli than to congruent stimuli. This
   incongruency effect was greater for the texture conditions than for the
   orientation conditions. These results suggest that the precuneus is
   involved in detecting incongruency between tactile and visual texture
   information in concert with the medial temporal lobe, which is tightly
   linked with long-term memory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{289-299}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The ability to recognize subtle facial expressions can be valuable in
   social interaction to infer emotions and intentions of others. Research
   has shown that the personality trait of alexithymia is linked to
   difficulties labeling facial expressions especially when these are
   presented with temporal constraints. The present study investigates the
   neural mechanisms underlying this deficit. 50 young healthy volunteers
   had to label briefly presented (<= 100 ms) emotional (happy, angry,
   fearful) facial expressions masked by a neutral expression while
   undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A multi-method
   approach (20-Item Toronto Alexithymia Scale and Toronto Structured
   Interview for Alexithymia) was administered to assess alexithymic
   tendencies. Behavioral results point to a global deficit of alexithymic
   individuals in labeling brief facial expressions. Alexithymia was
   related to decreased response of the ventral striatum to negative facial
   expressions. Moreover, alexithymia was associated with lowered
   activation in frontal, temporal and occipital cortices. Our data suggest
   that alexithymic individuals have difficulties in creating appropriate
   representations of the emotional state of other persons under temporal
   constraints. These deficiencies could lead to problems in labeling other
   people's facial emotions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Prior knowledge is known to influence the encoding of new events.
   Specifically, recent theoretical frameworks suggest that positively
   correlated hippocampus (HC)-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity is
   involved in creating enduring traces of events inconsistent with our
   prior knowledge. Events that are consistent with our schemas are
   suggested to be encoded via mPFC-cortical interactions. Previous studies
   examined differences in functional connectivity between subsequently
   remembered and forgotten items, but the source of these differences was
   not addressed. Therefore, the involvement of the inter-regions
   functional connectivity in subsequent remembering or subsequent
   forgetting of events is unknown. In this study, in addition to probing
   for a remembered-forgotten difference in functional connectivity, we
   also examined how connectivity differed from baseline in each of the
   memory conditions. At encoding, the participants were presented with
   pairs of semantically related (schema-consistent) and semantically
   unrelated (schema-inconsistent) words. A surprise recognition test was
   administered, and a subsequent memory analysis evaluating potential
   interactions with the HC and mPFC was conducted. Consistent with the
   suggested frameworks, subsequent memory modulated HC-mPFC connectivity
   only in schema-inconsistent events. Importantly, the HC and mPFC were
   positively correlated with respect to subsequently remembered
   schema-inconsistent items, whereas the subsequently forgotten
   schema-inconsistent events did not differ from baseline. We also found
   that positively correlated activity of the mPFC with visual and parietal
   regions mediated subsequent memory of schema-inconsistent items.
   Therefore, inconsistent events may be encoded by a network of cortical
   and medial temporal lobe regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{How does our brain organize knowledge? Traditional theories assume that
   our knowledge is represented abstractly in an amodal conceptual network
   of formal logic symbols. The theory of embodied cognition challenges
   this view and argues that conceptual representations that constitute our
   knowledge are grounded in sensory and motor experiences. We tested this
   hypothesis by examining how the concept of social coordination is
   grounded metaphorically in the tactile sensation of roughness.
   Participants experienced rough or smooth touch before being asked to
   judge an ambiguous social interaction. Results revealed that rough touch
   made social interactions appear more difficult and adversarial,
   consistent with the rough metaphor. This impact of tactile cues on
   social impressions was accompanied by a network including primary and
   secondary somatosensory cortices, amygdala, hippocampus and inferior
   prefrontal cortex. Thus, the roughness of tactile stimulation affected
   metaphor-relevant (but not metaphor-irrelevant) behavioral and neural
   responses. Receiving touch from a rough object seems to trigger the
   application of associated ontological concepts (or scaffolds) even for
   unrelated people and situations (but not to unrelated or more general
   feelings). Since this priming was based on somatosensory brain areas,
   our results provide support for the theory that sensorimotor grounding
   is intrinsic to cognitive processes.}},

Abstract = {{Depending on threat proximity, different defensive behaviours are
   mediated by a descending neural network involving forebrain (distal
   threat) vs midbrain areas (proximal threat). Compared to healthy
   subjects, it can be assumed that phobics are characterized by shortened
   defensive distances on a behavioural and neural level. This study aimed
   at characterizing defensive reactivity in two subtypes of specific
   phobia {[}snake (SP) and dental phobics (DP)]. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), n = 39 subjects (13 healthy controls, HC; 13
   SP; 13 DP) underwent an event-related fMRI task employing an
   anticipation (5-10 s) and immediate perception phase (phobic pictures
   and matched neutral stimuli; 1250 ms) to modulate defensive distance.
   Although no differential brain activity in any comparisons was observed
   in DP, areas associated with defensive behaviours (e.g. amygdala,
   hippocampus, midbrain) were activated in SP. Decreasing defensive
   distance in SP was characterized by a shift to midbrain activity.
   Present findings substantiate differences between phobia types in their
   physiological and neural organization that can be expanded to early
   stages of defensive behaviours. Findings may contribute to a better
   understanding of the dynamic organization of defensive reactivity in
   different types of phobic fear.}},

Abstract = {{Proneness to specific moral sentiments (e.g. pride, gratitude, guilt,
   indignation) has been linked with individual variations in functional
   MRI (fMRI) response within anterior brain regions whose lesion leads to
   inappropriate behaviour. However, the role of structural anatomical
   differences in rendering individuals prone to particular moral
   sentiments relative to others is unknown. Here, we investigated grey
   matter volumes (VBM8) and proneness to specific moral sentiments on a
   well-controlled experimental task in healthy individuals. Individuals
   with smaller cuneus, and precuneus volumes were more pride-prone,
   whereas those with larger right inferior temporal volumes experienced
   gratitude more readily. Although the primary analysis detected no
   associations with guilt- or indignation-proneness, subgenual cingulate
   fMRI responses to guilt were negatively correlated with grey matter
   volumes in the left superior temporal sulcus and anterior dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortices (right > left). This shows that individual
   variations in functional activations within critical areas for moral
   sentiments were not due to grey matter volume differences in the same
   areas. Grey matter volume differences between healthy individuals may
   nevertheless play an important role by affecting posterior cortical
   brain systems that are non-critical but supportive for the experience of
   specific moral sentiments. This may be of particular relevance when
   their experience depends on visuo-spatial elaboration.}},

Abstract = {{The different temporal dynamics of emotions are critical to understand
   their evolutionary role in the regulation of interactions with the
   surrounding environment. Here, we investigated the temporal dynamics
   underlying the perception of four basic emotions from complex scenes
   varying in valence and arousal (fear, disgust, happiness and sadness)
   with the millisecond time resolution of Electroencephalography (EEG).
   Event-related potentials were computed and each emotion showed a
   specific temporal profile, as revealed by distinct time segments of
   significant differences from the neutral scenes. Fear perception
   elicited significant activity at the earliest time segments, followed by
   disgust, happiness and sadness. Moreover, fear, disgust and happiness
   were characterized by two time segments of significant activity, whereas
   sadness showed only one long-latency time segment of activity.
   Multidimensional scaling was used to assess the correspondence between
   neural temporal dynamics and the subjective experience elicited by the
   four emotions in a subsequent behavioral task. We found a high coherence
   between these two classes of data, indicating that psychological
   categories defining emotions have a close correspondence at the brain
   level in terms of neural temporal dynamics. Finally, we localized the
   brain regions of time-dependent activity for each emotion and time
   segment with the low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Fear
   and disgust showed widely distributed activations, predominantly in the
   right hemisphere. Happiness activated a number of areas mostly in the
   left hemisphere, whereas sadness showed a limited number of active areas
   at late latency. The present findings indicate that the neural signature
   of basic emotions can emerge as the byproduct of dynamic spatiotemporal
   brain networks as investigated with millisecond-range resolution, rather
   than in time-independent areas involved uniquely in the processing one
   specific emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Although evolution has shaped human infant crying and the corresponding
   response from caregivers, there is marked variation in paternal
   involvement and caretaking behavior, highlighting the importance of
   understanding the neurobiology supporting optimal paternal responses to
   cries. We explored the neural response to infant cries in fathers of
   children aged 1-2, and its relationship with hormone levels, variation
   in the androgen receptor (AR) gene, parental attitudes and parental
   behavior. Although number of AR CAG trinucleotide repeats was positively
   correlated with neural activity in brain regions important for empathy
   (anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus), restrictive attitudes were
   inversely correlated with neural activity in these regions and with
   regions involved with emotion regulation (orbitofrontal cortex).
   Anterior insula activity had a non-linear relationship with paternal
   caregiving, such that fathers with intermediate activation were most
   involved. These results suggest that restrictive attitudes may be
   associated with decreased empathy and emotion regulation in response to
   a child in distress, and that moderate anterior insula activity reflects
   an optimal level of arousal that supports engaged fathering.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations of fear conditioning in rodents and humans have
   illuminated the neural mechanisms of fear acquisition and extinction.
   However, the neural mechanism of memory consolidation of fear
   conditioning is not well understood. To address this question, we
   measured brain activity and the changes in functional connectivity
   following fear acquisition using resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. The amygdala-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
   and hippocampus-insula functional connectivity were enhanced, whereas
   the amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) functional coupling was
   decreased during fear memory consolidation. Furthermore, the
   amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity was negatively correlated with the
   subjective fear ratings. These findings suggest the amygdala functional
   connectivity with dACC and mPFC may play an important role in memory
   consolidation of fear conditioning. The change of amygdala-mPFC
   functional connectivity could predict the subjective fear. Accordingly,
   this study provides a new perspective for understanding fear memory
   consolidation.}},

Abstract = {{Social information influences decision-making through an integration of
   information derived from individual experience with that derived from
   observing the actions of others. This raises the question as to which
   extent one should utilize social information. One strategy is to make
   use of uncertainty estimates, leading to a copy-when-uncertain strategy
   that weights information from individual and social sources based on
   their respective reliabilities. Here, we investigate this integration
   process by extending models of Bayes optimal integration of sensory
   information to a social decision context. We then use a key parameter of
   our behavioral model in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to identify the neural substrate that is specifically linked to
   the fidelity of this integration process. We show that individuals
   behave near Bayes optimal when integrating two distinct sources of
   social information but systematically deviate from Bayes optimal choice
   when integrating individual with social information. This systematic
   behavioral deviation from optimality is linked to activity of left
   inferior frontal gyrus. Thus, an ability to optimally exploit social
   information depends on processes that overcome an egocentric bias, and
   this regulatory role involves the left inferior prefrontal cortex. The
   findings provide a mechanistic explanation for observations wherein
   individuals neglect the benefits from exploiting social information.}},

Abstract = {{According to terror management theory, self-esteem serves as a buffer
   against existential anxiety. This proposition is well supported
   empirically, but its neuronal underpinnings are poorly understood.
   Therefore, in the present neuroimaging study, our aim was to test how
   self-esteem affects our neural circuitry activation when death-related
   material is processed. Consistent with previous findings, the bilateral
   insula responded less to death-related stimuli relative to similarly
   unpleasant, but death-unrelated sentences, an effect that might reflect
   a decrease in the sense of oneself in the face of existential threat. In
   anterior parts of the insula, this `deactivation' effect was more
   pronounced for high self-esteem individuals, suggesting that the insula
   might be of core importance to understanding the anxiety-buffering
   effect of self-esteem. In addition, low self-esteem participants
   responded with enhanced activation to death-related over unpleasant
   stimuli in bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal and medial orbitofrontal
   cortex, suggesting that regulating death-related thoughts might be more
   effortful to these individuals. Together, this suggests that the
   anxiety-buffering effect of self-esteem might be implemented in the
   brain in the form of both insula-dependent awareness mechanisms and
   prefrontal cortex-dependent regulation mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{While watching movies, the brain integrates the visual information and
   the musical soundtrack into a coherent percept. Multisensory integration
   can lead to emotion elicitation on which soundtrack valences may have a
   modulatory impact. Here, dynamic kissing scenes from romantic comedies
   were presented to 22 participants (13 females) during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging scanning. The kissing scenes were either
   accompanied by happy music, sad music or no music. Evidence from
   cross-modal studies motivated a predefined three-region network for
   multisensory integration of emotion, consisting of fusiform gyrus (FG),
   amygdala (AMY) and anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG). The
   interactions in this network were investigated using dynamic causal
   models of effective connectivity. This revealed bilinear modulations by
   happy and sad music with suppression effects on the connectivity from FG
   and AMY to aSTG. Non-linear dynamic causal modeling showed a suppressive
   gating effect of aSTG on fusiform-amygdalar connectivity. In conclusion,
   fusiform to amygdala coupling strength is modulated via feedback through
   aSTG as region for multisensory integration of emotional material. This
   mechanism was emotion-specific and more pronounced for sad music.
   Therefore, soundtrack valences may modulate emotion elicitation in
   movies by differentially changing preprocessed visual information to the
   amygdala.}},

Abstract = {{Self-concept is deeply affected in schizophrenia. Positive symptoms in
   particular are related to disturbed self/other distinctions. The neural
   networks underlying self-evaluation in schizophrenia have barely been
   investigated. The study reported here involved 13 patients with
   schizophrenia and 13 matched controls. During functional MRI,
   participants decided in three conditions whether the presented positive
   and negative personality traits characterized themselves, an intimate
   person, or included a certain letter. Based on the responses, each
   experimental condition was designed using a flexible factorial model.
   Controls and patients showed a similar behavioral pattern during
   self-evaluation, with group comparison revealing decreased activation in
   patients in the left inferior temporal gyrus and both temporal poles
   during self-ascription of traits, and in the anterior medial prefrontal
   cortex during evaluation of an intimate person. In patients, positive
   symptoms correlated positively with brain activation in the left
   parahippocampus during trait self-ascription. Hence, while evaluating
   themselves, schizophrenia patients revealed decreased activation in
   areas related to self-awareness overlapping with networks involved in
   theory of mind, empathy and social knowledge. Moreover, patients' brain
   activation during self-reflection was affected by the current positive
   symptomatology. The close interaction between self and other highlights
   the clinical and social relevance of self-processing deficits in
   schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{An intense fear of abandonment or rejection is a central feature of
   social relationships for individuals with borderline personality
   disorder (BPD). A total of 20 unmedicated BPD patients and 20 healthy
   participants (HC, matched for age and education) played a virtual
   ball-tossing game including the three conditions: exclusion, inclusion
   and a control condition with predefined game rules, whereas cerebral
   activity was assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Subjective experiences of exclusion were assessed after each blocked
   condition. Both groups felt similarly excluded during the exclusion
   condition; however, BPD subjects felt more excluded than HC during the
   inclusion and control conditions. In all three conditions, BPD patients
   showed a stronger engagement of the dorsal anterior cingulate and medial
   prefrontal cortex. For HC, activation in several cerebral regions such
   as the insula and the precuneus differed depending on the interaction
   situation, whereas for BPD subjects activation in these regions was not
   modulated by experimental conditions. Subjects with BPD differed from HC
   in both their subjective reactions to and their neural processing of
   social interaction situations. Our data suggest that individuals with
   BPD have difficulty in discriminating between social situations, and
   tend to hypermentalize during social encounters that are not determined

   concrete, specific and non-evaluative. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the neural bases of these two
   modes of self-focus in relation with brooding, the maladaptive form of
   rumination. Forty-one French-speaking right-handed healthy young adults
   (10 men, mean age +/- s.d.: 21.8 +/- 2.3 years) engaged in analytical
   and experiential self-focus triggered by verbal stimuli during fMRI.
   Brooding was measured with the 22-item Rumination Response Style scale.
   Individuals with lower brooding scores showed greater activation of the
   posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus during analytical than experiential
   self-focus, whereas individuals with higher brooding scores did not.
   This is consistent with the hypothesis that brooding is associated with
   less control over the nature of the self-focus engaged. These findings
   may help to refine our understanding of how rumination promotes
   depression through maladaptive self-focus.}},

Abstract = {{Processing self-related material recruits similar neural networks
   regardless of whether the self-relevance is made explicit or not.
   However, when considering the neural mechanisms that distinctly underlie
   cognitive and affective components of self-reflection, it is still
   unclear whether the same mechanisms are involved when self-reflection is
   explicit or implicit, and how these mechanisms may be modulated by
   individual personality traits, such as self-esteem. In the present
   functional MRI study, 25 participants were exposed to positive and
   negative words that varied with respect to the degree of self-relevance
   for each participant; however, the participants were asked to make a
   judgment about the color of the words. Regions-of-interest analysis
   showed that medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior cingulate
   cortex were associated with gauging the self-relevance of information.
   However, no main effect of valence or an interaction effect between
   self-relevance and valence was observed. Further, positive correlations
   were observed between levels of self-esteem and response within dorsal
   mPFC (dmPFC) both in the contrast positive-high in self-relevance trials
   vs positive-low in self-relevance trials and in the contrast
   negative-low in self-relevance trials vs positive-low in self-relevance
   trials. These results suggested that the activation of dmPFC may be
   particularly associated with the processes of self-positivity bias.}},

Abstract = {{While non-verbal affective voice cues are generally recognized as a
   crucial behavioral guide in any day-to-day conversation their role as a
   powerful source of information may extend well beyond close-up personal
   interactions and include other modes of communication such as written
   discourse or literature as well. Building on the assumption that
   similarities between the different `modes' of voice cues may not only be
   limited to their functional role but may also include cerebral
   mechanisms engaged in the decoding process, the present functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at exploring brain responses
   associated with processing emotional voice signals described in literary
   texts. Emphasis was placed on evaluating `voice' sensitive as well as
   task- and emotion-related modulations of brain activation frequently
   associated with the decoding of acoustic vocal cues. Obtained findings
   suggest that several similarities emerge with respect to the perception
   of acoustic voice signals: results identify the superior temporal,
   lateral and medial frontal cortex as well as the posterior cingulate
   cortex and cerebellum to contribute to the decoding process, with
   similarities to acoustic voice perception reflected in a `voice'-cue
   preference of temporal voice areas as well as an emotion-related
   modulation of the medial frontal cortex and a task-modulated response of
   the lateral frontal cortex.}},

Abstract = {{We examined whether Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for social
   anxiety disorder (SAD) would modify self-reported negative emotion and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging brain responses when reacting to
   and reappraising social evaluation, and tested whether changes would
   predict treatment outcome in 59 patients with SAD who completed CBT or
   waitlist groups. For reactivity, compared to waitlist, CBT resulted in
   (a) increased brain responses in right superior frontal gyrus (SFG),
   inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and middle occipital gyrus (MOG) when
   reacting to social praise, and (b) increases in right SFG and IPL and
   decreases in left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) when reacting
   to social criticism. For reappraisal, compared to waitlist, CBT resulted
   in greater (c) reductions in self-reported negative emotion, and (d)
   increases in brain responses in right SFG and MOG, and decreases in left
   pSTG. A linear regression found that after controlling for CBT-induced
   changes in reactivity and reappraisal negative emotion ratings and brain
   changes in reactivity to praise and criticism, reappraisal of criticism
   brain response changes predicted 24\% of the unique variance in
   CBT-related reductions in social anxiety. Thus, one mechanism underlying
   CBT for SAD may be changes in reappraisal-related brain responses to
   social criticism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A number of recent studies have investigated the neurological substrates
   of Emotional Intelligence (El), but none of them have considered the
   neural correlates of El that are measured using the Schutte Self-Report
   Emotional Intelligence Scale (SSREIS). This scale was developed based on
   the El model of Salovey and Mayer (1990). In the present study, SSREIS
   was adopted to estimate El. Meanwhile, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were used to evaluate the gray matter
   volume (GMV) of 328 university students. Results found positive
   correlations between Monitor of Emotions and VBM measurements in the
   insula and orbitofrontal cortex. In addition, Utilization of Emotions
   was positively correlated with the GMV in the parahippocampal gyros, but
   was negatively correlated with the VBM measurements in the fusiform
   gyrus and middle temporal gyrus. Furthermore, Social Ability had volume
   correlates in the vermis. These findings indicate that the neural
   correlates of the El model, which primarily focuses on the abilities of
   individuals to appraise and express emotions, can also regulate and
   utilize emotions to solve problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Pages = {{268-275}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Eye-movement patterns in `Sally-Anne' tasks reflect humans' ability to
   implicitly process the mental states of others, particularly
   false-beliefs - a key theory of mind (ToM) operation. It has recently
   been proposed that an efficient ToM system, which operates in the
   absence of awareness (implicit ToM, iToM), subserves the analysis of
   belief-like states. This contrasts to consciously available belief
   processing, performed by the explicit ToM system (eToM). The frontal,
   temporal and parietal cortices are engaged when humans explicitly
   `mentalize' about others' beliefs. However, the neural underpinnings of
   implicit false-belief processing and the extent to which they draw on
   networks involved in explicit general-belief processing are unknown.
   Here, participants watched `Sally-Anne' movies while fMRI and
   eye-tracking measures were acquired simultaneously. Participants
   displayed eye-movements consistent with implicit false-belief
   processing. After independently localizing the brain areas involved in
   explicit general-belief processing, only the left anterior superior
   temporal sulcus and precuneus revealed greater
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity for false-relative to true-belief
   trials in our iToM paradigm. No such difference was found for the right
   temporal-parietal junction despite significant activity in this area.
   These findings fractionate brain regions that are associated with
   explicit general ToM reasoning and false-belief processing in the
   absence of awareness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Stochastic geometric network models for groups of functional and

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{473-484}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Structural and functional connectomes are emerging as important
   instruments in the study of normal brain function and in the development
   of new biomarkers for a variety of brain disorders. In contrast to
   single-network studies that presently dominate the (non-connectome)
   network literature, connectome analyses typically examine groups of
   empirical networks and then compare these against standard (stochastic)
   network models. The current practice in connectome studies is to employ
   stochastic network models derived from social science and engineering
   contexts as the basis for the comparison. However, these are not
   necessarily best suited for the analysis of connectomes, which often
   contain groups of very closely related networks, such as occurs with a
   set of controls or a set of patients with a specific disorder. This
   paper studies important extensions of standard stochastic models that
   make them better adapted for analysis of connectomes, and develops new
   statistical fitting methodologies that account for inter-subject
   variations. The extensions explicitly incorporate geometric information
   about a network based on distances and inter/intra hemispherical
   asymmetries (to supplement ordinary degree-distribution information),
   and utilize a stochastic choice of network density levels (for fixed
   threshold networks) to better capture the variance in average
   connectivity among subjects. The new statistical tools introduced here
   allow one to compare groups of networks by matching both their average
   characteristics and the variations among them. A notable finding is that
   connectomes have high ``smallworldness{''} beyond that arising from
   geometric and degree considerations alone. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Social rejection impairs self-regulation, yet the neural mechanisms
   underlying this relationship remain unknown. The right ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) facilitates self-regulation and plays a
   robust role in regulating the distress of social rejection. However,
   recruiting this region's inhibitory function during social rejection may
   come at a self-regulatory cost. As supported by prominent theories of
   self-regulation, we hypothesized that greater rVLPFC recruitment during
   rejection would predict a subsequent self-regulatory imbalance that
   favored reflexive impulses (i.e., cravings), which would then impair
   self-regulation. Supporting our hypotheses, rVLPFC activation during
   social rejection was associated with greater subsequent nucleus
   accumbens (NAcc) activation and lesser functional connectivity between
   the NAcc and rVLPFC to appetitive cues. Over seven days, the effect of
   daily felt rejection on daily self-regulatory impairment was exacerbated
   among participants who showed a stronger rVLPFC response to social
   rejection. This interactive effect was mirrored in the effect of daily
   felt rejection on heightened daily alcohol cravings. Our findings
   suggest that social rejection likely impairs self-regulation by
   recruiting the rVLPFC, which then tips the regulatory balance towards
   reward-based impulses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Perceivers extractmultiple social dimensions from another's face (e. g.,
   race, emotion), and these dimensions can become linked due to
   stereotypes (e. g., Black individuals. angry). The current research
   examined the neural basis of detecting and resolving conflicts between
   top-down stereotypes and bottom-up visual information in person
   perception. Participants viewed faces congruent and incongruent with
   stereotypes, via variations in race and emotion, while neural activity
   was measured using fMRI. Hand movements en route to race/emotion
   responses were recorded using mouse-tracking to behaviorally index
   individual differences in stereotypical associations during
   categorization. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) showed stronger activation to faces that violated
   stereotypical expectancies at the intersection of multiple social
   categories (i.e., race and emotion). These regions were highly sensitive
   to the degree of incongruency, exhibiting linearly increasing responses
   as race and emotion became stereotypically more incongruent. Further,
   the ACC exhibited greater functional connectivity with the lateral
   fusiform cortex, a region implicated in face processing, when viewing
   stereotypically incongruent (relative to congruent) targets. Finally,
   participants with stronger behavioral tendencies to link race and
   emotion stereotypically during categorization showed greater
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation to stereotypically incongruent
   targets. Together, the findings provide insight into how conflicting
   stereotypes at the nexus of multiple social dimensions are resolved at
   the neural level to accurately perceive other people. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In neurorehabilitation, longitudinal assessment of arm movement related
   brain function in patients with motor disability is challenging due to
   variability in task performance. MRI-compatible robots monitor and
   control task performance, yielding more reliable evaluation of brain
   function over time. The main goals of the present study were first to
   define the brain network activated while performing active and passive
   elbow movements with an MRI-compatible arm robot (MaRIA) in healthy
   subjects, and second to test the reproducibility of this activation over
   time. For the fMRI analysis two models were compared. In model 1
   movement onset and duration were included, whereas in model 2 force and
   range of motion were added to the analysis. Reliability of brain
   activation was tested with several statistical approaches applied on
   individual and group activation maps and on summary statistics. The
   activated network included mainly the primary motor cortex, primary and
   secondary somatosensory cortex, superior and inferior parietal cortex,
   medial and lateral premotor regions, and subcortical structures.
   Reliability analyses revealed robust activation for active movements
   with both fMRI models and all the statistical methods used. Imposed
   passive movements also elicited mainly robust brain activation for
   individual and group activation maps, and reliability was improved by
   including additional force and range of motion using model 2. These
   findings demonstrate that the use of robotic devices, such as MaRIA, can
   be useful to reliably assess arm movement related brain activation in
   longitudinal studies and may contribute in studies evaluating therapies
   and brain plasticity following injury in the nervous system.}},

Abstract = {{Voluntary selective attention can prioritize different features in a
   visual scene. The frontal eye-fields (FEF) are one potential source of
   such feature-specific top-down signals, but causal evidence for
   influences on visual cortex (as was shown for ``spatial{''} attention)
   has remained elusive. Here, we show that transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) applied to right FEF increased the blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) signals in visual areas processing ``target
   feature{''} but not in ``distracter feature{''}aEuro{''}processing
   regions. TMS-induced BOLD signals increase in motion-responsive visual
   cortex (MT+) when motion was attended in a display with moving dots
   superimposed on face stimuli, but in face-responsive fusiform area (FFA)
   when faces were attended to. These TMS effects on BOLD signal in both
   regions were negatively related to performance (on the motion task),
   supporting the behavioral relevance of this pathway. Our findings
   provide new causal evidence for the human FEF in the control of
   nonspatial ``feature{''}-based attention, mediated by dynamic influences
   on feature-specific visual cortex that vary with the currently attended
   property.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Successful emotion regulation partly depends on our capacity
   to modulate emotional responses through the use of cognitive strategies.
   Age may affect the strategies employed most often; thus, we examined
   younger and older adults' neural network connectivity when employing two
   different strategies: cognitive reappraisal and selective attention.
   Method. The current study used psychophysiological interaction analyses
   to examine functional connectivity with a region of anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC) because it is a core part of an emotion regulation network
   showing relative structural preservation with age.
   Results. Functional connectivity between ACC and prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   was greater for reappraisal relative to selective attention and passive
   viewing conditions for both age groups. For younger adults, ACC was more
   strongly connected with lateral dorsolateral PFC, ventrolateral PFC,
   dorsomedial PFC, and posterior cingulate regions during reappraisal. For
   older adults, stronger connectivity during reappraisal was observed
   primarily in ventromedial PFC and orbitofrontal cortex.
   Discussion. Our results suggest that although young and older adults
   engage PFC networks during regulation, and particularly during
   reappraisal, the regions within these networks might differ.
   Additionally, these results clarify that, despite prior evidence for
   age-related declines in the structure and function of those regions,
   older adults are able to recruit ACC and PFC regions as part of coherent
   network during emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Mentalizing deficits are a hallmark of the autism spectrum
   condition (ASC) and a potential endopheno-type for atypical social
   cognition in ASC. Differences in performance and neural activation on
   the `Reading the Mind in the Eyes' task (the Eyes task) have been
   identified in individuals with ASC in previous studies.
   Method. Performance on the Eyes task along with the associated neural
   activation was examined in adolescents with ASC (n=50), their unaffected
   siblings (n=40) and typically developing controls (n=40). Based on prior
   literature that males and females with ASC display different cognitive
   and associated neural characteristics, analyses were stratified by sex.
   Three strategies were applied to test for endophenotypes at the level of
   neural activation: (1) identifying and locating conjunctions of
   ASC-control and sibling-control differences; (2) examining whether the
   sibling group is comparable to the ASC or intermediate between the ASC
   and control groups; and (3) examining spatial overlaps between
   ASC-control and sibling-control differences across multiple thresholds.
   Results. Impaired behavioural performance on the Eyes task was observed
   in males with ASC compared to controls, but only at trend level in
   females; and no difference in performance was identified between sibling
   and same-sex control groups in both sexes. Neural activation showed a
   substantial endophenotype effect in the female groups but this was only
   modest in the male groups.
   Conclusions. Behavioural impairment on complex emotion recognition
   associated with mental state attribution is a phenotypic, rather than an
   endophenotypic, marker of ASC. However, the neural response during the
   Eyes task is a potential endophenotypic marker for ASC, particularly in
   females.}},

Abstract = {{Background. What determines inter-individual variability to impairments
   in behavioural control that may underlie road-traffic accidents, and
   impulsive and violent behaviours occurring under the influence of
   cannabis, the most widely used illicit drug worldwide?
   Method. Employing a double-blind, repeated-measures design, we
   investigated the genetic and neural basis of variable sensitivity to
   cannabis-induced behavioural dyscontrol in healthy occasional cannabis
   users. Acute oral challenge with placebo or.9-tetrahydrocannabinol
   (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, was combined with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, while participants performed a
   response inhibition task that involved inhibiting a prepotent motor
   response. They were genotyped for rs1130233 single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) of the protein kinase B (AKT1) gene.
   Results. Errors of inhibition were significantly (p=0.008) increased
   following administration of THC in carriers of the A allele, but not in
   G allele homozygotes of the AKT1 rs1130233 SNP. The A allele carriers
   also displayed attenuation of left inferior frontal response with THC
   evident in the sample as a whole, while there was a modest enhancement
   of inferior frontal activation in the G homozygotes. There was a direct
   relationship (r=-0.327, p=0.045) between the behavioural effect of THC
   and its physiological effect in the inferior frontal gyrus, where AKT1
   genotype modulated the effect of THC.
   Conclusions. These results require independent replication and show that
   differing vulnerability to acute psychomotor impairments induced by
   cannabis depends on variation in a gene that influences dopamine
   function, and is mediated through modulation of the effect of cannabis
   on the inferior frontal cortex, that is rich in dopaminergic innervation
   and critical for psychomotor control.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesBoth patients with pediatric bipolar disorder (BD) and
   unaffected youth at familial risk (AR) for the illness show impairments
   in face emotion labeling. Few studies, however, have examined brain
   regions engaged in AR youth when processing emotional faces. Moreover,
   studies have yet to explore neural responsiveness to subtle changes in
   face emotion in AR youth.
   MethodsSixty-four unrelated youth, including 20 patients with BD, 15
   unaffected AR youth, and 29 healthy comparisons (HC), completed
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Neutral faces were morphed with
   angry or happy faces in 25\% intervals. In specific phases of the task,
   youth alternatively made explicit (hostility) or implicit (nose width)
   ratings of the faces. The slope of blood oxygenated level-dependent
   activity was calculated across neutral to angry and neutral to happy
   face stimuli.
   ResultsBehaviorally, both subjects with BD (p0.001) and AR youth (p0.05)
   rated faces as less hostile relative to HC. Consistent with this, in
   response to increasing anger on the face, patients with BD and AR youth
   showed decreased modulation in the amygdala and inferior frontal gyrus
   (IFG; BA 46) compared to HC (all p0.05). Amygdala dysfunction was
   present across both implicit and explicit rating conditions, but IFG
   modulation deficits were specific to the explicit condition. With
   increasing happiness, AR youth showed aberrant modulation in the IFG,
   which was also sensitive to task demands (all p0.05).
   ConclusionsDecreased amygdala and IFG modulation in patients with BD and
   AR youth may be pathophysiological risk markers for BD, and may underlie
   the social cognition and face emotion labeling deficits observed in BD
   and AR youth.}},

Abstract = {{Similarities and differences between obesity and addiction are a
   prominent topic of ongoing research. We conducted an activation
   likelihood estimation meta-analysis on 87 studies in order to map the
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to reward in
   participants with obesity, substance addiction and non-substance (or
   behavioural) addiction, and to identify commonalities and differences
   between them. Our study confirms the existence of alterations during
   reward processing in obesity, non-substance addiction and substance
   addiction. Specifically, participants with obesity or with addictions
   differed from controls in several brain regions including prefrontal
   areas, subcortical structures and sensory areas. Additionally,
   participants with obesity and substance addictions exhibited similar
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent fMRI hyperactivity in the amygdala and
   striatum when processing either general rewarding stimuli or the
   problematic stimuli (food and drug-related stimuli, respectively). We
   propose that these similarities may be associated with an enhanced focus
   on reward - especially with regard to food or drug-related stimuli - in
   obesity and substance addiction. Ultimately, this enhancement of reward
   processes may facilitate the presence of compulsive-like behaviour in
   some individuals or under some specific circumstances. We hope that
   increasing knowledge about the neurobehavioural correlates of obesity
   and addictions will lead to practical strategies that target the high
   prevalence of these central public health challenges.}},

   regions potentially representing increased complexity and subjective
   emotional experience. Furthermore, context effects were modulated by

Abstract = {{Objectives: Empirical evidence suggests substance dependence creates
   stress system dysregulation which, in turn, may limit the efficacy of
   verbal-based treatment interventions, as the recovering brain may not be
   functionally capable of executive level processing. Treatment models

   Methods: An RCT was conducted to examine the effects of a
   dual-processing (DP) intervention compared to a didactic standard care
   (RP) model on brain function change in substance-dependent adults
   (N=29).
   Results: fMRI analyses showed decreased amygdala activation simultaneous
   with increased frontal lobe (medial frontal gyrus and ACC) activation in
   the DP group during passive watch condition, while the RP group showed
   continued amygdala activation simultaneous to frontal lobe activation
   during drug stressor presentation at post-treatment.
   Conclusions: Our study offers preliminary evidence that DP acts on
   neural functioning in ways that increase regulatory response in the
   presence of drug stressor cues by enhancing top-down functioning and
   diminishing amygdala reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{Early identification of dyslexia would be fundamental to prevent the
   negative consequences of delayed treatment in the social, psychological
   and occupational domains. Movement-related potentials of dyslexic
   children are characterized by inadequate ability to program movements
   and reduced capacity to evaluate their performance and to correct their
   errors. Reading-related potentials recorded during different reading
   conditions elicit a series of positive and negative components with
   specific functional meaning and with a characteristic spatial temporal
   pattern. These reading-related potentials, when analyzed with sLORETA,
   show significantly different patterns of activation when comparing
   self-paced reading aloud to passive viewing of single letters.
   Comparison of fMRI and sLORETA during both tasks showed that the
   cortical region with the widest inter-modality similarities is the
   middle-superior temporal lobe during self-paced reading aloud.
   Neuropsychological studies have shown the existence of clinical subtypes
   of dyslexia; these studies have been confirmed by the results of ICA
   applied to the EEG. Dyslexia can be defined as a disorder of programming
   and integrating ideokinetic elements, associated with a deficiency in
   the fast processing and integration of sensory information, with reduced
   efficiency of error systems analysis. Each of these phenomena occurs at
   different levels of the central nervous system and at different times.

Abstract = {{Humans automatically imitate other people's actions during social
   interactions, building rapport and social closeness in the process.
   Although the behavioral consequences and neural correlates of imitation
   have been studied extensively, little is known about the neural
   mechanisms that control imitative tendencies. For example, the degree to
   which an agent is perceived as human-like influences automatic
   imitation, but it is not known how perception of animacy influences
   brain circuits that control imitation. In the current fMRI study, we
   examined how the perception and belief of animacy influence the control
   of automatic imitation. Using an imitation-inhibition paradigm that
   involves suppressing the tendency to imitate an observed action, we
   manipulated both bottom-up (visual input) and top-down (belief) cues to
   animacy. Results show divergent patterns of behavioral and neural
   responses. Behavioral analyses show that automatic imitation is
   equivalent when one or both cues to animacy are present but reduces when
   both are absent. By contrast, right TPJ showed sensitivity to the
   presence of both animacy cues. Thus, we demonstrate that right TPJ is
   biologically tuned to control imitative tendencies when the observed
   agent both looks like and is believed to be human. The results suggest
   that right TPJ may be involved in a specialized capacity to control
   automatic imitation of human agents, rather than a universal process of
   conflict management, which would be more consistent with generalist
   theories of imitative control. Evidence for specialized neural circuitry
   that controls imitation offers new insight into developmental disorders
   that involve atypical processing of social information, such as autism
   spectrum disorders.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, an explosion of neuroimaging studies has examined
   cognitive reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy that involves
   changing the way one thinks about a stimulus in order to change its
   affective impact. Existing models broadly agree that reappraisal
   recruits frontal and parietal control regions to modulate emotional
   responding in the amygdala, but they offer competing visions of how this
   is accomplished. One view holds that control regions engage ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), an area associated with fear extinction, that
   in turn modulates amygdala responses. An alternative view is that
   control regions modulate semantic representations in lateral temporal
   cortex that indirectly influence emotion-related responses in the
   amygdala. Furthermore, while previous work has emphasized the amygdala,
   whether reappraisal influences other regions implicated in emotional
   responding remains unknown. To resolve these questions, we performed a
   meta-analysis of 48 neuroimaging studies of reappraisal, most involving
   downregulation of negative affect. Reappraisal consistently 1) activated
   cognitive control regions and lateral temporal cortex, but not vmPFC,
   and 2) modulated the bilateral amygdala, but no other brain regions.
   This suggests that reappraisal involves the use of cognitive control to
   modulate semantic representations of an emotional stimulus, and these
   altered representations in turn attenuate activity in the amygdala.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional intelligence (EI) is a multi-faceted construct consisting of
   our ability to perceive, monitor, regulate and use emotions. Despite
   much attention being paid to the neural substrates of EI, little is
   known of the spontaneous brain activity associated with EI during
   resting state. We used resting-state fMRI to investigate the association
   between the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and EI in a
   large sample of young, healthy adults. We found that EI was
   significantly associated with ALFFs in key nodes of two networks: the
   social emotional processing network (the fusiform gyrus, right superior
   orbital frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus and left inferior
   parietal lobule) and the cognitive control network (the bilateral
   pre-SMA, cerebellum and right precuneus). These findings suggest that
   the neural correlates of EI involve several brain regions in two crucial
   networks, which reflect the core components of EI: emotion perception
   and emotional control.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies of language have typically focused on either
   production or comprehension of single speech utterances such as
   syllables, words, or sentences. In this study we used a new approach to
   functional MRI acquisition and analysis to characterize the neural
   responses during production and comprehension of complex real-life
   speech. First, using a time-warp based intrasubject correlation method,
   we identified all areas that are reliably activated in the brains of
   speakers telling a 15-min-long narrative. Next, we identified areas that
   are reliably activated in the brains of listeners as they comprehended
   that same narrative. This allowed us to identify networks of brain
   regions specific to production and comprehension, as well as those that
   are shared between the two processes. The results indicate that
   production of a real-life narrative is not localized to the left
   hemisphere but recruits an extensive bilateral network, which overlaps
   extensively with the comprehension system. Moreover, by directly
   comparing the neural activity time courses during production and
   comprehension of the same narrative we were able to identify not only
   the spatial overlap of activity but also areas in which the neural
   activity is coupled across the speaker's and listener's brains during
   production and comprehension of the same narrative. We demonstrate
   widespread bilateral coupling between production-and
   comprehension-related processing within both linguistic and
   nonlinguistic areas, exposing the surprising extent of shared processes
   across the two systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background The hippocampus and annygdala exhibit structural and
   functional alterations in patients with depression. The objective of
   this study was to investigate the structural and functional
   relationships between these core regions.
   Methods Based on the severity of their condition, 60 patients and 20
   healthy controls were equally divided into four groups (mild group,
   moderate group, major group and health controls group), scanned by
   T1-MR, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and susceptibility
   weighted imaging (SWI). Structural image, BOLD image, and SWI image were
   collected for processing and analysis. The characteristics of the
   depression and controls were checked by analysis of variance test, and
   the difference between groups was checked by Dunnett's test.
   Results The volume of hippocampus and amygdala varied with the severity
   of the condition. The signal obtained under the stimulation of negative
   events was linearly decreased in the mild, moderate and major groups
   revealed by fMRI. The length and diameter of the lateral ventricle vein
   was reduced in the mild group, whereas the number of branches increased.
   In the moderate and major groups, the reduction in the length, diameter
   and increase in the number of branches of the lateral ventricle vein
   were greater.
   Conclusion The alterations of the volume, fMRI, and cerebral veins in
   these core regions may account for the causal relationship between
   structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{Bilinguals exhibit a feat to control their two languages in
   conversation. The neural substrates of bilingual language control have
   been well investigated with language switching paradigm. Yet, most of
   those studies have taken single lexical items (i.e., words outside a
   context) as the investigative tool. In the present study, we examined
   the neural substrates of in-context language control in unbalanced
   bilinguals with a sentence-end switching paradigm. Our results showed
   that in-context language control in bilinguals recruited the neural
   mechanisms that were similar in kind to those responsible for cognitive
   control in general. When the direction of switching was considered, we
   found that backward switching called for more cognitive/language control
   relative to forward switching. Behaviorally, symmetric switching costs
   were found regardless of the switching factor (switching vs.
   non-switching) and the language factor (L1 vs. L2). We interpreted our
   imaging and behavioral results as the effects of context when unbalanced
   bilinguals controlled their two languages in a context (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{145-160}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{We introduce matched-filter fMRI, which improves BOLD (blood oxygen
   level dependent) sensitivity by variable density image acquisition
   tailored to subsequent image smoothing. Image smoothing is an
   established post-processing technique used in the vast majority of fMRI
   studies. Here we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting
   smoothed data can be substantially increased by acquisition weighting
   with a weighting function that matches the k-space filter imposed by the
   smoothing operation. We derive the theoretical SNR advantage of this
   strategy and propose a practical implementation of 2D echo-planar
   acquisition matched to common Gaussian smoothing. To reliably perform
   the involved variable-speed trajectories, concurrent magnetic field
   monitoring with NMR probes is used. Using this technique, phantom and in
   vivo measurements confirm reliable SNR improvement in the order of 30\%
   in a ``resting-state{''} condition and prove robust in different regimes
   of physiological noise. Furthermore, a preliminary task-based visual
   fMRI experiment equally suggests a consistent BOLD sensitivity increase
   in terms of statistical sensitivity (average t-value increase of about
   35\%). In summary, our study suggests that matched-filter acquisition is
   an effective means of improving BOLD SNR in studies that rely on image
   smoothing at the post-processing level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{271-289}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that the P3b component of event-related potentials
   (ERPs) reflects linking of responses to target stimuli. This proposal
   was tested by disconnecting the temporal link between target stimuli and
   responses, and by applying residue iteration decomposition (RIDE) for
   separating the ERP components into stimulus-locked, response-locked, and
   ``intermediate{''} clusters. Left or right keys had to be pressed in
   response to frequent (80\%) and rare (20\%) target letters, but
   responses had to wait for ``go{''} signals (appearing in 90\% of
   trials). Between blocks, stimulus-onset asynchronies (SOAs) from targets
   to go-signals varied from 0 ms to 800 ms. Rare targets with their rare
   responses were expected to evoke large P3bs ({''}oddball effect{''}). If
   related to stimulus processing only, this effect will be equally large
   across all SOAs and will be modeled by RIDE's stimulus-cluster. If
   related to response initiation only, the oddball effect will be evoked
   by go-signals rather than by targets and will be modeled by RIDE's
   response-cluster. If indicating integration of rare stimuli with their
   rare responses, the oddball effect will be evoked by targets but will be
   reduced and stretched in time across SOAs and will be modeled by RIDE's
   intermediate cluster. RIDE analysis confirmed this latter view, for the
   most part. SOA effects matched best, though not perfectly, predictions
   made by the stimulus-response-link view. These results call for a
   refined account of the oddball effect on P3b in terms of
   stimulus-response coupling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{316-324}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{For successful communication, we need to understand the external world
   consistently with others. This task requires sufficiently similar
   cognitive schemas or psychological perspectives that act as filters to
   guide the selection, interpretation and storage of sensory information,
   perceptual objects and events. Here we show that when individuals adopt
   a similar psychological perspective during natural viewing, their brain
   activity becomes synchronized in specific brain regions. We measured
   brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from 33
   healthy participants who viewed a 10-min movie twice, assuming once a
   `social' (detective) and once a `non-social' (interior decorator)
   perspective to the movie events. Pearson's correlation coefficient was
   used to derive multisubject voxelwise similarity measures (inter-subject
   correlations; ISCs) of functional MRI data. We used k-nearest-neighbor
   and support vector machine classifiers as well as a Mantel test on the
   ISC matrices to reveal brain areas wherein ISC predicted the
   participants' current perspective. ISC was stronger in several brain
   regions-most robustly in the parahippocampal gyrus, posterior parietal
   cortex and lateral occipital cortex-when the participants viewed the
   movie with similar rather than different perspectives. Synchronization
   was not explained by differences in visual sampling of the movies, as
   estimated by eye gaze. We propose that synchronous brain activity across
   individuals adopting similar psychological perspectives could be an
   important neural mechanism supporting shared understanding of the
   environment. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{564-579}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropies in the cortical representation of various stimulus
   parameters can reveal the fundamental mechanisms by which sensory
   properties are analysed and coded by the brain. One example is the
   preference for motion radial to the point of fixation (i.e. centripetal
   or centrifugal) exhibited in mammalian visual cortex. In two
   experiments, this study used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to explore the determinants of these radial biases for motion in
   functionally-defined areas of human early visual cortex, and in
   particular their dependence upon eccentricity which has been indicated
   in recent reports. In one experiment, the cortical response to
   wide-field random dot kinematograms forming 16 different complex motion
   patterns (including centrifugal, centripetal, rotational and spiral
   motion) was measured. The response was analysed according to preferred
   eccentricity within four different eccentricity ranges. Response
   anisotropies were characterised by enhanced activity for centripetal or
   centrifugal patterns that changed systematically with eccentricity in
   visual areas V1-V3 and hV4 (but not V3A/B or V5/MT+). Responses evolved
   from a preference for centrifugal over centripetal patterns close to the
   fovea, to a preference for centripetal over centrifugal at the most
   peripheral region stimulated, in agreement with previous work. These
   effects were strongest in V2 and V3. In a second experiment, the stimuli
   were restricted to within narrow annuli either close to the fovea
   (0.75-1.88 degrees) or further in the periphery (4.82-6.28 degrees), in
   a way that preserved the local motion information available in the first
   experiment. In this configuration a preference for radial motion
   (centripetal or centrifugal) persisted but the dependence upon
   eccentricity disappeared. Again this was clearest in V2 and V3. A novel
   interpretation of the dependence upon eccentricity of motion
   anisotropies in early visual cortex is offered that takes into account
   the spatiotemporal ``predictability{''} of the moving pattern. Such
   stimulus predictability, and its relationship to models of predictive
   coding, has found considerable support in recent years in accounting for
   a number of other perceptual and neural phenomena. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Modeling of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rs-fMRI) data using network models is of increasing interest. It is
   often desirable to group nodes into clusters to interpret the
   communication patterns between nodes. In this study we consider three
   different nonparametric Bayesian models for node clustering in complex
   networks. In particular, we test their ability to predict unseen data
   and their ability to reproduce clustering across datasets. The three
   generative models considered are the Infinite Relational Model (IRM),
   Bayesian Community Detection (BCD), and the Infinite Diagonal Model
   (IDM). The models define probabilities of generating links within and
   between clusters and the difference between the models lies in the
   restrictions they impose upon the between-cluster link probabilities.
   IRM is the most flexible model with no restrictions on the probabilities
   of links between clusters. BCD restricts the between-cluster link
   probabilities to be strictly lower than within-cluster link
   probabilities to conform to the community structure typically seen in
   social networks. IDM only models a single between-cluster link
   probability, which can be interpreted as a background noise probability.
   These probabilistic models are compared against three other approaches
   for node clustering, namely Infomap, Louvain modularity, and
   hierarchical clustering. Using 3 different datasets comprising healthy
   volunteers' rs-fMRI we found that the BCD model was in general the most
   predictive and reproducible model. This suggests that rs-fMRI data
   exhibits community structure and furthermore points to the significance
   of modeling heterogeneous between-cluster link probabilities. (C) 2014

   real-time fMRI neurofeedback: a pilot study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{This pilot study aimed to explore whether criminal psychopaths can learn
   volitional regulation of the left anterior insula with real-time fMRI
   neurofeedback. Our previous studies with healthy volunteers showed that
   learned control of the blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal
   was specific to the target region, and not a result of general arousal
   and global unspecific brain activation, and also that successful
   regulation modulates emotional responses, specifically to aversive
   picture stimuli but not neutral stimuli. In this pilot study, four
   criminal psychopaths were trained to regulate the anterior insula by
   employing negative emotional imageries taken from previous episodes in
   their lives, in conjunction with contingent feedback. Only one out of
   the four participants learned to increase the percent differential BOLD
   in the up-regulation condition across training runs. Subjects with
   higher Psychopathic Checklist-Revised (PCL:SV) scores were less able to
   increase the BOLD signal in the anterior insula than their lower PCL:SV
   counterparts. We investigated functional connectivity changes in the
   emotional network due to learned regulation of the successful
   participant, by employing multivariate Granger Causality Modeling (GCM).
   Learning to up-regulate the left anterior insula not only increased the
   number of connections (causal density) in the emotional network in the
   single successful participant but also increased the difference between
   the number of outgoing and incoming connections (causal flow) of the
   left insula. This pilot study shows modest potential for training
   psychopathic individuals to learn to control brain activity in the
   anterior insula.}},

Title = {{The role of mirroring and mentalizing networks in mediating action
   intentions in autism}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: The ability to interpret agents' intent from their actions
   is a vital skill in successful social interaction. However, individuals
   with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been found to have difficulty
   in attributing intentions to others. The present study investigated the
   neural mechanisms of inferring intentions from actions in individuals
   with ASD.
   Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired
   from 21 high-functioning young adults with ASD and 22 typically
   developing (TD) control participants, while making judgments about the
   means (how an action is performed) and intention (why an action is
   performed) of a model's actions.
   Results: Across both groups of participants, the middle and superior
   temporal cortex, extending to temporoparietal junction, and posterior
   cingulate cortex, responded significantly to inferring the intent of an
   action, while inferior parietal lobule and occipital cortices were
   active for judgments about the means of an action. Participants with ASD
   had significantly reduced activation in calcarine sulcus and
   significantly increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus,
   compared to TD peers, while attending to the intentions of actions.
   Also, ASD participants had weaker functional connectivity between
   frontal and posterior temporal regions while processing intentions.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that processing actions and
   intentions may not be mutually exclusive, with reliance on mirroring and
   mentalizing mechanisms mediating action understanding. Overall,
   inferring information about others' actions involves activation of the
   mirror neuron system and theory-of-mind regions, and this activation
   (and the synchrony between activated brain regions) appears altered in
   young adults with ASD.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Anxiety is associated with increased physiological reactivity
   and also increased ``interoceptive{''} sensitivity to such changes in
   internal bodily arousal. Joint hypermobility, an expression of a common
   variation in the connective tissue protein collagen, is increasingly
   recognized as a risk factor to anxiety and related disorders. This study
   explored the link between anxiety, interoceptive sensitivity and
   hypermobility in a sub-clinical population using neuroimaging and
   psychophysiological evaluation.
   Methods: Thirty-six healthy volunteers undertook interoceptive
   sensitivity tests, a clinical examination for hypermobility and
   completed validated questionnaire measures of state anxiety and body
   awareness tendency. Nineteen participants also performed an emotional
   processing paradigm during functional neuroimaging.
   Results: We confirmed a significant relationship between state anxiety
   score and joint hypermobility. lnteroceptive sensitivity mediated the
   relationship between state anxiety and hypermobility. Hypermobile,
   compared to non-hypermobile, participants displayed heightened neural
   reactivity to sad and angry scenes within brain regions implicated in
   anxious feeling states, notably insular cortex.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight the dependence of anxiety state on
   bodily context, and increase our understanding of the mechanisms through
   which vulnerability to anxiety disorders arises in people bearing a
   common variant of collagen.}},

Title = {{Intention understanding over T: a neuroimaging study on shared
   representations and tennis return predictions}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Studying the way athletes predict actions of their peers during
   fast-ball sports, such as a tennis, has proved to be a valuable tool for
   increasing our knowledge of intention understanding. The working model
   in this area is that the anticipatory representations of others'
   behaviors require internal predictive models of actions formed from
   pre-established and shared representations between the observer and the
   actor. This model also predicts that observers would not be able to read
   accurately the intentions of a competitor if the competitor were to
   perform the action without prior knowledge of their intention until
   moments before the action. To test this hypothesis, we recorded brain
   activity from 25 male tennis players while they performed a novel
   behavioral tennis intention inference task, which included two
   conditions: (i) one condition in which they viewed video clips of a
   tennis athlete who knew in advance where he was about to act/serve
   (initially intended serves) and (ii) one condition in which they viewed
   video clips of that same athlete when he did not know where he was to
   act/serve until the target was specified after he had tossed the ball
   into the air to complete his serve (non-initially intended serves). Our
   results demonstrated that (i) tennis expertise is related to the
   accuracy in predicting where another server intends to serve when that
   server knows where he intends to serve before (but not after) he tosses
   the ball in the air; and (ii) accurate predictions are characterized by
   the recruitment of both cortical areas within the human mirror neuron
   system (that is known to be involved in higher-order (top-down)
   processes of embodied cognition and shared representation) and
   subcortical areas within brain regions involved in procedural memory
   (caudate nucleus). Interestingly, inaccurate predictions instead recruit
   areas known to be involved in low-level (bottom-up) computational
   processes associated with the sense of agency and self-other
   distinction.}},

Title = {{From naturalistic neuroscience to modeling radical embodiment with
   narrative enactive systems}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Mainstream cognitive neuroscience has begun to accept the idea of
   embodied mind, which assumes that the human mind is fundamentally
   constituted by the dynamical interactions of the brain, body, and the
   environment. In today's paradigm of naturalistic neurosciences, subjects
   are exposed to rich contexts, such as video sequences or entire films,
   under relatively controlled conditions, against which researchers can
   interpret changes in neural responses within a time window. However,
   from the point of view of radical embodied cognitive neuroscience, the
   increasing complexity alone will not suffice as the explanatory
   apparatus for dynamical embodiment and situatedness of the mind. We
   suggest that narrative enactive systems with dynamically adaptive
   content as stimuli, may serve better to account for the embodied mind
   engaged with the surrounding world. Among the ensuing challenges for
   neuroimaging studies is how to interpret brain data against broad
   temporal contexts of previous experiences that condition the unfolding

Abstract = {{Introduction: Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides high spatial and
   temporal resolution. In this study we combined EEG and fMRI to
   investigate the structures involved in the processing of different sound
   pressure levels (SPLs).
   Methods: EEG data were recorded simultaneously with fMRI from 16 healthy
   volunteers using MR compatible devices at 3 T. Tones with different SPLs
   were delivered to the volunteers and the N1/P2 amplitudes were included
   as covariates in the fMRI data analysis in order to compare the
   structures activated with high and low SPLs. Analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) and ROI analysis were also performed. Additionally, source
   localisation analysis was performed on the EEG data.
   Results: The integration of averaged ERP parameters into the fMRI
   analysis showed an extended map of areas exhibiting covariation with the
   BOLD signal related to the auditory stimuli. The ANOVA and ROI analyses
   also revealed additional brain areas other than the primary auditory
   cortex (PAC) which were active with the auditory stimulation at
   different SPLs. The source localisation analyses showed additional
   sources apart from the PAC which were active with the high SPLs.
   Discussion: The PAC and the insula play an important role in the
   processing of different SPLs. In the fMRI analysis, additional
   activation was found in the anterior cingulate cortex, opercular and
   orbito-frontal cortices with high SPLs. A strong response of the visual
   cortex was also found with the high SPLs, suggesting the presence of
   cross-modal effects.}},

   An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Neural substrates underlying the human-pet relationship are largely
   unknown. We examined fMRI brain activation patterns as mothers viewed
   images of their own child and dog and an unfamiliar child and dog. There
   was a common network of brain regions involved in emotion, reward,
   affiliation, visual processing and social cognition when mothers viewed
   images of both their child and dog. Viewing images of their child
   resulted in brain activity in the midbrain (ventral tegmental
   area/substantia nigra involved in reward/affiliation), while a more
   posterior cortical brain activation pattern involving fusiform gyrus
   (visual processing of faces and social cognition) characterized a
   mother's response to her dog. Mothers also rated images of their child
   and dog as eliciting similar levels of excitement (arousal) and
   pleasantness (valence), although the difference in the own vs.
   unfamiliar child comparison was larger than the own vs. unfamiliar dog
   comparison for arousal. Valence ratings of their dog were also
   positively correlated with ratings of the attachment to their dog.
   Although there are similarities in the perceived emotional experience
   and brain function associated with the mother-child and mother-dog bond,
   there are also key differences that may reflect variance in the
   evolutionary course and function of these relationships.}},

Volume = {{1583}},

Abstract = {{The neural processing of impulsive behavior is a central topic in
   various clinical and non-clinical contexts. To investigate neural and
   behavioral correlates of the empathic processing of complex social
   scenarios, especially considering ecological validity of the
   experimental procedure, we developed and investigated a video stimulus
   inventory. It includes realistic neutral, social-positive, and
   reactive-aggressive action scenarios. Short video-clips showing these
   social scenarios from a first-person perspective triggering different
   emotional states were presented to a non-clinical sample of 20 young
   adult male participants during fMRI measurements. Both affective
   interaction conditions (social-positive and reactive-aggressive) were
   contrasted against a neutral baseline condition and against each other.
   Behavioral evaluation data largely confirmed the validity of the
   emotion-inducing stimulus material. Reactive-aggressive and
   social-positive interaction scenarios produced widely overlapping fMRI
   activation patterns in hetero-modal association cortices, but also in
   subcortical regions, such as the peri-aqueductal gray.
   Reactive-aggressive compared to social-positive scenarios yielded a more
   anterior distribution of activations in pre-motor and inferior frontal
   brain regions associated to motor-preparation and inhibitory control
   processing as well as in the insula associated to pain and/or
   aversion-processing. We argue that there are both principally common
   neural networks recruited for the processing of reactive-aggressive and
   social-positive scenarios, but also exclusive network parts in
   particular involved depending on individual socialization. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Focused attention has great impact on our quality of life. Our learning,
   social skills and even happiness are closely intertwined with our
   capacity for focused attention. Attention promotion is replete with
   examples of training-induced increases in attention capability, most of
   which rely on visual and auditory stimulation. Pure haptic stimulation
   to increase attention capability is rarely found. We show that accurate
   force control tasks with pure haptic feedback enhance short-term focused
   attention. Participants were trained by a force control task in which
   information from visual and auditory channels was blocked, and only
   haptic feedback was provided. The trainees were asked to exert a target
   force within a pre-defined force tolerance for a specific duration. The
   tolerance was adaptively modified to different levels of difficulty to
   elicit full participant engagement. Three attention tests showed
   significant changes in different aspects of focused attention in
   participants who had been trained as compared with those who had not,
   thereby illustrating the role of haptic-based sensory-motor tasks in the
   promotion of short-term focused attention. The findings highlight the
   potential value of haptic stimuli in brain plasticity and serve as a new
   tool to extend existing computer games for cognitive enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{Gaze and arrows automatically trigger attentional shifts. Neuroimaging
   studies have identified a commonality in the spatial distribution of the
   neural activation involved in such attentional shifts. However, it
   remains unknown whether these activations occur with common temporal
   profiles. To investigate this issue, magnetoencephalography (MEG) was
   used to evaluate neural activation involved in attentional shifts
   induced by gaze and arrows. MEG source reconstruction analyses revealed
   that the superior temporal sulcus and the inferior frontal gyrus were
   commonly activated after 200 ms, in response to directional versus
   non-directional cues. Regression analyses further revealed that the
   magnitude of brain activity in these areas and in the bilateral
   occipital cortex was positively related to the effect of attentional
   shift on reaction times under both the gaze and the arrow conditions.
   The results also revealed that some brain regions were activated
   specifically in response to directional versus non-directional gaze or
   arrow cues at the 350-400 ms time window. These results suggest that the
   neural mechanisms underlying attentional shifts induced by gaze and
   arrows share commonalities in their spatial distributions and temporal
   profiles, with some spatial differences at later time stages. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Detection of the contingency between one's own behavior and consequent
   social events is important for normal social development, and impaired
   contingency detection may be a cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
   To depict the neural underpinnings of this contingency effect, 19 adults
   with ASD and 22 control participants underwent functional MRI while
   imitating another's actions and their actions being imitated by the
   other. As the extrastriate body area (EBA) receives efference copies of
   one's own movements, we predicted that the EBA would show an atypical
   response during contingency detection in ASD. We manipulated two
   factors: the congruency of the executed and observed actions, and the
   order of action execution and observation. Both groups showed the
   congruency effect in the bilateral EBA during imitation. When action
   preceded observation, the left EBA of the control group showed the
   congruency effect, representing the response to being imitated,
   indicating contingency detection. The ASD group showed a reduced
   contingency effect in the left EBA. These results indicate that the
   function of the EBA in the contingency detection is altered in ASD. (C)

Abstract = {{Perceived social support emphasizes subjective feeling of provisions
   offered by family, friends and significant others. In consideration of
   the great significance of perceived social support to health outcomes,
   attempt to reveal the neural substrates of perceived social support will
   facilitate its application in a series of mental disorders. Perceived
   social support potentially relies on healthy interpersonal relationships
   calling for cognitive processes like perspective taking, empathy and
   theory of mind. Interestingly, functional activations and connectivity
   within the default mode network (DMN) are extensively involved in these
   interpersonal skills. As a result, it is proposed that synchronous
   activities among brain regions within the DMN will correlate with
   self-report of perceived social support. In the present study, we tried
   to investigate the associations between coherence among the DMN regions
   and perceived social support at resting state. A total of 333 (145 men)
   participants were directed to fulfill the Multidimensional Scale of
   Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) after a 484-s functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning without any task. As a result,
   seed-based functional connectivity and power spectrum analyses revealed
   that heightened synchronicity among the DMN regions was associated with
   better performance on perceived social support. Moreover, results in the
   present study were independent of different methods, structural changes,
   and general cognitive performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is specialized for
   interpreting perceived human actions, and disruptions to its function
   occur in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here we consider the role of
   Crus I of neocerebellum in supporting pSTS function. Research has
   associated Crus I activity with imitation and biological motion
   perception, and neocerebellum is theorized to coordinate activity among
   cerebral sites more generally. Moreover, cerebellar abnormalities have
   been associated with ASD. We hypothesized that disordered Crus I-pSTS
   interactions could predict social deficits in ASD. 15 high functioning
   adolescents with ASD and 15 same-age comparison youth participated in an
   fMRI imitation paradigm; ratings of mentalizing ability were collected
   via parent report. We predicted that stronger Crus I-pSTS interactions
   would be associated with better mentalizing ability. Consistent with
   these hypotheses, stronger psychophysiological interactions between Crus
   I and right pSTS were associated with greater mentalizing ability among
   adolescents with ASD. Wholebrain analyses also indicated that typically
   developing youth recruited right inferior frontal gyrus, left pSTS,
   medial occipital regions, and precuneus more strongly during imitation
   than did youth with ASD. Overall, these results indicate that
   variability in neocerebellar interactions with key cortical social brain
   sites may help explain individual differences in social perceptual
   outcomes in ASD. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{104-116}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Although attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) and autism
   spectrum disorders (ASD) share certain neurocognitive characteristics,
   it has been hypothesized to differentiate the two disorders based on
   their brain's reward responsiveness to either social or monetary reward.
   Thus, the present fMRI study investigated neural activation in response
   to both reward types in age and IQ-matched boys with ADHD versus ASD
   relative to typically controls (TDC). A significant group by reward type
   interaction effect emerged in the ventral striatum with greater
   activation to monetary versus social reward only in TDC, whereas
   subjects with ADHD responded equally strong to both reward types, and
   subjects with ASD showed low striatal reactivity across both reward
   conditions. Moreover, disorderspecific neural abnormalities were
   revealed, including medial prefrontal hyperactivation in response to
   social reward in ADHD versus ventral striatal hypoactivation in response
   to monetary reward in ASD. Shared dysfunction was characterized by
   fronto-striato-parietal hypoactivation in both clinical groups when
   money was at stake. Interestingly, lower neural activation within
   parietal circuitry was associated with higher autistic traits across the
   entire study sample. In sum, the present findings concur with the
   assumption that both ASD and ADHD display distinct and shared neural
   dysfunction in response to reward. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Despite substantial clinical and anecdotal evidence for emotion
   dysregulation in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), little
   is known about the neural substrates underlying this phenomenon. We
   sought to explore neural mechanisms for cognitive reappraisal in
   children and adolescents with ASD using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). We studied 16 youth with ASD and 15 age- and IQ-matched
   typically developing (TD) comparison youth. Participants were instructed
   in the use of cognitive reappraisal strategies to increase and decrease
   their emotional responses to disgusting images. Participants in both
   groups displayed distinct patterns of brain activity for increasing
   versus decreasing their emotions. TD participants showed downregulation
   of bilateral insula and left amygdala on decrease trials, whereas ASD
   participants showed no modulation of insula and upregulation of left
   amygdala. Furthermore, TD youth exhibited increased functional
   connectivity between amygdala and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   compared to ASD participants when downregulating disgust, as well as
   decreased functional connectivity between amygdala and orbitofrontal
   cortex. These findings have important implications for our understanding
   of emotion dysregulation and its treatment in ASD. In particular, the
   relative lack of prefrontalamygdala connectivity provides a potential
   target for treatment-related outcome measurements. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Organizational neuroscience continues to flourish in organizational
   behavior and management studies as indicated by the growing number of
   publications. However, with a few exceptions, substantive critiques of
   organizational neuroscience are conspicuous by their absence. In this
   point-counterpoint article, we aim to redress this imbalance. We do so
   by asking two significant yet neglected questions: (i) how strong is the
   science behind this domain, and (ii) why are we doing this type of
   research (the so what? question)? Our analysis shows that the science
   behind organizational neuroscience is far less rigorous than currently
   advocated (due to low statistical power of some neuroimaging studies
   plus an inability to locate mental phenomena precisely in the brain). In
   terms of the so what? question, we encourage researchers to move away
   from general statements and become more specific about the phenomena
   they research. We contend that the practical implications of this
   research, as well as inferences of the link to behavioral changes, are
   currently overstated. We also underscore the importance for these
   studies to become contextually sensitive in order for the researchers to
   capture important events in the workplace. Finally, we offer some
   suggestions for future research. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Organizational neuroscience has great promise for advancing
   organizational research and practice. The field, however, is developing
   rapidly and has also become the subject of technological and
   methodological challenges that must be considered when conducting or
   interpreting neuroscience research as applied to organizational
   behavior. We explore four issues we deem to be important in
   understanding the role of neuroscience in organizational behavior
   research: (i) neuroscientific research and reductionism; (ii) the need
   to address methodological and technological challenges in conducting
   this type of research; (iii) how neuroscientific research is meaningful
   in organizations (the ``So what?{''} issue); and (iv) neuroscience as
   just another management fad. In addressing these issues, we hope to set
   out a roadmap that will enable organizational scholars to avoid past

Abstract = {{BackgroundAdvancing research on the etiology, prevention, and treatment
   of psychopathology requires the field to move beyond modular
   conceptualizations of neural dysfunction toward understanding
   disturbance in key brain networks. Although some studies of anxiety and
   depression have begun doing so, they typically suffer from several
   drawbacks, including: (1) a categorical approach ignoring
   transdiagnostic processes, (2) failure to account for substantial
   anxiety and depression comorbidity, (3) examination of networks at rest,
   which overlooks disruption manifesting only when networks are
   challenged. Accordingly, the present study examined relationships
   between transdiagnostic dimensions of anxiety/depression and patterns of
   functional connectivity while goal maintenance was challenged.
   MethodsParticipants (n = 179, unselected community members and
   undergraduates selected to be high/low on anxiety/depression) performed
   a task in which goal maintenance was challenged (color-word Stroop)
   while fMRI data were collected. Analyses examined moderation by
   anxiety/depression of condition-dependent coupling between regions of
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) previously associated with
   approach and avoidance motivation and amygdala/orbitofrontal cortex
   (OFC).
   ResultsAnxious arousal was positively associated with amygdalaright
   dlPFC coupling. Depression was positively associated with OFCright dlPFC
   coupling and negatively associated with OFCleft dlPFC coupling.
   ConclusionsFindings advance the field toward an integrative model of the
   neural instantiation of anxiety/depression by identifying specific,
   distinct dysfunctions associated with anxiety and depression in networks
   important for maintaining approach and avoidance goals. Specifically,
   findings shed light on potential neural mechanisms involved in
   attentional biases in anxiety and valuation biases in depression and
   underscore the importance of examining transdiagnostic dimensions of
   anxiety/depression while networks are challenged.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAlmost half of children with an inhibited temperament will
   develop social anxiety disorder by late adolescence. Importantly, this
   means that half of children with an inhibited temperament will not
   develop social anxiety disorder. Studying adults with an inhibited
   temperament provides a unique opportunity to identify neural signatures
   of both risk and resilience to social anxiety disorder.
   MethodsFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure
   brain activation during the anticipation of viewing fear faces in 34
   young adults (17 inhibited, 17 uninhibited). To identify neural
   signatures of risk, we tested for group differences in functional
   activation and connectivity in regions implicated in social anxiety
   disorder, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and insula. To
   identify neural signatures of resilience, we tested for correlations
   between brain activation and both emotion regulation and social anxiety
   scores.
   ResultsInhibited subjects had greater activation of a prefrontal network
   when anticipating viewing fear faces, relative to uninhibited subjects.
   No group differences were identified in the amygdala. Inhibited subjects
   had more negative connectivity between the rostral anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC) and the bilateral amygdala. Within the inhibited group,
   those with fewer social anxiety symptoms and better emotion regulation
   skills had greater ACC activation and greater functional connectivity
   between the ACC and amygdala.
   ConclusionsThese findings suggest that engaging regulatory prefrontal
   regions during anticipation may be a protective factor, or putative
   neural marker of resilience, in high-risk individuals. Cognitive
   training targeting prefrontal cortex function may provide protection
   against anxiety, especially in high-risk individuals, such as those with
   inhibited temperament.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundCollectively, functional neuroimaging studies implicate
   frontal-limbic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD), as reflected by altered amygdala reactivity and
   deficient prefrontal responses. These neural patterns are often elicited
   by social signals of threat (fearful/angry faces) and traumatic
   reminders (combat sounds, script-driven imagery). Although PTSD can be
   conceptualized as a disorder of emotion dysregulation, few studies to
   date have directly investigated the neural correlates of volitional
   attempts at regulating negative affect in PTSD.
   MethodsUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging and a well-validated
   task involving cognitive regulation of negative affect via reappraisal
   and known to engage prefrontal cortical regions, the authors compared
   brain activation in veterans with PTSD (n = 21) and without PTSD (n =
   21, combat-exposed controls/CEC), following military combat trauma
   experience during deployments in Afghanistan or Iraq. The primary
   outcome measure was brain activation during cognitive reappraisal (i.e.,
   decrease negative affect) as compared to passive viewing (i.e., maintain
   negative affect) of emotionally evocative content of aversive images
   ResultsThe subjects in both groups reported similar successful reduction
   in negative affect following reappraisal. The PTSD group engaged the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during cognitive reappraisal,
   albeit to a lesser extent than the CEC group. Although the amygdala was
   engaged in both groups during passive viewing of aversive images,
   neither group exhibited attenuation of amygdala activation during
   cognitive reappraisal.
   ConclusionsVeterans with combat-related PTSD showed less recruitment of
   the dlPFC involved in cognitive reappraisal, suggesting focal and
   aberrant neural activation during volitional, self-regulation of
   negative affective states.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundPediatric and adult anxiety disorder patients exhibit
   attention bias to threat and difficulty disengaging attention away from
   threat. Cognitive frameworks suggest that these patterns are associated
   with hyperactivation of regions associated with detecting threat, such
   as the amygdala, and hypoactivation of regions associated with
   regulating attention, including the lateral prefrontal cortex and
   rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). The aim of the present study
   was to examine the neural correlates of these processes in children and
   adolescents with anxiety disorders.
   MethodsParticipants with an anxiety disorder 7 to 19 years old (n = 34)
   and typically developing controls (n = 35) underwent fMRI scanning.
   During scanning, they completed a task with conditions that manipulated
   whether participants were instructed to match emotional faces (direct
   emotion processing) or match shapes in the context of emotional face
   distractors (attentional control).
   ResultsResults revealed a significant difference in rACC activation
   during shape versus face matching, with controls evidencing greater rACC
   activation relative to patients.
   ConclusionsThis study identifies abnormalities in rACC activation as a
   potential neural mediator associated with pediatric anxiety disorders,

Abstract = {{Visual perception of body motion is vital for everyday activities such
   as social interaction, motor learning or car driving. Tumors to the left
   lateral cerebellum impair visual perception of body motion. However,
   compensatory potential after cerebellar damage and underlying neural
   mechanisms remain unknown. In the present study, visual sensitivity to
   point-light body motion was psychophysically assessed in patient SL with
   dysplastic gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease) to the left
   cerebellum before and after neurosurgery, and in a group of healthy
   matched controls. Brain activity during processing of body motion was
   assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Alterations in
   underlying cerebro-cerebellar circuitry were studied by
   psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis. Visual sensitivity to
   body motion in patient SL before neurosurgery was substantially lower
   than in controls, with significant improvement after neurosurgery.
   Functional MRI in patient SL revealed a similar pattern of cerebellar
   activation during biological motion processing as in healthy
   participants, but located more medially, in the left cerebellar lobules
   III and IX. As in normalcy, PPI analysis showed cerebellar communication
   with a region in the superior temporal sulcus, but located more
   anteriorly. The findings demonstrate a potential for recovery of visual
   body motion processing after cerebellar damage, likely mediated by
   topographic shifts within the corresponding cerebro-cerebellar circuitry
   induced by cerebellar reorganization. The outcome is of importance for
   further understanding of cerebellar plasticity and neural circuits
   underpinning visual social cognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Even though language allows us to say exactly what we mean, we often use
   language to say things indirectly, in a way that depends on the specific
   communicative context. For example, we can use an apparently
   straightforward sentence like ``It is hard to give a good
   presentation{''} to convey deeper meanings, like ``Your talk was a
   mess!{''} One of the big puzzles in language science is how listeners
   work out what speakers really mean, which is a skill absolutely central
   to communication. However, most neuroimaging studies of language
   comprehension have focused on the arguably much simpler,
   context-independent process of understanding direct utterances. To
   examine the neural systems involved in getting at contextually
   constrained indirect meaning, we used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging as people listened to indirect replies in spoken dialog.
   Relative to direct control utterances, indirect replies engaged
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, right temporo-parietal junction and
   insula, as well as bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and right medial
   temporal gyrus. This suggests that listeners take the speaker's
   perspective on both cognitive (theory of mind) and affective
   (empathy-like) levels. In line with classic pragmatic theories, our
   results also indicate that currently popular ``simulationist{''}
   accounts of language comprehension fail to explain how listeners
   understand the speaker's intended message.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep deprivation has a variable impact on extrinsic activities during
   multiple cognitive tasks, especially on mood and emotion processing.
   There is also a trait-like individual vulnerability or compensatory
   effect in cognition. Previous studies have elucidated the altered
   functional connectivity after sleep deprivation. However, it remains
   unclear whether the small-world properties of resting-state network are
   sensitive to sleep deprivation. A small-world network is a type of graph
   that combines a high local connectivity as well as a few long-range
   connections, which ensures a higher information-processing efficiency at
   a low cost. The complex network of the brain can be described as a
   small-world network, in which a node is a brain region and an edge is
   present when there is a functional correlation between two nodes. Here,
   we investigated the topological properties of the human brain networks
   of 22 healthy subjects under sufficient sleep and sleep-deprived
   conditions. Specifically, small-worldness is utilized to quantify the
   small-world property, by comparing the clustering coefficient and path
   length of a given network to an equivalent random network with same
   degree distribution. After sufficient sleep, the brain networks showed
   the property of small-worldness. Compared with the resting state under
   sufficient sleep, the small-world property was significantly enhanced in
   the sleep deprivation condition, suggesting a possible compensatory
   adaptation of the human brain. Specifically, the altered measurements
   were correlated with the neuroticism of subjects, indicating that
   individuals with low-levels of neuroticism are more resilient to sleep
   deprivation.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the neural
   basis of framing effects. We tested the reflexive and reflective systems
   model of social cognition as it relates to framing. We also examined the
   relationships among frame susceptibility, intelligence and personality
   measures. Participants evaluated whether personal attributes applied to
   themselves from multiple perspectives and in positive and negative
   frames. Participants rated whether each statement was descriptive or not
   and endorsed positive frames more than negative frames. Individual
   differences on frame decisions enabled us to form high and low frame
   susceptibility groups. Endorsement of frame-consistent attributes was
   associated with personality factors, cognitive reflection and
   intelligence. Reflexive brain regions were associated with positive
   frames while reflective areas were associated with negative frames.
   Region of Interest analyses showed that frame-inconsistent responses
   were associated with increased activation within reflective cognitive
   control regions including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC),
   dorsomedial PFC and left ventrolateral PFC. Frame-consistent responses
   were associated with increased activation in the right orbitofrontal
   cortex. These results demonstrate that individual differences in frame
   susceptibility influence personal attribute evaluations. Overall, this
   study clarifies the neural correlates of the reflective and reflexive
   systems of social cognition as applied to decisions about social
   attributions.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of a deceiver to track a victim's ongoing judgments about
   the truthfulness of the deceit can be critical for successful deception.
   However, no study has yet investigated the neural circuits underlying
   receiving a judgment about one's lie. To explore this issue, we used a
   modified Guilty Knowledge Test in a mock murder situation to
   simultaneously record the neural responses involved in producing
   deception and later when judgments of that deception were made.
   Producing deception recruited the bilateral inferior parietal lobules
   (IPLs), right ventral lateral prefrontal (VLPF) areas and right
   striatum, among which the activation of the right VLPF contributed
   mostly to diagnosing the identities of the participants, correctly
   diagnosing 81.25\% of `murderers' and 81.25\% of `innocents'. Moreover,
   the participant's response when their deception was successful uniquely
   recruited the right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral IPLs, bilateral
   orbitofrontal cortices, bilateral middle temporal gyrus and left
   cerebellum, among which the right IPL contributed mostly to diagnosing
   participants' identities, correctly diagnosing 93.75\% of murderers and
   87.5\% of innocents. This study shows that neural activity associated
   with being a successful liar (or not) is a feasible indicator for
   detecting lies and may be more valid than neural activity associated
   with producing deception.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expression perception can be influenced by the natural visual
   context in which the face is perceived. We performed an fMRI experiment
   presenting participants with fearful or neutral faces against
   threatening or neutral background scenes. Triangles and scrambled scenes
   served as control stimuli. The results showed that the valence of the
   background influences face selective activity in the right anterior
   parahippocampal place area (PPA) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex
   (sgACC) with higher activation for neutral backgrounds compared to
   threatening backgrounds (controlled for isolated background effects) and
   that this effect correlated with trait empathy in the sgACC. In
   addition, the left fusiform gyrus (FG) responds to the affective
   congruence between face and background scene. The results show that
   valence of the background modulates face processing and support the
   hypothesis that empathic processing in sgACC is inhibited when affective
   information is present in the background. In addition, the findings
   reveal a pattern of complex scene perception showing a gradient of
   functional specialization along the posterior-anterior axis: from
   sensitivity to the affective content of scenes (extrastriate body area:
   EBA and posterior PPA), over scene emotion-face emotion interaction
   (left FG) via category-scene interaction (anterior PPA) to
   scene-category-personality interaction (sgACC).}},

Abstract = {{A previous functional MRI adaptation study on trait inference indicated
   that a trait code is located in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC), but could not rule out that this adaptation effect is due to
   the trait's underlying valence. To address this issue, we presented
   sentences describing positive and negative valences of either a human
   trait or object characteristic, and manipulated whether the human trait
   or object characteristic was repeated or not, either with the same or
   opposite valance. In two trait conditions, a behavioral trait-implying
   sentence was preceded by a prime sentence that implied the same or the
   opposite trait. The results confirmed the earlier finding of robust
   trait adaptation from prime to target in the vmPFC, and also found
   adaptation in the precuneus and right mid-occipital cortex. In contrast,
   no valence adaptation was found in two novel object conditions, in which
   the target sentence again implied a positive or negative trait, but was
   preceded by a prime sentence that described an object with the same or
   the opposite valence. Together with the previous study, this indicates
   that a specific trait code, but not a generalized valence code, is
   represented in the vmPFC.}},

Abstract = {{Tonal music is characterized by a continuous flow of tension and

   musical tension in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (pars orbitalis
   of the inferior frontal gyrus). In addition, a region of interest
   analysis in bilateral amygdala showed activation in the right
   superficial amygdala during periods of increasing tension (compared with
   decreasing tension). This is the first neuroimaging study investigating
   the time-varying changes of the emotional experience of musical tension,

Abstract = {{Social avoidance is a major factor contributing to the development and
   maintenance of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Converging evidence
   suggests that social avoidance is associated with abnormal aversive
   processing and hyperactive amygdala signaling. However, what are the
   consequences of such abnormal aversive processing for action and for the
   neural mechanisms implementing action is unclear. Existing literature is
   conflicting, pointing at either enhanced or reduced action inhibition.
   We investigated the interaction between aversion and action in social
   avoidance by comparing the effects of aversive vs appetitive faces on a
   go/no-go task and associated striatal signals in 42 high and low
   socially avoidant individuals. We combined fMRI with a novel
   probabilistic learning task, in which emotional valence (angry and happy
   faces) and optimal response (go-and no-go-responses) were manipulated
   independently. High compared with low socially avoidant individuals
   showed reduced behavioral inhibition (proportion no-go-responses) for
   angry relative to happy faces. This behavioral disinhibition correlated
   with greater striatal signal during no-go-responses for angry relative
   to happy faces. The results suggest that social avoidant coping style is
   accompanied by disinhibition of action and striatal signal in the
   context of social threat. The findings concur with recent theorizing
   about aversive disinhibition and affective disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Aggression is a common response to provocation, albeit with considerable
   interindividual differences. In this fMRI study, we investigated
   emotional reactivity to threat as possible link between provocation and
   aggression, as well as the neural correlates of this relationship. We
   hypothesized that emotional reactivity, measured as fear potentiation
   (FP) of the startle response, would be negatively associated with
   aggressive behavior and would modulate neural activity during an
   aggressive interaction. In 30 healthy female participants, FP was
   measured as the difference between blink amplitudes while watching
   threatening vs neutral pictures. Participants subsequently engaged in a
   variant of the Taylor Aggression Paradigm (TAP), while being scanned.
   During the TAP, participants selected a punishment level for either a
   highly provoking or a nonprovoking opponent. There was no difference in
   aggressive behavior between participants high and low in FP. However, we
   found a negative correlation between FP and the neural provocation
   effect in several regions of a network previously associated with
   mentalizing including the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and the
   temporo-parietal junction. Independently of the FP variability,
   aggressive behavior correlated with the provocation effect on activity
   in the caudate nucleus. Our results indicate that during a provocative
   confrontation, high emotional reactivity to threat suppresses
   recruitment of the mentalizing network.}},

Abstract = {{Reward responses in the medial temporal lobes and dopaminergic midbrain
   boost episodic memory formation in healthy adults, and weak memory for
   emotionally positive material in depression suggests this mechanism may
   be dysfunctional in major depressive disorder (MDD). To test this
   hypothesis, we performed a study in which unmedicated adults with MDD
   and healthy controls encoded drawings paired with reward or zero tokens
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging. In a recognition test,
   participants judged whether drawings were previously associated with the
   reward token ('reward source') or the zero token ('zero source'). Unlike
   controls, depressed participants failed to show better memory for
   drawings from the reward source vs the zero source. Consistent with
   predictions, controls also showed a stronger encoding response to reward
   tokens vs zero tokens in the right para-hippocampus and dopaminergic
   midbrain, whereas the MDD group showed the opposite pattern-stronger
   responses to zero vs reward tokens-in these regions. Differential
   activation of the dopaminergic midbrain by reward vs zero tokens was
   positively correlated with the reward source memory advantage in
   controls, but not depressed participants. These data suggest that weaker
   memory for positive material in depression reflects blunted encoding
   responses in the dopaminergic midbrain and medial temporal lobes.}},

Abstract = {{Neurodevelopmental disconnections have been assumed to cause behavioral
   alterations in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Here, we combined
   measurements of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) from
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with
   task-based fMRI to explore whether altered activity and/or iFC of the
   right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) mediates deficits in
   emotion recognition in ASD. Fifteen adults with ASD and 15
   matched-controls underwent resting-state and task-based fMRI, during
   which participants discriminated emotional states from point light
   displays (PLDs). Intrinsic FC of the right pSTS was further examined
   using 584 (278 ASD/306 controls) resting-state data of the Autism Brain
   Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Participants with ASD were less accurate
   than controls in recognizing emotional states from PLDs. Analyses
   revealed pronounced ASD-related reductions both in task-based activity
   and resting-state iFC of the right pSTS with fronto-parietal areas
   typically encompassing the action observation network (AON). Notably,
   pSTS-hypo-activity was related to pSTS-hypo-connectivity, and both
   measures were predictive of emotion recognition performance with each
   measure explaining a unique part of the variance. Analyses with the
   large independent ABIDE dataset replicated reductions in pSTS-iFC to
   fronto-parietal regions. These findings provide novel evidence that pSTS
   hypo-activity and hypo-connectivity with the fronto-parietal AON are
   linked to the social deficits characteristic of ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Being reminded of the inherently finite nature of human existence has
   been demonstrated to elicit strivings for sexual reproduction and the
   formation and maintenance of intimate relationships. Recently, it has
   been proposed that the perception of potential mating partners is
   influenced by mortality salience. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we investigated the neurocognitive processing of attractive
   opposite-sex faces after priming with death-related words for
   heterosexual men and women. Significant modulations of behavioral and
   neural responses were found when participants were requested to decide
   whether they would like to meet the presented person. Men were more in
   favor of meeting attractive women after being primed with death-related
   words compared to a no-prime condition. Increased neural activation
   could be found under mortality salience in the left anterior insula and
   the adjacent lateral prefrontal cortex (IPFC) for both men and women. As
   previously suggested, we believe that the IPFC activation reflects an
   approach-motivated defense mechanism to overcome concerns that are
   induced by being reminded of death and dying. Our results provide
   insight on a neurocognitive level that approach motivation in general,
   and mating motivation in particular is modulated by mortality salience.}},

Abstract = {{Prior research links greater activation of posterior medial frontal
   cortex (pMFC) and anterior insula (AI) with decreasing outcome
   predictability during decision making, as measured by decreasing
   probability for the more likely outcome out of two or increasing outcome
   variance. In addition to predictability, much work indicates that the
   magnitude or `stakes' of the outcome is also important. Despite the
   interest in the neural correlates of these decision variables, it is
   unknown whether pMFC and AI are differentially sensitive to
   predictability when magnitude is varied. This study examined brain
   activity during decision making in relation to decreasing outcome
   predictability for low as compared with high magnitude decisions. For
   low magnitude decisions, reduced predictability of the outcome was
   associated with greater activity in pMFC and bilateral AI, replicating
   prior studies. In contrast, there was no relationship between
   predictability and brain activity for high magnitude decisions, which
   tended to elicit greater pMFC and AI activity than low magnitude
   decisions for more predictable outcomes. These data indicate that the
   relationship between outcome predictability and pMFC and AI activity
   during decision making depends on magnitude, and suggest that these
   regions may be responding to the motivational salience of the decision
   rather than predictability information per se.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The authors sought to investigate neural system habituation
   to face and eye gaze in fragile X syndrome, a disorder characterized by
   eye-gaze aversion, among other social and cognitive deficits.
   Method: Participants (ages 15-25 years) were 30 individuals with fragile
   X syndrome (females, N=14) and a comparison group of 25 individuals
   without fragile X syndrome (females, N=12) matched for general cognitive
   ability and autism symptoms. Functional MRI (fMRI) was used to assess
   brain activation during a gaze habituation task. Participants viewed
   repeated presentations of four unique faces with either direct or
   averted eye gaze and judged the direction of eye gaze.
   Results: Four participants (males, N=4/4; fragile X syndrome, N=3) were
   excluded because of excessive head motion during fMRI scanning.
   Behavioral performance did not differ between the groups. Less neural
   habituation (and significant sensitization) in the. fragile X syndrome
   group was found in the cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and frontal
   cortex in response to all faces (direct and averted gaze). Left fusiform
   habituation in female participants was directly correlated with higher,
   more typical levels of the fragile X mental retardation protein and
   inversely correlated with autism symptoms. There was no evidence for
   differential habituation to direct gaze compared with averted gaze
   within or between groups.
   Conclusions: Impaired habituation and accentuated sensitization in
   response to face/eye gaze was distributed across multiple levels of
   neural processing. These results could help inform interventions, such
   as desensitization therapy, which may help patients with fragile X
   syndrome modulate anxiety and arousal associated with eye gaze, thereby
   improving social functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how neural processes involved in punishing and rewarding
   others are altered by group membership and personality traits is
   critical in order to gain a better understanding of how socially
   important phenomena such as racial and group biases develop.
   Participants in an fMRI study (n=48) gave rewards (money) or punishments
   (electroshocks) to in-group or out-group members. The results show that
   when participants rewarded others, greater activation was found in
   regions typically associated with receiving rewards such as the striatum
   and medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilaterally. Activation in those
   regions increased when participants rewarded in-group compared to
   out-group members. Punishment led to increased activation in regions
   typically associated with Theory of Mind including the medial prefrontal
   cortex and posterior superior temporal sulcus, as well as regions
   typically associated with perceiving others in pain such as the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula and lateral orbitofrontal
   cortex. Interestingly, in contrast to the findings regarding reward,
   activity in these regions was not moderated by whether the target of the
   punishment was an in- or out-group member. Additional regression
   analysis revealed that participants who have low perspective taking
   skills and higher levels of psychopathy showed less activation in the
   brain regions identified when punishing others, especially when they
   were out-group members. In sum, when an individual is personally
   responsible for delivering rewards and punishments to others, in-group
   bias is stronger for reward allocation than punishments, marking the
   first neuroscientific evidence of this dissociation. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Human beings often observe other people's social interactions without
   being a part of them. Whereas the implications of some brain regions
   (e.g. amygdala) have been extensively examined, the implication of the
   precuneus remains yet to be determined. Here we examined the implication
   of the precuneus in third-person perspective of social interaction using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants performed a
   socially irrelevant task while watching the biological motion of two
   agents acting in either typical (congruent to social conventions) or
   atypical (incongruent to social conventions) ways. When compared to
   typical displays, the atypical displays elicited greater activation in
   the central and posterior bilateral precuneus, and in frontoparietal and
   occipital regions. Whereas the right precuneus responded with greater
   activation also to upside down than upright displays, the left precuneus
   did not. Correlations and effective connectivity analysis added
   consistent evidence of an interhemispheric asymmetry between the right
   and left precuneus. These findings suggest that the precuneus reacts to
   violations of social expectations, and plays a crucial role in
   third-person perspective of others' interaction even when the social
   context is unattended. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5190-5203, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{The ability to interpret others' body language is a vital skill that
   helps us infer their thoughts and emotions. However, individuals with
   autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been found to have difficulty in
   understanding the meaning of people's body language, perhaps leading to
   an overarching deficit in processing emotions. The current fMRI study
   investigates the functional connectivity underlying emotion and action
   judgment in the context of processing body language in high-functioning
   adolescents and young adults with autism, using an independent
   components analysis (ICA) of the fMRI time series. While there were no
   reliable group differences in brain activity, the ICA revealed
   significant involvement of occipital and parietal regions in processing
   body actions; and inferior frontal gyrus, superior medial prefrontal
   cortex, and occipital cortex in body expressions of emotions. In a
   between-group analysis, participants with autism, relative to typical
   controls, demonstrated significantly reduced temporal coherence in left
   ventral premotor cortex and right superior parietal lobule while
   processing emotions. Participants with ASD, on the other hand, showed
   increased temporal coherence in left fusiform gyrus while inferring
   emotions from body postures. Finally, a positive predictive relationship
   was found between empathizing ability and the brain areas underlying
   emotion processing in ASD participants. These results underscore the
   differential role of frontal and parietal brain regions in processing
   emotional body language in autism. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5204-5218, 2014.

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that early life stress (ELS) changes stress
   reactivity via reduced resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC)
   between amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Oxytocin (OXT) modulates
   amygdala connectivity and attenuates responses to psychosocial stress,
   but its effect appears to be moderated by ELS. Here we first investigate
   the effect of ELS on amygdala-prefrontal rs-FC, and examine whether
   ELS-associated changes of rs-FC in this neural circuit predict its
   response to psychosocial stress. Secondly, we explore the joint effect
   of OXT and ELS on the amygdala-prefrontal circuit. Eighteen healthy
   young males participated in a resting-state fMRI study of OXT effects
   using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject
   crossover design. We measured the rs-FC to bilateral amygdalae and
   subsequently assessed changes of state anxiety and prefrontal responses
   to psychosocial stress. Multiple linear regressions showed that ELS,
   specifically emotional abuse, predicted reduced rs-FC between the right
   amygdala and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), which in turn
   predicted elevated state anxiety after psychosocial stress. In subjects
   with lower ELS scores, stronger pgACC-amygdala rs-FC predicted stronger
   pgACC deactivation during the psychosocial stress task, and this
   rest-task interaction was attenuated by OXT. In subjects with higher ELS
   scores however, the rest-task interaction was altered and OXT showed no
   significant effect. These findings highlight that ELS reduces
   pgACC-amygdala rs-FC and alters how rs-FC of this circuit predicts its
   stress responsiveness. Such changes in pgACC-amygdala functional
   dynamics may underlie the altered sensitivity to the effects of OXT
   after ELS. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5328-5339, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Inferring the cause of another person's emotional state is relevant for
   guiding behavior in social interactions. With respect to their
   potentially evoked behavioral reactions some emotional states like anger
   or happiness are considered to have high social impact while others such

   magnetic resonance imaging study to map the brain activation patterns
   related to reasoning about facial expressions of emotions with high or
   low social impact in twenty-six healthy volunteers with good emotional
   competence, self-reported empathy, and explicit facial affect
   recognition abilities.
   Our data show that empathic reasoning was faster and more accurate for
   high impact emotional states than for low impact emotional states.
   Activated brain areas involved brain circuits associated with basic and
   higher order empathy and decision-making in the dorsomedial and
   dorsolateral frontal cortex. However, activation in higher order areas
   was less during reasoning about emotional states of high social impact.
   Taken together, reasoning of high and low impact emotional states relied
   on similar empathy-related brain areas with reasoning about emotional
   states of low social impact being more erroneous and requiring more

Title = {{Do individuals with autism lack a sense of humor? A study of humor

Abstract = {{Humor helps to build interpersonal bonds and allows individuals to feel
   closer. Previous research has generally claimed that individuals with
   autism have difficulty with interpersonal communication and social
   contacts, but there has been no such consensus regarding the sense of
   humor among individuals with autism. To address this issue, the present
   study aimed to compare the comprehension of, appreciation for, and
   preferred styles of humor between students with and without autism. The
   samples consisted of 177 high school students with autism and 177
   control high school students. Every participant was within the normal
   range of intelligence. The gender ratio and age ratio of the two groups
   were maintained through pairwise sampling. The research tools were a
   questionnaire regarding the comprehension of and appreciation for
   nonsense and incongruity-resolution jokes, and the Humor Styles
   Questionnaire. The results show that the students with autism did not
   comprehend the nonsense jokes and incongruity-resolution jokes as well
   as the control students did, but they felt greater enjoyment when
   reading nonsense jokes. The students with autism preferred the nonsense
   jokes which is featured of less logical reasoning and using homophones
   for double-meaning. The tendencies toward affiliative humor,
   self-enhancing humor, and self-defeating humor among the students with
   autism were not as strong as those among the control students. Only the
   tendency toward aggressive humor was equal between two groups, showing
   that the students with autism still have sense of humor but tend to use
   hostile humor style. It is suggested to investigate the tendency of
   hostile humor in people with autism, and to provide them with
   affiliative humor to break the interpersonal stalemate experienced by
   individuals with autism. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Blind people's inferences about how other people see provide a window
   into fundamental questions about the human capacity to think about one
   another's thoughts. By working with blind individuals, we can ask both
   what kinds of representations people form about others' minds, and how
   much these representations depend on the observer having had similar
   mental states themselves. Thinking about others' mental states depends
   on a specific group of brain regions, including the right
   temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). We investigated the representations of
   others' mental states in these brain regions, using multivoxel pattern
   analyses (MVPA). We found that, first, in the RTPJ of sighted adults,
   the pattern of neural response distinguished the source of the mental
   state (did the protagonist see or hear something?) but not the valence
   (did the protagonist feel good or bad?). Second, these neural
   representations were preserved in congenitally blind adults. These
   results suggest that the temporo-parietal junction contains explicit,
   abstract representations of features of others' mental states, including
   the perceptual source. The persistence of these representations in
   congenitally blind adults, who have no first-person experience with
   sight, provides evidence that these representations emerge even in the
   absence of relevant first-person perceptual experiences. (C) 2014

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{It is now well established that activation of the ventral striatum (VS)
   encodes feedback related information, in particular, aspects of feedback
   validity, reward magnitude, and reward probability. More recent findings
   also point toward a role of VS in encoding social context of feedback
   processing. Here, we investigated the effect of social observation on
   neural correlates of feedback processing. To this end, subjects
   performed a time estimation task and received positive, negative, or
   uninformative feedback. In one half of the experiment subjects thought
   that an experimenter closely monitored their face via a camera. We
   successfully replicated an elevated VS response to positive relative to
   negative feedback. Further, our data demonstrate that this
   reward-related activation of the VS is increased during observation by
   others. Using uninformative feedback as reference condition, we show
   that specifically VS activation during positive feedback was modulated
   by observation manipulation. Our findings support accounts which posit a
   role of VS in integrating social context into the processing of feedback
   and, in doing so, signaling its social relevance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc

Title = {{Comparison of structural covariance with functional connectivity
   approaches exemplified by an investigation of the left anterior insula}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{269-280}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The anterior insula is a multifunctional region involved in various
   cognitive, perceptual and socio-emotional processes. In particular, a
   portion of the left anterior insula is closely associated with working
   memory processes in healthy participants and shows gray matter reduction
   in schizophrenia. To unravel the functional networks related to this
   left anterior insula region, we here combined resting state
   connectivity, meta-analytic-connectivity modeling (MACM) and structural
   covariance (SC) in addition to functional characterization based on
   BrainMap meta-data. Apart from allowing new insight into the seed
   region, this approach moreover provided an opportunity to systematically
   compare these different connectivity approaches. The results showed that
   the left anterior insula has a broad response profile and is part of
   multiple functional networks including language, memory and
   socio-emotional networks. As all these domains are linked with several
   symptoms of schizophrenia, dysfunction of the left anterior insula might
   be a crucial component contributing to this disorder. Moreover, although
   converging connectivity across all three connectivity approaches for the
   left anterior insula were found, also striking differences were
   observed. RS and MACM as functional connectivity approaches specifically
   revealed functional networks linked with internal cognition and active
   perceptual/language processes, respectively. SC, in turn, showed a clear
   preference for highlighting regions involved in social cognition. These
   differential connectivity results thus indicate that the use of multiple
   forms of connectivity is advantageous when investigating functional
   networks as conceptual differences between these approaches might lead
   to systematic variation in the revealed functional networks. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Psychologists have been trying to understand differences in cognition
   and behavior between East Asian and Western cultures within a single
   cognitive framework such as holistic versus analytic or interdependent
   versus independent processes. However, it remains unclear whether
   cultural differences in multiple psychological processes correspond to
   the same or different neural networks. We conducted a quantitative
   meta-analysis of 35 functional MRI studies to examine cultural
   differences in brain activity engaged in social and non-social
   processes. We showed that social cognitive processes are characterized
   by stronger activity in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, lateral
   frontal cortex and temporoparietal junction in East Asians but stronger
   activity in the anterior cingulate, ventral medial prefrontal cortex and
   bilateral insula in Westerners. Social affective processes are
   associated with stronger activity in the right dorsal lateral frontal
   cortex-in East Asians but greater activity in the left insula and right
   temporal pole in Westerners. Non-social processes induce stronger
   activity in the left inferior parietal cortex, left middle occipital and
   left superior parietal cortex in East Asians but greater activations in
   the right lingual gyrus, right inferior parietal cortex and precuneus in
   Westerners. The results suggest that cultural differences in social and
   non-social processes are mediated by distinct neural networks. Moreover,
   East Asian cultures are associated with increased neural activity in the
   brain regions related to inference of others' mind and emotion
   regulation whereas Western cultures are associated with enhanced neural
   activity in the brain areas related to self-relevance encoding and
   emotional responses during social cognitive/affective processes. (C)

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{301-311}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The ability to impute mental states to others, or Theory of Mind (ToM),
   has been the subject of hundreds of neuroimaging studies. Although
   reviews and theta-analyses-of these studies have concluded that ToM
   recruits a coherent brain network, mounting evidence suggests that this
   network is an abstraction based on pooling data from numerous studies,
   most of which use different behavioral tasks to investigate ToM.
   Problematically, this means that no single behavioral task can be used
   to reliably measure ToM Network function as currently conceived. To make
   ToM Network function scientifically tractable, we need standardized
   tasks capable of reliably measuring specific aspects of its functioning.
   Here, our goal is to validate the Why/How Task for this purpose. Several
   prior studies have found that when compared to answering how-questions
   about another person's behavior, answering why-questions about that same
   behavior activates a network that is anatomically consistent with
   meta-analytic definitions of the ToM Network. In the version of the
   Why/How Task presented here, participants answer yes/no Why (e.g., Is
   the person helping someone?) and How (e.g., Is the person lifting
   something?) questions about pretested photographs of naturalistic human
   behaviors. Across three fMRI studies, we show that the task elicits
   reliable performance measurements and modulates a left-lateralized
   network that is consistently localized across studies. While this
   network is convergent with meta-analyses of ToM studies, it is largely
   distinct from the network identified by the widely used False-Belief
   Localizer, the most common ToM task. Our new task is publicly available,
   and can be used as an efficient functional localizer to provide reliable
   identification of single-subject responses in most regions of the
   network Our results validate the Why/How Task, both as a standardized
   protocol capable of producing maximally comparable data across studies,
   and as a flexible foundation for programmatic research on the
   neurobiological foundations of a basic manifestation of human ToM. (C)

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Having previously used functional MRI to map the response to a reward
   signal in the ventral caudate in awake unrestrained dogs, here we
   examined the importance of signal source to canine caudate activation.
   Hand signals representing either incipient reward or no reward were
   presented by a familiar human (each dog's respective handler), an
   unfamiliar human, and via illustrated images of hands on a computer
   screen to 13 dogs undergoing voluntary fMRI. All dogs had received
   extensive training with the reward and no-reward signals from their
   handlers and with the computer images and had minimal exposure to the
   signals from strangers. All dogs showed differentially higher BOLD
   response in the ventral caudate to the reward versus no reward signals,
   and there was a robust effect at the group level. Further, differential
   response to the signal source had a highly significant interaction with
   a dog's general aggressivity as measured by the C-BARQ canine
   personality assessment. Dogs with greater aggressivity showed a higher
   differential response to the reward signal versus no-reward signal
   presented by the unfamiliar human and computer, while dogs with lower
   aggressivity showed a higher differential response to the reward signal
   versus no-reward signal from their handler. This suggests that specific
   facets of canine temperament bear more strongly on the perceived reward
   value of relevant communication signals than does reinforcement history,
   as each of the dogs were reinforced similarly for each signal,
   regardless of the source (familiar human, unfamiliar human, or
   computer). A group-level psychophysiological interaction (PPI)
   connectivity analysis showed increased functional coupling between the
   caudate and a region of cortex associated with visual discrimination and
   learning on reward versus no-reward trials. Our findings emphasize the
   sensitivity of the domestic dog to human social interaction, and may
   have other implications and applications pertinent to the training and
   assessment of working and pet dogs.}},

Abstract = {{In recent times, the relevance of an accurate diagnosis of
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults has been the
   focus of several studies. No longer considered a pathology exclusive to
   children and adolescents, and taking into account its social
   implications, developing enhanced support tools for the current
   diagnostic procedure becomes a priority. Here we present a method for
   the objective assessment of ADHD in adults using chirp-evoked, paired
   auditory late responses (ALRs) combined with a two-dimensional ALR
   denoising scheme to extract correlates of intracortical inhibition. Our
   method allows for an effective single-sweep denoising, thus requiring
   less trials to obtain recognizable physiological features, useful as
   pointers of cortical impairment. Results allow an optimized diagnosis,
   reduction of data loss and acquisition time; moreover, they do not
   account exclusively for critical elements within clinical evaluations,
   but also allow studying the pathophysiology of the condition by
   providing objective information regarding impaired cortical functions.

Abstract = {{In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, smoking cues
   have been found to elicit increases in brain activity in regions
   associated with processing rewarding and emotional stimuli. However,
   most smoking cue studies to date have reported effects relative to
   neutral control stimuli with no incentive properties, making it unclear
   whether the observed activation pertains to value in general or the
   value of cigarettes in particular. The current fMRI study sought to
   clarify the neural activity reflecting tobacco-specific incentive value
   versus domain-general incentive value by examining smoking cues, neutral
   cues, and a third set of cues, monetary cues, which served as an active
   control condition. Participants were 42 male daily smokers. Compared to
   neutral cues, significantly greater activation was found in the left
   ventral striatum in response to tobacco and money cues. Monetary cues
   also elicited significantly increased activation in the right inferior
   frontal gyrus and cuneus compared to the other two cue types. Overall,
   the results suggest that the salience of monetary cues was the highest
   and, as a result, might have reduced the incentive salience of tobacco
   cues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Brain Regions of Theory of Mind}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Humans possess efficient mechanisms to behave adaptively in social
   contexts. They ascribe goals and beliefs to others and use these for
   behavioural predictions. Researchers argued for two separate mental
   attribution systems: an implicit and automatic one involved in online
   interactions, and an explicit one mainly used in offline deliberations.
   However, the underlying mechanisms of these systems and the types of
   beliefs represented in the implicit system are still unclear. Using
   neuroimaging methods, we show that the right temporo-parietal junction
   and the medial prefrontal cortex, brain regions consistently found to be
   involved in explicit mental state reasoning, are also recruited by
   spontaneous belief tracking. While the medial prefrontal cortex was more
   active when both the participant and another agent believed an object to
   be at a specific location, the right temporo-parietal junction was
   selectively activated during tracking the false beliefs of another agent
   about the presence, but not the absence of objects. While humans can
   explicitly attribute to a conspecific any possible belief they
   themselves can entertain, implicit belief tracking seems to be
   restricted to beliefs with specific contents, a content selectivity that
   may reflect a crucial functional characteristic and signature property
   of implicit belief attribution.}},

Title = {{Moving to music: effects of heard and imagined musical cues on
   movement-related brain activity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Music is commonly used to facilitate or support movement, and
   increasingly used in movement rehabilitation. Additionally, there is
   some evidence to suggest that music imagery, which is reported to lead
   to brain signatures similar to music perception, may also assist
   movement. However, it is not yet known whether either imagined or
   musical cueing changes the way in which the motor system of the human
   brain is activated during simple movements. Here, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging was used to compare neural activity during wrist
   flexions performed to either heard or imagined music with self-pacing of
   the same movement without any cueing. Focusing specifically on the motor
   network of the brain, analyses were performed within a mask of BA4, BA6,
   the basal ganglia (putamen, caudate, and pallidum), the motor nuclei of
   the thalamus, and the whole cerebellum. Results revealed that moving to
   music compared with self-paced movement resulted in significantly
   increased activation in left cerebellum VI. Moving to imagined music led
   to significantly more activation in pre-supplementary motor area
   (pre-SMA) and right globus pallidus, relative to self-paced movement.
   When the music and imagery cueing conditions were contrasted directly,
   movements in the music condition showed significantly more activity in
   left hemisphere cerebellum VII and right hemisphere and vermis of
   cerebellum IX, while the imagery condition revealed more significant
   activity in pre-SMA. These results suggest that cueing movement with
   actual or imagined music impacts upon engagement of motor network
   regions during the movement, and suggest that heard and imagined cues
   can modulate movement in subtly different ways. These results may have
   implications for the applicability of auditory cueing in movement
   rehabilitation for different patient populations.}},

Title = {{YOU ARE IN SYNC WITH ME: NEURAL CORRELATES OF INTERPERSONAL SYNCHRONY

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{277}},
Pages = {{842-858}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Interpersonal synchrony is characterized by a temporary alignment of
   periodic behaviors with another person. This process requires that at
   least one of the two individuals monitors and adjusts his/her movements
   to maintain alignment with the other individual (the referent).
   Interestingly, recent research on interpersonal synchrony has found that
   people who are motivated to befriend an unfamiliar social referent tend
   to automatically synchronize with their social referents, raising the
   possibility that synchrony may be employed as an affiliation tool. It is
   unknown, however, whether the opposite is true; that is, whether the
   person serving as the referent of interpersonal synchrony perceives
   synchrony with his/her partner or experiences affiliative feelings
   toward the partner. To address this question, we performed a series of
   studies on interpersonal synchrony with a total of 100 participants. In
   all studies, participants served as the referent with no requirement to
   monitor or align their behavior with their partners. Unbeknown to the
   participants, the timings of their ``partner's{''} movements were
   actually determined by a computer program based on the participant's
   (i.e., referent's) behavior. Overall, our behavioral results showed that
   the referent of a synchrony task expressed greater perceived synchrony
   and greater social affiliation toward a synchronous partner (i.e., one
   displaying low mean asynchrony and/or a narrow asynchrony range) than
   with an asynchronous partner (i.e., one displaying high mean asynchrony
   and/or high asynchrony range). Our neuroimaging study extended these
   results by demonstrating involvement of brain areas implicated in social
   cognition, embodied cognition, self-other expansion, and action
   observation as correlates of interpersonal synchrony (vs. asynchrony).
   These findings have practical implications for social interaction and
   theoretical implications for understanding interpersonal synchrony and
   social coordination. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Neural Associations of the Early Retinotopic Cortex with the Lateral
   Occipital Complex during Visual Perception}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that the early retinotopic cortex
   (ERC, i.e., V1/V2/V3) is highly associated with the lateral occipital
   complex (LOC) during visual perception. However, it remains largely
   unclear how to evaluate their associations in quantitative way. The
   present study tried to apply a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to
   quantify the neural activity in ERC and its association with that of the
   LOC when participants saw visual images. To this end, we assessed
   whether lowlevel visual features (Gabor features) could predict the
   neural activity in the ERC and LOC according to a voxel-based encoding
   model (VBEM), and then quantified the association of the neural activity
   between these regions by using an analogical VBEM. We found that the
   Gabor features remarkably predicted the activity of the ERC (e.g., the
   predicted accuracy was 52.5\% for a participant) instead of that of the
   LOC (4.2\%). Moreover, the MVPA approach can also be used to establish
   corresponding relationships between the activity patterns in the LOC and
   those in the ERC (64.2\%). In particular, we found that the integration
   of the Gabor features and LOC visual information could dramatically
   improve the `prediction' of ERC activity (88.3\%). Overall, the present
   study provides new evidences for the possibility of quantifying the
   association of the neural activity between the regions of ERC and LOC.
   This approach will help to provide further insights into the neural
   substrates of the visual processing.}},

Title = {{Loss of agency in apraxia}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{The feeling of acting voluntarily is a fundamental component of human
   behavior and social life and is usually accompanied by a sense of
   agency. However, this ability can be impaired in a number of diseases
   and disorders. An important example is apraxia, a disturbance
   traditionally defined as a disorder of voluntary skillful movements that
   often results from frontal-parietal brain damage. The first part of this
   article focuses on direct evidence of some core symptoms of apraxia,
   emphasizing those with connections to agency and free will. The loss of
   agency in apraxia is reflected in the monitoring of internally driven
   action, in the perception of specifically self-intended movements and in
   the neural intention to act. The second part presents an outline of the
   evidences supporting the functional and anatomical link between apraxia
   and agency. The available structural and functional results converge to
   reveal that the frontal parietal network contributes to the sense of
   agency and its impairment in disorders such as apraxia. The current
   knowledge on the generation of motor intentions and action monitoring
   could potentially be applied to develop therapeutic strategies for the
   clinical rehabilitation of voluntary action.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{1581}},
Pages = {{40-50}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{We used the ``standard{''} and ``switched{''} social contract versions
   of the Wason Selection-task to investigate the neural bases of human
   reasoning about social rules. Both these versions typically elicit the
   deontically correct answer, i.e. the proper identification of the
   violations of a conditional obligation. Only in the standard version of
   the task, however, this response corresponds to the logically correct
   one. We took advantage of this differential adherence to logical vs.
   deontical accuracy to test the different predictions of logic rule-based
   vs. visuospatial accounts of inferential abilities in 14 participants
   who solved the standard and switched versions of the Selection-task
   during functional-Magnetic-Resonance-Imaging. Both versions activated
   the well known left fronto-parietal network of deductive reasoning. The
   standard version additionally recruited the medial parietal and right
   inferior parietal cortex, previously associated with mental imagery and
   with the adoption of egocentric vs. allocentric spatial reference
   frames. These results suggest that visuospatial processes encoding one's
   own subjective experience in social interactions may support and shape
   the interpretation of deductive arguments and/or the resulting
   inferences, thus contributing to elicit content effects in human
   reasoning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The concepts of representation and information in explanatory theories
   of human behavior}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Focusing in experimental study of human behavior, this article discusses
   the concepts of information and mental representation aiming the
   integration of their biological, computational, and semantic aspects.
   Assuming that the objective of any communication process is ultimately
   to modify the receiver's state, the term correlational information is
   proposed as a measure of how changes occurring in external world
   correlate with changes occurring inside an individual. Mental
   representations are conceptualized as a special case of information
   processing in which correlational information is received, recorded, but
   also modified by a complex emergent process of associating new elements.
   In humans, the acquisition of information and creation of mental
   representations occurs in a two-step process. First, a sufficiently
   complex brain structure is necessary to establishing internal states
   capable to co-vary with external events. Second, the validity or meaning
   of these representations must be gradually achieved by confronting them
   with the environment. This contextualization can be considered as part
   of the process of ascribing meaning to information and representations.
   The hypothesis introduced here is that the sophisticated psychological
   constructs classically associated with the concept of mental
   representation are essentially of the same nature of simple interactive
   behaviors. The capacity of generating elaborated mental phenomena like
   beliefs and desires emerges gradually during evolution and, in a given
   individual, by learning and social interaction.}},

Title = {{Correlations between social-emotional feelings and anterior insula
   activity are independent from visceral states but influenced by culture}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{The anterior insula (Al) maps visceral states and is active during
   emotional experiences, a functional confluence that is central to
   neurobiological accounts of feelings. Yet, it is unclear how Al activity
   correlates with feelings during social emotions, and whether this
   correlation may be influenced by culture, as studies correlating
   real-time Al activity with visceral states and feelings have focused on
   Western subjects feeling physical pain or basic disgust. Given
   psychological evidence that social-emotional feelings are cognitively
   constructed within cultural frames, we asked Chinese and American
   participants to report their feeling strength to admiration and
   compassion-inducing narratives during fMRI with simultaneous
   electrocardiogram recording. Trial-by-trial, cardiac arousal and feeling
   strength correlated with ventral and dorsal Al activity bilaterally but
   predicted different variance, suggesting that interoception and
   social-emotional feeling construction are concurrent but dissociable Al
   functions. Further, although the variance that correlated with cardiac
   arousal did not show cultural effects, the variance that correlated with
   feelings did. Feeling strength was especially associated with ventral Al
   activity (the autonomic modulatory sector) in the Chinese group but with
   dorsal Al activity (the visceral-somatosensory/cognitive sector) in an
   American group not of Asian descent. This cultural group difference held
   after controlling for posterior insula (PI) activity and was replicated.
   A bi-cultural East-Asian American group showed intermediate results. The
   findings help elucidate how the Al supports feelings and suggest that
   previous reports that dorsal Al activation reflects feeling strength are
   culture related. More broadly, the results suggest that the brain's
   ability to construct conscious experiences of social emotion is less
   closely tied to visceral processes than neurobiological models predict
   and at least partly open to cultural influence and learning.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin and vasopressin modulate a range of species typical behavioral
   functions that include social recognition, maternal-infant attachment,
   and modulation of memory, offensive aggression, defensive fear
   reactions, and reward seeking. We have employed novel functional
   magnetic resonance mapping techniques in awake rats to explore the roles
   of these neuropeptides in the maternal and non-maternal brain. Results
   from the functional neuroimaging studies that are summarized here have
   directly and indirectly confirmed and supported previous findings.
   Oxytocin is released within the lactating rat brain during suckling
   stimulation and activates specific subcortical networks in the maternal
   brain. Both vasopressin and oxytocin modulate brain regions involved
   unconditioned fear, processing of social stimuli and the expression of
   agonistic behaviors. Across studies there are relatively consistent
   brain networks associated with internal motivational drives and
   emotional states that are modulated by oxytocin and vasopressin.

Abstract = {{Brain networks that govern parental response to infant signals have been
   studied with imaging techniques over the last 15 years. The complex
   interaction of thoughts and behaviors required for sensitive parenting
   enables the formation of each individual's first social bonds and
   critically shapes development. This review concentrates on magnetic
   resonance imaging experiments which directly examine the brain systems
   involved in parental responses to infant cues. First, we introduce
   themes in the literature on parental brain circuits studied to date.
   Next, we present a thorough chronological review of state-of-the-art
   fMRI studies that probe the parental brain with a range of baby audio
   and visual stimuli. We also highlight the putative role of oxytocin and
   effects of psychopathology, as well as the most recent work on the
   paternal brain. Taken together, a new model emerges in which we propose
   that cortico-limbic networks interact to support parental brain
   responses to infants. These include circuitry for
   arousal/salience/motivation/reward, reflexive/instrumental caring,
   emotion response/regulation and integrative/complex cognitive
   processing. Maternal sensitivity and the quality of caregiving behavior
   are likely determined by the responsiveness of these circuits during
   early parent-infant experiences. The function of these circuits is
   modifiable by current and early-life experiences, hormonal and other
   factors. Severe deviation from the range of normal function in these
   systems is particularly associated with (maternal) mental illnesses -
   commonly, depression and anxiety, but also schizophrenia and bipolar
   disorder. Finally, we discuss the limits and extent to which brain
   imaging may broaden our understanding of the parental brain given our
   current model. Developments in the understanding of the parental brain
   may have profound implications for long-term outcomes in families across
   risk, resilience and possible interventions.

Title = {{The left side of motor resonance}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{Motor resonance is defined as the internal activation of an observer's
   motor system, specifically attuned to the perceived movement. In social
   contexts, however, different patterns of observed and executed muscular
   activation are frequently required. This is the case, for instance, of
   seeing a key offered with a precision grip and received by opening the
   hand. Novel evidence suggests that compatibility effects in motor
   resonance can be altered by social response preparation. What is not
   known is how handedness modulates this effect. The present study aimed
   at determining how a left- and a right-handed actor grasping an object
   and then asking for a complementary response influences corticospinal
   activation in left- and right-handers instructed to observe the scene.
   Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials
   (MEPs) were thus recorded from the dominant hands of left- and
   right-handers. Interestingly, requests posed by the right-handed actor
   induced a motor activation in the participants' respective dominant
   hands, suggesting that left-handers tend to mirror right-handers with
   their most efficient hand. Whereas requests posed by the left-handed
   actor activated the anatomically corresponding muscles (i.e., left hand)
   in all the participants, right-handers included. Motor resonance effects
   classically reported in the literature were confirmed when observing
   simple grasping actions performed by the right-handed actor. These
   findings indicate that handedness influences both congruent motor
   resonance and complementary motor preparation to observed actions.}},

Title = {{Voxel-Wise Motion Artifacts in Population-Level Whole-Brain Connectivity
   Analysis of Resting-State fMRI}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) based brain connectivity
   analysis maps the functional networks of the brain by estimating the
   degree of synchronous neuronal activity between brain regions. Recent
   studies have demonstrated that ``resting-state'' fMRI-based brain
   connectivity conclusions may be erroneous when motion artifacts have a
   differential effect on fMRI BOLD signals for between group comparisons.
   A potential explanation could be that in-scanner displacement, due to
   rotational components, is not spatially constant in the whole brain.
   However, this localized nature of motion artifacts is poorly understood
   and is rarely considered in brain connectivity studies. In this study,
   we initially demonstrate the local correspondence between head
   displacement and the changes in the resting-state fMRI BOLD signal.
   Than, we investigate how connectivity strength is affected by the
   population-level variation in the spatial pattern of regional
   displacement. We introduce Regional Displacement Interaction (RDI), a
   new covariate parameter set for second-level connectivity analysis and
   demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing motion related confounds in
   comparisons of groups with different voxel-vise displacement pattern and
   preprocessed using various nuisance regression methods. The effect of
   using RDI as second-level covariate is than demonstrated in
   autism-related group comparisons. The relationship between the proposed
   method and some of the prevailing subject-level nuisance regression
   techniques is evaluated. Our results show that, depending on
   experimental design, treating in-scanner head motion as a global
   confound may not be appropriate. The degree of displacement is highly
   variable among various brain regions, both within and between subjects.
   These regional differences bias correlation-based measures of brain
   connectivity. The inclusion of the proposed second-level covariate into
   the analysis successfully reduces artifactual motion-related group
   differences and preserves real neuronal differences, as demonstrated by
   the autism-related comparisons.}},

Title = {{Neural Correlates of Gender Differences in Reputation Building}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{Gender differences in cooperative choices and their neural correlates
   were investigated in a situation where reputation represented a crucial
   issue. Males and females were involved in an economic exchange (trust
   game) where economic and reputational payoffs had to be balanced in
   order to increase personal welfare. At the behavioral level, females
   showed a stronger reaction to negative reputation judgments that led to
   higher cooperation than males, measured by back transfers in the game.
   The neuroanatomical counterpart of this gender difference was found
   within the reward network (engaged in producing expectations of positive
   results) and reputation-related brain networks, such as the self-control
   network (engaged in strategically resisting the temptation to defect)
   and the mentalizing network (engaged in thinking about how one is viewed
   by others), in which the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the
   medial (M) PFC respectively play a crucial role. Furthermore, both DLPFC
   and MPFC activity correlated with the amount of back transfer, as well
   as with the personality dimensions assessed with the Big-Five
   Questionnaire (BFQ-2). Males, according to their greater DLPFC
   recruitment and their higher level of the BFQ-2 subscale of Dominance,
   were more focused on implementing a profit-maximizing strategy, pursuing
   this target irrespectively of others' judgments. On the contrary,
   females, according to their greater MPFC activity and their lower level
   of Dominance, were more focused on the reputation per se and not on the
   strategic component of reputation building. These findings shed light on
   the sexual dimorphism related to cooperative behavior and its neural
   correlates.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{The present study explored the bilingual cognitive control mechanism by
   comparing Chinese-English bilinguals' language switching in a blocked
   picture naming paradigm against three baseline conditions, namely the
   control condition (a fixation cross, low-level baseline), single L1
   production (Chinese naming, high-level baseline), and single L2
   production (English naming, high-level baseline). Different activation
   patterns were observed for language switching against different baseline
   conditions. These results indicate that different script bilingual
   language control involves a fronto-parietal-subcortical network that
   extends to the precentral gyrus, the Supplementary Motor Area, the Supra
   Marginal Gyrus, and the fusiform. The different neural correlates
   identified across different comparisons supported that bilingual
   language switching involves high-level cognitive processes that are not
   specific to language processing. Future studies adopting a network
   approach are crucial in identifying the functional connectivity among

Abstract = {{For a profit-maximizing rational agent, labor markets present a paradox:
   Economic contexts encourage exploitation of commodities whereas social
   contexts discourage exploitation of people and instead promote empathic
   responding and moral protection. This may result in irrational behavior.
   Perhaps rational agents reduce spontaneous social-cognitive responses to
   successfully maximize profits in a labor market. We tested this
   hypothesis by creating a labor market-an economic market where people
   serve as commodities. fMRI participants initially purchased players from
   a timeestimation skill labor market, then revalued these players based
   on performance in an attempt to maximize profit. Despite implementing a
   variety of purchasing strategies, we find that participants initially
   reduce activity in social cognition brain regions when viewing purchased
   players-an initial reduction consistent with a dehumanized brain
   response-that predicts later revaluation of purchased labor market
   players. However, traditional valuation regions in medial orbito-frontal
   cortex (MOFC) predict nonpurchased players' revaluation. These results
   suggest valuation and social cognition brain regions independently guide
   revaluation processes when people are treated like commodities.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{703-720}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The establishment of an accurate understanding of one's
   social context is a central developmental task during adolescence. A
   critical component of such development is to learn how to integrate the
   objective evaluation of one's behavior with the social response to the
   latter-here referred to as social feedback processing. Case report: We
   measured brain activity by means of fMRI in 33 healthy adolescents
   (12-19 years old, 14 females). Participants played a difficult
   perceptual game with integrated verbal and visual feedback. Verbal
   feedback provided the participants with objective performance evaluation
   (won vs. lost). Visual feedback consisted of either smiling or angry
   faces, representing positive or negative social evaluations. Together,
   the combination of verbal and visual feedback gave rise to congruent
   versus incongruent social feedback combinations. In addition to
   assessing sex differences, we further tested for the effects of age and
   attachment style on social feedback processing. Results revealed that
   brain activity during social feedback processing was significantly
   modulated by sex, age, and attachment style in prefrontal cortical
   areas, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, caudate, and
   amygdala/hippocampus. We found indication for heightened activity during
   incongruent social feedback processing in females, older participants,
   and individuals with an anxious attachment style. Conversely, we
   observed stronger activity during processing of congruent social
   feedback in males and participants with an avoidant attachment style.
   Conclusion: Our findings not only extend knowledge on the typical
   development of socio-emotional brain function during adolescence, but
   also provide first clues on how attachment insecurities, and

Abstract = {{Self-experience anomalies are elementary features of schizophrenic
   pathology. Such deficits can have a profound impact on self-other
   relationship, but how they are related through aberrant brain function
   remains poorly understood. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study, we provide new evidence for a cortical link between
   aberrant self-experience and social cognition in first-episode
   schizophrenia (FES). As identified in previous studies, ventral premotor
   cortex (vPMC) and posterior insula (pIC) are candidate brain regions
   underlying disturbances in both self-experience and self-other
   relationship due to their processing of predominantly externally guided
   (vPMC; goal-oriented behavior) and internally guided (pIC;
   interoception) stimuli. Results from functional interaction analysis in
   a sample of 24 FES patients and 22 healthy controls show aberrant
   functional interactions (background/intrinsic connectivity) of right
   vPMC and bilateral pIC with posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a midline
   region that has been shown central in mediating self-experience. More
   specifically, our results show increased functional coupling between
   vPMC and PCC, which positively correlated with basic symptoms
   (subjective self-experience disturbances). pIC showed reduced functional
   coupling with PCC and postcentral gyrus and increased functional
   interactions with anterior insula. Taken together, our results suggest
   an imbalance in the processing between internally and externally guided
   information and its abnormal integration with self-referential
   processing as mediated by PCC. Due to our correlation findings, we
   suggest this imbalance to be closely related to basic symptoms in FES
   and thus anomalous self-experience. The findings further disentangle the
   cortical basis of how self-experience anomalies may pervade the social
   domain.}},

Abstract = {{This study was performed to investigate differences between children who
   did and did not experience peer rejection in psychological state through
   surveys and in emotion processing during an interpersonal stress
   challenge task to reflect naturalistic interpersonal face-to-face
   relationships. A total of 20 right-handed children, 10 to 12 yr of age,
   completed self-rating questionnaires inquiring about peer rejection in
   school, depression, and anxiety. They then underwent an interpersonal
   stress challenge task simulating conditions of emotional stress, in
   reaction to positive, negative and neutral facial expression stimuli,
   using interpersonal feedbacks, and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (FMRI) for an analysis of neural correlates during the task. Ten were
   the peer-rejection group, whereas the remainder were the control group.
   Based on the behavioral results, the peer-rejection group exhibited
   elevated levels of depression, state anxiety, trait anxiety and social
   anxiety as compared to the control group. The FMRI results revealed that
   the peer-rejection group exhibited greater and remarkably more extensive
   activation of brain regions encompassing the amygdala, orbitofrontal
   cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex in response to negative
   feedback stimuli of emotional faces. The different brain reactivities
   characterizing emotion processing during interpersonal relationships may
   be present between children who do and do not experience peer rejection.}},

Abstract = {{Romantic interest or rejection can be powerful incentives not merely for
   their emotional impact, but for their potential to transform, in a
   single interaction, what we think we know about another person-or
   ourselves. Little is known, though, about how the brain computes
   expectations for, and learns from, real-world romantic signals. In a
   novel ``speed-dating{''} paradigm, we had participants meet potential
   romantic partners in a series of 5-min ``dates,{''} and decide whether
   they would be interested in seeing each partner again. Afterward,
   participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging
   while they were told, for the first time, whether that partner was
   interested in them or rejected them. Expressions of interest and
   rejection activated regions previously associated with
   ``mentalizing,{''} including the posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) and rostromedial prefrontal cortex (RMPFC); while pSTS responded
   to differences from the participant's own decision, RMPFC responded to
   prediction errors from a nreinforcement-learning model of personal
   desirability. Responses in affective regions were also highly sensitive
   to participants' expectations. Far from being inscrutable, then,
   responses to romantic expressions seem to involve a quantitative
   learning process, rooted in distinct sources of expectations, and
   encoded in neural networks that process both affective value and social
   beliefs.}},

   perception in anorexia nervosa patients?}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{26-37}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) patients show disturbances in body size
   experience. Here, malleability of body representation was assessed by
   inducing the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI). Specifically the impact of the
   illusion on body size estimation was investigated.
   Thirty AN patients and thirty healthy females participated. The RHI was
   induced synchronously (experimental condition) and asynchronously
   (control condition) Both before and after induction of the RHI
   participants were asked to estimate the size of their own and the rubber
   hand.
   The results showed that AN patients had a stronger experience of
   ownership over the rubber hand than healthy females in the experimental,
   but not the control condition. AN patients and HC did not differ on
   proprioceptive drift. Before induction of the illusion AN patients
   overestimated hand width. After induction of the illusion (experimental
   as well as control condition) AN patients no longer overestimated the
   width of their hand. Healthy females correctly estimated hand size both
   before and after induction of the RHI.
   In conclusion, stronger experience of ownership over the rubber hand in
   the AN group implies a more malleable body representation in AN patients
   compared to healthy females. Changed hand size estimation in the AN
   group appears to be unrelated to the RHI, as it occurred under both
   experimental and control conditions of the illusion. Alternative
   interpretations are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding how the brain computes value is a basic question in
   neuroscience. Although individual studies have driven this progress,
   meta-analyses provide an opportunity to test hypotheses that require
   large collections of data. We carry out a meta-analysis of a large set
   of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies of value computation to
   address several key questions. First, what is the full set of brain
   areas that reliably correlate with stimulus values when they need to be
   computed? Second, is this set of areas organized into dissociable
   functional networks? Third, is a distinct network of regions involved in
   the computation of stimulus values at decision and outcome? Finally, are
   different brain areas involved in the computation of stimulus values for
   different reward modalities? Our results demonstrate the centrality of
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), ventral striatum and posterior
   cingulate cortex (PCC) in the computation of value across tasks, reward
   modalities and stages of the decision-making process. We also find
   evidence of distinct subnetworks of co-activation within VMPFC, one
   involving central VMPFC and dorsal PCC and another involving more
   anterior VMPFC, left angular gyrus and ventral PCC. Finally, we identify
   a posterior-to-anterior gradient of value representations corresponding
   to concrete-to-abstract rewards.}},

Abstract = {{Implicit or automatic detection of social signals, which discriminate
   animate, intentional objects in the environment, is essential for higher
   social cognition and its development. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we identified the neural substrate of detecting
   simple visual social signals and examined its functional link with the
   mechanism of inferring another's mental state. Healthy participants were
   presented with the eye-gaze shift (EG) and self-propelling motion (SP)
   under both implicit and explicit task conditions. They also performed a
   social role-playing game in which mental inference (MI) was implicitly
   prompted during the presentation of faces (implicit MI). Implicit
   detection of EG and SP activated the posterior middle temporal gyrus
   (pMTG) bilaterally, whereas the right posterior superior temporal sulcus
   was activated during the explicit conditions. We revealed that the
   individual variation in neural response in the right pMTG during
   implicit eye-gaze detection explains the individual tendency to recruit
   the regions implicated in mental-state inference (medial prefrontal
   cortex, temporal pole and striatum) during the implicit MI task. Our
   results suggest that the implicit detection of visual social signals
   involves the pMTG and underlies the development of higher social
   cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Human beings are constantly engaged in thought. Sometimes thoughts occur
   repetitively and can become distressing. Up to now the neural bases of
   these intrusive or unwanted thoughts is largely unexplored. To study the
   neural correlates of unwanted thoughts, we acquired resting-state fMRI
   data of 41 female healthy subjects and assessed the self-reported amount
   of unwanted thoughts during measurement. We analyzed local connectivity
   by means of regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity of a
   seed region. More unwanted thoughts (state) were associated with lower
   ReHo in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and higher ReHo in
   left striatum (putamen). Additional seed-based analysis revealed higher
   functional connectivity of the left striatum with left inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG) in participants reporting more unwanted thoughts. The
   state-dependent higher connectivty in left striatum was positively
   correlated with rumination assessed with a dedicated questionnaire
   focussing on trait aspects. Unwanted thoughts are associated with
   activity in the fronto-striatal brain circuitry. The reduction of local
   connectivity in DLPFC could reflect deficiencies in thought suppression
   processes, whereas the hightened activity in left striatum could imply
   an imbalance of gating mechanisms housed in basal ganglia. Its
   functional connectivity to left IFG is discussed as the result of
   thought-related speech processes.}},

Abstract = {{When people state their willingness to pay for something, the amount
   usually differs from the behavior in a real purchase situation. The
   discrepancy between a hypothetical answer and the real act is called
   hypothetical bias. We investigated neural processes of hypothetical bias
   regarding monetary donations to public goods using fMRI with the
   hypothesis that amygdala codes for real costs. Real decisions activated
   amygdala more than hypothetical decisions. This was observed for both
   accepted and rejected proposals. The more the subjects accepted real
   donation proposals the greater was the activity in rostral anterior
   cingulate cortex-a region known to control amygdala but also neural
   processing of the cost-benefit difference. The presentation of a
   charitable donation goal evoked an insula activity that predicted the
   later decision to donate. In conclusion, we have identified the neural
   mechanisms underlying real donation behavior, compatible with theories
   on hypothetical bias. Our findings imply that the emotional system has
   an important role in real decision making as it signals what kind of
   immediate cost and reward an outcome is associated with.}},

Abstract = {{Many people routinely criticise themselves. While self-criticism is
   largely unproblematic for most individuals, depressed patients exhibit
   excessive self-critical thinking, which leads to strong negative
   affects. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy
   subjects (N = 20) to investigate neural correlates and possible
   psychological moderators of self-critical processing. Stimuli consisted
   of individually selected adjectives of personally negative content and
   were contrasted with neutral and negative non-self-referential
   adjectives. We found that confrontation with self-critical material
   yielded neural activity in regions involved in emotions (anterior
   insula/hippocampus-amygdala formation) and in anterior and posterior
   cortical midline structures, which are associated with self-referential
   and autobiographical memory processing. Furthermore, contrasts revealed
   an extended network of bilateral frontal brain areas. We suggest that
   the co-activation of superior and inferior lateral frontal brain regions
   reflects the recruitment of a frontal top-down pathway, representing
   cognitive reappraisal strategies for dealing with evoked negative
   affects. In addition, activation of right superior frontal areas was
   positively associated with neuroticism and negatively associated with
   cognitive reappraisal. Although these findings may not be specific to
   negative stimuli, they support a role for clinically relevant
   personality traits in successful regulation of emotion during
   confrontation with self-critical material.}},

Abstract = {{Neural activity in the social brain network varies across individuals
   with different cultural traits and different genetic polymorphisms. It
   remains unknown whether a specific genetic polymorphism may influence
   the association between cultural traits and neural activity in the
   social brain network. We tested whether the serotonin transporter
   promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) affects the association between
   self-construals and neural activity involved in reflection of personal
   attributes of oneself and a significant other (i.e., mother). Using
   functional MRI, we scanned Chinese adults with short/short (s/s) or
   long/long (l/l) variants of the 5-HTTLPR during reflection of personal
   attributes of oneself and one's mother. We found that, while s/s and l/l
   genotype groups did not differ significantly in self-construals measured
   by the Self-Construal Scale, the relationship between self-construal
   scores and neural responses to reflection of oneself and mother was
   significantly different between the two genotype groups. Specifically,
   l/l but not s/s genotype group showed significant association between
   self-construal scores and activity in the medial prefrontal cortex,
   bilateral middle frontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, insula and
   hippocampus during reflection on mental attributes of oneself and
   mother. Our findings suggest that a specific genetic polymorphism may
   interact with a cultural trait to shape the neural substrates underlying

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala plays a central role in processing facial affect,
   responding to diverse expressions and features shared between
   expressions. Although speculation exists regarding the nature of
   relationships between expression-and feature-specific amygdala
   reactivity, this matter has not been fully explored. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and principal component analysis (PCA) in a
   sample of 300 young adults, to investigate patterns related to
   expression-and feature-specific amygdala reactivity to faces displaying
   neutral, fearful, angry or surprised expressions. The PCA revealed a
   two-dimensional correlation structure that distinguished emotional
   categories. The first principal component separated neutral and
   surprised from fearful and angry expressions, whereas the second
   principal component separated neutral and angry from fearful and
   surprised expressions. This two-dimensional correlation structure of
   amygdala reactivity may represent specific feature-based cues conserved
   across discrete expressions. To delineate which feature-based cues
   characterized this pattern, face stimuli were averaged and then
   subtracted according to their principal component loadings. The first
   principal component corresponded to displacement of the eyebrows,
   whereas the second principal component corresponded to increased
   exposure of eye whites together with movement of the brow. Our results
   suggest a convergent representation of facial affect in the amygdala
   reflecting feature-based processing of discrete expressions.}},

   pathophysiology would be displayed to a wide extent over the brain.
   Moreover, the network-wide changes could be dependent on the context of
   affective processing. In this study, we sought affective state-dependent
   changes of the brain functional network by applying a graph-theoretical
   approach to functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired in 13
   patients with MDD and 12 healthy controls who were exposed to video
   clips inducing the negative, neutral or positive affective state. For
   each affective condition, a group-wise brain functional network was
   constructed based on partial correlation of mean activity across
   subjects between brain areas. Network parameters, global and local
   efficiencies, were measured from the brain functional network. Compared
   with controls', patients' brain functional network shifted to the
   regular network in the topological architecture, showing decreased
   global efficiency and increased local efficiency, during negative and
   neutral affective processing. Further, the shift to the regular network
   in patients was most evident during negative affective processing. MDD
   is proposed to provoke widespread changes across the whole brain in an
   affective state-dependent manner, specifically in the negative affective
   state.}},

Abstract = {{Exaggerated anticipatory anxiety during expectation of
   performance-related situations is an important feature of the
   psychopathology of social anxiety disorder (SAD). The neural basis of
   anticipatory anxiety in SAD has not been investigated in controlled
   studies. The current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates during the anticipation of
   public and evaluated speaking vs a control condition in 17 SAD patients
   and 17 healthy control subjects. FMRI results show increased activation
   of the insula and decreased activation of the ventral striatum in SAD
   patients, compared to control subjects during anticipation of a speech
   vs the control condition. In addition, an activation of the amygdala in
   SAD patients during the first half of the anticipation phase in the
   speech condition was observed. Finally, the amount of anticipatory
   anxiety of SAD patients was negatively correlated to the activation of
   the ventral striatum. This suggests an association between incentive
   function, motivation and anticipatory anxiety when SAD patients expect a
   performance situation.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure therapy builds on the mechanism of fear extinction leading to
   decreased fear responses. How the stress hormone cortisol affects brain
   regions involved in fear extinction in humans is unknown. For this
   reason, we tested 32 men randomly assigned to receive either 30mg
   hydrocortisone or placebo 45 min before fear extinction. In fear
   acquisition, a picture of a geometrical figure was either partially
   paired (conditioned stimulus; CS+) or not paired (CS-) with an
   electrical stimulation (unconditioned stimulus; UCS). In fear
   extinction, each CS was presented again, but no UCS occurred. Cortisol
   increased conditioned skin conductance responses in early and late
   extinction. In early extinction, higher activation towards the CS- than
   to the CS+ was found in the amygdala, hippocampus and posterior
   parahippocampal gyrus. This pattern might be associated with the
   establishment of a new memory trace. In late extinction, the placebo
   compared with the cortisol group displayed enhanced CS+/CS-
   differentiation in the amygdala, medial frontal cortex and nucleus
   accumbens. A change from early deactivation to late activation of the
   extinction circuit as seen in the placebo group seems to be needed to
   enhance extinction and to reduce fear. Cortisol appears to interfere
   with this process thereby impairing extinction of recently acquired
   conditioned fear.}},

Abstract = {{Despite widespread interest in social dominance, little is known of its
   neural correlates in primates. We hypothesized that social status in
   primates might be related to individual variation in subcortical brain
   regions implicated in other aspects of social and emotional behavior in
   other mammals. To examine this possibility we used magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI), which affords the taking of quantitative measurements
   noninvasively, both of brain structure and of brain function, across
   many regions simultaneously. We carried out a series of tests of
   structural and functional MRI (fMRI) data in 25 group-living macaques.
   First, a deformation-based morphometric (DBM) approach was used to show
   that gray matter in the amygdala, brainstem in the vicinity of the raphe
   nucleus, and reticular formation, hypothalamus, and septum/striatum of
   the left hemisphere was correlated with social status. Second, similar
   correlations were found in the same areas in the other hemisphere.
   Third, similar correlations were found in a second data set acquired
   several months later from a subset of the same animals. Fourth, the
   strength of coupling between fMRI-measured activity in the same areas
   was correlated with social status. The network of subcortical areas,
   however, had no relationship with the sizes of individuals' social
   networks, suggesting the areas had a simple and direct relationship with
   social status. By contrast a second circuit in cortex, comprising the
   midsuperior temporal sulcus and anterior and dorsal prefrontal cortex,
   covaried with both individuals' social statuses and the social network
   sizes they experienced. This cortical circuit may be linked to the
   social cognitive processes that are taxed by life in more complex social
   networks and that must also be used if an animal is to achieve a high
   social status.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to recognize others' emotions is critical to successful
   interpersonal interactions. Given its importance, there has been an
   extensive amount of research using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms associated with
   facial affect recognition in healthy individuals, and some in patient
   populations with affective disorders. Findings from these studies reveal
   that the underlying mechanisms involve a distributed neural network,
   engaging structures within limbic and subcortical regions, prefrontal
   cortex, temporal and parietal lobes, and occipital cortex. In the last
   several decades, researchers have become increasingly interested in how
   emotion recognition is affected after a traumatic brain injury (TBI),
   which often involves damage to these structures, as well as the neural
   circuitry connecting them. Not surprisingly, research has reliably
   demonstrated that facial affect recognition deficits are common after
   TBI. To date, however, no neuroimaging studies have investigated facial
   affect recognition deficits in the TBI population. Consequently, the
   purpose of this paper is to consider how functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) might inform our knowledge about affect recognition
   deficits after TBI, and potentially enhance treatment approaches.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Neuroimaging studies have documented differences in neural
   responses to food cues in obese versus lean samples but little is known
   about weight status differences in responsiveness to other key features
   of obesogenic environments, particularly cues reflecting physical
   activity. To address this gap, patterns of activation related to visual
   depictions of sedentary activities and vigorous physical exercise were
   assessed in overweight (O-W) and average weight (A-W) samples via
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   METHODS: Thirteen O-W and 13 A-W Chinese women were instructed to
   imagine engaging in 90 physical exercise activities and 90 sedentary
   activities and to watch 90 landscape images presented during three runs
   of an fMRI scan within a cross-sectional design.
   RESULTS: Behavioral results indicated O-W women endorsed more negative
   attitudes toward physical activity than A-W did. Imaging analyses
   indicated that body mass index had a significant negative association
   with activation of the right putamen and a positive correlation with
   activation in the right medial frontal gyrus, specifically Brodmann Area
   10 in the exercise-sedentary image contrast condition. For the
   sedentary-control contrast, significantly less activation in an insula
   area related to negative affect was observed for the O-W group. Finally,
   for the exercise-control contrast, O-W women also displayed
   comparatively weaker activation in a cingulate gyrus area implicated in
   kinesthetic memory of body movements and the re-experiencing real
   events.
   CONCLUSION: Together, results supported contentions that exposure to
   depictions of physical exercise corresponds to reduced activation of
   reward centers and heightened activation in regions associated with
   negative affect regulation among O-W women compared with leaner peers.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have difficulty
   understanding other minds (Theory of Mind; ToM), with atypical
   processing evident at both behavioural and neural levels. Individuals
   with conduct problems and high levels of callous-unemotional (CU) traits
   (CP/HCU) exhibit reduced responsiveness to others' emotions and
   difficulties interacting with others, but nonetheless perform normally
   in experimental tests of ToM. The present study aimed to examine the
   neural underpinnings of ToM in children (aged 10-16) with ASD (N=16),
   CP/HCU (N=16) and typically developing (TD) controls (N=16) using a
   non-verbal cartoon vignette task. Whilst individuals with ASD were
   predicted to show reduced fMRI responses across regions involved in ToM
   processing, CP/HCU individuals were predicted to show no differences
   compared with TD controls. The analyses indicated that neural responses
   did not differ between TD and CP/HCU groups during ToM. TD and CP/HCU
   children exhibited significantly greater medial prefrontal cortex
   responses during ToM than did the ASD group. Within the ASD group,
   responses in medial prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction
   (TPJ) correlated with symptom severity as measured by the Autism
   Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). Findings suggest that although
   both ASD and CP/HCU are characterized by social difficulties, only
   children with ASD display atypical neural processing associated with
   ToM.}},

Abstract = {{Deficit in the ability to understand and predict the mental states of
   others is one of the central features of traumatic brain injury (TBI),
   leading to problems in social-daily life such as social withdrawal and
   the inability to maintain work or family relationships. Although several
   functional neuroimaging studies have identified a widely distributed
   brain network involved in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET),
   the necessary brain regions engaged in this capacity are still heavily
   debated. In this study, we combined the RMET with a whole-brain
   voxel-based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM) approach to identify brain
   regions necessary for adequate RMET performance in a large sample of
   patients with penetrating TBI (pTBI). Our results revealed that pTBI
   patients performed worse on the RMET compared to non-head injured
   controls, and impaired RMET performance was associated with lesions in
   the left inferior frontal gyms (IFG). Our findings suggest that the left
   IFG is a key region in reading the mind in the eyes, probably involved
   in a more general impairment of a semantic working memory system that
   facilitates reasoning about what others are feeling and thinking as
   expressed by the eyes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Different impressions of other agents obtained through social

Abstract = {{Internal (neuronal) representations in the brain are modified by our
   experiences, and this phenomenon is not unique to sensory and motor
   systems. Here, we show that different impressions obtained through
   social interaction with a variety of agents uniquely modulate activity
   of dorsal and ventral pathways of the brain network that mediates human
   social behavior.
   We scanned brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) in 16 healthy volunteers when they performed a simple
   matching-pennies game with a human, human-like android, mechanical
   robot, interactive robot, and a computer. Before playing this game in
   the scanner, participants experienced social interactions with each
   opponent separately and scored their initial impressions using two
   questionnaires.
   We found that the participants perceived opponents in two mental
   dimensions: one represented ``mind-holderness{''} in which participants
   attributed anthropomorphic impressions to some of the opponents that had
   mental functions, while the other dimension represented
   ``mind-readerness{''} in which participants characterized opponents as
   intelligent. Interestingly, this ``mind-readerness{''} dimension
   correlated to participants frequently changing their game tactic to
   prevent opponents from envisioning their strategy, and this was
   corroborated by increased entropy during the game. We also found that
   the two factors separately modulated activity in distinct social brain
   regions. Specifically, mind-holderness modulated activity in the dorsal
   aspect of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal and
   posterior paracingulate cortices, while mind-readerness modulated
   activity in the ventral aspect of TPJ and the temporal pole.
   These results clearly demonstrate that activity in social brain networks
   is modulated through pre-scanning experiences of social interaction with
   a variety of agents. Furthermore, our findings elucidated the existence
   of two distinct functional networks in the social human brain. Social
   interaction with anthropomorphic or intelligent-looking agents may
   distinctly shape the internal representation of our social brain, which
   may in turn determine how we behave for various agents that we encounter
   in our society. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated with
   impoverished anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) engagement during
   attentional control. Attentional Control Theory proposes such
   deficiencies may be offset when demands on resources are increased to
   execute goals. To test the hypothesis attentional demands affect ACC
   response 23 patients with gSAD and 24 matched controls performed an fMRI
   task involving a target letter in a string of identical targets (low
   load) or a target letter in a mixed letter string (high load)
   superimposed on fearful, angry, and neutral face distractors. Regardless
   of load condition, groups were similar in accuracy and reaction time.
   Under low load gSAD patients showed deficient rostral ACC recruitment to
   fearful (vs. neutral) distractors. For high load, increased activation
   to fearful (vs. neutral) distractors was observed in gSAD suggesting a
   compensatory function. Results remained after controlling for group
   differences in depression level. Findings indicate perceptual demand
   modulates ACC in gSAD. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging studies have reported task-related brain
   activation changes in preclinical individuals carrying the Huntington's
   disease (HD) gene mutation (preHD). Little is known about
   ``task-negative{''} activity, i.e., patterns of task-related
   deactivation in preHD, and about the stability of any deactivation
   changes over the course of the disease. Here, we explored task-related
   deactivation and functional connectivity of ``task-negative{''} networks
   (TNNs) in preHD followed over a time period of 2 years. Thirteen
   far-from-onset preHD (mean time to estimated motor onset = 19.5 years)
   and thirteen healthy controls were investigated. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a verbal working memory task, and
   uni- and multivariate analysis techniques for fMRI data. Behavior was
   similar in preHD and controls at baseline and did not change 2 years
   later. At both time points, deactivation was similar in preHD and
   controls. Within two spatio-temporally distinct TNNs, preHD had lower
   functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex and higher
   functional connectivity in the left anterior prefrontal cortex compared
   to controls (p < 0.05, cluster-corrected). These findings remained
   stable at follow-up. Anterior prefrontal connectivity correlated with
   disease burden scores both at baseline and at follow-up. Over time,
   preHD exhibited higher connectivity in a dorsal cingulate region.
   Functional connectivity differences within this region were inversely
   associated with changes of motor function. These data provide first
   evidence for TNN connectivity changes in preHD followed over a period of
   2 years. The relationship between dorsal cingulate connectivity and
   motor function suggests that ``task-negative{''} activity may capture
   time-sensitive neural and functional processes in preHD.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Combat soldiers often encounter moral dilemmas during
   operational deployment, especially when an armed engagement is situated
   within a civilian setting. The study of moral dilemmas and posttraumatic
   stress disorder (PTSD) has mostly focused on the impact of war
   atrocities and moral injury. However, the relationship between moral
   attitudes and different combat-related pathologies has not been
   thoroughly addressed by quantitative studies.
   Aims: We aimed to assess the relationship between combatant's moral
   attitudes, severity of PTSD symptoms and mixed lateral preference.
   Methods: Data on moral objection, PTSD severity and lateral preference
   were collected in a right-handed non-pathologic sample (n = 147) of
   reserve combat troops in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
   Results: Nearly one-fifth (19.7\%) of the reserve personnel who served
   in the occupied territories have reported high moral objection to the
   commands they were expected to act upon. This group of participants
   exhibited more PTSD symptoms and higher levels of mixed lateral
   preference. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed a mediating
   role of moral objection in the relationship between PTSD symptoms
   severity and lateral preference.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that moral objection has significant
   implications on combatant's psychological and organic well-being. The
   findings highlight the need to include moral attitudes in research and
   clinical practice among combat personnel and veterans.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the appropriate punishment for a norm violation requires
   consideration of both the perpetrator's state of mind (for example,
   purposeful or blameless) and the strong emotions elicited by the harm
   caused by their actions. It has been hypothesized that such affective
   responses serve as a heuristic that determines appropriate punishment.
   However, an actor's mental state often trumps the effect of emotions, as
   unintended harms may go unpunished, regardless of their magnitude. Using
   fMRI, we found that emotionally graphic descriptions of harmful acts
   amplify punishment severity, boost amygdala activity and strengthen
   amygdala connectivity with lateral prefrontal regions involved in
   punishment decision-making. However, this was only observed when the
   actor's harm was intentional; when harm was unintended, a
   temporoparietal-medial-prefrontal circuit suppressed amygdala activity
   and the effect of graphic descriptions on punishment was abolished.
   These results reveal the brain mechanisms by which evaluation of a
   transgressor's mental state gates our emotional urges to punish.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual function is a major concern for many individuals following spinal
   cord injury (SCI). Sexuality after SCI is a complex issue that is
   influenced by a number of social, psychological and physiological
   factors, including urinary incontinence (UI). To examine the experience
   of sexuality for women with SCI, to determine the impact of UI on sexual
   function and sexual satisfaction in these women, and to identify their
   main concerns regarding UI and sexuality. Using a phenomenological
   approach, seven in-depth interviews combining the interview guide
   approach and standardized open-ended questions were conducted. Two main
   categories were identified: Sexuality and the impact of UI on sexuality.
   Related themes were uncovered within each category. Both categories
   revealed emerging themes including 13 for sexuality and 10 for the
   impact of UI on sexuality. Five additional themes relevant to the
   research question but that did not fit into the initial categories were
   also identified. Intimacy and the sexual experience were negatively
   affected by UI as a result of SCI, and by an excessive concern about
   autonomic dysreflexia. There is a significant shortage of information
   available for women with SCI regarding sexual function in general, but
   more specifically, a lack of information on sexual function as it
   relates to UI. Future research should focus on creating resources to
   assist in this area which may improve the quality of life for these
   individuals.}},
