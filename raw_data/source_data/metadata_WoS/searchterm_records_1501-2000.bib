Abstract = {{The search for new therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer disease (AD) is a
   major goal in medicine and society, also due to the impressive economic
   and social costs of this disease. In this scenario, biotechnologies play
   an important role. Here, it is demonstrated that the Radio Electric
   Asymmetric Conveyer (REAC), an innovative technology platform for
   neuro-and bio-modulation, used according to the neuro-regenerative
   protocol (RGN-N), significantly increases astroglial reaction around the
   amyloid plaques in an AD mouse model, as evaluated by
   GFAP-immunoreactivity, and reduces microglia-associated
   neuroinflammation markers, as evaluated by Iba1-immunoreactivity and
   mRNA expression level of inflammatory cytokines TREM. IL1beta, iNOS and
   MRC1 were not affected neither by the genotype or by REAC RGN-N
   treatment. Also observed was an increase in locomotion in treated
   animals. The study was performed in 24-month-old male Tg2576 mice and
   age-matching wild-type animals, tested for Y-maze, contextual fear
   conditioning and locomotion immediately after the end of a specific REAC
   treatment administered for 15 hours/day for 15 days. These results
   demonstrated that REAC RGN-N treatment modifies pathological
   neuroinflammation, and mitigates part of the complex motor behaviour
   alterations observed in very old Tg2576 mice.}},

Title = {{Extraversion and neuroticism related to the resting-state effective
   connectivity of amygdala}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{The amygdala plays a key role in emotion processing. Its functional
   connectivity with other brain regions has been extensively demonstrated
   to be associated with extraversion and neuroticism. However, how the
   amygdala affects other regions and is affected by others within these
   connectivity patterns associated with extraversion and neuroticism
   remains unclear. To address this issue, we investigated the effective
   connectivity of the amygdala using Granger causality analysis on the
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 70
   participants. Results showed that extraversion was positively correlated
   with the influence from the right inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) to the
   left amygdala, and from the bilateral IOG to the right amygdala; such
   result may represent the neural correlates of social interactions in
   extraverts. Conversely, neuroticism was associated with an increased
   influence from right amygdala to right middle frontal gyrus and a
   decreased influence from right precuneus to right amygdala. This
   influence might affect the modulations of cognitive regulation function
   and self-referential processes in neurotic individuals. These findings
   highlight the importance of the causal influences of amygdala in
   explaining the individual differences in extraversion and neuroticism,
   and offer further insights into the specific neural networks underlying
   personality.}},

Title = {{Sustained Effects of Acupuncture Stimulation Investigated with
   Centrality Mapping Analysis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Acupuncture can have instant and sustained effects, however, its
   mechanisms of action are still unclear. Here, we investigated the
   sustained effect of acupuncture by evaluating centrality changes in
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging after manually
   stimulating the acupuncture point ST36 at the lower leg or two control
   point locations (CP1 same dermatome, CP2 different dermatome). Data from
   a previously published experiment evaluating instant BOLD effects and
   S2-seed-based resting state connectivity was re-analyzed using
   eigenvector centrality mapping and degree centrality mapping. These data
   driven methods might add new insights into sustained acupuncture effects
   on both global and local inter-region connectivity (centrality) by
   evaluating the summary of connections of every voxel. We found higher
   centrality in parahippocampal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus after ST36
   stimulation in comparison to the two control points. These regions are
   positively correlated to major hubs of the default mode network, which
   might be the primary network affected by chronic pain. The stronger
   integration of both regions within the whole-brain connectome after
   stimulation of ST36 might be a potential contributor to pain modulation
   by acupuncture. These findings highlight centrality mapping as a
   valuable analysis for future imaging studies investigating clinically
   relevant outcomes associated with physiological response to acupuncture
   stimulation. Clinical trial registration: NCT01079689,
   ClinicalTrials.gov.}},

   Neuroanatomy with fMRI}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{We aimed to progress understanding of prosodic emotion expression by
   establishing brain regions active when expressing specific emotions,
   those activated irrespective of the target emotion, and those whose
   activation intensity varied depending on individual performance. BOLD
   contrast data were acquired whilst participants spoke non-sense words in
   happy, angry or neutral tones, or performed jaw-movements.
   Emotion-specific analyses demonstrated that when expressing angry
   prosody, activated brain regions included the inferior frontal and
   superior temporal gyri, the insula, and the basal ganglia. When
   expressing happy prosody, the activated brain regions also included the
   superior temporal gyrus, insula, and basal ganglia, with additional
   activation in the anterior cingulate. Conjunction analysis confirmed
   that the superior temporal gyrus and basal ganglia were activated
   regardless of the specific emotion concerned. Nevertheless, disjunctive
   comparisons between the expression of angry and happy prosody
   established that anterior cingulate activity was significantly higher
   for angry prosody than for happy prosody production. Degree of inferior
   frontal gyrus activity correlated with the ability to express the target
   emotion through prosody. We conclude that expressing prosodic emotions
   (vs. neutral intonation) requires generic brain regions involved in
   comprehending numerous aspects of language, emotion-related processes
   such as experiencing emotions, and in the time-critical integration of
   speech information.}},

Title = {{The neural transfer effect of working memory training to enhance hedonic
   processing in individuals with social anhedonia}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{Anhedonia, the diminished ability to experience pleasure, is a
   challenging negative symptom in patients with schizophrenia and can be
   observed in at-risk individuals with schizotypy. Deficits in hedonic
   processing have been postulated to be related to decreased motivation to
   engage in potentially rewarding events. It remains unclear whether
   non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive training, could
   improve anhedonia. The present study aimed to examine the neural
   mechanism for alleviating hedonic deficits with working memory ( WM)
   training in individuals with social anhedonia. Fifteen individuals with
   social anhedonia were recruited and received 20 sessions of training on
   a dual n-back task, five sessions a week. Functional imaging paradigms
   of the Monetary Incentive Delay ( MID) and the Affective Incentive Delay
   ( AID) tasks were administered both before and after the training to
   evaluate the neural transfer effects on hedonic processing ability.
   Enhanced brain activations related to anticipation were observed at the
   anterior cingulate cortex, the left dorsal striatum and the left
   precuneus with the AID task, and at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   and the supramarginal gyrus with the MID task. The present findings
   support that WM training may improve monetary-based and affective-based
   hedonic processing in individuals with social anhedonia.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{This article proposes that what have been historically and
   contemporarily defined as different domains of human cognition are
   served by one of four functionally- and structurally-distinct areas of
   the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Their contributions to human intelligence
   are as follows: (a) BA9, enables our emotional intelligence, engaging
   the psychosocial domain; (b) BA47, enables our practical intelligence,
   engaging the material domain; (c) BA46 (or BA46-9/46), enables our
   abstract intelligence, engaging the hypothetical domain; and (d) BA10,
   enables our temporal intelligence, engaging in planning within any of
   the other three domains. Given their unique contribution to human
   cognition, it is proposed that these areas be called the, social (BA9),
   material (BA47), abstract (BA46-9/46) and temporal (BA10) mind. The
   evidence that BA47 participates strongly in verbal and gestural
   communication suggests that language evolved primarily as a consequence
   of the extreme selective pressure for practicality; an observation
   supported by the functional connectivity between BA47 and orbital areas
   that negatively reinforce lying. It is further proposed that the
   abstract mind (BA46-9/46) is the primary seat of metacognition charged
   with creating adaptive behavioral strategies by generating higher-order
   concepts (hypotheses) from lower-order concepts originating from the
   other three domains of cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) primarily impairs motor abilities
   but also affects cognition and emotional processing. We hypothesise that
   subjective ratings of emotional stimuli depicting social interactions
   and facial expressions is changed in ALS. It was found that recognition
   of negative emotions and ability to mentalize other's intentions is
   reduced.
   Methods
   Processing of emotions in faces was investigated. A behavioural test of
   Ekman faces expressing six basic emotions was presented to 30 ALS
   patients and 29 age-, gender and education matched healthy controls.
   Additionally, a subgroup of 15 ALS patients that were able to lie supine
   in the scanner and 14 matched healthy controls viewed the Ekman faces
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Affective state and
   a number of daily social contacts were measured.
   Results
   ALS patients recognized disgust and fear less accurately than healthy
   controls. In fMRI, reduced brain activity was seen in areas involved in
   processing of negative emotions replicating our previous results. During
   processing of sad faces, increased brain activity was seen in areas
   associated with social emotions in right inferior frontal gyrus and
   reduced activity in hippocampus bilaterally. No differences in brain
   activity were seen for any of the other emotional expressions. Inferior
   frontal gyrus activity for sad faces was associated with increased
   amount of social contacts of ALS patients.
   Conclusion
   ALS patients showed decreased brain and behavioural responses in
   processing of disgust and fear and an altered brain response pattern for
   sadness. The negative consequences of neurodegenerative processes in the
   course of ALS might be counteracted by positive emotional activity and
   positive social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroplastic changes induced by sensory learning have been recognized
   within the cortices of specific modalities as well as within higher
   ordered multimodal areas. The interplay between these areas is not fully
   understood, particularly in the case of somatosensory learning. Here we
   examined functional and structural changes induced by short-term tactile
   training based of Braille reading, a task that requires both significant
   tactile expertise and mapping of tactile input onto multimodal
   representations. Subjects with normal vision were trained for 3 weeks to
   read Braille exclusively by touch and scanned before and after training,
   while performing a same-different discrimination task on Braille
   characters and meaningless characters. Functional and diffusion-weighted
   magnetic resonance imaging sequences were used to assess resulting
   changes. The strongest training-induced effect was found in the primary
   somatosensory cortex (SI), where we observed bilateral augmentation in
   activity accompanied by an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) within
   the contralateral SI. Increases of white matter fractional anisotropy
   were also observed in the secondary somatosensory area (SII) and the
   thalamus. Outside of somatosensory system, changes in both structure and
   function were found in i.e., the fusiform gyrus, the medial frontal gyri
   and the inferior parietal lobule. Our results provide evidence for
   functional remodeling of the somatosensory pathway and higher ordered
   multimodal brain areas occurring as a result of short-lasting tactile
   learning, and add to them a novel picture of extensive white matter
   plasticity.}},

Title = {{Cerebral Activity Associated with Transient Sleep-Facilitated Reduction
   in Motor Memory Vulnerability to Interference}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Motor memory consolidation is characterized, in part, by a
   sleep-facilitated decrease in susceptibility to subsequent interfering
   experiences. Surprisingly, the cerebral substrates supporting this
   phenomenon have never been examined. We used fMRI to investigate the
   neural correlates of the influence of sleep on interference to motor
   memory consolidation. Healthy young adults were trained on a sequential
   motor task, and subsequently practiced a second competing sequence after
   an interval including diurnal sleep or wakefulness. Participants were
   then retested on the initial sequence 8 h and 24 h (including nocturnal
   sleep) after training. Results demonstrated that a post-training nap
   significantly protected memory against interference at 8 h and modulated
   the link between cerebral activity and behavior, such that a smaller
   post-interference decrease in cortico-striatal activity was associated
   with better performance. Interestingly, the protective effect of a nap
   was only transitory, as both groups performed similarly at 24 h.
   Activity in cortico-striatal areas that was disrupted during the day,
   presumably due to interference and accentuated in the absence of a nap,
   was restored overnight. Altogether, our findings offer the first
   evidence that cortico-striatal areas play a critical role in the
   transient sleep-facilitated reduction in motor memory vulnerability and
   in the overnight restoration of previously degraded memories.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Functional MRI studies suggest that at least three brain regions in
   human visual cortex-the parahippocampal place area (PPA), retrosplenial
   complex (RSC), and occipital place area (OPA; often called the
   transverse occipital sulcus)-represent large-scale information in
   natural scenes. Tuning of voxels within each region is often assumed to
   be functionally homogeneous. To test this assumption, we recorded blood
   oxygenation level-dependent responses during passive viewing of complex
   natural movies. We then used a voxelwise modeling framework to estimate
   voxelwise category tuning profiles within each scene-selective region.
   In all three regions, cluster analysis of the voxelwise tuning profiles
   reveals two functional subdomains that differ primarily in their
   responses to animals, man-made objects, social communication, and
   movement. Thus, the conventional functional definitions of the PPA, RSC,
   and OPA appear to be too coarse. One attractive hypothesis is that this
   consistent functional subdivision of scene-selective regions is a
   reflection of an underlying anatomical organization into two separate
   processing streams, one selectively biased toward static stimuli and one
   biased toward dynamic stimuli.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Continuous dimensions, such as time, space, and numerosity, have been
   suggested to be subserved by common neurocognitive mechanisms.
   Neuroimaging studies that have investigated either one or two dimensions
   simultaneously have consistently identified neural correlates in the
   parietal cortex of the brain. However, studies investigating the degree
   of neural overlap across several dimensions are inconclusive, and it
   remains an open question whether a potential overlap can be
   conceptualized as a neurocognitive magnitude processing system. The
   current functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated the
   potential neurocognitive overlap across three dimensions. A sample of
   adults (N = 24) performed three different magnitude processing tasks: a
   temporal discrimination task, a number discrimination task, and a line
   length discrimination task. A conjunction analysis revealed several
   overlapping neural substrates across multiple magnitude dimensions, and
   we argue that these cortical nodes comprise a distributed magnitude
   processing system. Key components of this predominantly
   right-lateralized system include the intraparietal sulcus, insula,
   premotor cortex/SMA, and inferior frontal gyrus. Together with previous
   research highlighting intraparietal sulcus, our results suggest that the
   insula also is a core component of the magnitude processing system. We
   discuss the functional role of each of these components in the magnitude
   processing system and suggest that further research of this system may
   provide insight into the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders where
   cognitive deficits in magnitude processing are manifest.}},

Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Gelotophobics have social deficits in the form of relative humorlessness
   and heightened sensitivity to aggressive humor; however, little is known
   about the neural reward mechanisms for this group. The present study
   attempted to identify the neural substrates of responses to hostile and
   non-hostile jokes in gelotophobics and non-gelotophobics. Gelotophobics
   showed greater activation than did non-gelotophobics in the dorsal
   corticostriatal system, which comprises the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex and dorsal striatum, suggesting a higher degree of voluntary
   top-down cognitive control of emotion. As expected, gelotophobics showed
   less activation in the ventral mesocorticolimbic system (MCL) in
   response to both hostile and non-hostile jokes, suggesting a relative
   deficit in the reward system. Conversely, non-gelotophobics displayed
   greater activation than gelotophobics did in the MCL system,
   particularly for non-hostile jokes, which suggests a more robust
   bottom-up emotional response. In response to non-hostile jokes,
   non-gelotophobics showed greater activation in the ventral MCL reward
   system, which comprises the midbrain, amygdalae, nucleus accumbens,
   ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and insula. Psychophysiological
   interaction analyses further showed that gelotophobics exhibited
   diminished MCL activation in response to hostile jokes. These group
   differences may have important implications for our understanding of the
   neural correlates of social motivation and humor appreciation.}},

Abstract = {{Observers can deliberately attend to some aspects of a face (e.g.
   emotional expression) while ignoring others. How do internal goals
   influence representational geometry in face-responsive cortex?
   Participants watched videos of naturalistic dynamic faces during MRI
   scanning. We measured multivariate neural response patterns while
   participants formed an intention to attend to a facial aspect (age, or
   emotional valence), and then attended to that aspect, and responses to
   the face's emotional valence, independent of attention. Distinct
   patterns of response to the two tasks were found while forming the
   intention, in left fronto-lateral but not face-responsive regions, and
   while attending to the face, in almost all face-responsive regions.
   Emotional valence was represented in right posterior superior temporal
   sulcus and medial prefrontal cortex, but could not be decoded when
   unattended. Shifting the focus of attention thus alters cortical
   representation of social information, probably reflecting neural
   flexibility to optimally integrate goals and perceptual input.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Intentional deception is a common act that often has
   detrimental social, legal, and clinical implications. In the last
   decade, brain activation patterns associated with deception have been
   mapped with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), significantly
   expanding our theoretical understanding of the phenomenon. However,
   despite substantial criticism, polygraphy remains the only biological
   method of lie detection in practical use today. We conducted a blind,
   prospective, and controlled within-subjects study to compare the
   accuracy of fMRI and polygraphy in the detection of concealed
   information. Data were collected between July 2008 and August 2009.
   Method: Participants (N = 28) secretly wrote down a number between 3 and
   8 on a slip of paper and were questioned about what number they wrote
   during consecutive and counterbalanced fMRI and polygraphy sessions. The
   Concealed Information Test (CIT) paradigm was used to evoke deceptive
   responses about the concealed number. Each participant's preprocessed
   fMRI images and 5-channel polygraph data were independently evaluated by
   3 fMRI and 3 polygraph experts, who made an independent determination of
   the number the participant wrote down and concealed.
   Results: Using a logistic regression, we found that fMRI experts were
   24\% more likely (relative risk = 1.24, P < .001) to detect the
   concealed number than the polygraphy experts. Incidentally, when 2 out
   of 3 raters in each modality agreed on a number (N = 17), the combined
   accuracy was 100\%.
   Conclusions: These data justify further evaluation of fMRI as a
   potential alternative to polygraphy. The sequential or concurrent use of
   psychophysiology and neuroimaging in lie detection also deserves new
   consideration. (C) Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1990s, several disciplines have emerged at the interface
   between neuroscience and the social and human sciences. For the most
   part, they aim at capturing the commonalities that underlay the
   heterogeneity of human behaviors and experiences. Neuroanthropology and
   cultural neuroscience, or the ``neurodisciplines of culture,{''} appear
   different, since their goal is to understand specificity rather than
   commonality and to address how cultural differences are inscribed in the
   brain. After offering an overview of these disciplines, and of their
   relation to endeavors such as cultural psychology and social
   neuroscience, this article discusses some of the most representative
   studies in the area in order to explore in which ways they are relevant
   for an understanding of culture.}},

Abstract = {{The current study utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to examine how two important noncognitive skills, grit
   and growth mindset, are associated with cortico-striatal networks
   important for learning. Whole-brain seed-to-voxel connectivity was
   examined for dorsal and ventral striatal seeds. While both grit and
   growth mindset were associated with functional connectivity between
   ventral striatal and bilateral prefrontal networks thought to be
   important for cognitive-behavioral control. There were also clear
   dissociations between the neural correlates of the two constructs. Grit,
   the long-termperseverance towards a goal or set of goals, was associated
   with ventral striatal networks including connectivity to regions such as
   the medial prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices implicated
   in perseverance, delay and receipt of reward. Growth mindset, the belief
   that effort can improve talents, notably intelligence, was associated
   with both ventral and dorsal striatal connectivity with regions thought
   to be important for error-monitoring, such as dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex. Our findings may help construct neurocognitive models of these
   non-cognitive skills and have critical implications for character
   education. Such education is a key component of social and emotional

Abstract = {{Social transmission of both threat and safety is ubiquitous, but little
   is known about the neural circuitry underlying vicarious safety
   learning. This is surprising given that these processes are critical to
   flexibly adapt to a changeable environment. To address how the
   expression of previously learned fears can be modified by the
   transmission of social information, two conditioned stimuli (CS + s)
   were paired with shock and the third was not. During extinction, we held
   constant the amount of direct, non-reinforced, exposure to the CSs (i.e.
   direct extinction), and critically varied whether another
   individual-acting as a demonstrator-experienced safety (CS + (vic
   safety)) or aversive reinforcement (CS + (vic reinf)). During
   extinction, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) responses to the CS +
   (vic reinf) increased but decreased to the CS + (vic safety). This
   pattern of vmPFC activity was reversed during a subsequent fear
   reinstatement test, suggesting a temporal shift in the involvement of
   the vmPFC. Moreover, only the CS + (vic reinf) association recovered.
   Our data suggest that vicarious extinction prevents the return of
   conditioned fear responses, and that this efficacy is reflected by
   diminished vmPFC involvement during extinction learning. The present
   findings may have important implications for understanding how social
   information influences the persistence of fear memories in individuals
   suffering from emotional disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation theories posit that strategies like reappraisal
   should impact both the intensity and duration of emotional responses.
   However, research on reappraisal to date has examined almost exclusively
   its effect on the intensity of responses while failing to examine its
   effect on the duration of responses. To address this, we used inverse
   logit functions to estimate the height and duration of hemodynamic
   responses to negative pictures when individuals with recent life stress
   were instructed to use reappraisal either to decrease their negative
   emotion or to increase their positive emotion (relative to unregulated
   viewing of negative pictures). Several emotion-generative regions such
   as the amygdala, thalamus and midbrain exhibited decreases in duration
   of activation, even when controlling for differences in height of
   activation. In addition, whereas the amygdala exhibited both decreased
   activation height and duration when participants reappraised to decrease
   their negative emotion, it only exhibited decreased duration when
   participants reappraised to increase their positive emotion. These
   results indicate that emotion regulation alters the temporal dynamics of
   emotional responding and that models of reappraisal should accommodate
   whether reappraisal influences the height of activation, duration of
   activation or both, which may change based on the goal of the
   reappraisal strategy being used.}},

Abstract = {{Self-control is key to success in life. Initial acts of self-control
   temporarily impair subsequent self-control performance. Why such
   self-control failures occur is unclear, with prominent models
   postulating a loss of a limited resource vs a loss of motivation,
   respectively. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   identify the neural correlates of motivation-induced benefits on
   self-control. Participants initially exerted or did not exert
   self-control. In a subsequent Stroop task, participants performed worse
   after exerting self-control, but not if they were motivated to perform
   well by monetary incentives. On the neural level, having exerted
   self-control resulted in decreased activation in the left inferior
   frontal gyrus. Increasing motivation resulted in a particularly strong
   activation of this area specifically after exerting self-control. Thus,
   after self-control exertion participants showed more prefrontal neural
   activity without improving performance beyond baseline level. These
   findings suggest that impaired performance after self-control exertion
   may not exclusively be due to a loss of motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Human voices consist of specific patterns of acoustic features that are
   considerably enhanced during affective vocalizations. These acoustic
   features are presumably used by listeners to accurately discriminate
   between acoustically or emotionally similar vocalizations. Here we used
   high-field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging in human listeners
   together with a so-called experimental `feature elimination approach' to
   investigate neural decoding of three important voice features of two
   affective valence categories (i.e. aggressive and joyful vocalizations).
   We found a valence-dependent sensitivity to vocal pitch (f0) dynamics
   and to spectral high-frequency cues already at the level of the auditory
   thalamus. Furthermore, pitch dynamics and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR)
   showed overlapping, but again valence-dependent sensitivity in tonotopic
   cortical fields during the neural decoding of aggressive and joyful
   vocalizations, respectively. For joyful vocalizations we also revealed
   sensitivity in the inferior frontal cortex (IFC) to the HNR and pitch
   dynamics. The data thus indicate that several auditory regions were
   sensitive to multiple, rather than single, discriminative voice
   features. Furthermore, some regions partly showed a valence-dependent
   hypersensitivity to certain features, such as pitch dynamic sensitivity
   in core auditory regions and in the IFC for aggressive vocalizations,
   and sensitivity to high-frequency cues in auditory belt and parabelt
   regions for joyful vocalizations.}},

Abstract = {{Video ads promoting condom use are a key component of media campaigns to
   stem the HIV epidemic. Recent neuroimaging studies in the context of
   smoking cessation, point to personal relevance as one of the key
   variables that determine the effectiveness of public health messages.
   While minority men who have sex with men (MSM) are at the highest risk
   of HIV infection, most safe-sex ads feature predominantly Caucasian
   actors in heterosexual scenarios. We compared brain respons of 45
   African American MSM to safe sex ads that were matched (i.e. `Targeted')
   to participants' sexual orientation and race, and `Untargeted' ads that
   were un matched for these characteristics. Ad recall, perceived
   `convincingness' and attitudes towards condom use were also assessed. We
   found that Targeted ads were better remembered than the Untargeted ads
   but perceived as equally convincing. Targeted ads engaged brain regions
   involved in self-referential processing and memory, including the
   amygdala, hippocampus, temporal and medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC)
   and the precuneus. Connectivity between MPFC and precuneus and middle
   temporal gyrus was stronger when viewing Targeted ads. Our results
   suggest that targeting may increase cognitive processing of safe sex ads
   and justify further prospective studies linking brain response to media
   public health interventions and clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Social Identity Theory (SIT) is one of the most influential perspectives
   on intergroup relations. We discuss how different neuroscientific models
   and methods (EEG, fMRI, cardiovascular measures) can illuminate insights
   into four core social identity constructs and processes: Social
   categorization, self-group overlap, ingroup bias, and coping with
   threat. We describe neuroscientific research that provides converging
   evidence for SIT. More specifically, we propose that social neuroscience
   provides more direct measures for core SIT-constructs (e.g.,
   categorization, threat) that are difficult to measure with self-report
   measures, and refines SIT by identifying more subtle forms of ingroup
   bias in `upstream' neural processing, and by testing more dynamic
   relationships between SIT constructs (e.g., considering categorization
   as a dependent variable, or examining social identity `challenge', in
   addition to threat).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Significant disruption in caregiving is associated with
   increased internalizing symptoms, most notably heightened separation
   anxiety symptoms during childhood. It is also associated with altered
   functional development of the amygdala, a neurobiological correlate of
   anxious behavior. However, much less is known about how functional
   alterations of amygdala predict individual differences in anxiety. Here,
   we probed amygdala function following institutional caregiving using
   very subtle social-affective stimuli (trustworthy and untrustworthy
   faces), which typically result in large differences in amygdala signal,
   and change in separation anxiety behaviors over a 2-year period. We
   hypothesized that the degree of differentiation of amygdala signal to
   trustworthy versus untrustworthy face stimuli would predict separation
   anxiety symptoms. Methods: Seventy-four youths mean (SD) age = 9.7 years
   (2.64) with and without previous institutional care, who were all living
   in families at the time of testing, participated in an fMRI task
   designed to examine differential amygdala response to trustworthy versus
   untrustworthy faces. Parents reported on their children's separation
   anxiety symptoms at the time of scan and again 2 years later. Results:
   Previous institutional care was associated with diminished amygdala
   signal differences and behavioral differences to the contrast of
   untrustworthy and trustworthy faces. Diminished differentiation of these
   stimuli types predicted more severe separation anxiety symptoms 2 years
   later. Older age at adoption was associated with diminished
   differentiation of amygdala responses. Conclusions: A history of
   institutional care is associated with reduced differential amygdala
   responses to social-affective cues of trustworthiness that are typically
   exhibited by comparison samples. Individual differences in the degree of
   amygdala differential responding to these cues predict the severity of
   separation anxiety symptoms over a 2-year period. These findings provide
   a biological mechanism to explain the associations between early
   caregiving adversity and individual differences in internalizing
   symptomology during development, thereby contributing to individualized
   predictions of future clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Children exposed to maltreatment show neural sensitivity to
   facial cues signalling threat. However, little is known about how
   maltreatment influences the processing of social threat cues more
   broadly, and whether atypical processing of social threat cues relates
   to psychiatric risk. Methods: Forty-one 10- to 14-year-old children
   underwent a social rejection-themed emotional Stroop task during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging: 21 children with a documented
   history of maltreatment (11 F) and 19 comparison children with no
   maltreatment history (11 F). Groups were matched on age, pubertal
   status, gender, IQ, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and reading ability.
   Classic colour Stroop stimuli were also administered in the same
   paradigm to investigate potential differences in general cognitive
   control. Results: Compared with their peers, children who had
   experienced maltreatment showed reduced activation in the Rejection
   versus Neutral condition, across circuitry previously implicated in
   abuse-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including the left
   anterior insula, extending into left ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex/orbitofrontal cortex; left amygdala; left inferior parietal
   cortex (STS); and bilateral visual association cortex, encompassing the
   cuneus and lingual gyrus. No group differences in neural or behavioural
   responses were found for the classic colour Stroop conditions.
   Significant negative associations between activity in bilateral cuneus
   and STS during the rejection-themed Stroop and higher self-reported PTSD
   symptomatology, including dissociation, were observed in children
   exposed to maltreatment. Conclusion: Our findings indicate a pattern of
   altered neural response to social rejection cues in maltreated children.
   Compared to their peers, these children displayed relative
   hypoactivation to rejection cues in regions previously associated with
   PTSD, potentially reflecting an avoidant coping response. It is
   suggested that such atypical processing of social threat may index
   latent vulnerability to future psychopathology in general and PTSD in
   particular.}},

Abstract = {{Individual and life span differences in charitable giving are an
   important economic force, yet the underlying motives are not well
   understood. In an adult, life span sample, we assessed manifestations of
   prosocial tendencies across 3 different measurement domains: (a)
   psychological self-report measures, (b) actual giving choices, and (c)
   fMRI-derived, neural indicators of ``pure altruism.{''} The latter
   expressed individuals' activity in neural valuation areas when charities
   received money compared to when oneself received money and thus
   reflected an altruistic concern for others. Results based both on
   structural equation modeling and unit-weighted aggregate scores revealed
   a strong higher-order General Benevolence dimension that accounted for
   variability across all measurement domains. The fact that the neural
   measures likely reflect pure altruistic tendencies indicates that
   General Benevolence is based on a genuine concern for others.
   Furthermore, General Benevolence exhibited a robust increase across the
   adult life span, potentially providing an explanation for why older
   adults typically contribute more to the public good than young adults.}},

Abstract = {{Visual expertise in distinguishing words from objects and word-like
   stimuli is a fundamental skill that is important for children to become
   proficient readers. This expertise can be indexed by the N1 component of
   ERPs at the neural level. However, the nature of N1 tuning for print is
   controversial in terms of onset of the latency, lateralization and the
   neural mechanism of the N1. This study aimed to investigate whether two
   groups of Chinese children could discriminate characters/character-like
   stimuli from visual controls (i.e., coarse N1 tuning) and distinguish
   characters from character-like stimuli (i.e., fine N1 tuning). We also
   explored the cognitive-linguistic correlates of N1 tuning. Seventeen
   children in the younger group (M=7.7 years) and 13 in the older group
   (M=9.4 years) were all required to finish a character decision task with
   character, pseudocharacter, noncharacter, and stroke combination
   conditions using ERP testing. Both the pseudocharacters and
   noncharacters were unpronounceable, and the main difference between the
   two conditions was in orthographic presentation (i.e., radical
   position). Children were also administered measures of reading fluency,
   reading accuracy, RAN, phonological skill and vocabulary knowledge. ERP
   results showed that a significantly larger N1 was observed in the
   characters, pseudocharacters, and noncharacters as compared to the
   stroke combinations in both groups. The N1 for characters and
   pseudocharacters was also significantly larger than that for
   noncharacters in both groups. Both coarse and fine N1s were larger for
   younger children than for older children, and the N1 was bilateral in
   younger children, but left lateralized in older children. Correlational
   analyses showed that the coarse N1 tuning of real characters versus
   visual controls was moderately correlated with reading fluency and
   accuracy but not RAN, phonology, or vocabulary. Taken together, our
   study suggests that both coarse and fine N1 tuning occurs in both
   younger and older children, when performing character decisions. Under
   such task demands, orthography, rather than phonology or semantics,
   seems to be the driver of coarse N1 tuning for print in Chinese
   children. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Large portions of energy-dense foods drive energy intake but
   the brain mechanisms underlying this effect are not clear. Our main
   objective was to investigate brain function in response to food images
   varied by portion size (PS) and energy density (ED) in children using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   METHODS AND DESIGN: Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI was
   completed in 36 children (ages 7-10 years) after a 2-h fast while
   viewing food images at two levels of PS (Large PS, Small PS) and two
   levels of ED (High ED, Low ED). Children rated perceived fullness pre-
   and post-fMRI, as well as liking of images on visual analog scales
   post-fMRI. Anthropometrics were completed 4 weeks before the fMRI. Large
   PS vs Small PS and High ED vs Low ED were compared with
   region-of-interest analyses using Brain Voyager v 2.8.
   RESULTS: Region-of-interest analyses revealed that activation in the
   right inferior frontal gyrus (P = 0.03) was greater for Large PS vs
   Small PS. Activation was reduced for High ED vs Low ED in the left
   hypothalamus (P = 0.03). Main effects were no longer significant after
   adjustment for pre-fMRI fullness and liking ratings (PS, P = 0.92; ED, P
   = 0.58).
   CONCLUSION: This is the first fMRI study to report increased activation
   to large portions in a brain region that is involved in inhibitory
   control. These findings may contribute to understanding why some
   children overeat when presented with large portions of palatable food.}},

Abstract = {{Background Very preterm birth (VPT; <32 weeks of gestation) has been
   associated with impairments in emotion regulation, social competence and
   communicative skills. However, the neuroanatomical mechanisms underlying
   such impairments have not been systematically studied. Here we
   investigated the functional integrity of the amygdala connectivity
   network in relation to the ability to recognize emotions from facial
   expressions in VPT adults.
   Method Thirty-six VPT-born adults and 38 age-matched controls were
   scanned at rest in a 3-T MRI scanner. Resting-state functional
   connectivity (rs-fc) was assessed with SPM8. A seed-based analysis
   focusing on three amygdalar subregions
   (centro-medial/latero-basal/superficial) was performed. Participants'
   ability to recognize emotions was assessed using dynamic stimuli of
   human faces expressing six emotions at different intensities with the
   Emotion Recognition Task (ERT).
   Results VPT individuals compared to controls showed reduced rs-fc
   between the superficial subregion of the left amygdala, and the right
   posterior cingulate cortex (p = 0.017) and the left precuneus (p =
   0.002). The VPT group further showed elevated rs-fc between the left
   superficial amygdala and the superior temporal sulcus (p = 0.008).
   Performance on the ERT showed that the VPT group was less able than
   controls to recognize anger at low levels of intensity. Anger scores
   were significantly associated with rs-fc between the superficial
   amygdala and the posterior cingulate cortex in controls but not in VPT
   individuals.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that alterations in rs-fc between the
   amygdala, parietal and temporal cortices could represent the mechanism
   linking VPT birth and deficits in emotion processing.}},

Abstract = {{Because he was trained to. The domestic dog's accessibility, social
   intelligence, and evolutionary history with humans have led to
   increasing interest in canine cognition. Despite a growing body of data
   on canine behavior and cognitive skills, relatively few advances have
   been made in understanding canine brain function. Practical and ethical
   concerns had limited the use of the invasive brain-imaging techniques
   typically used with primate and rodent models. However, the
   demonstration that dogs can be trained to cooperatively participate in
   fMRI studies has opened up a wealth of new data about canine brain
   function. Many of these studies have investigated the dog's
   preternatural social intelligence, focusing on neural pathways
   associated with different types of reward, including social reward, and
   face and vocal processing. These studies have implications for our
   understanding of canine brain function, and potentially, because of
   dogs' close relations with humans, for models of human development and

Abstract = {{Deficits in working memory (WM) and emotion processing are prominent
   impairments in psychotic disorders, and have been linked to reduced
   quality of life and real-world functioning. Translation of knowledge
   regarding the neural circuitry implementing these deficits into improved
   diagnosis and targeted treatments has been slow, possibly because of
   categorical definitions of disorders. Using the dimensional Research
   Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, we investigated the clinical and
   practical utility of transdiagnostic behavioral and neural measures of
   emotion-related WM disruption across psychotic disorders. Behavioral and
   functional MRI data were recorded while 53 participants with psychotic
   disorders and 29 participants with no history of psychosis performed a
   modified n-back task with fear and neutral distractors. Hierarchical
   regression analyses showed that psychotic symptoms entered after
   diagnosis accounted for unique variance in fear versus neutral accuracy
   and activation in the ventrolateral, dorsolateral, and dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex, but diagnostic group entered after psychotic symptoms
   did not. These results remained even after controlling for negative
   symptoms, disorganized symptoms, and dysphoria. Finally, worse accuracy
   and greater prefrontal activity were associated with poorer social
   functioning and unemployment across diagnostic groups. Present results
   support the transdiagnostic nature of behavioral and neuroimaging
   measures of emotion-related WM disruption as they relate to psychotic
   symptoms, irrespective of diagnosis. They also provide support for the
   practical utility of these markers in explaining real-world functioning.
   Overall, these results elucidate key aspects of the RDoC construct of WM
   maintenance by clarifying its transdiagnostic importance and clinical
   utility in psychotic disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Previous brain imaging and brain stimulation studies have suggested that
   the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may be critical in regulating
   risk-taking behavior, although its specific causal effect on people's
   risk preference remains controversial. This paper studied the
   independent modulation of the activity of the right and left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using various configurations of
   transcranial direct current stimulation. We designed a risk-measurement
   table and adopted a within-subject design to compare the same
   participant's risk preference before and after unilateral stimulation
   when presented with different frames of gain and loss. The results
   confirmed a hemispheric asymmetry and indicated that the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has an asymmetric effect on risk
   preference regarding frames of gain and loss. Enhancing the activity of
   the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex significantly decreased the
   participants' degree of risk aversion in the gain frame, whereas it
   increased the participants' degree of risk aversion in the loss frame.
   Our findings provide important information regarding the impact of
   transcranial direct current stimulation on the risk preference of
   healthy participants. The effects observed in our experiment compared
   with those of previous studies provide further evidence of the effects
   of hemispheric and frame-dependent asymmetry. These findings may be
   helpful in understanding the neural basis of risk preference in humans,
   especially when faced with decisions involving possible gain or loss
   relative to the status quo. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in human neuroimaging have shown that it is possible to
   accurately decode how the brain perceives information based only on
   non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements of brain
   activity. Two commonly used statistical approaches, namely, univariate
   analysis and multivariate pattern analysis often lead to distinct
   patterns of selected voxels. One current debate in brain decoding
   concerns whether the brain's representation of sound categories is
   localized or distributed. We hypothesize that the distributed pattern of
   voxels selected by most multivariate pattern analysis models can be an
   artifact due to the spatial correlation among voxels. Here, we propose a
   Bayesian spatially varying coefficient model, where the spatial
   correlation is modeled through the variance-covariance matrix of the
   model coefficients. Combined with a proposed region selection strategy,
   we demonstrate that our approach is effective in identifying the truly
   localized patterns of the voxels while maintaining robustness to
   discover truly distributed pattern. In addition, we show that localized
   or clustered patterns can be artificially identified as distributed if
   without proper usage of the spatial correlation information in fMRI
   data. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
   tics, repetitive movements and vocalizations which are prompted by a
   sensory-cognitive premonitory urge. Complex tics include environmentally
   dependent social behaviors such as echoing of other people's speech and
   actions. Recent studies have suggested that adults with TS can show
   differences to controls in Theory of Mind (ToM): reasoning about mental
   states (e.g. beliefs, emotions). In this study, twenty-five adults with
   uncomplicated TS (no co-morbid disorders, moderate tic severity), and
   twenty-five healthy age and gender matched controls were scanned with
   fMRI during an established ToM task. Neural activity was contrasted
   across ToM trials involving reasoning about false-belief, and matched
   trials requiring judgments about physical states rather than mental
   states. Contrasting task conditions uncovered differential fMRI
   activation in TS during ToM involving the right temporo-parietal
   junction (TPJ), right amygdala and posterior cingulate. Further analysis
   revealed that activity within the right TPJ as localised by this task
   covaried with the severity of symptoms including echophenomena, impulse
   control problems and premonitory urges in TS. Amygdala activation was
   also linked to premonitory urges, while activity in the left TPJ during
   ToM was linked to ratings of non-obscene socially inappropriate
   symptoms. These findings indicate that patients with TS exhibit atypical
   functional activation within key neural substrates involved in ToM. More
   generally, our data could highlight an important role for TPJ
   dysfunction in driving compulsive behaviors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Creativity is commonly defined as the ability to produce something both
   novel and useful. Stimulating creativity has great significance for both
   individual success and social improvement. Although increasing creative
   capacity has been confirmed to be possible and effective at the
   behavioral level, few longitudinal studies have examined the extent to
   which the brain function and structure underlying creativity are
   plastic. A cognitive stimulation (20 sessions) method was used in the
   present study to train subjects and to explore the neuroplasticity
   induced by training. The behavioral results revealed that both the
   originality and the fluency of divergent thinking were significantly
   improved by training. Furthermore, functional changes induced by
   training were observed in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC),
   dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and posterior brain regions.
   Moreover, the gray matter volume (GMV) was significantly increased in
   the dACC after divergent thinking training. These results suggest that
   the enhancement of creativity may rely not only on the posterior brain
   regions that are related to the fundamental cognitive processes of
   creativity (e.g., semantic processing, generating novel associations),
   but also on areas that are involved in top-down cognitive control, such
   as the dACC and DLPFC. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3375-3387, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{Humans have the ability to reflect upon their perception, thoughts, and
   actions, known as metacognition (MC). The brain basis of MC is
   incompletely understood, and it is debated whether MC on different
   processes is subserved by common or divergent networks. We combined
   behavioral phenotyping with multi-modal neuroimaging to investigate
   whether structural substrates of individual differences in MC on
   higher-order cognition (MC-C) are dissociable from those underlying MC
   on perceptual accuracy (MC-P). Motivated by conceptual work suggesting a
   link between MC and cognitive perspective taking, we furthermore tested
   for overlaps between MC substrates and mentalizing networks. In a large
   sample of healthy adults, individual differences in MC-C and MC-P did
   not correlate. MRI-based cortical thickness mapping revealed a
   structural basis of this independence, by showing that individual
   differences in MC-P related to right prefrontal cortical thickness,
   while MC-C scores correlated with measures in lateral prefrontal,
   temporo-parietal, and posterior midline regions. Surface-based
   superficial white matter diffusivity analysis revealed substrates
   resembling those seen for cortical thickness, confirming the divergence
   of both MC faculties using an independent imaging marker. Despite their
   specificity, substrates of MC-C and MC-P fell clearly within networks
   known to participate in mentalizing, confirmed by task-based fMRI in the
   same subjects, previous meta-analytical findings, and ad-hoc
   Neurosynth-based meta-analyses. Our integrative multi-method approach
   indicates domain-specific substrates of MC; despite their divergence,
   these nevertheless likely rely on component processes mediated by
   circuits also involved in mentalizing. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3388-3399,

Abstract = {{Morality is defined as prescriptive norms regarding how people should
   treat one another, and includes concepts of fairness, justice, and
   rights. One recent study with moral dilemmas suggested that testosterone
   administration increases utilitarian judgments, which depends on
   second-to-fourth (2D: 4D) digit ratio, as a proxy of prenatal priming.
   However, the neural mechanism by which acute testosterone modulates
   moral reasoning remains to be determined. Using a placebo-controlled
   within-subject design, the current study examined the neuromodulatory
   effect of testosterone in young females by combining moral dilemmas, 2D:
   4D, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and subjective ratings
   of morally laden scenarios. Results showed that testosterone
   administration elicited more utilitarian responses to evitable dilemmas.
   The high 2D: 4D group scored more punishments for moral evaluation,
   whereas the low 2D: 4D group did the opposite. The activity in the
   amygdala, anterior insular cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (dlPFC) was increased when participants evaluated morally unorthodox
   actions (intentional harm). The activity in the posterior superior
   temporal sulcus/temporoparietal junction (pSTS/TPJ) to accidental harm
   was decreased, specific to the high 2D: 4D group. The functional
   connectivity between the amygdala and dlPFC was reduced. The activity in
   the pSTS/TPJ to perceived agency predicted utilitarian responses to
   evitable dilemmas. The findings demonstrate the acute effect of
   testosterone on neural responses associated with moral judgment, and
   provide evidence to support that prenatal sex-hormones priming could be
   important for early neurodevelopment, which plays a crucial role in the
   neural and behavioral manifestations of testosterone on adult moral
   reasoning. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3417-3430, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{Behavioral evidence and theory suggest gesture and language processing
   may be part of a shared cognitive system for communication. While much
   research demonstrates both gesture and language recruit regions along
   perisylvian cortex, relatively less work has tested functional
   segregation within these regions on an individual level. Additionally,
   while most work has focused on a shared semantic network, less has
   examined shared regions for processing communicative intent. To address
   these questions, functional and structural MRI data were collected from
   24 adult participants while viewing videos of an experimenter producing
   communicative, Participant-Directed Gestures (PDG) (e.g., Hello, come
   here), noncommunicative Self-adaptor Gestures (SG) (e.g., smoothing
   hair), and three written text conditions: (1) Participant-Directed
   Sentences (PDS), matched in content to PDG, (2) Third-person Sentences
   (3PS), describing a character's actions from a third-person perspective,
   and (3) meaningless sentences, Jabberwocky (JW). Surface-based
   conjunction and individual functional region of interest analyses
   identified shared neural activation between gesture (PDGvsSG) and
   language processing using two different language contrasts. Conjunction
   analyses of gesture (PDGvsSG) and Third-person Sentences versus
   Jabberwocky revealed overlap within left anterior and posterior superior
   temporal sulcus (STS). Conjunction analyses of gesture and
   Participant-Directed Sentences to Third-person Sentences revealed
   regions sensitive to communicative intent, including the left middle and
   posterior STS and left inferior frontal gyrus. Further, parametric
   modulation using participants' ratings of stimuli revealed sensitivity
   of left posterior STS to individual perceptions of communicative intent
   in gesture. These data highlight an important role of the STS in
   processing participant-directed communicative intent through gesture and
   language. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3444-3461, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{When required to represent a perspective that conflicts with one's own,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggests that the right
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (rvlPFC) supports the inhibition of that
   conflicting self-perspective. The present task dissociated inhibition of
   self-perspective from other executive control processes by contrasting
   belief reasoninga cognitive state where the presence of conflicting
   perspectives was manipulatedwith a conative desire state wherein no
   systematic conflict existed. Linear modeling was used to examine the
   effect of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to rvlPFC on
   participants' reaction times in belief and desire reasoning. It was
   anticipated that cTBS applied to rvlPFC would affect belief but not
   desire reasoning, by modulating activity in the Ventral Attention System
   (VAS). We further anticipated that this effect would be mediated by
   functional connectivity within this network, which was identified using
   resting state fMRI and an unbiased model-free approach. Simple
   reaction-time analysis failed to detect an effect of cTBS. However, by
   additionally modeling individual measures from within the stimulated
   network, the hypothesized effect of cTBS to belief (but, importantly,
   not desire) reasoning was demonstrated. Structural morphology within the
   stimulated region, rvlPFC, and right temporoparietal junction were
   demonstrated to underlie this effect. These data provide evidence that
   inconsistencies found with cTBS can be mediated by the composition of
   the functional network that is being stimulated. We suggest that the
   common claim that this network constitutes the VAS explains the effect
   of cTBS to this network on false belief reasoning. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{The influential competition between verbal and implicit systems (COVIS)
   model proposes that category learning is driven by two competing neural
   systemsan explicit, verbal, system, and a procedural-based, implicit,
   system. In the current fMRI study, participants learned either a
   conjunctive, rule-based (RB), category structure that is believed to
   engage the explicit system, or an information-integration category
   structure that is thought to preferentially recruit the implicit system.
   The RB and information-integration category structures were matched for
   participant error rate, the number of relevant stimulus dimensions, and
   category separation. Under these conditions, considerable overlap in
   brain activation, including the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and
   the hippocampus, was found between the RB and information-integration
   category structures. Contrary to the predictions of COVIS, the medial
   temporal lobes and in particular the hippocampus, key regions for
   explicit memory, were found to be more active in the
   information-integration condition than in the RB condition. No regions
   were more activated in RB than information-integration category
   learning. The implications of these results for theories of category
   learning are discussed. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3557-3574, 2016. (c) 2016

Title = {{Exposure to an inflammatory challenge enhances neural sensitivity to
   negative and positive social feedback}},
Journal = {{BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{21-29}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Inflammation, part of the body's innate immune response, can lead to
   ``sickness behaviors,{''} as well as alterations in social and affective
   experiences. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been
   associated with increased neural sensitivity to social rejection and
   social threat, but also decreased neural sensitivity to rewards.
   However, recent evidence suggests that inflammation may actually enhance
   sensitivity to certain social rewards, such as those that signal support
   and care. Despite a growing interest in how inflammation influences
   neural reactivity to positive and negative social experiences, no known
   studies have investigated these processes in the same participants,
   using a similar task. To examine this issue, 107 participants were
   randomly assigned to receive either placebo or low-dose endotoxin, which
   safely triggers an inflammatory response. When levels of
   pro-inflammatory cytokines were at their peak, participants were scanned
   using fMRI while they received positive, negative, and neutral feedback
   from an ``evaluator{''} (actually a confederate) about how they came
   across in an audio-recorded interview. In response to negative feedback
   (vs. neutral), participants in the endotoxin condition showed heightened
   neural activity in a number of threat-related neural regions (i.e.,
   bilateral amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) and a key
   mentalizing-related region (i.e., dorsomedial PFC), compared to placebo
   participants. Interestingly, when receiving positive feedback (vs.
   neutral), endotoxin (vs. placebo) led to greater neural activity in the
   ventral striatum and ventromedial PFC, regions often implicated in
   processing reward, as well as greater activity in dorsomedial PFC.
   Together, these results reveal that individuals exposed to an
   inflammatory challenge are more ``neurally sensitive{''} to both
   negative and positive social feedback, suggesting that inflammation may
   lead to a greater vigilance for both social threats and social rewards.

Abstract = {{Low-grade systemic inflammation has been implicated in chronic pain, as
   well as in comorbid diseases like depression and fatigue. We have
   previously shown that women's pain perception and regulation is more
   affected by systemic inflammation than that of men. Here we investigated
   the neural substrates underlying these effects using an fMRI paradigm
   previously employed in a clinical population. Fiftyone participants (29
   women) were injected with 0.6 ng/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline
   to induce a peripheral inflammatory response.
   The subjects were then tested with a pressure pain fMRI paradigm
   designed to capture descending pain inhibitory activity 2 h after
   injection, and blood was sampled for cytokine analysis. The subjects
   injected with LPS became more pain sensitive compared to the placebo
   group, and the heightened pain sensitivity was paralleled by decreased
   activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the rostra( anterior
   cingulate cortex (rACC) compared to placebo; areas involved in
   descending pain regulation. The LPS group also had higher activity in
   the anterior insular cortex, an area underpinning affective and
   interoceptive pain processing. Women displayed overall less pain-evoked
   rACC activity compared to men, which may have rendered women less
   resilient to immune provocation, possibly explaining sex differences in
   LPS-induced pain sensitivity. Our findings elucidate the pain-related
   brain circuits affected by experimental peripheral inflammation,
   strengthening the theoretical link between systemic inflammation and
   weakened pain regulation in chronic pain disdrders. The results further
   suggest a possible mechanism underlying the female predominance in many
   chronic pain disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of functional neuroimaging investigations aim to
   characterize an average human brain. However, another important goal of
   cognitive neuroscience is to understand the ways in which individuals
   differ from one another and the significance of these differences. This
   latter goal is given special weight by the recent reconceptualization of
   neurological disorders where sharp boundaries are no longer drawn either
   between health and neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, or
   among different disorders (e.g., Insel et al., 2010). Consequently, even
   the variability in the healthy population can inform our understanding
   of brain disorders. However, because the use of functional neural
   markers is still in its infancy, no consensus presently exists about
   which measures (e.g., effect size?, extent of activation?, degree of
   lateralization?) are the best ones to use. We here attempt to address
   this question with respect to one large-scale neural system: the set of
   brain regions in the frontal and temporal cortices that jointly support
   high-level linguistic processing (e.g., Binder et al., 1997; Fedorenko,
   Hsieh, Nieto-Castanon, Whitfield-Gabrieli, \& Kanwisher, 2010). In
   particular, using data from 150 individuals all of whom had performed a
   language ``localizer{''} task contrasting sentences and nonword
   sequences (Fedorenko et al., 2010), we: a) characterize the
   distributions of the values for four key neural measures of language
   activity (region effect sizes, region volumes, lateralization based on
   effect sizes, and lateralization based on volumes); b) test the
   reliability of these measures in a subset of 32 individuals who were
   scanned across two sessions; c) evaluate the relationship among the
   different regions of the language system; and d) evaluate the
   relationship among the different neural measures. Based on our results,
   we provide some recommendations for future studies of brain-behavior and
   brain-genes relationships. Although some of our conclusions are specific
   to the language system, others (e.g., the fact that effect-size-based
   measures tend to be more reliable than volume-based measures) are likely
   to generalize to the rest of the brain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Research on neural basis of inhibitory control has been extensively
   conducted in various parts of the world. It is often implicitly assumed
   that neural basis of inhibitory control is universally similar across
   cultures. Here, we investigated the extent to which culture modulated
   inhibitory-control brain activity at both cultural-group and
   cultural-value levels of analysis. During fMRI scanning, participants
   from different cultural groups (including Caucasian-Americans and
   Japanese-Americans living in the United States and native Japanese
   living in Japan) performed a Go/No-Go task. They also completed
   behavioral surveys assessing cultural values of behavioral consistency,
   or the extent to which one's behaviors in daily life are consistent
   across situations. Across participants, the Go/No-Go task elicited
   stronger neural activity in several inhibitory-control areas, such as
   the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
   Importantly, at the cultural-group level, we found variation in left IFG
   (L-IFG) activity that was explained by a cultural region where
   participants lived in (as opposed to race). Specifically, L-IFG activity
   was stronger for native Japanese compared to Caucasian-and
   Japanese-Americans, while there was no systematic difference in L-IFG
   activity between Japanese-and Caucasian-Americans. At the cultural-value
   level, we found that participants who valued being ``themselves{''}
   across situations (i.e., having high endorsement of behavioral
   consistency) elicited stronger rostral ACC activity during the Go/No-Go
   task. Altogether, our findings provide novel insight into how culture
   modulates the neural basis of inhibitory control. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Conventional metaphors in longer passages evoke affective brain response}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{218-230}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Conventional metaphorical sentences such as She's a sweet child have
   been found to elicit greater amygdala activation than matched literal
   sentences (e.g., She's a kind child). In the present fMRI study, this
   finding is strengthened and extended with naturalistic stimuli involving
   longer passages and a range of conventional metaphors. In particular, a
   greater number of activation peaks (four) were found in the bilateral
   amygdala when passages containing conventional metaphors were read than
   when their matched literal versions were read (a single peak); while the
   direct contrast between metaphorical and literal passages did not show
   significant amygdala activation, parametric analysis revealed that BOLD
   signal changes in the left amygdala correlated with an increase in
   metaphoricity ratings across all stories. Moreover, while a measure of
   complexity was positively correlated with an increase in activation of a
   broad bilateral network mainly involving the temporal lobes, complexity
   was not predictive of amygdala activity. Thus, the results suggest that
   amygdala activation is not simply a result of stronger overall activity
   related to language comprehension, but is more specific to the
   processing of metaphorical language.
   Significance statement: This work is the first to show that conventional
   metaphorical language in naturalistic longer passages that includes a
   range of metaphors elicits more activation in the amygdala-an area
   recognized to be involved in emotional processing-than carefully matched
   literal control passages. We probe this finding with parametric analyses
   using a measure of syntactic complexity and subjective judgments of
   metaphoricity. While complexity correlates with more overall bilateral
   activation of the temporal lobes, it does not correlate with amygdala
   activation. Instead, amygdala activation correlates with metaphoricity,
   suggesting that the increase in emotional salience is specific to
   metaphoricity and is not simply a result of an overall increase in brain
   activity in regions associated with language comprehension. Crown

   domain-general in nature}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{368-375}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Imitation has been hailed as `social glue', facilitating rapport with
   others. Previous studies suggest that social cues modulate imitation but
   the mechanism of such modulation remains underspecified. Here we examine
   the locus, specificity, and neural basis of the social control of
   imitation. Social cues (group membership and eye gaze) were manipulated
   during an imitation task in which imitative and spatial compatibility
   could be measured independently. Participants were faster to perform
   compatible compared to incompatible movements in both spatial and
   imitative domains. However, only spatial compatibility was modulated by
   social cues: an interaction between group membership and eye gaze
   revealed more spatial compatibility for ingroup members with direct gaze
   and outgroup members with averted gaze. The fMRI data were consistent
   with this finding. Regions associated with the control of imitative
   responding (temporoparietal junction, inferior frontal gyrus) were more
   active during imitatively incompatible compared to imitatively
   compatible trials. However, this activity was not modulated by social
   cues. On the contrary, an interaction between group, gaze and spatial
   compatibility was found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a
   pattern consistent with reaction times. This region may be exerting
   control over the motor system to modulate response inhibition. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The effects of group membership on brain responses to social exclusion
   have been investigated in adults, revealing greater anterior cingulate
   responses to exclusion by members of one's in-group (e.g., same-gender).
   However, social exclusion is a critical aspect of peer relations in
   youth and reaches heightened salience during adolescence, a time when
   social anxiety disorders are also emergent. While the behavioral and
   neural correlates of social exclusion in adolescence have been
   extensively explored, the effects of group membership on peer rejection
   are less clear. The current study used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to investigate the differential neural correlates of
   being excluded by peers of one's same- versus opposite-gender during an
   online ball-toss game. Participants were a group of typically developing
   children and adolescents (7-17years). As predicted, anterior cingulate
   cortex showed a main effect of social exclusion versus fair play.
   However, unlike a previous adult study, this region did not show
   increased activation to same-gender exclusion. Instead, several regions
   differentiating same- versus opposite-gender exclusion were exclusively
   more sensitive to exclusion by one's opposite gender. These results are
   discussed in the context of adolescent socio-emotional development.}},

Volume = {{255}},

Abstract = {{Women ill with anorexia nervosa (AN) have been shown to exhibit altered
   cognitive functioning, particularly poor set-shifting (SS). In this
   study, we investigated whether brain activation in frontal and parietal
   regions during visual stimulus processing correlates with SS ability.
   Women currently ill with AN (AN; N=14), recovered women (REC; N=14) and
   healthy controls (HC; N=15), viewed alternating blocks of food and
   non-food pictures during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   The Berg's Card Sorting Task was completed outside the scanner to
   measure SS. A priori regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in frontal
   and parietal regions. The activation during visual stimulus processing
   in several ROls correlated positively with poor SS ability in REC,
   particularly in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). The
   correlations with poor SS ability were opposite in AN patients,
   particularly in the right dACC. These findings underscore that
   addressing heightened levels of cognitive control associated with higher
   frontal activation could reduce cognitive inflexibility in recovered
   women. In AN, greater activation in frontal and parietal regions might
   be necessary to perform at normal levels during various tasks. Thus,
   weight restoration could be necessary for AN patients prior to
   addressing cognitive inflexibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is highly prevalent in adolescence and
   has been suggested as an autonomous diagnosis in the Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual (DSM-5). Social rejection is as potential risk factor
   for NSSI and depression in adolescence. Objectives of this study were to
   identify differences in neural processing of social rejection in
   depressed adolescents with and without co-morbid NSSI and healthy
   controls. Participants were 28 depressed adolescents (14 with co-morbid
   NSSI, 79\% females) and 15 healthy controls, with an average age of 15.2
   years (SD = 1.8). Social exclusion was implemented using the Cyberball
   paradigm `Cyberball' during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). All participants reported feelings of social exclusion after
   fMRI scanning. Investigating the effects of NSSI, we found that
   depressed adolescents with NSSI showed relatively enhanced activation of
   the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex (vIPFC) compared to depressed adolescents without NSSI and also
   compared to healthy controls. Results point towards divergent processing
   of social exclusion in depressed adolescents with NSSI as compared to
   adolescents with mere depression in brain regions previously related to
   the processing of social exclusion. This finding of distinct
   neurophysiological responses may stimulate further research on
   individual treatment approaches. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{We investigated the influence of negative emotion on the degree of
   self-reference effect using event-related potentials (ERPs). We

   the color of the target stimulus (self-referential stimuli). ERP results
   showed that the target stimuli elicited larger P2 amplitudes under
   neutral conditions than under negative emotional conditions. Under
   neutral conditions, N2 amplitudes for highly self-relevant names (target
   stimulus) were smaller than those for any other names. Under negative
   emotional conditions, highly and moderately self-referential stimuli
   activated smaller N2 amplitudes. P3 amplitudes activated by
   self-referential processing under negative emotional conditions were
   smaller than neutral conditions. In the left and central sites, highly
   self-relevant names activated larger P3 amplitudes than any other names.
   But in the central sites, moderately self-relevant names activated
   larger P3 amplitudes than non self-relevant names. The findings indicate

Title = {{The Motivational Hierarchy between the Personal Self and Close Others in
   the Chinese Brain: an ERP Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{People base their decisions not only on their own self-interest but also
   on the interests of close others. Generally, the personal self has
   primacy in the motivational hierarchy in the Western culture. A recent
   study found that friends have the same motivational hierarchy as the
   personal self in the Eastern collectivist culture. Remaining unknown is
   whether the motivational hierarchy of the personal self and close others
   can be manifested in the collectivist brain. In the present study, we
   asked participants to gamble for the personal self, close others (i.e.,
   mother, father, and close friend), and strangers. The positive-going
   deflection of event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to positive
   feedback showed the following pattern: personal self = mother = father >
   friend > stranger. In the loss condition, no significant beneficiary
   effect was observed. The present results indicate that the personal self
   and parents are intertwined in the motivational system in the Chinese
   undergraduate student brain, supporting the view that the personal self
   and parents have the same motivational primacy at the electrocortical
   level.}},

Title = {{Reward vs. Retaliation the Role of the Mesocorticolimbic Salience
   Network in Human Reactive Aggression}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{The propensity for reactive aggression (RA) which occurs in response to
   provocation has been linked to hyperresponsivity of the
   mesocorticolimbic reward network in healthy adults. Here, we aim to
   elucidate the role of the mesocorticolimbic network in clinically
   significant RA for two competing motivated behaviors, reward-seeking vs.
   retaliation. 18 male participants performed a variant of the
   Point-Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP) during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). We examined whether RA participants compared
   with non-aggressive controls would choose to obtain a monetary reward
   over the opportunity to retaliate against a fictitious opponent, who
   provoked the participant by randomly stealing money from his earnings.
   Across all fMRI-PSAP runs, RA individuals vs. controls chose to work
   harder to earn money but not to retaliate. When engaging in such
   reward-seeking behavior vs. retaliation in a single fMRI-PSAP run, RA
   individuals exhibited increased activation in the insular-striatal part
   of the mesocorticolimbic salience network, and decreased precuneus and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation compared to controls. Enhanced
   overall reward-seeking behavior along with an up-regulation of the
   mesocorticolimbic salience network and a down-regulation of the
   default-mode network in RA individuals indicate that RA individuals are
   willing to work more for monetary reward than for retaliation when
   presented with a choice. Our findings may suggest that the use of
   positive reinforcement might represent an efficacious intervention
   approach for the potential reduction of retaliatory behavior in
   clinically significant RA.}},

Abstract = {{Pain is a fundamental human experience that triggers a range of social

   fMRI data to examine the effect of multiple group memberships salience
   on reported and neural indices of pain. We found that participants
   expressed higher levels of pain when more social group memberships were
   salient. This is consistent with the notion that pain itself motivates
   people to communicate their pain, and more so when multiple
   psychological resources are salient. In addition, fMRI results reveal an
   interesting twist: when participants increased their pain reporting as
   group memberships increased (from one group to four), there was a
   corresponding relative reduction in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and
   anterior insula activation. These results provide evidence for an
   adaptive response to pain: the more people make use of the social
   resources at their disposal when experiencing pain, the less pain areas
   are activated.}},

Title = {{Variation in the Oxytocin Receptor Gene Is Associated with Face
   Recognition and its Neural Correlates}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{The ability to recognize faces is crucial for daily social interactions.
   Recent studies suggest that intranasal oxytocin administration improves
   social recognition in humans. Oxytocin signaling in the amygdala plays
   an essential role for social recognition in mice, and oxytocin
   administration has been shown to influence amygdala activity in humans.
   It is therefore possible that the effects of oxytocin on human social
   recognition depend on mechanisms that take place in the amygdala a
   central region for memory processing also in humans. Variation in the
   gene encoding the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) has been associated with
   several aspects of social behavior. The present study examined the
   potential associations between nine OXTR polymorphisms, distributed
   across the gene, and the ability to recognize faces, as well as
   face-elicited amygdala activity measured by functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) during incidental encoding of faces. The OXTR
   3' polymorphism rs7632287, previously related to social bonding behavior
   and autism risk, was associated with participants ability to recognize
   faces. Carriers of the GA genotype, associated with enhanced memory,
   displayed higher amygdala activity during face encoding compared to
   carriers of the GG genotype. In line with work in rodents, these
   findings suggest that, in humans, naturally occurring endogenous
   modulation of OXTR function affects social recognition through an
   amygdala-dependent mechanism. These findings contribute to the
   understanding of how oxytocin regulates human social behaviors.}},

   -cognitive functioning.
   Methods: This clinical study is a randomized, double-blind, cross-over,
   placebo-controlled, multicenter functional magnetic resonance imaging
   study with two arms. A sample of 102 male autism spectrum disorder
   patients, diagnosed with Infantile Autistic Disorder (F84.0 according to
   ICD-10), Asperger Syndrome (F84.5 according to ICD-10), or Atypical
   Autism (F84.1 according to ICD-10) will be recruited and will receive
   oxytocin and placebo nasal spray on two different days. Autism spectrum
   disorder patients will be randomized to determine who receives oxytocin
   on the first and who on the second visit. Healthy control participants
   will be recruited and case-control matched to the autism spectrum
   disorder patients. The primary outcome will be neural network activity,
   measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants
   perform socio-affective and -cognitive tasks. Behavioral markers such as
   theory of mind accuracy ratings and response times will be assessed as
   secondary outcomes in addition to physiological measures such as skin
   conductance. Trait measures for alexithymia, interpersonal reactivity,
   and social anxiety will also be evaluated. Additionally, we will analyze
   the effect of oxytocin receptor gene variants and how these potentially
   influence the primary and secondary outcome measures. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging assessments will take place at two time
   points which will be scheduled at least two weeks apart to ensure a
   sufficient wash-out time after oxytocin treatment. The study has been
   approved by an ethical review board and the competent authority.
   Discussion: Revealing the mechanisms of acute oxytocin administration,
   especially on the socio-affective and -cognitive domains at hand, will
   be a further step towards novel therapeutic interventions regarding
   autism.}},

Abstract = {{Combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common among
   returning veterans, and is a serious and debilitating disorder. While
   highly effective treatments involving trauma exposure exist,
   difficulties with engagement and early drop may lead to sub-optimal
   outcomes. Mindfulness training may provide a method for increasing
   emotional regulation skills that may improve engagement in
   trauma-focused therapy. Here, we examine potential neural correlates of
   mindfulness training and in vivo exposure (non-trauma focused) using a
   novel group therapy {[}mindfulness-based exposure therapy (MBET)] in
   Afghanistan (OFF) or Iraq (OIF) combat veterans with PTSD. OFF/OIF
   combat veterans with PTSD (N = 23) were treated with MBET (N = 14) or a
   comparison group therapy {[}Present-centered group therapy (PCGT), N =
   9]. PTSD symptoms were assessed at pre- and post-therapy with Clinician
   Administered PTSD scale. Functional neuroimaging (3-1 fMRI) before and
   after therapy examined responses to emotional faces (angry, fearful, and
   neutral faces). Patients treated with MBET had reduced PTSD symptoms
   (effect size d = 0.92) but effect was not significantly different from
   PCGT (d = 0.43). Improvement in PTSD symptoms from pre- to
   post-treatment in both treatment groups was correlated with increased
   activity in rostral anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC), and left amygdala. The MBET group showed greater
   increases in amygdala and fusiform gyrus responses to Angry faces, as
   well as increased response in left mPFC to Fearful faces. These
   preliminary findings provide intriguing evidence that MBET group therapy
   for PTSD may lead to changes in neural processing of social emotional
   threat related to symptom reduction.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of restrained eaters' high susceptibility to food
   cues: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{631}},
Pages = {{56-62}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Many studies have reported that specific susceptibility to food cues
   plays an important role in disordered eating behavior. However, whether
   restraint status modulates the neural bases of attentional bias to
   different types of food cues remains unknown. Thus, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted in individuals (12 restraint
   eaters, 12 unrestraint eaters) exposed to high/low-energy food and
   neutral images while performing a two-choice oddball task. The results
   indicated that restrained eaters responded more quickly to high-energy
   food images than to neutral and low-energy food images. More notably,
   compared with unrestrained eaters, restrained eaters showed faster
   reaction times, hyper activation in a much wider array of reward (e.g.,
   insula/orbitofrontal cortex), attention (superior frontal gyrus) and
   visual processing (e.g., superior temporal gyrus) regions, and
   hypo-activation in cognitive control areas (e.g., anterior cingulate) in
   response to high-energy food cues. Furthermore, among restrained eaters,
   the longest reaction times were found for low-energy food images, and
   activation of the attention and visual-related cortex (e.g., superior
   parietal gyrus) in the low neutral contrast condition was significantly
   stronger than in unrestrained eaters. These findings contribute to our
   understanding of susceptibility to food cues: in addition to the special
   sensitivity (attentional bias) to high-energy food images, restrained
   eaters may also be more sensitive (allocate more attentional resources)
   to low-energy food images. These potential neural bases of restrained
   eaters may help clarify why dieting to lose or maintain weight is so
   often unsuccessful. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When reading a narrative text, both the dorsal and ventral visual
   systems are activated. To illustrate the patterns of interactions
   between the dorsal and ventral visual systems in text reading, we
   conducted analyses of functional connectivity (FC) and effective
   connectivity (EC) in a left-hemispheric network for reading-driven
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state fMRI
   (rs-fMRI) data. In reading-driven fMRI (Experiment 1), we found
   significant FCs among the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the left
   intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and the visual word form area (VWFA), and
   there were topdown effects from the left MFG to the left IPS, from the
   left MFG to the VWFA, and from the left IPS to the VWFA. In rs-fMRI
   (Experiment 2), we identified FCs and ECs for MFG-IPS and IPS-VWFA
   connections. In addition, the brainbehavior relationship in resting
   states showed that the dorsal connection was more associated with
   reading fluency relative to lexical decision. The combination of two
   experiments revealed that the MFG-IPS and the VWFA-IPS connections were
   shared connections both in reading-driven fMRI and rs-fMRI, and that the
   MFG-VWFA was specific connectivity in reading-driven fMRI. These results
   suggest that topdown effects from the dorsal visual system to ventral
   visual system play an important role in text reading.}},

Abstract = {{Visual motion responses in the brain are shaped by two distinct sources:
   the physical movement of objects in the environment and motion resulting
   from one's own actions. The latter source, termed visual reafference,
   stems from movements of the head and body, and in primates from the
   frequent saccadic eye movements that mark natural vision. To study the
   relative contribution of reafferent and stimulus motion during natural
   vision, we measured fMRI activity in the brains of two macaques as they
   freely viewed >50 hours of naturalistic video footage depicting dynamic
   social interactions. We used eye movements obtained during scanning to
   estimate the level of reafferent retinal motion at each moment in time.
   We also estimated the net stimulus motion by analyzing the video content
   during the same time periods. Mapping the responses to these distinct
   sources of retinal motion, we found a striking dissociation in the
   distribution of visual responses throughout the brain. Reafferent motion
   drove fMRI activity in the early retinotopic areas V1, V2, V3, and V4,
   particularly in their central visual field representations, as well as
   lateral aspects of the caudal inferotemporal cortex (area TE0. However,
   stimulus motion dominated fMRI responses in the superior temporal
   sulcus, including areas MT, MST, and FST as well as more rostral areas.
   We discuss this pronounced separation of motion processing in the
   context of natural vision, saccadic suppression, and the brain's
   utilization of corollary discharge signals.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Love and affection is expressed through a range of physically intimate
   gestures, including caresses. Recent studies suggest that posterior
   temporal lobe areas typically associated with visual processing of
   social cues also respond to interpersonal touch. Here, we asked whether
   these areas are selective to caress-like skin stroking. We collected
   functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 23 healthy participants
   and compared brain responses to skin stroking and vibration. We did not
   find any significant differences between stroking and vibration in the
   posterior temporal lobe; however, right posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (pSTS) responses predicted healthy participants perceived
   pleasantness of skin stroking, but not vibration. These findings link
   right pSTS responses to individual variability in perceived pleasantness
   of caress-like tactile stimuli. We speculate that the right pSTS may
   play a role in the translation of tactile stimuli into positively
   valenced, socially relevant interpersonal touch and that this system may
   be affected in disorders associated with impaired attachment.}},

Abstract = {{The sunk cost effect, an interesting and well-known maladaptive
   behavior, is pervasive in real life, and thus has been studied in
   various disciplines, including economics, psychology, organizational
   behavior, politics, and biology. However, the neural mechanisms
   underlying the sunk cost effect have not been clearly established, nor
   have their association with differences in individual susceptibility to
   the effect. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated
   neural responses induced by sunk costs along with measures of core human
   personality. We found that individuals who tend to adhere to social
   rules and regulations (who are high in measured agreeableness and
   conscientiousness) are more susceptible to the sunk cost effect.
   Furthermore, this behavioral observation was strongly mediated by insula
   activity during sunk cost decision-making. Tight coupling between the
   insula and lateral prefrontal cortex was also observed during
   decision-making under sunk costs. Our findings reveal how individual
   differences can affect decision-making under sunk costs, thereby
   contributing to a better understanding of the psychological and neural
   mechanisms of the sunk cost effect.}},

Abstract = {{Faces are salient social stimuli whose features attract a stereotypical
   pattern of fixations. The implications of this gaze behavior for
   perception and brain activity are largely unknown. Here, we characterize
   and quantify a retinotopic bias implied by typical gaze behavior toward
   faces, which leads to eyes and mouth appearing most often in the upper
   and lower visual field, respectively. We found that the adult human
   visual system is tuned to these contingencies. In two recognition
   experiments, recognition performance for isolated face parts was better
   when they were presented at typical, rather than reversed, visual field
   locations. The recognition cost of reversed locations was equal to
   similar to 60\% of that for whole face inversion in the same sample.
   Similarly, an fMRI experiment showed that patterns of activity evoked by
   eye and mouth stimuli in the right inferior occipital gyrus could be
   separated with significantly higher accuracy when these features were
   presented at typical, rather than reversed, visual field locations. Our
   findings demonstrate thathumanface perception is determined not only by
   the local position of features within a face context, but by whether
   features appear at the typical retinotopic location given normal gaze
   behavior. Such location sensitivity may reflect fine-tuning of
   category-specific visual processing to retinal input statistics. Our
   findings further suggest that retinotopic heterogeneity might play a
   role for face inversion effects and for the understanding of conditions
   affecting gaze behavior toward faces, such as autism spectrum disorders
   and congenital prosopagnosia.}},

Abstract = {{The evolved capacity for third-party punishment is considered crucial to
   the emergence and maintenance of elaborate human social organization and
   is central to the modern provision of fairness and justice within
   society. Although it is well established that the mental state of the
   offender and the severity of the harm he caused are the two primary
   predictors of punishment decisions, the precise cognitive and brain
   mechanisms by which these distinct components are evaluated and
   integrated into a punishment decision are poorly understood. Using fMRI,
   here we implement a novel experimental design to functionally dissociate
   the mechanisms underlying evaluation, integration, and decision that
   were conflated in previous studies of third-party punishment.
   Behaviorally, the punishment decision is primarily defined by a
   superadditive interaction between harm and mental state, with subjects
   weighing the interaction factor more than the single factors of harm and
   mental state. On a neural level, evaluation of harms engaged brain areas
   associated with affective and somatosensory processing, whereas mental
   state evaluation primarily recruited circuitry involved in
   mentalization. Harm and mental state evaluations are integrated in
   medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate structures, with the amygdala
   acting as a pivotal hub of the interaction between harm and mental
   state. This integrated information is used by the right dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex at the time of the decision to assign an appropriate
   punishment through a distributed coding system. Together, these findings
   provide a blueprint of the brain mechanisms by which neutral third
   parties render punishment decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Mutations in a synaptic organizing pathway contribute to autism.
   Autism-associated mutations in MDGA2 (MAM domain containing
   glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor 2) are thought to reduce
   excitatory/inhibitory transmission. However, we show that mutation of
   Mdga2 elevates excitatory transmission, and that MDGA2 blocks
   neuroligin-1 interaction with neurexins and suppresses excitatory
   synapse development. Mdga2(+/-) mice, modeling autism mutations,
   demonstrated increased asymmetric synapse density, mEPSC frequency and
   amplitude, and altered LTP, with no change in measures of inhibitory
   synapses. Behavioral assays revealed an autism-like phenotype including
   stereotypy, aberrant social interactions, and impaired memory. In vivo
   voltage-sensitive dye imaging, facilitating comparison with fMRI studies
   in autism, revealed widespread increases in cortical spontaneous
   activity and intracortical functional connectivity. These results
   suggest that mutations in MDGA2 contribute to altered cortical
   processing through the dual disadvantages of elevated excitation and
   hyperconnectivity, and indicate that perturbations of the NRXN-NLGN
   pathway in either direction from the norm increase risk for autism.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has demonstrated that affective states elicited by
   viewing pictures varying in valence and arousal are identifiable from
   whole brain activation patterns observed with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Identification of affective states from more
   naturalistic stimuli has clinical relevance, but the feasibility of
   identifying these states on an individual trial basis from fMRI data
   elicited by dynamic multimodal stimuli is unclear. The goal of this
   study was to determine whether affective states can be similarly
   identified when participants view dynamic naturalistic audiovisual
   stimuli. Eleven participants viewed 5s audiovisual clips in a passive
   viewing task in the scanner. Valence and arousal for individual trials
   were identified both within and across participants based on distributed
   patterns of activity in areas selectively responsive to audiovisual
   naturalistic stimuli while controlling for lower level features of the
   stimuli. In addition, the brain regions identified by searchlight
   analyses to represent valence and arousal were consistent with
   previously identified regions associated with emotion processing. These
   findings extend previous results on the distributed representation of
   affect to multimodal dynamic stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of anthropological fieldwork in a US pediatric neuroscience
   laboratory, this article traces the recent move from studies of
   individual diagnostic pathologies like ADHD, Tourette or autism spectrum
   disorder to the rapid creation of innovative interdisciplinary research
   coalitions and collaborations that both produce and utilize big data
   techniques in order to map the human connectome. By analogy with the
   human genome, connectome studies require new ways to imagine and image
   complex and multivalent neuro-circuits in which brain scans of those
   with and without diagnoses provide data points, open to recombination
   with other forms of data. Emergent expert understandings of the
   connectome are only minimally related to what families who enroll their
   diagnosed children in fMRI studies understand. Likewise, young adult
   self-advocates with the same diagnoses on which the neuroscientists are
   now working use `brain talk' to stake their own ethical claims. I argue
   that this epistemological gap among medico-scientific, familial and
   advocacy visions of human brains provides a mobile space of creativity
   as well as misunderstanding.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. This article review studies social and interpersonal functioning in
   patients with bipolar disorder (BD), and reports on the neurobiological
   underpinnings of the dysfunctions in emotion recognition, i.e. one of
   the main domains of social cognition. Methods. A bibliographical
   research of controlled studies from 1967 to 2015 was completed in PubMed
   and PsycINFO using the keywords: ``fMRI{''}, ``emotion
   comprehension{''}, ``emotion perception{''}, ``affect comprehension{''},
   ``affect perception{''}, ``facial expression{''}, ``prosody{''},
   ``theory of mind{''}, ``mentalizing{''}, ``attributional style{''},
   ``social perception{''}, ``empathy{''} and ``bipolar disorder{''} or
   ``unipolar depression{''}. Results. Limbic hyperactivity, with a lack of
   appropriate cortical control, has been reported in subjects with BD
   during social interactions. This is particularly evident during the
   acute affective episodes but may persist during the euthymic phases.
   Discussion. Deficits in emotion regulation, including neural systems
   implicated both in voluntary and automatic emotion regulatory
   subprocesses, are present in DB, particularly for what pertains to
   social interactions and interpersonal functioning. Conclusions. Patients
   with bipolar disorder may present a dysfunction in the cortical ability
   to modulate the limbic system, which may show hyperactivity during
   social interactions. More studies are needed, including studies to
   evaluate treatment implications.}},

Title = {{CBT reduces CBF: cognitive-behavioral therapy reduces cerebral blood
   flow in fear-relevant brain regions in spider phobia}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Imaging studies have provided evidence that
   cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is able to change brain activation in
   phobic patients in response to threatening stimuli. The changes occurred
   in both emotion-generating and modulatory regions. In this study, we use
   a data-driven approach to explore resting state cerebral blood flow
   (CBF) measured by arterial spin labeling (ASL), before and after CBT.
   Methods: Eight female patients with spider phobia were scanned before
   and 1 month after an exposure-based group therapy for spider phobia.
   Each MRI session consisted of an ASL resting state measurement acquired
   before and after a symptom provocation task involving the showing of
   spider pictures in the scanner. The first ASL acquisition measured
   anticipatory anxiety and the second measured postprocessing of
   phobia-relevant stimuli. Results: Cognitive-behavioral therapy
   significantly reduced spider phobic symptoms in all patients. Symptom
   reduction during anticipatory anxiety was accompanied by reduced
   bilateral CBF in the parahippocampal gyrus, ventral anterior thalamus,
   Brodmann area 8, and the anterior cingulate cortex. During
   postprocessing of phobia-relevant stimuli, patients showed reduced CBF
   in the bilateral insula, components of the motor cortex, and areas
   associated with language functions. Conclusions: Longitudinal CBF
   dynamics following CBT were in concordance with results from several
   studies using BOLD fMRI to investigate the effects of psychotherapy on
   brain activity. CBF can be quantified by ASL, with the principal
   advantage of sensitivity to slow variations in neural activity and task
   independence. Therefore, ASL may be a suitable method for monitoring and
   evaluating the efficacy of psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Impairments of social cognition are well documented in patients with
   schizophrenia (SCZ), but the neural basis remains poorly understood. In
   light of evidence that suggests that the ``mirror neuron system{''}
   (MNS) and the ``mentalizing network{''} (MENT) are key substrates of
   intersubjectivity and joint action, it has been suggested that
   dysfunction of these neural networks may underlie social difficulties in
   SCZ patients. Additionally, MNS and MENT might be associated differently
   with positive vs negative symptoms, given prior social cognitive and
   symptom associations. We assessed resting state functional connectivity
   (RSFC) in meta-analytically defined MNS and MENT networks in this
   patient group. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained from
   116 patients and 133 age-, gender- and movement-matched healthy controls
   (HC) at 5 different MRI sites. Network connectivity was analyzed for
   group differences and correlations with clinical symptoms. Results
   demonstrated decreased connectivity within the MNS and also the MENT in
   patients compared to controls. Notably, dysconnectivity of the MNS was
   related to symptom severity, while no such relationship was observed for
   the MENT. In sum, these findings demonstrate that differential patterns
   of dysconnectivity exist in SCZ patients, which may contribute
   differently to the interpersonal difficulties commonly observed in the
   disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Although children's social development is embedded in social
   interaction, most developmental neuroscience studies have examined
   responses to non-interactive social stimuli (e.g. photographs of faces).
   The neural mechanisms of real-world social behavior are of special
   interest during middle childhood (roughly ages 7-13), a time of
   increased social complexity and competence coinciding with structural
   and functional social brain development. Evidence from adult
   neuroscience studies suggests that social interaction may alter neural
   processing, but no neuroimaging studies in children have directly
   examined the effects of live social-interactive context on social
   cognition. In the current study of middle childhood, we compare the
   processing of two types of speech: speech that children believed was
   presented over a real-time audio-feed by a social partner and speech
   that they believed was recorded. Although in reality all speech was
   prerecorded, perceived live speech resulted in significantly greater
   neural activation in regions associated with social cognitive
   processing. These findings underscore the importance of using
   ecologically-valid and interactive methods to understand the developing
   social brain.}},

Abstract = {{Flexibility of associative learning can be revealed by establishing and
   then reversing cue-outcome discriminations. Here, we used functional MRI
   to examine whether neurobehavioral correlates of reversal-learning are
   impaired in White and Asian volunteers when initial learning involves
   fear-conditioning to a racial out-group. For one group, the picture of a
   Black male was initially paired with shock (threat) and a White male was
   unpaired (safe). For another group, the White male was a threat and the
   Black male was safe. These associations reversed midway through the
   task. Both groups initially discriminated threat from safety, as
   expressed through skin conductance responses (SCR) and activity in the
   insula, thalamus, midbrain and striatum. After reversal, the group
   initially conditioned to a Black male exhibited impaired reversal of
   SCRs to the new threat stimulus (White male), and impaired reversals in
   the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, midbrain and thalamus. In
   contrast, the group initially conditioned to a White male showed
   successful reversal of SCRs and successful reversal in these brain
   regions toward the new threat. These findings provide new evidence that
   an aversive experience with a racial out-group member impairs the
   ability to flexibly and appropriately adjust fear expression towards a

Abstract = {{Inhibitory control (IC) is a critical neurocognitive skill for
   successfully navigating challenges across domains. Several studies have
   attempted to use training to improve neurocognitive skills such as IC,
   but few have found that training generalizes to performance on
   non-trained tasks. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   to investigate the effect of IC training on a related but untrained
   emotion regulation (ER) task with the goal of clarifying how training
   alters brain function and why its effects typically do not transfer
   across tasks. We suggest hypotheses for training-related changes in
   activation relevant to transfer effects: the strength model and several
   plausible alternatives (shifting priorities, stimulus-response
   automaticity, scaffolding). Sixty participants completed three weeks of
   IC training and underwent fMRI scanning before and after. The training
   produced pre- to post-training changes in neural activation during the

Abstract = {{Although the processes that underlie sharing others' emotions (empathy)
   and understanding others' mental states (mentalizing, Theory of Mind)
   have received increasing attention, it is yet unclear how they relate to
   each other. For instance, are people who strongly empathize with others
   also more proficient in mentalizing? And (how) do the neural networks
   supporting empathy and mentalizing interact? Assessing both functions
   simultaneously in a large sample (N = 178), we show that people's
   capacities to empathize and mentalize are independent, both on a
   behavioral and neural level. Thus, strong empathizers are not
   necessarily proficient mentalizers, arguing against a general capacity
   of social understanding. Second, we applied dynamic causal modeling to
   investigate how the neural networks underlying empathy and mentalizing
   are orchestrated in naturalistic social settings. Results reveal that in
   highly emotional situations, empathic sharing can inhibit
   mentalizing-related activity and thereby harm mentalizing performance.
   Taken together, our findings speak against a unitary construct of social
   understanding and suggest flexible interplay of distinct social
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical observations and similarities to addiction suggest heightened
   reward sensitivity to food in patients with bulimic-type eating (BTE)

   food reward compared with monetary reward in patients with BTE.
   Fifty-six patients with BTE (27 patients with binge eating disorder and
   29 with bulimia nervosa) and 55 matched healthy control participants
   underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while
   performing both food and monetary incentive delay tasks. BTE patients
   exhibited reduced brain activation in the posterior cingulate cortex
   during the expectation of food and increased activity in the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex, anterior medial prefrontal cortex and posterior
   cingulate cortex during the receipt of food reward. These findings were
   relevant to food because we found no significant group differences
   related to monetary reward. In the patients, higher brain activity in
   the medial orbitofrontal cortex during the receipt of food reward was
   related to higher levels of trait food craving and external eating. BTE
   patients exhibited increased hedonic processing during the receipt of
   food reward. These findings corroborate the notion that an altered
   responsiveness of the reward network to food stimuli is associated with
   BTE.}},

Abstract = {{Human communication relies on the ability to process linguistic
   structure and to map words and utterances onto our environment.
   Furthermore, as what we communicate is often not directly encoded in our
   language (e.g. in the case of irony, jokes or indirect requests), we
   need to extract additional cues to infer the beliefs and desires of our
   conversational partners. Although the functional interplay between
   language and the ability to mentalise has been discussed in theoretical
   accounts in the past, the neurobiological underpinnings of these
   dynamics are currently not well understood. Here, we address this issue
   using functional imaging (fMRI). Participants listened to question-reply
   dialogues. In these dialogues, a reply is interpreted as a direct reply,
   an indirect reply or a request for action, depending on the question. We
   show that inferring meaning from indirect replies engages parts of the
   mentalising network (mPFC) while requests for action also activate the
   cortical motor system (IPL). Subsequent connectivity analysis using
   Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) revealed that this pattern of activation
   is best explained by an increase in effective connectivity from the
   mentalising network (mPFC) to the action system (IPL). These results are
   an important step towards a more integrative understanding of the
   neurobiological basis of indirect speech processing.}},

Abstract = {{Return of fear is a serious problem in exposure-based treatments of
   anxiety disorders. Renewal of the fear response may occur when
   re-encountering the conditioned stimulus within a novel context.
   Findings in rodents underpin the hippocampus' role in conditioned fear
   renewal in novel contexts, but it has yet to be investigated in humans.
   Forty-six healthy men took part in a 2-day, context-dependent, cued fear
   conditioning paradigm with fear acquisition, extinction learning (day 1)
   and extinction recall in the acquisition, extinction and a novel context
   one day later. Conditioned evaluative, skin conductance responses (SCRs)
   and blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses served as dependent
   variables. Context-dependent fear renewal was reflected in stronger
   conditioned SCRs. In the acquisition context, individuals with a higher
   renewal of conditioned SCRs showed stronger activation of the fear
   circuit. Hippocampal activation distinguished conditioned responding in
   the novel compared with the extinction context. Individuals with a
   stronger renewal of conditioned SCRs in the novel context showed
   increased effective connectivity of hippocampal activation foci with
   structures in the fear and extinction network. These results outline the
   pivotal role of the hippocampus and its connectivity in conditioned fear
   renewal in a novel context in humans and might have important

Abstract = {{Facial threat is associated with changes in limbic activity as well as
   modifications in the cortical face-related N170. It remains unclear if
   task-irrelevant threat modulates the response to a subsequent facial
   stimulus, and whether the amygdala's role in early threat perception is
   independent and direct, or modulatory. In 19 participants, crowds of
   emotional faces were followed by target faces and a rating task while
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI were recorded. In addition to conventional
   analyses, fMRI-informed EEG analyses and fMRI dynamic causal modeling
   (DCM) were performed. Fearful crowds reduced EEG N170 target face
   amplitudes and increased responses in a fMRI network comprising insula,
   amygdala and inferior frontal cortex. Multimodal analyses showed that
   amygdala response was present similar to 60 ms before the right fusiform
   gyrus-derived N170. DCM indicated inhibitory connections from amygdala
   to fusiform gyrus, strengthened when fearful crowds preceded a target
   face. Results demonstrated the suppressing influence of task-irrelevant
   fearful crowds on subsequent face processing. The amygdala may be
   sensitive to task-irrelevant fearful crowds and subsequently strengthen
   its inhibitory influence on face-responsive fusiform N170 generators.
   This provides spatiotemporal evidence for a feedback mechanism of the
   amygdala by narrowing attention in order to focus on potential threats.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of evidence in animals and humans implicates the amygdala
   in promoting memory for arousing experiences. Although the amygdala can
   trigger threat-related noradrenergic-sympathetic arousal, in humans
   amygdala activation and noradrenergic-sympathetic arousal do not always
   concur. This raises the question how these two processes play a role in
   enhancing emotional declarative memory. This study was designed to
   disentangle these processes in a combined
   subsequent-memory/fear-conditioning paradigm with neutral items
   belonging to two conceptual categories as conditioned stimuli.
   Functional MRI, skin conductance (index of sympathetic activity), and
   pupil dilation (indirect index of central noradrenergic activity) were
   acquired throughout procedures. Recognition memory for individual items
   was tested 24 h later. We found that pupil dilation and skin conductance
   responses were higher on CS+ (associated with a shock) compared with CS-
   trials, irrespective of later memory for those items. By contrast,
   amygdala activity was only higher for CS+ items that were later
   confidently remembered compared with CS+ items that were later
   forgotten. Thus, amygdala activity and not noradrenergic-sympathetic
   arousal, predicted enhanced declarative item memory. This dissociation
   is in line with animal models stating that the amygdala integrates
   arousal-related neuromodulatory changes to alter mnemonic processes
   elsewhere in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging work has identified a network of regions that work
   in concert to update impressions of other people, particularly in
   response to inconsistent behavior. However, the specific functional
   contributions of these regions to the updating process remain unclear.
   Using fMRI, we tested whether increases in activity triggered by
   inconsistent behavior reflect changes in the stored representations of
   other people in response to behavioral inconsistency, or merely a
   response to the inconsistency itself. Participants encountered a series
   of individuals whose behavior either changed in an attributionally
   meaningful fashion or was merely inconsistent with the immediately
   preceding behavior. We observed that left ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex (vlPFC) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were preferentially
   recruited in response to unexpected, immoral behavior, whereas a
   separate set of regions (including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex,
   posterior cingulate cortex and temporoparietal junction/inferior
   parietal lobule) was preferentially recruited in response to more
   mundane inconsistencies in behavior. These results shed light on the
   distributed systems supporting impression updating. Specifically, while
   many regions supporting updating may primarily respond to
   moment-to-moment changes in behavior, a subset of regions (e.g. vlPFC
   and IFG) may contribute to updating person representations in response
   to trait-relevant changes in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The Emotional enhancement of memory (EEM) is observed in immediate
   free-recall memory tests when emotional and neutral stimuli are encoded
   and tested together ({''}mixed lists{''}), but surprisingly, not when
   they are encoded and tested separately ({''}pure lists{''}). Here our
   aim was to investigate whether the effect of list-composition (mixed
   versus pure lists) on the EEM is due to differential allocation of
   attention. We scanned participants with fMRI during encoding of
   semantically-related emotional (negative valence only) and neutral
   pictures. Analysis of memory performance data replicated previous work,
   demonstrating an interaction between list composition and emotional
   valence. In mixed lists, neural subsequent memory effects in the dorsal
   attention network were greater for neutral stimulus encoding, while
   neural subsequent memory effects for emotional stimuli were found in a
   region associated with the ventral attention network. These results
   imply that when life experiences include both emotional and neutral
   elements, memory for the latter is more highly correlated with neural
   activity representing goal-directed attention processing at encoding.

Abstract = {{Glutathione, a natural substance, acts on calcium receptors on the
   tongue and is known to enhance basic taste sensations. However, the
   effects of glutathione on brain activity associated with taste sensation
   on the tongue have not been determined under standardized taste delivery
   conditions. In this study, we investigated the sensory effect of
   glutathione on taste with no effect of the smell when glutathione added
   to a combined umami and salty taste stimulus. Twenty-six volunteers (12
   women and 14 men; age 19-27 years) performed a sensory evaluation of
   taste of a solution of monosodium L-glutamate and sodium chloride, with
   and without glutathione. The addition of glutathione changed taste
   qualities and significantly increased taste intensity ratings under
   standardized taste delivery conditions (P < 0.001). Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging showed that glutathione itself elicited significant
   activation in the left ventral insula. These results are the first to
   demonstrate the enhancing effect of glutathione as reflected by brain
   data while tasting an umami and salty mixture.}},

Title = {{Exposure to Blue Light Increases Subsequent Functional Activation of the
   Prefrontal Cortex During Performance of a Working Memory Task}},
Journal = {{SLEEP}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1671-1680}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Study Objectives: Prolonged exposure to blue wavelength light has been
   shown to have an alerting effect, and enhances performance on cognitive
   tasks. A small number of studies have also shown that relatively short
   exposure to blue light leads to changes in functional brain responses
   during the period of exposure. The extent to which blue light continues
   to affect brain functioning during a cognitively challenging task after
   cessation of longer periods of exposure (i.e., roughly 30 minutes or
   longer), however, has not been fully investigated.
   Methods: A total of 35 healthy participants (18 female) were exposed to
   either blue (469 nm) (n = 17) or amber (578 nm) (n = 18) wavelength
   light for 30 minutes in a darkened room, followed immediately by
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while undergoing a working
   memory task (N-back task).
   Results: Participants in the blue light condition were faster in their
   responses on the N-back task and showed increased activation in the
   dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral (VLPFC) prefrontal cortex
   compared to those in the amber control light condition. Furthermore,
   greater activation within the VLPFC was correlated with faster N-back
   response times.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to suggest that a relatively brief,
   single exposure to blue light has a subsequent beneficial effect on
   working memory performance, even after cessation of exposure, and leads
   to temporarily persisting functional brain changes within prefrontal
   brain regions associated with executive functions. These findings may
   have broader implication for using blue-enriched light in a variety of
   work settings where alertness and quick decision-making are important.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{407-418}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we contribute to ``sociology in bioethics{''} and help
   clarify the range of ways sociological work can contribute to ethics
   scholarship. We do this using a case study of an innovative
   neurotechnology, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and its use to
   attempt to diagnose and communicate with severely brain-injured
   patients. We compare empirical data from interviews with relatives of
   patients who have a severe brain injury with perspectives from
   mainstream bioethics scholars. We use the notion of an ``ethical
   landscape{''} as an analogy for the different ethical positions subjects
   can take-whereby a person's position relative to the landscape makes a
   difference to the way they experience and interact with it. We show
   that, in comparison to studying abstract ethics ``from above{''} the
   ethical landscape, which involves universal generalizations and global
   judgements, studying ethics empirically ``from the ground,{''} within
   the ethical landscape foregrounds a more plural and differentiated
   picture. We argue it is important not to treat empirical ethics as
   secondary to abstract ethics, to treat on-the-ground perspectives as
   useful only insofar as they can inform ethics from above. Rather,
   empirical perspectives can illuminate the plural vantage points in
   ethical judgments, highlight the ``lived{''} nature of ethical
   reasoning, and point to all ethical vantage points as being significant.
   This is of epistemic importance to normative ethics, since researchers
   who pay attention to the various positions in and trajectories through
   the ethical landscape are unlikely to think about ethics in terms of
   abstract agency-as can happen with top-down ethics-or to elide agency
   with the agency of policymakers. Moreover, empirical perspectives may
   have transformative implications for people on the ground, especially
   where focus on the potential harms and benefits they face brings their
   experiences and interests to the forefront of ethical and policy
   discussion.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive
   behavioural therapy (CBT) are often used concomitantly to treat social
   anxiety disorder (SAD), but few studies have examined the effect of this
   combination.
   Aims
   To evaluate whether adding escitalopram to internet-delivered CBT (ICBT)
   improves clinical outcome and alters brain reactivity and connectivity
   in SAD.
   Method
   Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled neuroimaging trial of ICBT
   combined either with escitalopram (n=24) or placebo (n=24), including a
   15-month clinical follow-up (trial registration: ISRCTN24929928).
   Results
   Escitalopram+ICBT, relative to placebo+ICBT, resulted in significantly
   more clinical responders, larger reductions in anticipatory speech state
   anxiety at post-treatment and larger reductions in social anxiety
   symptom severity at 15-month follow-up and at a trend-level = 0.09) at
   post-treatment. Right amygdala reactivity to emotional faces also
   decreased more in the escitalopram+ICBT combination relative to
   placebo+ICBT, and in treatment responders relative to non-responders.
   Conclusions
   Adding escitalopram improves the outcome of ICBT for SAD and decreased
   amygdala reactivity is important for anxiolytic treatment response.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) typically presents
   with left hemisphere predominant rostral temporal lobe (rTL) atrophy and
   the most significant complaints within the language domain. Less
   frequently, patients present with right hemisphere predominant temporal
   atrophy coupled with marked impairments in processing of famous faces
   and emotions. Few studies have objectively compared these patient groups
   in both domains and therefore it is unclear to what extent the syndromes
   overlap. Clinically diagnosed svPPA patients were characterized as left-
   (n = 21) or right predominant (n = 12) using imaging and compared along
   with 14 healthy controls. Regarding language, our primary focus was upon
   two hallmark features of svPPA; confrontation naming and surface
   dyslexia. Both groups exhibited naming deficits and surface dyslexia
   although the impairments were more severe in the left-predominant group.
   Familiarity judgments on famous faces and affect processing were more
   profoundly impaired in the right-predominant group. Our findings suggest
   that the two syndromes overlap significantly but that early cases at the
   tail ends of the continuum constitute a challenge for current clinical
   criteria. Correlational neuroimaging analyses implicated a mid portion
   of the left lateral temporal lobe in exception word reading impairments
   in line with proposals that this region is an interface between
   phonology and semantic knowledge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{There is evidence that besides limbic brain structures, prefrontal and
   insular cortical activations and deactivations are involved in the
   pathophysiology of panic disorder. This study investigated activation
   response patterns to stimulation with individually selected
   panic-specific pictures in patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia
   (PDA) and healthy control subjects using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). Structures of interest were the prefrontal, cingulate,
   and insular cortex, and the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. Nineteen PDA
   subjects (10 females, 9 males) and 21 healthy matched controls were
   investigated using a Siemens 3-Tesla scanner. First, PDA subjects gave
   Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) ratings on 120 pictures showing
   characteristic panic/agoraphobia situations, of which 20 pictures with
   the individually highest SAM ratings were selected. Twenty matched
   pictures showing aversive but not panic-specific stimuli and 80 neutral
   pictures from the International Affective Picture System were chosen for
   each subject as controls. Each picture was shown twice in each of four
   subsequent blocks. Anxiety and depression ratings were recorded before
   and after the experiment. Group comparisons revealed a significantly
   greater activation in PDA patients than control subjects in the insular
   cortices, left inferior frontal gyrus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex,
   the left hippocampal formation, and left caudatum, when PA and N
   responses were compared. Comparisons for stimulation with unspecific
   aversive pictures showed activation of similar brain regions in both
   groups. Results indicate region-specific activations to panic-specific
   picture stimulation in PDA patients. They also imply dysfunctionality in
   the processing of interoceptive cues in PDA and the regulation of
   negative emotionality. Therefore, differences in the functional networks
   between PDA patients and control subjects should be further
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Cue reactivity to natural and social rewards is essential for
   motivational behavior. However, cue reactivity to drug rewards can also
   elicit craving in addicted subjects. The degree to which drug and
   natural rewards share neural substrates is not known. The objective of
   this study is to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of neuroimaging
   studies on drug, gambling and natural stimuli (food and sex) to identify
   the common and distinct neural substrates of cue reactivity to drug and
   natural rewards. Neural cue reactivity studies were selected for the
   meta-analysis by means of activation likelihood estimations, followed by
   sensitivity and clustering analyses of averaged neuronal response
   patterns. Data from 176 studies (5573 individuals) suggests largely
   overlapping neural response patterns towards all tested reward
   modalities. Common cue reactivity to natural and drug rewards was
   expressed by bilateral neural responses within anterior cingulate gyrus,
   insula, caudate head, inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and
   cerebellum. However, drug cues also generated distinct activation
   patterns in medial frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, posterior
   cingulate gyrus, caudate body and putamen. Natural (sexual) reward cues
   induced unique activation of the pulvinar in thalamus. Neural substrates
   of cue reactivity to alcohol, drugs of abuse, food, sex and gambling are
   largely overlapping and comprise a network that processes reward,
   emotional responses and habit formation. This suggests that cue-mediated
   craving involves mechanisms that are not exclusive for addictive
   disorders but rather resemble the intersection of information pathways
   for processing reward, emotional responses, non-declarative memory and
   obsessive-compulsive behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All

Abstract = {{When humans perform two tasks simultaneously, responses to the second
   task are increasingly delayed as the interval between the two tasks
   decreases (psychological refractory period). This delay of the second
   task is thought to reflect a central processing limitation at the
   response selection stage. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this
   central processing limitation remain unclear. Using transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (TMS), we examined the role of the dorsal medial
   frontal cortex (dMFC) in a dual-task paradigm in which participants
   performed an auditory task 1 and a visual task 2. We found that dMFC
   TMS, relative to control conditions, reduced the psychological
   refractory period for task 2 processing, whereas we observed no dMFC TMS
   effects on task 1 processing. This suggests a causal role of the dMFC in
   coordinating response selection processes at the central bottleneck.}},

Abstract = {{The insula is a region that integrates interoception and drug urges, but
   little is known about its role in behavioral addiction such as internet
   addiction. We investigated insula-based functional connectivity in
   participants with internet gaming disorder (IGD) and healthy controls
   (HC) using resting-state functional MRI. The right and left insula
   subregions (posterior, ventroanterior, and dorsoanterior) were used as
   seed regions in a connectivity analysis. Compared with the HC group, the
   IGD group showed decreased functional connectivity between left
   posterior insula and bilateral supplementary motor area and middle
   cingulated cortex, between right posterior insula and right superior
   frontal gyrus, and decreased functional integration between insular
   subregions. The finding of reduced functional connectivity between the
   interoception and the motor/executive control regions is interpreted to
   reflect reduced ability to inhibit motor responses to internet gaming or
   diminished executive control over craving for internet gaming in IGD.
   The results support the hypothesis that IGD is associated with altered
   insula-based network, similar to substance addiction such as smoking.}},

Abstract = {{Self-referential processing is a complex cognitive function, involving a
   set of implicit and explicit processes, complicating investigation of
   its distinct neural signature. The present study explores the functional
   overlap and dissociability of self-referential and social stimulus
   processing. We combined an established paradigm for explicit
   self-referential processing with an implicit social stimulus processing
   paradigm in one fMRI experiment to determine the neural effects of
   self-relatedness and social processing within one study. Overlapping
   activations were found in the orbitofrontal cortex and in the
   intermediate part of the precuneus. Stimuli judged as self-referential
   specifically activated the posterior cingulate cortex, the ventral
   medial prefrontal cortex, extending into anterior cingulate cortex and
   orbitofrontal cortex, the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral
   and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the left inferior temporal gyrus,
   and occipital cortex. Social processing specifically involved the
   posterior precuneus and bilateral temporo-parietal junction. Taken
   together, our data show, not only, first, common networks for both
   processes in the medial prefrontal and the medial parietal cortex, but
   also, second, functional differentiations for self-referential
   processing versus social processing: an anterior-posterior gradient for
   social processing and self-referential processing within the medial
   parietal cortex and specific activations for self-referential processing
   in the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex and for social processing in
   the temporo-parietal junction.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite social cognitive dysfunction that may be observed in
   patients with schizophrenia, the knowledge about social and nonsocial
   affective processing in schizophrenia is scant. The aim of this study
   was to examine neurophysiological and behavioural responses to neutral
   and negative stimuli with (faces, people) and without (animals, objects)
   social content in schizophrenia.
   Methods: Twenty-six patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 21 healthy
   controls (HC) completed a visual oddball paradigm with either negative
   or neutral pictures from the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS) as
   targets while EEG was recorded. Half of the stimuli within each category
   presented social content (faces, people).
   Results: Negative stimuli with social content produced lower N2
   amplitude and higher mean LPP than any other type of stimuli in both
   groups. Despite differences in behavioural ratings and alterations in
   ERP processing of affective stimuli (lack of EPN differentiation,
   decreased P3 to neutral stimuli) SCZ were still able to respond to
   specific categories of stimuli similarly to HC.
   Conclusions: The pattem of results suggests that with no additional
   emotion-related task demands patients with schizophrenia may present
   similar attentional engagement with negative social stimuli as healthy
   controls. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background Late-life depression (LLD) in the elderly was reported to
   present with emotion dysregulation accompanied by high perceived
   loneliness. Previous research has suggested that LLD is a disorder of
   connectivity and is associated with aberrant network properties. On the
   other hand, perceived loneliness is found to adversely affect the brain,
   but little is known about its neurobiological basis in LLD. The current
   study investigated the relationships between the structural
   connectivity, functional connectivity during affective processing, and
   perceived loneliness in LLD.
   Method The current study included 54 participants aged >60 years of whom
   31 were diagnosed with LLD. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data and
   task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of an
   affective processing task were collected. Network-based statistics and
   graph theory techniques were applied, and the participants' perceived
   loneliness and depression level were measured. The affective processing
   task included viewing affective stimuli.
   Results Structurally, a loneliness-related sub-network was identified
   across all subjects. Functionally, perceived loneliness was related to
   connectivity differently in LLD than that in controls when they were
   processing negative stimuli, with aberrant networking in subcortical
   area.
   Conclusions Perceived loneliness was identified to have a unique role in
   relation to the negative affective processing in LLD at the functional
   brain connectional and network levels. The findings increas our
   understanding of LLD and provide initial evidence of the neurobiological
   mechanisms of loneliness in LLD. Loneliness might be a potential
   intervention target in depressive patients.}},

Abstract = {{An important feature of adaptive social behavior is the ability to
   flexibly modify future actions based on the successes or failures of
   past experiences. The ventral striatum (VS) occupies a central role in
   shaping behavior by using feedback to evaluate actions and guide
   learning. The current studies tested whether feedback indicating the
   need to update social knowledge would engage the VS, thereby
   facilitating subsequent learning. We also examined the sensitivity of
   these striatal signals to the value associated with social group
   membership. Across two fMRI studies, participants answered questions
   testing their knowledge about the preferences of personally relevant
   social groups who were high (in-group) or low (out-group) in social
   value. Participants received feedback indicating whether their responses
   were correct or incorrect on a trial-by-trial basis. After scanning,
   participants were given a surprise memory test examining memory for the
   different types of feedback. VS activity in response to social feedback
   correlated with subsequent memory, specifying a role for the VS in
   encoding and updating social knowledge. This effect was more robust in
   response to in-group than out-group feedback, indicating that the VS
   tracks variations in social value. These results provide novel evidence
   of a neurobiological mechanism adaptively tuned to the motivational
   relevance of the surrounding social environment that focuses learning
   efforts on the most valuable social outcomes and triggers adjustments in
   behavior when necessary.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Neuroscientific studies of social cognition typically employ paradigms
   in which perceivers draw single-shot inferences about the internal
   states of strangers. Real-world social inference features much different
   parameters: People often encounter and learn about particular social
   targets (e.g., friends) over time and receive feedback about whether
   their inferences are correct or incorrect. Here, we examined this
   process and, more broadly, the intersection between social cognition and
   reinforcement learning. Perceivers were scanned using fMRI while
   repeatedly encountering three social targets who produced conflicting
   visual and verbal emotional cues. Perceivers guessed how targets felt
   and received feedback about whether they had guessed correctly. Visual
   cues reliably predicted one target's emotion, verbal cues predicted a
   second target's emotion, and neither reliably predicted the third
   target's emotion. Perceivers successfully used this information to
   update their judgments over time. Furthermore, trial-by-trial learning
   signalsestimated using two reinforcement learning modelstracked activity
   in ventral striatum and ventromedial pFC, structures associated with
   reinforcement learning, and regions associated with updating social
   impressions, including TPJ. These data suggest that learning about
   others' emotions, like other forms of feedback learning, relies on
   domain-general reinforcement mechanisms as well as domain-specific
   social information processing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Anxiety disorders are prevalent and cause substantial
   disability. An important risk factor for anxiety disorders is inhibited
   temperament, the tendency to be shy and to avoid new situations.
   Inhibited adults have heightened amygdala activation and less flexible
   engagement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, it remains unknown
   whether these brain alterations are present in inhibited children before
   the onset of anxiety disorders.
   Method: A total of 37 children (18 inhibited and 19 uninhibited), 8 to
   10 years of age, completed a task testing anticipation and viewing of
   threat stimuli and social stimuli in the magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) scanner. Brain activation and functional connectivity were
   measured.
   Results: During the anticipation of threat stimuli, inhibited children
   failed to show the robust PFC engagement observed in the uninhibited
   children. In contrast, when viewing social stimuli, inhibited children
   had increased medial PFC and dorsolateral PFC activation. Connectivity
   analyses revealed a pattern of reduced connectivity between prefrontal
   and limbic regions and among distinct PFC regions in the inhibited
   group. The medial PFC emerged as a key hub of the altered PFC circuitry
   in inhibited children.
   Conclusion: This study provides new evidence of a neural signature of
   vulnerability to anxiety disorders. By investigating both anticipation
   and response to images, we identified that high-risk, inhibited children
   have widespread alterations in PFC function and connectivity,
   characterized by an inability to proactively prepare for social threat
   combined with heightened reactivity to social stimuli. Thus, children at
   high risk for anxiety show significantly altered prefrontal cortical
   function and connectivity before the onset of anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether
   functional connectivity of the amygdala is altered in preschool-age
   children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to assess the clinical
   relevance of observed alterations in amygdala connectivity.
   Method: A resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance
   imaging study of the amygdala (and a parallel study of primary visual
   cortex) was conducted in 72 boys (mean age 3.5 years; n = 43 with ASD; n
   = 29 age-matched controls).
   Results: The ASD group showed significantly weaker connectivity between
   the amygdala and several brain regions involved in social communication
   and repetitive behaviors, including bilateral medial prefrontal cortex,
   temporal lobes, and striatum (p < .05, corrected). Weaker connectivity
   between the amygdala and frontal and temporal lobes was significantly
   correlated with increased autism severity in the ASD group (p < .05). In
   a parallel analysis examining the functional connectivity of primary
   visual cortex, the ASD group showed significantly weaker connectivity
   between visual cortex and sensorimotor regions (p < .05, corrected).
   Weaker connectivity between visual cortex and sensorimotor regions was
   not correlated with core autism symptoms, but instead was correlated
   with increased sensory hypersensitivity in the visual/auditory domain (p
   < .05).
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that preschool-age children with ASD
   have disrupted functional connectivity between the amygdala and regions
   of the brain important for social communication and language, which
   might be clinically relevant because weaker connectivity was associated
   with increased autism severity. Moreover, although amygdala connectivity
   was associated with behavioral domains that are diagnostic of ASD,
   altered connectivity of primary visual cortex was related to sensory
   hypersensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to identify brain regions involved in motor
   imagery and differentiate two alternative strategies in its
   implementation: imagining a motor act using kinesthetic or visual
   imagery. Fourteen adults were precisely instructed and trained on how to
   imagine themselves or others perform a movement sequence, with the aim
   of promoting kinesthetic and visual imagery, respectively, in the
   context of an fMRI experiment using block design. We found that neither
   modality of motor imagery elicits activation of the primary motor cortex
   and that each of the two modalities involves activation of the premotor
   area which is also activated during action execution and action
   observation conditions, as well as of the supplementary motor area.
   Interestingly, the visual and the posterior cingulate cortices show
   reduced BOLD signal during both imagery conditions. Our results indicate
   that the networks of regions activated in kinesthetic and visual imagery
   of motor sequences show a substantial, while not complete overlap, and
   that the two forms of motor imagery lead to a differential suppression
   of visual areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is a multidimensional construct consisting of cognitive
   (inferring mental states) and emotional (empathic concern) components.
   Emotional empathy is severely impaired in individuals affected by
   Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Here, we investigated the neural
   correlates of such an emotional empathy dysfunction to shed light on the
   neural circuitry responsible for the social and emotional dysfunction in
   PTSD. We asked a group of PTSD and a group of healthy controls to solve
   a Multifaceted Empathy Test, measuring both cognitive and emotional
   empathy, and investigated the functional connectivity of the cortical
   areas involved in solving the test. The results revealed that, in
   healthy individuals, increased neural activity in the frontal cortex
   modulates activity in the insula while subjects perform the emotional
   empathy task; whereas, in individuals affected by PTSD, increased
   activity in limbic regions such the insula and the amygdala modulates
   activity in the frontal cortex while performing the emotional empathy
   task. These findings suggest that the lack of cortical top-down control
   of the frontal cortex on the limbic system in PTSD during empathic
   processing may explain the emotional and social difficulties experienced
   by individuals suffering from PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Nonhuman primate models are critical for understanding
   mechanisms underlying human psychopathology. We established a nonhuman
   primate model of anxious temperament (AT) for studying the early-life
   risk to develop anxiety and depression. Studies have identified the
   central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) as an essential component of AT's
   neural substrates. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is expressed in
   the Ce, has a role in stress, and is linked to psychopathology. Here, in
   young rhesus monkeys, we combined viral vector technology with
   assessments of anxiety and multimodal neuroimaging to understand the
   consequences of chronically increased CRF in the Ce region.
   METHODS: Using real-time intraoperative magnetic resonance
   imaging-guided convection-enhanced delivery, five monkeys received
   bilateral dorsal amygdala Ce-region infusions of adeno-associated virus
   serotype 2 containing the CRF construct. Their cagemates served as
   unoperated control subjects. AT, regional brain metabolism, resting
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging were
   assessed before and 2 months after viral infusions.
   RESULTS: Dorsal amygdala CRF overexpression significantly increased AT
   and metabolism within the dorsal amygdala. Additionally, we observed
   changes in metabolism in other AT-related regions, as well as in
   measures of functional and structural connectivity.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a translational roadmap that is
   important for understanding human psychopathology by combining molecular
   manipulations used in rodents with behavioral phenotyping and multimodal
   neuroimaging measures used in humans. The results indicate that chronic
   CRF overexpression in primates not only increases AT but also affects
   metabolism and connectivity within components of AT's neural circuitry.}},

   Genotype and Child Maltreatment on Brain Structure}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Oxytocin has received much attention as a prosocial and
   anxiolytic neuropeptide. In human studies, the G-allele of a common
   variant (rs53576) in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) has been
   associated with protective properties such as reduced stress response
   and higher receptiveness for social support. In contrast, recent studies
   suggest a detrimental role of the rs53576 G-allele in the context of
   childhood maltreatment. To further elucidate the role of OXTR, gene by
   maltreatment interactions on brain structure and function were
   investigated.
   METHODS: Three hundred nine healthy participants genotyped for OXTR
   rs53576 underwent structural as well as functional magnetic resonance
   imaging during a common emotional face-matching task. Childhood
   maltreatment was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).
   Gray matter volumes were investigated by means of voxel-based
   morphometry across the entire brain.
   RESULTS: Structural magnetic resonance imaging data revealed a strong
   interaction of rs53576 genotype and CTQ scores, mapping specifically to
   the bilateral ventral striatum. GG homozygotes but not A-allele carriers
   showed strong gray matter reduction with increasing CTQ scores. In turn,
   lower ventral striatum gray matter volumes were associated with lower
   reward dependence, a prosocial trait. Furthermore, the G-allele was
   associated with increased amygdala responsiveness to emotional facial
   expressions.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the G-allele constitutes a
   vulnerability factor for specific alterations of limbic brain structure
   in individuals with adverse childhood experiences, complemented by
   increased limbic responsiveness to emotional interpersonal stimuli.
   While oxytocinergic signaling facilitates attachment and bonding in
   supportive social environments, this attunement for social cues may turn
   disadvantageous under early adverse conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The ventral and dorsal striatum are critical substrates of reward
   processing and motivation and have been repeatedly linked to addictive
   disorders, including nicotine dependence. However, little is known about
   how functional connectivity between these and other brain regions is
   modulated by smoking withdrawal and may contribute to relapse
   vulnerability. In the present study, 37 smokers completed resting state
   fMRI scans during both satiated and 24-h abstinent conditions, prior to
   engaging in a 3-week quit attempt supported by contingency management We
   examined the effects of abstinence condition and smoking outcome (lapse
   vs non-lapse) on whole-brain connectivity with ventral and dorsal
   striatum seed regions. Results indicated a significant condition by
   lapse outcome interaction for both right and left ventral striatum
   seeds. Robust abstinence-induced increases in connectivity with
   bilateral ventral striatum were observed across a network of regions
   implicated in addictive disorders, including insula, supenor temporal
   gyros, and anterior/mid-cingulate cortex among non-lapsers; the opposite
   pattern was observed for those who later lapsed. For dorsal striatum
   seeds, 24-h abstinence decreased connectivity across both groups with
   several regions, including medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate
   cortex, hippocampus, and supplemental motor area These findings suggest
   that modulation of striatal connectivity with the cingulo-insular
   network during early withdrawal may be associated with smoking cessation
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The advancement of neuroscience depends on continued improvement
   inmethods andmodels. Here, we present novel techniques for the use of
   awake functionalmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the prairie vole
   (Microtus ochrogaster) - an important step forward in minimally-invasive
   measurement of neural activity in a nontraditional animal model. Imaging
   neural responses in prairie voles, a species studied for its propensity
   to form strong and selective social bonds, is expected to greatly
   advance ourmechanistic understanding of complex social and affective
   processes. The use of ultra-high-field fMRI allows for recording changes
   in region- specific activity throughout the entire brain simultaneously
   and with high temporal and spatial resolutions. By imaging neural
   responses in awake animals, with minimal invasiveness, we are able to
   avoid the confound of anesthesia, broaden the scope of possible stimuli,
   and potentially make use of repeated scans from the same animals. These
   methods are made possible by the development of an annotated and
   segmented 3D vole brain atlas and software for image analysis. The use
   of these methods in the prairie vole provides an opportunity to broaden
   neuroscientific investigation of behavior via a comparative approach,
   which highlights the ethological relevance of pro-social behaviors
   shared between voles and humans, such as communal breeding, selective
   social bonds, social buffering of stress, and caregiving behaviors.
   Results using these methods show that fMRI in the prairie vole is
   capable of yielding robust blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal
   changes in response to hypercapnic challenge (inhaled 5\% CO2),
   region-specific physical challenge (unilateral whisker stimulation), and
   presentation of a set of novel odors. Complementary analyses of repeated
   restraint sessions in the imaging hardware suggest that voles do not
   require acclimation to this procedure. Taken together, awake vole fMRI
   represents a new arena of neurobiological study outside the realm of
   traditional rodent models. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{274-283}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Emotions have been shown to exert influences on decision making during
   economic exchanges. Here we investigate the underlying neural mechanisms
   of a training regimen which is hypothesized to promote emotional
   awareness, specifically mindfulness training (MT). We test the
   hypothesis that MT increases cooperative economic decision making using
   fMRI in a randomized longitudinal design involving 8 weeks of either MT
   or active control training (CT). We find that MT results in an increased
   willingness to cooperate indexed by higher acceptance rates to unfair
   monetary offers in the Ultimatum Game. While controlling for acceptance
   rates of monetary offers between intervention groups, subjects in the MT
   and CT groups show differential brain activation patterns. Specifically,
   a subset of more cooperative MT subjects displays increased activation
   in the septal region, an area linked to social attachment, which may
   drive the increased willingness to express cooperative behavior in the
   MT cohort. Furthermore, MT resulted in attenuated activity in anterior
   insula compared with the CT group in response to unfair monetary offers
   post-training, which may suggest that MT enables greater ability to
   effectively regulate the anterior insula and thereby promotes social
   cooperation. Finally, functional connectivity analyses show a coupling
   between the septal region and posterior insula in the MT group,
   suggesting an integration of interoceptive inputs. Together, these
   results highlight that MT may be employed in contexts where emotional
   regulation is required to promote social cooperation. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although economic theories suggest that punishment threat is crucial for
   maintaining social norms, counterexamples are noted in which punishment
   threat hinders norm compliance. Such discrepancy may arise from the
   intention behind the threat: unintentionally introduced punishment
   threat facilitates, whereas intentionally introduced punishment threat
   hinders, norm compliance. Here, we combined a dictator game and fMRI to
   investigate how intention modulates the effect of punishment threat on
   norm compliance and the neural substrates of this modulation. We also
   investigated whether this modulation can be influenced by brain
   stimulation. Human participants divided an amount of money between
   themselves and a partner. The partner (intentionally) or a computer
   program (unintentionally) decided to retain or waive the right to punish
   the participant upon selfish distribution. Compared with the
   unintentional condition, participants allocated more when the partner
   intentionally waived the power of punishment, but less when the partner
   retained such power. The right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (rLOFC)
   showed higher activation when the partner waived compared with when the
   computer waived or when the partner retained the power. The functional
   connectivity between the rLOFC and the brain network associated with
   intention/mentalizing processing was predictive of the allocation
   difference induced by intention. Moreover, inhibition or activation of
   the rLOFC by brain stimulation decreased or increased, respectively, the
   participants' reliance on the partner's intention during monetary
   allocation. These findings demonstrate that the perceived intention of
   punishment threat plays a crucial role in norm compliance and that the
   LOFC is casually involved in the implementation of intention-based
   cooperative decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforcement learning theory powerfully characterizes how we learn to
   benefit ourselves. In this theory, prediction errors-the difference
   between a predicted and actual outcome of a choice-drive learning.
   However, we do not operate in a social vacuum. To behave prosocially we
   must learn the consequences of our actions for other people. Empathy,
   the ability to vicariously experience and understand the affect of
   others, is hypothesized to be a critical facilitator of prosocial
   behaviors, but the link between empathy and prosocial behavior is still
   unclear. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   participants chose between different stimuli that were probabilistically
   associated with rewards for themselves (self), another person
   (prosocial), or no one (control). Using computational modeling, we show
   that people can learn to obtain rewards for others but do so more slowly
   than when learning to obtain rewards for themselves. fMRI revealed that
   activity in a posterior portion of the subgenual anterior cingulate
   cortex/basal forebrain (sgACC) drives learning only when we are acting
   in a prosocial context and signals a prosocial prediction error
   conforming to classical principles of reinforcement learning theory.
   However, there is also substantial variability in the neural and
   behavioral efficiency of prosocial learning, which is predicted by trait
   empathy. More empathic people learn more quickly when benefitting
   others, and their sgACC response is the most selective for prosocial
   learning. We thus reveal a computational mechanism driving prosocial
   learning in humans. This framework could provide insights into atypical
   prosocial behavior in those with disorders of social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies of mood disorders demonstrate abnormalities in
   brain regions implicated in reward processing. However, there is a
   paucity of research investigating how social rewards affect reward
   circuit activity in these disorders. Here, we evaluated the relationship
   of both diagnostic category and dimensional depression severity to
   reward system function in bipolar and unipolar depression. In total, 86
   adults were included, including 24 patients with bipolar depression, 24
   patients with unipolar depression, and 38 healthy comparison subjects.
   Participants completed a social reward task during 3T BOLD fMRI. On
   average, diagnostic groups did not differ in activation to social
   reward. However, greater depression severity significantly correlated
   with reduced bilateral ventral striatum activation to social reward in
   the bipolar depressed group, but not the unipolar depressed group. In
   addition, decreased left orbitofrontal cortical activation correlated
   with more severe symptoms in bipolar depression, but not unipolar
   depression. These differential dimensional effects resulted in a
   significant voxelwise group by depression severity interaction. Taken
   together, these results provide initial evidence that deficits in social
   reward processing are differentially related to depression severity in
   the two disorders. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Schizotypy is associated with anhedonia. However, previous findings on
   the neural substrates of anhedonia in schizotypy are mixed. In the
   present study, we measured the neural substrates associated with reward
   anticipation and consummation in positive and negative schizotypy using
   functional MRI. The Monetary Incentive Delay task was administered to 33
   individuals with schizotypy (18 positive schizotypy (P5),15 negative
   schizotypy (NS)) and 22 healthy controls. Comparison between schizotypy
   individuals and controls were performed using two-sample T tests for
   contrast images involving gain versus non-gain anticipation condition
   and gain versus non-gain consummation condition. Multiple comparisons
   were corrected using Monte Carlo Simulation correction of p < .05. The
   results showed no significant difference in brain activity between
   controls and schizotypy individuals as a whole during gain anticipation
   or consummation. However, during the consummatory phase, NS individuals
   rather than PS individuals showed diminished left amygdala and left
   putamen activity compared with controls. We observed significantly
   weaker activation at the left ventral striatum during gain anticipation
   in NS individuals compared with controls. PS individuals, however,
   exhibited enhanced right ventral lateral prefrontal activity. These
   findings suggest that different dimensions of schizotypy may be
   underlied by different neural dysfunctions in reward anticipation and
   consummation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In our daily lives, we often receive performance feedback (PF) during
   imitative learning, and we adjust our behaviors accordingly to improve
   performance. However, little is known regarding the neural mechanisms
   underlying this learning process. We hypothesized that appropriate PF
   would enhance neural activation or recruit additional brain areas during
   subsequent action imitation. Pictures of 20 different finger gestures
   without any social meaning were shown to participants from the
   first-person perspective. Imitation with or without PF was investigated
   by functional magnetic resonance imaging in 30 healthy subjects. The PF
   was given by a real person or by a computer. PF from a real person
   induced hyperactivation of the parietal lobe (precuneus and cuneus),
   cingulate cortex (posterior and anterior), temporal lobe (superior and
   transverse temporal gyri), and cerebellum (posterior and anterior lobes)
   during subsequent imitation. The positive PF and negative PF from a real
   person, induced the activation of more brain areas during the following
   imitation. The hyperactivation of the cerebellum, posterior cingulate
   cortex, precuneus, and cuneus suggests that the subjects exhibited
   enhanced motor control and visual attention during imitation after PF.
   Additionally, random PF from a computer had a small effect on the next
   imitation. We suggest that positive and accurate PF may be helpful for
   imitation learning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Supervised, Multivariate, Whole-Brain Reduction Did Not Help to Achieve
   High Classification Performance in Schizophrenia Research}},

Abstract = {{We examined how penalized linear discriminant analysis with resampling,
   which is a supervised, multivariate, whole-brain reduction technique,
   can help schizophrenia diagnostics and research. In an experiment with
   magnetic resonance brain images of 52 first-episode schizophrenia
   patients and 52 healthy controls, this method allowed us to select brain
   areas relevant to schizophrenia, such as the left prefrontal cortex, the
   anterior cingulum, the right anterior insula, the thalamus, and the
   hippocampus. Nevertheless, the classification performance based on such
   reduced data was not significantly better than the classification of
   data reduced by mass univariate selection using a t-test or unsupervised
   multivariate reduction using principal component analysis. Moreover, we
   found no important influence of the type of imaging features, namely
   local deformations or gray matter volumes, and the classification
   method, specifically linear discriminant analysis or linear support
   vector machines, on the classification results. However, we ascertained
   significant effect of a cross validation setting on classification
   performance as classification results were overestimated even though the
   resampling was performed during the selection of brain imaging features.
   Therefore, it is critically important to perform cross validation in all
   steps of the analysis (not only during classification) in case there is
   no external validation set to avoid optimistically biasing the results
   of classification studies.}},

   gesture: evidence from fMRI repetition suppression}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation (a.k.a.
   repetition suppression) paradigm was used to test if semantic
   information contained in object-related (transitive) pantomimes and
   communicative (intransitive) gestures is represented differently in the
   occipito-temporal cortex. Participants watched 2.75 s back-to-back
   videos where the meaning of gesture was either repeated or changed. The
   just observed (typically second) gesture was then imitated. To maintain
   participants' attention, some trials contained a single video. fMRI
   adaptation -signal decreases-for watching both movement categories were
   observed particularly in the lateral occipital cortex, including the
   extrastriate body area (EBA). Yet, intransitive (vs. transitive) gesture
   specific repetition suppression was found mainly in the left rostral EBA
   and caudal middle temporal gyrus-the rEBA/cMTG complex. Repetition
   enhancement (signal increase) was revealed in the precuneus. While the
   whole brain and region-of-interest analyses indicate that the precuneus
   is involved only in visuospatial action processing for later imitation,
   the common EBA repetition suppression discloses sensitivity to the
   meaning of symbolic gesture, namely the ``semantic what{''} of actions.
   Moreover, the rEBA/cMTG suppression reveals greater selectivity for
   conventionalized communicative gesture. Thus, fMRI adaptation shows
   higher-order functions of EBA, its role in the semantic network, and
   indicates that its functional repertoire is wider than previously
   thought.}},

Abstract = {{People often demand a greater price when selling goods that they own
   than they would pay to purchase the same goods-a well-known economic
   bias called the endowment effect. The endowment effect has been found to
   be muted among experienced traders, but little is known about how
   trading experience reduces the endowment effect. We show that when
   selling, experienced traders exhibit lower right anterior insula
   activity, but no differences in nucleus accumbens or orbitofrontal
   activation, compared with inexperienced traders. Furthermore, insula
   activation mediates the effect of experience on the endowment effect.
   Similar results are obtained for inexperienced traders who are
   incentivized to gain trading experience. This finding indicates that
   frequent trading likely mitigates the endowment effect indirectly by
   modifying negative affective responses in the context of selling.}},

Title = {{Screening for Cognitive Impairments in Primary Blepharospasm}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Backgrounds Studies have reported that non-motor symptoms are an
   important component of primary dystonia. However, evidence supporting
   cognitive impairment in primary dystonia is limited and contradictory.
   Methods
   We applied the Chinese version of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive
   Examination-Revised and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to
   screen for cognitive impairment in patients with primary blepharospasm.
   In addition, we investigated the relationship between performance on the
   Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised and quality of life as
   measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form (SF36).
   Results
   The study included 68 primary blepharospasm patients and 68 controls
   matched by age, sex and education. The prevalence of cognitive deficits
   was 22.0\% and 32.3\% in primary blepharospasm patients group, as
   measured by the MMSE and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive
   Examination-Revised, respectively. Primary blepharospasm patents had a
   broad range of cognitive deficits, with the most frequently affected
   domains being visuospatial function (30.9\%) and language (30.9\%),
   followed by memory (27.9\%), orientation/attention (26.4\%) and verbal
   fluency (22.0\%). Patients with cognitive deficits had lower total SF36
   scores, especially in the subdomains of physical functioning,
   role-physical and social functioning, compared to those without
   cognitive deficits. Scores on the Addenbrooke's Cognitive
   Examination-Revised were significantly correlated with both the SF36
   scores and the scores on the subdomains of physical functioning and
   social functioning.
   Conclusions
   Some patients with primary blepharospasm have cognitive deficits. Poor
   performance on the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised is
   related to poorer quality of life.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{How do people consider other minds during cooperation versus
   competition? Some accounts predict that theory of mind (ToM) is
   recruited more for cooperation versus competition or competition versus
   cooperation, whereas other accounts predict similar recruitment across
   these two contexts. The present fMRI study examined activity in brain
   regions for ToM (bilateral temporoparietal junction, precuneus,
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex) across cooperative and competitive
   interactions with the same individual within the same paradigm. Although
   univariate analyses revealed that ToM regions overall were recruited
   similarly across interaction contexts, multivariate pattern analyses
   revealed that these regions nevertheless encoded information separating
   cooperation from competition. Specifically, ToM regions encoded
   differences between cooperation and competition when people believed the
   outcome was determined by their and their partner's choices but not when
   the computer determined the outcome. We propose that, when people are
   motivated to consider others' mental states, ToM regions encode
   different aspects of mental states during cooperation versus
   competition. Given the role of these regions for ToM, these findings
   reveal distinct patterns of social cognition for distinct motivational
   contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   during Cognitive Task}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Older adults today consume more alcohol than previous generations, the
   majority being social drinkers. The effects of heavy alcohol use on
   brain functioning closely resemble age-related changes, but it is not
   known if moderate-heavy alcohol consumption intensifies brain aging.
   Whether a lifestyle of moderate-heavy alcohol use in older adults
   increased age-related brain changes was examined. Forty-one older adults
   (65-80 years) that consumed light (< 2 drinks/week and >= 1 drink/month,
   n = 20) or moderate-heavy (7-21 drinks/week, non-bingers, n = 21)
   amounts of alcohol were enrolled. Twenty-two young adults (24-35 years)
   were also enrolled (light, n = 11 and moderate-heavy, n = 11).
   Functional brain networks based on magnetic resonance imaging data were
   generated for resting state and during a working memory task.
   Whole-brain, Central Executive Network (CEN), and Default Mode Network
   (DMN) connectivity were assessed in light and moderate-heavy alcohol
   consuming older adults with comparisons to young adults. The older
   adults had significantly lower whole brain connectivity (global
   efficiency) and lower regional connectivity (community structure) in the
   CEN during task and in the DMN at rest. Moderate-heavy older drinkers
   did not exhibit whole brain connectivity differences compared to the low
   drinkers. However, decreased CEN connectivity was observed during the
   task. There were no differences in the DMN connectivity between drinking
   groups. Taken together, a lifestyle including moderate-heavy alcohol
   consumption may be associated with further decreases in brain network
   connectivity within task-related networks in older adults. Further
   research is required to determine if this decrease is compensatory or an
   early sign of decline.}},

Title = {{The Neural Responses to Social Cooperation in Gain and Loss Context}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Cooperation is pervasive and constitutes the core behavioral principle
   of human social life. Previous studies have revealed that mutual
   cooperation was reliably correlated with two reward-related brain
   regions, the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study sought to
   investigate how the loss and gain contexts modulated the neural
   responses to mutual cooperation. Twenty-five female participants were
   scanned when they played a series of one-shot prisoner's dilemma games
   in the loss and gain contexts. Specifically, participants and partners
   independently chose to either cooperate with each other or not, and each
   was awarded or deprived of (in the gain context or the loss context,
   respectively) a sum of money which depended upon the interaction of
   their choices. Behavioral results indicated that participants cooperated
   in nearly half of the experiment trials and reported higher level of
   positive emotions for mutual cooperation in both contexts, but they
   cooperated more in the gain than in the loss context. At the neural
   level, stronger activities in the orbitofrontal cortex were observed for
   mutual cooperation compared with the other three outcomes in both
   contexts, while stronger activation in ventral striatum associated with
   mutual cooperation was observed in the gain context only. Together, our
   data indicated that, even in the one-shot interaction under loss
   context, participants still exhibited preference for cooperation and the
   rewarding experience from a mutually cooperative social interaction
   activated the ventral striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex, but the
   loss context weakened the association between the ventral striatum
   activation and mutual cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Previous behavioral research points to a positive relationship between
   maternal touch and early social development. Here, we explored the brain
   correlates of this relationship. The frequency of maternal touch was
   recorded for 43 five-year-old children during a 10 min standardized play
   session. Additionally, all children completed a resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging session. Investigating the default mode
   network revealed a positive relation between the frequency of maternal
   touch and activity in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) extending into the temporo-parietal junction. Using this effect
   as a seed in a functional connectivity analysis identified a network
   including extended bilateral regions along the temporal lobe, bilateral
   frontal cortex, and left insula. Compared with children with low
   maternal touch, children with high maternal touch showed additional
   connectivity with the right dorso-medial prefrontal cortex. Together
   these results support the notion that childhood tactile experiences
   shape the developing ``social brain{''} with a particular emphasis on a
   network involved in mentalizing.}},

Abstract = {{Both self-control and emotion regulation enable individuals to adapt to
   external circumstances and social contexts, and both are assumed to rely
   on the overlapping neural resources. Here, we tested whether high
   self-reported self-control is related to successful emotion regulation
   on the behavioral and neural level. One hundred eight participants
   completed three self-control questionnaires and regulated their negative
   emotions during functional magnetic resonance imaging using reappraisal
   (distancing). Trait self-control correlated positively with successful
   emotion regulation both subjectively and neurally, as indicated by
   online ratings of negative emotions and functional connectivity strength
   between the amygdala and prefrontal areas, respectively. This stronger
   overall connectivity of the left amygdala was related to more successful
   subjective emotion regulation. Comparing amygdala activity over time
   showed that high self-controllers successfully maintained
   down-regulation of the left amygdala over time, while low
   self-controllers failed to down-regulate towards the end of the
   experiment. This indicates that high self-controllers are better at
   maintaining a motivated state supporting emotion regulation over time.
   Our results support assumptions concerning a close relation of
   self-control and emotion regulation as two domains of behavioral
   control. They further indicate that individual differences in functional
   connectivity between task-related brain areas directly relate to
   differences in trait self-control.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally the mirror neuron system (MNS) only includes premotor and
   posterior parietal cortices. However, somatosensory cortices, BA1/2 in
   particular, are also activated during action execution and observation.
   Here, we examine whether BA1/2 and the parietofrontal MNS integrate
   information by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)guided
   continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to perturb BA1/2. Measuring
   brain activity using fMRI while participants are under the influence of
   cTBS shows local cTBS effects in BA1/2 varied, with some participants
   showing decreases and others increases in the BOLD response to viewing
   actions vs control stimuli. We show how measuring cTBS effects using
   fMRI can harness this variance using a whole-brain regression. This
   analysis identifies brain regions exchanging action-specific information
   with BA1/2 by mapping voxels away from the coil with cTBS-induced,
   action-observation-specific BOLD contrast changes that mirror those
   under the coil. This reveals BA1/2 exchanges action-specific information
   with premotor, posterior parietal and temporal nodes of the MNS during
   action observation. Although anatomical connections between BA1/2 and
   these regions are well known, this is the first demonstration that these
   connections carry action-specific signals during observation and hence,
   that BA1/2 plays a causal role in the human MNS.}},

Abstract = {{Distraction and rumination are distinct response styles that determine
   how an individual deals with negative thoughts and feelings. Rumination
   is accompanied by an elevated self-focus, which is associated with
   increased resting state functional connectivity and decreased reactivity
   within the default mode network. Interestingly, the NMDA receptor
   antagonist ketamine reduces functional connectivity in this network,
   while its effects on blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD) responses
   during stimulus perception are not known. Ketamine might lead to a more
   variable processing of the external world with an attenuated self-focus
   by reducing the resting state connectivity. Here, we used an emotional
   picture-viewing task in combination with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to test the hypothesis that a single ketamine administration to
   healthy subjects increases BOLD reactivity to negative stimuli. We found
   a region specific increase in BOLD reactivity in the pregenual anterior
   cingulate cortex and not in a posterior control region after ketamine
   compared with placebo administration. Moreover, a linear regression
   revealed that the increase in BOLD reactivity was more pronounced for
   subjects with a low ability to apply distraction during negative
   experiences. Our results implicate that ketamine attenuates a
   potentially pathological increased self-focus during negative
   experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with high anxiety sensitivity (AS) have an increased risk of
   developing anxiety disorders and are more biased in how they process
   fear-related stimuli. This study investigates the neural correlates of
   fear-related words and word associations in high-and low-AS individuals.
   We used a semantic priming paradigm during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging in which three types of target words (fear symptoms, e.g.
   `dizziness'; neutral, e.g. `drink'; and pseudowords, e.g. `salkom') were
   preceded by two types of prime words (fear-triggers, e.g. `elevator';
   and neutral, e.g. `bottle'). Subjects with high AS rated fear-symptom
   words (vs neutral words) as more unpleasant than low-AS individuals;
   they also related these words more strongly to fear-triggers and showed
   prolonged reaction times. During the processing of fear-symptom words,
   greater activation in the left anterior insula was observed in high-AS
   subjects than in low-AS subjects. Lower activation in the left inferior
   frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, fusiform gyrus and bilateral amygdalae was
   found in high-AS subjects when fear-symptom words were preceded by
   fear-trigger words. The findings suggest that cognitive biases and the
   anterior insula play a crucial role in high-AS individuals. Furthermore,
   semantic processes may contribute to high AS and the risk of developing
   anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Parental depression is a significant risk factor for adolescents'
   engagement in risk taking. Yet the neural processes that mediate the
   link between parental depression and adolescents' functioning remain
   unknown. Using a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
   design, we investigated how parental depression is associated with
   changes in adolescents' neural reactivity to rewards during a
   risk-taking task, and how such changes in neural reactivity are
   associated with changes in risk-taking behavior. Greater parental
   depressive symptoms were associated with increases in their adolescent
   child's risk taking and self-reported externalizing behavior over time.
   At the neural level, adolescents of parents with greater depressive
   symptoms showed longitudinal increases in the ventral striatum and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to rewards during risk taking.
   Longitudinal increases in adolescents' ventral striatum activation
   mediates the link between greater parental depression and increases in
   adolescents' risk taking and externalizing behavior. These findings
   provide novel evidence that parental depression may contribute to
   changes in adolescents' neural reactivity to rewards over time, which is
   associated with greater increases in their risk taking and externalizing
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The neural basis of emotion perception has mostly been investigated with
   single face or body stimuli. However, in daily life one may also
   encounter affective expressions by groups, e.g. an angry mob or an
   exhilarated concert crowd. In what way is brain activity modulated when
   several individuals express similar rather than different emotions? We
   investigated this question using an experimental design in which we
   presented two stimuli simultaneously, with same or different emotional
   expressions. We hypothesized that, in the case of two same-emotion
   stimuli, brain activity would be enhanced, while in the case of two
   different emotions, one emotion would interfere with the effect of the
   other. The results showed that the simultaneous perception of different
   affective body expressions leads to a deactivation of the amygdala and a
   reduction of cortical activity. It was revealed that the processing of
   fearful bodies, compared with different-emotion bodies, relied more
   strongly on saliency and action triggering regions in inferior parietal
   lobe and insula, while happy bodies drove the occipito-temporal cortex
   more strongly. We showed that this design could be used to uncover
   important differences between brain networks underlying fearful and
   happy emotions. The enhancement of brain activity for unambiguous
   affective signals expressed by several people simultaneously supports
   adaptive behaviour in critical situations.}},

Abstract = {{Despite functional brain imaging research pointing to the role of
   prefrontal cortex in cognitive reappraisal, the structural correlates of
   habitual engagement of reappraisal are unclear. Functional imaging
   studies of reappraisal have shown broad engagement of bilateral middle
   frontal cortex (MFC) and left superior frontal cortex (SFC), and
   specific engagement of the right SFC. However, volumetric studies have
   not identified clear associations between reappraisal and these regions.
   This discrepancy between functional and structural studies suggests that
   broad functional engagement associated with reappraisal might not be
   detectable at a structural level using highly localized volumetric
   measures. This study addressed the discrepant structural findings by
   assessing the relation between reappraisal and grey matter volume, using
   methods that allow both region-level broad/diffuse assessments
   (surface-based morphometry), and voxel-level specific/localized
   (voxel-based morphometry) measures. Results were consistent with diffuse
   positive volumetric associations with reappraisal in the right MFC and
   left SFC, and a localized positive volumetric association in the right
   SFC, thus resolving the discrepancy between functional and structural
   studies. This study provides novel evidence supporting the idea that
   functional engagement related to transient manipulations of reappraisal
   can be linked to structural associations related to habitual engagement
   of similar operations, within the same brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{Criminal behaviour poses a big challenge for society. A thorough
   understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying criminality
   could optimize its prevention and management. Specifically, elucidating
   the neural mechanisms underpinning reward expectation might be pivotal
   to understanding criminal behaviour. So far no study has assessed reward
   expectation and its mechanisms in a criminal sample. To fill this gap,
   we assessed reward expectation in incarcerated, psychopathic criminals.
   We compared this group to two groups of non-criminal individuals: one
   with high levels and another with low levels of impulsive/antisocial
   traits. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify
   neural responses to reward expectancy. Psychophysiological interaction
   analyses were performed to examine differences in functional
   connectivity patterns of reward-related regions. The data suggest that
   overt criminality is characterized, not by abnormal reward expectation
   per se, but rather by enhanced communication between reward-related
   striatal regions and frontal brain regions. We establish that
   incarcerated psychopathic criminals can be dissociated from non-criminal
   individuals with comparable impulsive/antisocial personality tendencies
   based on the degree to which reward-related brain regions interact with
   brain regions that control behaviour. The present results help us
   understand why some people act according to their impulsive/antisocial
   personality while others are able to behave adaptively despite
   reward-related urges.}},

Abstract = {{Pain behaviors are shaped by social demands and learning processes, and
   chronic pain has been previously suggested to affect their meaning. In
   this study, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging with
   in-scanner video recording during thermal pain stimulations and use
   multilevel mediation analyses to study the brain mediators of pain
   facial expressions and the perception of pain intensity (self-reports)
   in healthy individuals and patients with chronic back pain (CBP).
   Behavioral data showed that the relation between pain expression and
   pain report was disrupted in CBP. In both patients with CBP and healthy
   controls, brain activity varying on a trial-by-trial basis with pain
   facial expressions was mainly located in the primary motor cortex and
   completely dissociated from the pattern of brain activity varying with
   pain intensity ratings. Stronger activity was observed in CBP
   specifically during pain facial expressions in several nonmotor brain
   regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the
   medial temporal lobe. In sharp contrast, no moderating effect of chronic
   pain was observed on brain activity associated with pain intensity
   ratings. Our results demonstrate that pain facial expressions and pain
   intensity ratings reflect different aspects of pain processing and
   support psychosocial models of pain suggesting that distinctive
   mechanisms are involved in the regulation of pain behaviors in chronic
   pain.}},

Abstract = {{The neural basis of voluntarily suppressing conscious access to one's
   own memories (retrieval suppression {[}RS]) has recently received
   considerable attention. However, to date there has been limited research
   examining the effects of RS on subsequent processing of associated
   retrieval cues. In this study 47 healthy participants completed a
   Think/No Think task for memories of emotionally unpleasant visual
   scenes. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   participants were then presented with cues associated with both
   suppressed ({''}no-think-cues{''}) and non-suppressed
   ({''}think-cues{''}) memories, and then asked to perform simple
   arithmetic problems. We observed that, compared to think-cues,
   no-think-cues were associated with greater left mid/anterior insula
   activation and with greater insula-anterior cingulate functional
   connectivity; left insula activation also predicted worse arithmetic
   performance. These results suggest that cues associated with suppressed
   negative memories may lead to greater activation of the brain's
   ``salience{''} network, and reduced available cognitive resources for
   completion of an ongoing goal-directed task. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Autism and schizophrenia share multiple phenotypic and genotypic
   markers, and there is ongoing debate regarding the relationship of these
   two disorders. To examine whether cortical dynamics are similar across
   these disorders, we directly compared fMRI responses to visual,
   somatosensory and auditory stimuli in adults with autism (N = 15), with
   schizophrenia (N = 15), and matched controls (N = 15). All participants
   completed a one-back letter detection task presented at fixation (to
   control attention) while task-irrelevant sensory stimulation was
   delivered to the different modalities. We focused specifically on the
   response amplitudes and the variability in sensory fMRI responses of the
   two groups, given the evidence of greater trial-to-trial variability in
   adults with autism. Both autism and schizophrenia individuals showed
   weaker signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in sensory-evoked responses compared
   to controls (d > 0.42), but for different reasons. For the autism group,
   the fMRI response amplitudes were indistinguishable from controls but
   were more variable trial-to-trial (d = 0.47). For the schizophrenia
   group, response amplitudes were smaller compared to autism (d = 0.44)
   and control groups (d = 0.74), but were not significantly more variable
   (d < 0.29). These differential group profiles suggest (1) that greater
   trial-to-trial variability in cortical responses may be specific to
   autism and is not a defining characteristic of schizophrenia, and (2)
   that blunted response amplitudes may be characteristic of schizophrenia.
   The relationship between the amplitude and the variability of cortical
   activity might serve as a specific signature differentiating these
   neurodevelopmental disorders. Identifying the neural basis of these
   responses and their relationship to the underlying genetic bases may
   substantially enlighten the understanding of both disorders. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Individuals with schizophrenia evidence impaired emotional functioning.
   Abnormal amygdala activity has been identified as an etiological factor
   underlying affective impairment in this population, but the exact nature
   remains unclear. The current study utilized psychophysiological
   interaction analyses to examine functional connectivity between the
   amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during an emotion
   perception task. Participants with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy
   controls (HC) viewed and rated positive, negative, and neutral images
   while undergoing functional neuroimaging. Results revealed a significant
   group difference in right amygdala-mPFC connectivity during perception
   of negative versus neutral images. Specifically, HC participants
   demonstrated positive functional coupling between the amygdala and mPFC,
   consistent with co-active processing of salient information. In
   contrast, SZ participants evidenced negative functional coupling,
   consistent with top-down inhibition of the amygdala by the mPFC. A
   significant positive correlation between connectivity strength during
   negative image perception and clinician-rated social functioning was
   also observed in SZ participants, such that weaker right amygdala-mPFC
   coupling during negative compared to neutral image perception was
   associated with poorer social functioning. Overall, results suggest that
   emotional dysfunction and associated deficits in functional outcome in
   schizophrenia may relate to abnormal interactions between the amygdala
   and mPFC during perception of emotional stimuli. This study adds to the
   growing literature on abnormal functional connections in schizophrenia
   and supports the functional disconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia.

Title = {{Effects of acute tryptophan depletion on central processing of

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2072-2083}},

Abstract = {{C-tactile afferents (CTs) are slowly conducting nerve fibres, present
   only in hairy skin. They are optimally activated by slow, gentle
   stroking touch, such as those experienced during a caress. CT
   stimulation activates affective processing brain regions, alluding to
   their role in affective touch perception. We tested a theory that
   CT-activating touch engages the pro-social functions of serotonin, by
   determining whether reducing serotonin, through acute tryptophan
   depletion, diminishes subjective pleasantness and affective brain
   responses to gentle touch. A tryptophan depleting amino acid drink was
   administered to 16 healthy females, with a further 14 receiving a
   control drink. After 4h, participants underwent an fMRI scan, during
   which time CT-innervated forearm skin and CT non-innervated finger skin
   was stroked with three brushes of differing texture, at CT-optimal force
   and velocity. Pleasantness ratings were obtained post scanning. The
   control group showed a greater response in ipsilateral orbitofrontal
   cortex to CT-activating forearm touch compared to touch to the finger
   where CTs are absent. This differential response was not present in the
   tryptophan depleted group. This interaction effect was significant. In
   addition, control participants showed a differential primary
   somatosensory cortex response to brush texture applied to the finger, a
   purely discriminatory touch response, which was not observed in the
   tryptophan depleted group. This interaction effect was also significant.
   Pleasantness ratings were similar across treatment groups. These results
   implicate serotonin in the differentiation between CT-activating and
   purely discriminatory touch responses. Such effects could contribute to
   some of the social abnormalities seen in psychiatric disorders
   associated with abnormal serotonin function.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The internal state of others can be understood observing their actions
   or listening to their voice. While the neural bases of action style
   (vitality forms) have been investigated, there is no information on how
   we recognize others' internal state by listening to their speech. Here,
   using fMRI technique, we investigated the neural correlates of auditory
   vitality forms while participants listened to action verbs in three
   different conditions: human voice pronouncing the verbs in a rude and
   gentle way, robot voice pronouncing the same verbs without vitality
   forms, and a scrambled version of the same verbs pronounced by human
   voice. In agreement with previous studies on vitality forms encoding, we
   found specific activation of the central part of insula during listening
   to human voice conveying specific vitality forms. In addition, when
   listening both to human and robot voices there was an activation of the
   posterior part of the left inferior frontal gyrus and of the
   parieto-premotor circuit typically described to be activated during
   observation and execution of arm actions. Finally, the superior temporal
   gyrus was activated bilaterally in all three conditions. We conclude
   that, the central part of insula is a key region for vitality forms
   processing allowing the understanding of the vitality forms regardless
   of the modality by which they are conveyed. (C) 2016 Published by

   social-emotional bias}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{217-224}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The anterior region of the left superior temporal gyms/superior temporal
   sulcus (aSTG/STS) has been implicated in two very different cognitive
   functions: sentence processing and social-emotional processing. However,
   the vast majority of the sentence stimuli in previous reports have been
   of a social or social-emotional nature suggesting that sentence
   processing may be confounded with semantic content. To evaluate this
   possibility we had subjects read word lists that differed in
   phrase/constituent size (single words, 3-word phrases, 6-word sentences)
   and semantic content (social-emotional, social, and inanimate objects)
   while scanned in a 7 T environment. This allowed us to investigate if
   the aSTG/STS responded to increasing constituent structure (with
   increased activity as a function of constituent size) with or without
   regard to a specific domain of concepts, i.e., social and/or
   social-emotional content. Activity in the left aSTG/STS was found to
   increase with constituent size. This region was also modulated by
   content, however, such that social-emotional concepts were preferred
   over social and object stimuli. Reading also induced content type
   effects in domain-specific semantic regions. Those preferring
   social-emotional content included aSTG/STS, inferior frontal gyrus,
   posterior STS, lateral fusiform, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and
   amygdala, regions included in the ``social brain{''}, while those
   preferring object content included parahippocampal gyrus, retrosplenial
   cortex, and caudate, regions involved in object processing. These
   results suggest that semantic content affects higher-level linguistic
   processing and should be taken into account in future studies. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Besides offering opportunities in both clinical and non-clinical
   domains, the application of novel neuroimaging technologies raises
   pressing dilemmas. `Responsible Research and Innovation' (RRI) aims to
   stimulate research and innovation activities that take ethical and
   social considerations into account from the outset. We previously
   identified that Dutch neuroscientists interpret ``responsible
   innovation{''} as educating the public on neuroimaging technologies via
   the popular press. Their aim is to mitigate (neuro)hype, an aim shared
   with the wider emerging RRI community. Here, we present results of a
   media-analysis undertaken to establish whether the body of articles in
   the Dutch popular press presents balanced conversations on neuroimaging
   research to the public. We found that reporting was mostly positive and
   framed in terms of (healthcare) progress. There was rarely a balance
   between technology opportunities and limitations, and even fewer
   articles addressed societal or ethical aspects of neuroimaging research.
   Furthermore, neuroimaging metaphors seem to favour oversimplification.
   Current reporting is therefore more likely to enable hype than to
   mitigate it. How can neuroscientists, given their self-ascribed social
   responsibility, address this conundrum? We make a case for a collective
   and shared responsibility among neuroscientists, journalists and other
   stakeholders, including funders, committed to responsible reporting on
   neuroimaging research.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionLike nonverbal cues in oral interactions, text-based

   negative emotions. Voxel-wise analyses were performed to compare the
   responses and contrasted with emotional versus scrambled emoticons and
   among emoticons with different emotions. To explore processing
   strategies for text-based emoticons, brain activity in the bilateral
   occipital and fusiform face areas were compared.
   ResultsIn the voxel-wise analysis, both emotional and scrambled
   emoticons were processed mainly in the bilateral fusiform gyri, inferior
   division of lateral occipital cortex, inferior frontal gyri,
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (dACC), and parietal cortex. In a percent signal change analysis, the
   right occipital and fusiform face areas showed significantly higher
   activation than left ones. In comparisons among emoticons, sad one
   showed significant BOLD signal decrease in the dACC, the left AIC, the
   bilateral thalamus, and the precuneus as compared with other conditions.
   ConclusionThe results of this study imply that people recognize
   text-based emoticons as pictures representing face expressions. Even
   though text-based emoticons contain emotional meaning, they are not
   associated with the amygdala while previous studies using emotional
   stimuli documented amygdala activation.}},

Abstract = {{Do differences between the syntactic categories of nouns and adjectives
   for describing persons translate into different patterns of brain
   activation? In this fMRI study, we compared reading person and object
   descriptions denoted by nouns or adjectives. Previous behavioral studies
   found that nouns, describing the more abstract construct of social
   categories, compared to adjectives, describing the more concrete
   construct of personality traits, have an impact on the inferences made
   about a person. Additionally, previous neuroimaging findings suggest
   that abstract constructs recruit a different pattern of brain
   activation, compared to more concrete constructs. Participants read
   sentences describing a protagonist by means of a noun or an adjective,
   as well as sentences describing objects through a noun or an adjective.
   The results revealed that reading nouns as opposed to adjectives showed
   increased activation in the left lingual gyrus for persons, and
   additionally in the right lingual gyrus for objects. The results
   indicate that there are limited differences in the processing of nouns
   and adjectives when describing persons. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Social representations and contextual adjustments as two distinct
   components of the Theory of Mind brain network: Evidence from the REMICS
   task}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{176-191}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Theory of mind (ToM) refers to the ability to infer the mental states of
   others. Behavioral measures of ToM usually present information about
   both a character and the context in which this character is placed, and
   these different pieces of information can be used to infer the
   character's mental states. A set of brain regions designated as the ToM
   brain network is recognized to support (ToM) inferences. Different brain
   regions within that network could however support different ToM
   processes.
   This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aimed to
   distinguish the brain regions supporting two aspects inherent to many
   ToM tasks, i.e., the ability to infer or represent mental states and the
   ability to use the context to adjust these inferences. Nineteen healthy
   subjects were scanned during the REMICS task, a novel task designed to
   orthogonally manipulate mental state inferences (as opposed to physical
   inferences) and contextual adjustments of inferences (as opposed to
   inferences that do not require contextual adjustments).
   We observed that mental state inferences and contextual adjustments,
   which are important aspects of most behavioral ToM tasks, rely on
   distinct brain regions or subregions within the classical brain network
   activated in previous ToM research. Notably, an interesting dissociation
   emerged within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and temporoparietal
   junctions (TPJ) such that the inferior part of these brain regions
   responded to mental state inferences while the superior part of these
   brain regions responded to the requirement for contextual adjustments.
   This study provides evidence that the overall set of brain regions
   activated during ToM tasks supports different processes, and highlights
   that cognitive processes related to contextual adjustments have an
   important role in ToM and should be further studied. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   Topological Visual, Auditory, and Somatotomotor Maps}},

Abstract = {{Cortical mapping techniques using fMRI have been instrumental in
   identifying the boundaries of topological (neighbor-preserving) maps in
   early sensory areas. The presence of topological maps beyond early
   sensory areas raises the possibility that they might play a significant
   role in other cognitive systems, and that topological mapping might help
   to delineate areas involved in higher cognitive processes. In this
   study, we combine surface-based visual, auditory, and somatomotor
   mapping methods with a naturalistic reading comprehension task in the
   same group of subjects to provide a qualitative and quantitative
   assessment of the cortical overlap between sensory-motor maps in all
   major sensory modalities, and reading processing regions. Our results
   suggest that cortical activation during naturalistic reading
   comprehension overlaps more extensively with topological sensory-motor
   maps than has been heretofore appreciated. Reading activation in regions
   adjacent to occipital lobe and inferior parietal lobe almost completely
   overlaps visual maps, whereas a significant portion of frontal
   activation for reading in dorsolateral and ventral prefrontal cortex
   overlaps both visual and auditory maps. Even classical language regions
   in superior temporal cortex are partially overlapped by topological
   visual and auditory maps. By contrast, the main overlap with somatomotor
   maps is restricted to a small region on the anterior bank of the central
   sulcus near the border between the face and hand representations of M-I.

Title = {{Relationship between Parental Feeding Practices and Neural Responses to

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Social context, specifically within the family, influences adolescent
   eating behaviours and thus their health. Little is known about the
   specific mechanisms underlying the effects of parental feeding practices
   on eating. We explored relationships between parental feeding practices
   and adolescent eating habits and brain activity in response to viewing
   food images. Fifty-seven adolescents (15 with type 2 diabetes mellitus,
   21 obese and 21 healthy weight controls) underwent fMRI scanning whilst
   viewing images of food or matched control images. Participants completed
   the Kids Child Feeding Questionnaire, the Childrens' Dutch Eating
   Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) and took part in an observed meal.
   Parents completed the Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionniare and
   the DEBQ. We were particularly interested in brain activity in response
   to food cues that was modulated by different feeding and eating styles.
   Healthy-weight participants increased activation (compared to the other
   groups) to food in proportion to the level of parental restriction in
   visual areas of the brain such as right lateral occipital cortex (LOC),
   right temporal occipital cortex, left occipital fusiform gyrus, left
   lateral and superior LOC. Adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus had
   higher activation (compared to the other groups) with increased parental
   restrictive feeding in areas relating to emotional control, attention
   and decision-making, such as posterior cingulate, precuneus, frontal
   operculum and right middle frontal gyrus. Participants with type 2
   diabetes mellitus also showed higher activation (compared to the other
   groups) in the left anterior intraparietal sulcus and angular gyrus when
   they also reported higher self restraint. Parental restriction did not
   modulate food responses in obese participants, but there was increased
   activity in visual (visual cortex, left LOC, left occipital fusiform
   gyrus) and reward related brain areas (thalamus and parietal operculum)
   in response to parental teaching and modelling of behaviour. Parental
   restrictive feeding and parental teaching and modelling affected neural
   responses to food cues in different ways, depending on motivations and
   diagnoses, illustrating a social influence on neural responses to food
   cues.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Alterations of the default mode network (DMN) have been
   described in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, including
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the
   neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is known to modulate DMN activity.
   This study aimed to explore the role of 5-HT on the DMN and its
   functional connectivity (FC) in young patients with ADHD.
   Methods: Young male patients with ADHD (n = 12) and healthy controls (n
   = 10) (both aged 12-17 years) were subjected to acute tryptophan
   depletion (ATD) and subsequently diminished brain 5-HT synthesis. Three
   hours after challenge intake (ATD or a balanced control condition, BAL),
   resting state fMRI scans were obtained.
   Results: In patients, ATD led to attenuated FC of the right superior
   premotor cortex (BA 6) with the DMN, comparable to the extent found in
   controls after BAL administration. ATD lowered FC of the left
   somatosensory cortex (BA 3) with the DMN, independently of the factor
   group, but with stronger effects in controls.
   Conclusions: Data reveal a serotonergic modulation of FC between BA 6
   and 3, known to be relevant for motor planning and sensory perception,
   and the DMN, thereby possibly pointing toward ATD acting beneficially on
   neural planning of motor activity in patients with ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{The two-component framework of episodic memory (EM) development posits
   that the contributions of medial temporal lobe (MTL) and prefrontal
   cortex (PFC) to successful encoding differ across the lifespan. To test
   the framework's hypotheses, we compared subsequent memory effects (SME)
   of 10-12 year-old children, younger adults, and older adults using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Memory was probed by cued
   recall, and SME were defined as regional activation differences during
   encoding between subsequently correctly recalled versus omitted items.
   In MTL areas, children's SME did not differ in magnitude from those of
   younger and older adults. In contrast, children's SME in PFC were weaker
   than the corresponding SME in younger and older adults, in line with the
   hypothesis that PFC contributes less to successful encoding in
   childhood. Differences in SME between younger and older adults were
   negligible. The present results suggest that, among individuals with
   high memory functioning, the neural circuitry contributing to successful
   episodic encoding is reorganized from middle childhood to adulthood.
   Successful episodic encoding in later adulthood, however, is
   characterized by the ability to maintain the activation patterns that
   emerged in young adulthood. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Social scientists have long been interested in understanding how
   socioeconomic status (SES) affects the way people think, feel, and
   behave. Neuroscience has provided new tools (fMRI, EEG, and ERP) to
   allow us to answer these questions, demonstrating, for example, that
   lower SES is linked to stronger mirror neural responses, greater
   mentalizing, enhanced vigilance to threat, and lesser likelihood to
   spontaneously infer traits based on limited information. The present
   paper (i) reviews evidence that SES affects neural responses involved in
   a wide range of psychological processes, (ii) highlights the value of
   neural methods in investigations of SES, (iii) discusses cultural
   neuroscience as a potential framework to understand why SES has the
   effects it does on the brain, (iv) considers previous developmental
   neuroscience findings regarding SES and attention in light of cultural
   neuroscience, and (v) discusses future challenges, opportunities, and

Abstract = {{People diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) characteristically
   present with severe difficulties in interpreting every-day social
   signals. Currently it is assumed that these difficulties might have
   neurobiological correlates in alterations in activation as well as in
   connectivity in and between regions of the social perception network
   suggested to govern the processing of social cues. In this study, we
   conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based activation
   and connectivity analyses focusing on face-, voice-, and
   audiovisual-processing brain regions as the most important subareas of
   the social perception network. Results revealed alterations in
   connectivity among regions involved in the processing of social stimuli
   in ASD subjects compared to typically developed (TD)
   controls-specifically, a reduced connectivity between the left temporal
   voice area (TVA) and the superior and medial frontal gyrus. Alterations
   in connectivity, moreover, were correlated with the severity of autistic
   traits: correlation analysis indicated that the connectivity between the
   left TVA and the limbic lobe, anterior cingulate and the medial frontal
   gyrus as well as between the right TVA and the frontal lobe, anterior
   cingulate, limbic lobe and the caudate decreased with increasing symptom
   severity. As these frontal regions are understood to play an important
   role in interpreting and mentalizing social signals, the observed
   underconnectivity might be construed as playing a role in social
   impairments in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined identification of emotional information in facial
   expression, prosody, and their combination in 23 adult patients with
   combined attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus 31
   healthy controls (HC) matched for gender, age, and education. We
   employed a stimulus set which was carefully balanced for valence as well
   as recognizability of the expressed emotions as determined in an
   independent sample of HC to avoid potential biases due to different
   levels of task difficulty. ADHD patients were characterized by impaired
   recognition of all employed categories (neutral, happiness, eroticism,
   disgust, anger). Basic cognitive functions as assessed by
   neuropsychological testing, such as sustained attention, constancy of
   alertness, and verbal intelligence partially explained lower recognition
   rates. Removal of the correlated variance by means of regression
   analyses did not abolish lower performance in ADHD indicating deficits
   in social cognition independent of these neuropsychological factors (p <
   0.05). Lower performance correlated with self-rated emotional
   intelligence (r = 0.38, p < 0.05) indicating that adults with ADHD are
   aware of their problems in emotion perception. ADHD patients could
   partly compensate their deficit in unimodal emotion perception by
   audiovisual integration as revealed by larger gains in emotion
   recognition accuracy during bimodal presentation (p < 0.05) as compared
   to HC. These behavioral results can serve as foundation for future
   neuroimaging studies and point rather towards sensory-specific regions
   than audiovisual integration areas in perception of emotional
   information in adult ADHD.}},

Abstract = {{Recollection rejection or recall-to-reject is a mechanism that has been
   posited to help maintain accurate memory by preventing the occurrence of
   false memories. Recollection rejection occurs when the presentation of a
   new item during recognition triggers recall of an associated target, a
   mismatch in features between the new and old items is registered, and
   the lure is correctly rejected. Critically, this characterization of
   recollection rejection involves a recall signal that is conceptually
   similar to recollection as elicited by a target. However, previous
   neuroimaging studies have not evaluated the extent to which recollection
   rejection and target recollection rely on a common neural signal but
   have instead focused on recollection rejection as a postretrieval
   monitoring process. This study utilized a false memory paradigm in
   conjunction with an adapted remember-know-new response paradigm that
   separated new responses based on recollection rejection from those that
   were based on a lack of familiarity with the item. This procedure
   allowed for parallel recollection rejection and target recollection
   contrasts to be computed. Results revealed that, contrary to predictions
   from theoretical and behavioral literature, there was virtually no
   evidence of a common retrieval mechanism supporting recollection
   rejection and target recollection. Instead of the typical target
   recollection network, recollection rejection recruited a network of
   lateral prefrontal and bilateral parietal regions that is consistent
   with the retrieval monitoring network identified in previous
   neuroimaging studies of recollection rejection. However, a functional
   connectivity analysis revealed a component of the frontoparietal
   rejection network that showed increased coupling with the right
   hippocampus during recollection rejection responses. As such, we
   demonstrate a possible link between PFC monitoring network and basic
   retrieval mechanisms within the hippocampus that was not revealed with
   univariate analyses alone.}},

Abstract = {{Self-regulation is a critical ability for maintaining a wide range of
   health behaviors, especially in preventing overeating and weight gain.
   Previous work has identified various threats to self-control in the
   eating domain, chief among which are desire strength and negative
   affect. In the present study, we examined individual differences in
   college-aged dieters' experiences of these threats as they encountered
   temptations to eat in their daily lives, and tested whether these
   differences characterized sub-groups of dieters with divergent
   self-control outcomes. Specifically, 75 dieting females (age range:
   18-23) participated in a combined functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and experience sampling study. Participants passively viewed food
   cues during a fMRI session, and then reported their daily eating
   behaviors for one week via ecological momentary assessment. We examined
   the characteristics of dieters who exhibited the most favorable
   combination of the aforementioned factors (i.e., low desire strength and
   positive mood) and who were thus most successful at regulating their
   eating. These dieters endorsed more autonomous reasons for their
   self-regulatory goals, and during the food cue reactivity task more
   readily recruited the inferior frontal gyrus, a brain region associated
   with inhibitory control. We suggest that these motivational and neural
   correlates may also be implicated in self-regulation of other important
   health behaviors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Task-based fMRI has been used to study the effects of experimental
   inflammation on the human brain, but it remains unknown whether
   intrinsic connectivity in the brain at rest changes during a sickness
   response. Here, we investigated the effect of experimental inflammation
   on connectivity between areas relevant for monitoring of bodily states,
   motivation, and subjective symptoms of sickness. In a double-blind
   randomized controlled experiment, 52 healthy volunteers were injected
   with 0.6 ng/kg LPS (lipopolysaccharide) or placebo, and participated in
   a resting state fMRI experiment after approximately 2 h 45 min. Resting
   state fMRI data were available from 48 participants, of which 28
   received LPS and 20 received placebo. Bilateral anterior and bilateral
   posterior insula sections were used as seed regions and connectivity
   with bilateral orbitofrontal and cingulate (anterior and middle)
   cortices was investigated. Back pain, headache and global sickness
   increased significantly after as compared to before LPS, while a
   non-significant trend was shown for increased nausea. Compared to
   placebo, LPS was followed by increased connectivity between left
   anterior insula and left midcingulate cortex. This connectivity was
   significantly correlated to increase in back pain after LPS and tended
   to be related to increased global sickness, but was not related to
   increased headache or nausea. LPS did not affect the connectivity from
   other insular seeds. In conclusion, the finding of increased functional
   connectivity between left anterior insula and middle cingulate cortex
   suggests a potential neurophysiological mechanism that can be further
   tested to understand the subjective feeling of malaise and discomfort
   during a sickness response. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Energy balance is regulated by a multifaceted system of physiological
   signals that influence energy intake and expenditure. Therefore,
   variability in the brain's response to food may be partially explained
   by differences in levels of metabolically active tissues throughout the
   body, including fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM). The purpose of
   this study was to test the hypothesis that children's body composition
   would be related to their brain response to food images varying in
   energy density (ED), a measure of energy content per weight of food.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure brain
   response to High (>1.5 kcal/g) and Low (<15 kcal/g) ED food images, and
   Control images, in 36 children ages 7-10 years. Body composition was
   measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. Multi-subject random
   effects general linear model (GLM) and two-factor repeated measures
   analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test for main effects of ED
   (High ED vs. Low ED) in a priori defined brain regions of interest
   previously implicated in energy homeostasis and reward processing.
   Pearson's correlations were then calculated between activation in these
   regions for various contrasts (High ED-Low ED, High ED-Control, Low
   ED-Control) and child body composition (FFM index FM index, \% body
   fat). Relative to Low ED foods, High ED foods elicited greater BOLD
   activation in the left thalamus. In the right substantia nigra, BOLD
   activation for the contrast of High ED-Low ED foods was positively
   associated with child FFM. There were no significant results for the
   High ED-Control or Low ED-Control contrasts. Our findings support
   literature on FFM as an appetitive driver, such that greater amounts of
   lean mass were associated with greater activation for High ED foods in
   an area of the brain associated with dopamine signaling and reward
   (substantia nigra). These results confirm our hypothesis that brain
   response to foods varying in energy content is related to measures of
   child body composition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Amygdala hyperactivation to angry faces in intermittent explosive
   disorder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{34-41}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder (IED) were
   previously found to exhibit amygdala hyperactivation and relatively
   reduced orbital medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) activation to angry
   faces while performing an implicit emotion information processing task
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This study examines
   the neural substrates associated with explicit encoding of facial
   emotions among individuals with IED.
   Method: Twenty unmedicated IED subjects and twenty healthy, matched
   comparison subjects (HC) underwent fMRI while viewing blocks of angry,
   happy, and neutral faces and identifying the emotional valence of each
   face (positive, negative or neutral). We compared amygdala and OMPFC
   reactivity to faces between IED and HC subjects. We also examined the
   relationship between amygdala/OMPFC activation and aggression severity.
   Results: Compared to controls, the IED group exhibited greater amygdala
   response to angry (vs. neutral) facial expressions. In contrast, IED and
   control groups did not differ in OMPFC activation to angry faces. Across
   subjects amygdala activation to angry faces was correlated with number
   of prior aggressive acts.
   Conclusions: These findings extend previous evidence of amygdala
   dysfunction in response to the identification of an ecologically-valid
   social threat signal (processing angry faces) among individuals with
   IED, further substantiating a link between amygdala hyperactivity to
   social signals of direct threat and aggression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{10-25}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Human language allows us to express our thoughts and ideas by combining
   entities, concepts and actions into multi-event episodes. Yet, the
   functional neuroanatomy engaged in interpretation of such high-level
   linguistic input remains poorly understood. Here, we used easy to detect
   and more subtle ``borderline{''} anomalies to investigate the brain
   regions and mechanistic principles involved in the use of real-world
   event knowledge in language comprehension. Overall, the results showed
   that the processing of sentences in context engages a complex set of
   bilateral brain regions in the frontal, temporal and inferior parietal
   lobes. Easy anomalies preferentially engaged lower-order cortical areas
   adjacent to the primary auditory cortex. In addition, the left
   supramarginal gyrus and anterior temporal sulcus as well as the right
   posterior middle temporal gyrus contributed to the processing of easy
   and borderline anomalies. The observed pattern of results is explained
   in terms of (i) hierarchical processing along a dorsal-ventral axis and
   (ii) the assumption of high-order association areas serving as cortical
   hubs in the convergence of information in a distributed network.
   Finally, the observed modulation of BOLD signal in prefrontal areas
   provides support for their role in the implementation of executive
   control processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Neural adaptation in pSTS correlates with perceptual aftereffects to
   biological motion and with autistic traits}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{149-161}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{The adaptive nature of biological motion perception has been documented
   in behavioral studies, with research showing that prolonged viewing of
   an action can bias judgments of subsequent actions towards the opposite
   of its attributes. However, the neural mechanisms underlying action
   adaptation aftereffects remain unknown. We examined adaptation-induced
   changes in brain responses to an ambiguous action after adapting to
   walking or running actions within two bilateral regions of interest: 1)
   human middle temporal area (hMT+), a lower-level motion-sensitive region
   of cortex, and 2) posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), a
   higher-level action-selective area. We found a significant correlation
   between neural adaptation strength in right pSTS and perceptual
   aftereffects to biological motion measured behaviorally, but not in
   hMT+. The magnitude of neural adaptation in right pSTS was also strongly
   correlated with individual differences in the degree of autistic traits.
   Participants with more autistic traits exhibited less adaptation-induced
   modulations of brain responses in right pSTS and correspondingly weaker
   perceptual aftereffects. These results suggest a direct link between
   perceptual aftereffects and adaptation of neural populations in right
   pSTS after prolonged viewing of a biological motion stimulus, and
   highlight the potential importance of this brain region for
   understanding differences in social-cognitive processing along the
   autistic spectrum. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A stepwise category-learning task was designed to examine brain
   activation associated with invariance detection and variance inhibition
   during category induction (CI). Three stimuli were displayed
   sequentially and participants were asked to learn the target category
   based on the invariant feature among stimuli. The processes of
   invariance detection and variance inhibition were necessary during
   certain events; however, these processes were not required for other
   events. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results indicated
   that the processes of detecting invariant features and inhibiting
   variant features were associated with significant activation in the left
   prefrontal cortex, including the left superior frontal gyrus, middle
   frontal gyrus, and mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as other
   regions (e.g., bilateral parietal cortex and putamen). These findings
   confirmed the important role of the fronto-parietal network and striatum

Title = {{Neural Correlates of Fear of Movement in Patients with Chronic Low Back
   Pain vs. Pain-Free Individuals}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Fear of movement (FOM) can be acquired by a direct aversive experience
   such as pain or by social learning through observation and instruction.
   Excessive FOM results in heightened disability and is an obstacle for
   recovery from acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain (cLBP). FOM has
   further been identified as a significant explanatory factor in the Fear
   Avoidance (FA) model of cLBP that describes how individuals experiencing
   acute back pain may become trapped into a vicious circle of chronic
   disability and suffering. Despite a wealth of evidence emphasizing the
   importance of FOM in cLBP, to date, no related neural correlates in
   patients were found and this therefore has initiated a debate about the
   precise contribution of fear in the FA model. In the current fMRI study,
   we applied a novel approach encompassing: (1) video clips of potentially
   harmful activities for the back as FOM inducing stimuli; and (2) the
   assessment of FOM in both, cLBP patients (N = 20) and age- and
   gender-matched pain-free subjects (N = 20). Derived from the FA model,
   we hypothesized that FOM differentially affects brain regions involved
   in fear processing in patients with cLBP compared to pain-free
   individuals due to the recurrent pain and subsequent avoidance behavior.
   The results of the whole brain voxel-wise regression analysis revealed
   that: (1) FOM positively correlated with brain activity in fear-related
   brain regions such as the amygdala and the insula; and (2) differential
   effects of FOM between patients with cLBP and pain-free subjects were
   found in the extended amygdala and in its connectivity to the anterior
   insula. Current findings support the FOM component of the FA model in
   cLBP.}},

   action observation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Smooth social interactions require a deep understanding of others'
   intentions and feelings. In the present study, to investigate brain
   regions that respond to inference of others' effort level, we recorded
   brain activity during action observation of different effort levels
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used a dumbbell
   curl movement to depict a movement requiring effort. To dissociate the
   factors of effort level of the actor and weight of the dumbbell, we used
   four combinations of dumbbell weight and actor physique: a thin actor or
   a built actor lifting a heavy or light dumbbell. During observation of
   dumbbell curls, the bilateral front-parietal action observation network
   (AON) was activated. This included the premotor cortices, parietal
   cortices, visual areas 5/superior temporal cortices (STS), amygdalae,
   hippocampi, right dorsolateral and ventrolateral frontal cortices. When
   we evaluated brain regions associated with the actor's effort level,
   activity in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and STS was
   observed. However, activity in the front-parietal AON was independent of
   the actor's effort during action observation. This finding suggests that
   the right TPJ and STS play an important role in the inference of others'
   effort levels during the observation of others' movements.}},

   Phenomenon in Mandarin Chinese}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the neural substrates underlying the implementation
   of phonological rule in lexical tone by the Tone 3 sandhi phenomenon in
   Mandarin Chinese. Tone 3 sandhi is traditionally described as the
   substitution of Tone 3 with Tone 2 when followed by another Tone 3 (33
   -> 23) during speech production. Tone 3 sandhi enables the examination
   of tone processing in the phonological level with the least involvement
   of segments. Using the fMRI technique, we measured brain activations
   corresponding to the monosyllable and disyllable sequences of the four
   Chinese lexical tones, while manipulating the requirement on overt oral
   response. The application of Tone 3 sandhi to disyllable sequence of
   Tone 3 was confirmed by our behavioral results. Larger brain responses
   to overtly produced disyllable Tone 3 (33 > 11, 22, and 44) were found
   in right posterior IFG by both whole-brain and ROI analyses. We suggest
   that the right IFG was responsible for the processing of Tone 3 sandhi.
   Intense temporo-frontal interaction is needed in speech production for
   self-monitoring. The involvement of the right IFG in tone production
   might result from its interaction with the right auditory cortex, which
   is known to specialize in pitch. Future studies using tools with better
   temporal resolutions are needed to illuminate the dynamic interaction
   between the right inferior frontal regions and the left-lateralized
   language network in tone languages.}},

Title = {{Amplitude of Sensorimotor Mu Rhythm Is Correlated with BOLD from
   Multiple Brain Regions: A Simultaneous EEG-fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{The mu rhythm is a field oscillation in the similar to 10Hz range over
   the sensorimotor cortex. For decades, the suppression of mu
   (event-related desynchronization) has been used to index movement
   planning, execution, and imagery. Recent work reports that non-motor
   processes, such as spatial attention and movement observation, also
   desynchronize mu, raising the possibility that the mu rhythm is
   associated with the activity of multiple brain regions and systems. In
   this study, we tested this hypothesis by recording simultaneous
   resting-state EEG-fMRI from healthy subjects. Independent component
   analysis (ICA) was applied to extract the mu components. The amplitude
   (power) fluctuations of mu were estimated as a time series using a
   moving-window approach, which, after convolving with a canonical
   hemodynamic response function (HRF), was correlated with
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals from the entire brain. Two
   main results were found. First, mu power was negatively correlated with
   BOLD from areas of the sensorimotor network, the attention control
   network, the putative mirror neuron system, and the network thought to
   support theory of mind. Second, mu power was positively correlated with
   BOLD from areas of the salience network, including anterior cingulate
   cortex and anterior insula. These results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that sensorimotor mu rhythm is associated with multiple brain
   regions and systems. They also suggest that caution should be exercised
   when attempting to interpret mu modulation in terms of a single brain
   network.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a complex
   manifestation of symptoms that include deficits in social interaction
   and repetitive or stereotyped interests and behaviors. In keeping with
   the increasing recognition of the dimensional characteristics of ASD
   symptoms and the categorical nature of a diagnosis, we sought to
   delineate the neural mechanisms of ASD symptoms based on the functional
   connectivity of four known neural networks (i.e., default mode network,
   dorsal attention network, salience network, and executive control
   network).
   METHODS: We leveraged an open data resource (Autism Brain Imaging Data
   Exchange) providing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   data sets from 90 boys with ASD and 95 typically developing boys. This
   data set also included the Social Responsiveness Scale as a dimensional
   measure of ASD traits. Seed-based functional connectivity was paired
   with linear regression to identify functional connectivity abnormalities
   associated with categorical effects of ASD diagnosis, dimensional
   effects of ASD-like behaviors, and their interaction.
   RESULTS: Our results revealed the existence of dimensional mechanisms of
   ASD uniquely affecting each network based on the presence of
   connectivity-behavioral relationships; these were independent of
   diagnostic category. However, we also found evidence of categorical
   differences (i.e., diagnostic group differences) in connectivity
   strength for each network as well as categorical differences in
   connectivity-behavioral relationships (i.e., diagnosis-by-behavior
   interactions), supporting the coexistence of categorical mechanisms of
   ASD.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a hybrid model for ASD
   characterization that includes a combination of categorical and
   dimensional brain mechanisms and provide a novel understanding of the
   neural underpinnings of ASD.}},

Title = {{Ballistocardiogram artifact correction taking into account physiological
   signal preservation in simultaneous EEG-fMRI}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{45-63}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifact is currently one of the most
   challenging in the EEG acquired concurrently with fMRI, with correction
   invariably yielding residual artifacts and/or deterioration of the
   physiological signals of interest. In this paper, we propose a family of
   methods whereby the EEG is decomposed using Independent Component
   Analysis (ICA) and a novel approach for the selection of BCG-related
   independent components (ICs) is used (PROJection onto Independent
   Components, PROJIC). Three ICA-based strategies for BCG artifact
   correction are then explored: 1) BCG-related ICs are removed from the
   back-reconstruction of the EEG (PROJIC); and 2-3) BCG-related ICs are
   corrected for the artifact occurrences using an Optimal Basis Set (OBS)
   or Average Artifact Subtraction (AAS) framework, before back-projecting
   all ICs onto EEG space (PROJIC-OBS and PROJIC-AAS, respectively). A
   novel evaluation pipeline is also proposed to assess the methods
   performance, which takes into account not only artifact but also
   physiological signal removal, allowing for a flexible weighting of the
   importance given to physiological signal preservation. This evaluation
   is used for the group-level parameter optimization of each algorithm on
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI data acquired using two different setups at 3 T
   and 7 T. Comparison with state-of-the-art BCG correction methods showed
   that PROJIC-OBS and PROJIC-AAS outperformed the others when priority was
   given to artifact removal or physiological signal preservation,
   respectively, while both PROJIC-AAS and AAS were in general the best
   choices for intermediate trade-offs. The impact of the BCG correction on
   the quality of event-related potentials (ERPs) of interest was assessed
   in terms of the relative reduction of the standard error (SE) across
   trials: 26/66\%, 32/62\% and 18/61\% were achieved by, respectively,
   PROJIC, PROJIC-OBS and PROJIC-AAS, for data collected at 3 T/7 T.
   Although more significant improvements were achieved at 7 T, the results
   were qualitatively comparable for both setups, which indicate the wide
   applicability of the proposed methodologies and recommendations. (C)

Abstract = {{Touch can be highly emotional, and depending on the environment, it can
   be perceived as pleasant and comforting or disgusting and dangerous.
   Here, we studied the impact of context on the processing of tactile
   stimuli using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm.
   This was achieved by embedding tactile stimulation in a variable
   olfactory environment.
   Twenty people were scanned with BOLD fMRI while receiving the following
   stimulus blocks: Slow stroking Touch, Civette odor (feces like), Rose
   odor, Touch + Civette, and Touch + Rose. Ratings of pleasantness and
   intensity of tactile stimuli and ratings of disgust and intensity of
   olfactory stimuli were collected. The impact of the olfactory context on
   the processing of touch was studied using covariance analyses. Coupling
   between olfactory processing and somatosensory processing areas was
   assessed with psychophysiological interaction analysis (PPI).
   A subjectively disgusting olfactory environment significantly reduced
   the perceived pleasantness of touch. The touch fMRI activation in the
   secondary somatosensory cortex, operculum 1 (OP1), was positively
   correlated with the disgust towards the odors. Decreased pleasantness of
   touch was related to decreased posterior insula activity. PPI analysis
   revealed a significant interaction between the OP1, posterior insula,
   and regions processing the disgust of odors (orbitofrontal cortex and
   amygdala).
   We conclude that the disgust evaluation of the olfactory environment
   moderates neural reactivity in somatosensory regions by upregulation of
   the OP1 and downregulation of the posterior insula. This adaptive
   regulation of affective touch processing may facilitate adaptive
   reaction to a potentially harmful stimulus. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{308}},
Pages = {{38-45}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Social-cognitive processing has been posited to underlie general
   functions such as episodic memory. Episodic memory impairment is a
   recognized hallmark of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) who is
   at a high risk for dementia. Three canonical networks, self-referential
   processing, executive control processing and salience processing, have
   distinct roles in episodic memory retrieval processing. It remains
   unclear whether and how these sub-networks of the episodic memory
   retrieval system would be affected in aMCI. This task -state fMRI study
   constructed systems-level episodic memory retrieval sub-networks in 28
   aMCI and 23 controls using two computational approaches: a multiple
   region-of-interest based approach and a voxel-level functional
   connectivity-based approach, respectively. These approaches produced the
   remarkably similar findings that the self-referential processing network
   made critical contributions to episodic memory retrieval in aMCI. More
   conspicuous alterations in self-referential processing of the episodic
   memory retrieval network were identified in aMCI. In order to complete a
   given episodic memory retrieval task, increases in cooperation between
   the self-referential processing network and other sub-networks were
   mobilized in aMCI. Self-referential processing mediate the cooperation
   of the episodic memory retrieval sub-networks as it may help to achieve
   neural plasticity and may contribute to the prevention and treatment of
   dementia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Very little is known about the neural circuitry underlying
   anger processing among alcoholics. The purpose of this study was to
   examine the altered brain activity of alcoholic individuals during
   transient anger emotion.
   Methods: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 18 male
   patients diagnosed with alcohol dependence in an inpatient alcohol
   treatment facility and 16 social drinkers with similar demographics were
   scanned during the viewing of anger-provoking film clips.
   Results: While there was no significant difference in the level of
   experienced anger between alcohol-dependent patients and non-alcoholic
   controls, significantly greater activation was observed in the bilateral
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the right precentral gyrus
   among alcoholic patients compared to the normal controls.
   Conclusions: In summary, specific brain regions were identified that are
   associated with anger among patients with alcohol dependency.}},

Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with a psychotic disorder are at an increased
   risk of becoming victim of a crime or other forms of aggression.
   Research has revealed several possible risk factors (e.g. impaired
   social cognition, aggression regulation problems, assertiveness,
   self-stigma, self-esteem) for victimization in patients with a psychotic
   disorder. To address these risk factors and prevent victimization, we
   developed a body-oriented resilience training with elements of
   kickboxing: BEATVIC. The present study aims to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the intervention.
   Methods/Design: Seven mental health institutions in the Netherlands will
   participate in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to
   either the BEATVIC training or the control condition: social activation.
   Follow-ups are at 6, 18 and 30 months. Short term effects on risk
   factors for victimization will be examined, since these are direct
   targets of the intervention and are thought to be mediators of
   victimization, the primary outcome of the intervention. The effect on
   victimization will be investigated at follow-up. In a subgroup of
   patients, fMRI scans will be made before and after the intervention
   period in order to assess potential neural changes associated with the
   effects of the training.
   Discussion: This study is the first to examine the effectiveness of an
   intervention targeted at victimization in psychosis. Methodological
   issues of the study are addressed in the discussion of this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Regret and relief are associated with counterfactual thinking and are
   sensitive to various social contexts. In the present fMRI study, we
   investigated the neural basis for regret and relief and how social
   context (following vs. not following advice) modulates them by employing
   a sequential risk-taking task. Participants were asked to open a series
   of boxes consecutively until they decided to stop. Each box contained a
   reward (gold), except for one that contained an adverse stimulus
   (devil), which caused the participant to lose all the gold collected in
   that trial. Before each trial, participants received advice about when
   to stop, which they then chose to follow or not. Behaviorally,
   subjective regret and relief were primarily dependent on the number of
   missed chances and the trade-off between obtained gains and missed
   chances, respectively. Participants felt less regret when they chose not
   to follow the advice than when they did. At the neural level, striatum,
   vmPFC/mOFC, and vACC activations were associated with greater relief.
   Meanwhile, dmPFC and left superior temporal gyrus were associated with
   greater regret. Additionally, dACC showed stronger activation in the
   Not-Follow context than the Follow context. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by

Abstract = {{Internet gaming disorder (IGD) has become a serious mental health issue
   worldwide. Evaluating the benefits of interventions for IGD is of great

   Twenty IGD subjects participated in a group craving behavioral
   intervention (CBI) and were scanned before and after the intervention.
   The remaining 16 IGD subjects did not receive an intervention. The
   results showed that IGD subjects showed decreased amplitude of low
   fluctuation in the orbital frontal cortex and posterior cingulate
   cortex, and exhibited increased resting-state functional connectivity
   between the posterior cingulate cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex, compared with HC subjects. Compared with IGD subjects who did
   not receive the intervention, those receiving CBI demonstrated
   significantly reduced resting-state functional connectivity between the:
   (1) orbital frontal cortex with hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus; and,
   (2) posterior cingulate cortex with supplementary motor area, precentral
   gyrus, and postcentral gyrus. These findings suggest that IGD is
   associated with abnormal resting-state neural activity in
   reward-related, default mode and executive control networks. Thus, the
   CBI may exert effects by reducing interactions between regions within a
   reward-related network, and across the default mode and executive
   control networks.}},

Abstract = {{The human attachment system is activated in situations of danger such as
   potential separation, threats of loss of a significant other and
   potential insecurity on the availability of the attachment figure. To
   date, however, a precise characterization of the neural correlates of
   the attachment system in healthy individuals is lacking. This functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study aims at characterizing the
   distinctive neural substrates activated by the exposure to attachment
   vs. non-attachment scenes. Healthy participants (N = 25) were presented
   scenes from the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP), a
   validated set of standardized attachment-related pictures extended by a
   control picture stimulus set consisting of scenes without
   attachment-related content. When compared to the control neutral
   pictures, attachment scenes activated the inferior parietal lobes
   (IPLs), the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and the anterior medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These areas are associated with reasoning
   about mental representations, semantic memory of social knowledge, and
   social cognition. This neural activation pattern confirms the
   distinctive quality of this stimulus set, and suggests its use as a
   potential neuroimaging probe to assess social cognition/mentalizing
   related to attachment in healthy and clinical populations.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Efficient brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are in need of knowledge
   about the human brain and how it interacts, plays games, and socializes
   with other brains. A breakthrough can be achieved by revealing the micro
   foundations of sociality, an additional component of the utility
   function reflecting the value of contributing to group success derived
   from social identity. Building upon our previous behavioral work, we
   conduct a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   experiments (N=D 10 in the Pilot Study and N=D 15 in the Main Study) to
   measure whether and how sociality alters the functional activation of
   and connectivity between specific systems in the brain. The overarching
   hypothes is of this study is that sociality, even in a minimal form,
   serves as a natural mechanism of sustainable cooperation by fostering
   interaction between brain regions associated with social cognition and
   those related to value calculation. We use group-based manipulations to
   induce varying levels of sociality and compare behavior in two social
   dilemmas: Prisoner's Dilemma and variations of Ultimatum Game. We find
   that activation of the right in ferior frontal gyrus, a region
   previously associated with cognitive control and modulation of the
   valuation system, is correlated with activity in the medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) to agreater degree when participants make economic
   decisions in a game with an acquaintance, high sociality condition,
   compared to a game with a random individual, low sociality condition.
   These initial results suggest a specific biological mechanism through
   which sociality facilitates cooperation, fairness and provision of
   public goods at the cost of individual gain. Future research should
   examine neural dynamics in the brain during the computation of utility
   in the context of strategic games that involve social interaction for a
   larger sample of subjects.}},

   borrowers only significantly follow the herd when mavens advocate
   strategic default, not when they recommend against it.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated a unique way in which adolescent peer influence occurs

   form of social endorsement and potential source of peer influence.
   Adolescents underwent fMRI while viewing photos ostensibly submitted to
   Instagram. They were more likely to like photos depicted with many likes
   than photos with few likes; this finding showed the influence of virtual
   peer endorsement and held for both neutral photos and photos of risky
   behaviors (e.g., drinking, smoking). Viewing photos with many (compared
   with few) likes was associated with greater activity in neural regions
   implicated in reward processing, social cognition, imitation, and
   attention. Furthermore, when adolescents viewed risky photos (as opposed
   to neutral photos), activation in the cognitive-control network
   decreased. These findings highlight possible mechanisms underlying peer

Abstract = {{The amygdala is a complex structure with distinct subregions and
   dissociable functional networks. The laterobasal subregion of the
   amygdala is hypothesized to mediate the presentation and severity of
   autism symptoms, although very little data are available regarding
   amygdala dysfunction at the subregional level. In this study, we
   investigated the relationship between abnormal amygdalar intrinsic
   connectivity, autism symptom severity, and anxiety and depressive
   symptoms. We collected resting state fMRI data on 31 high functioning
   adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder and 38 typically
   developing (TD) controls aged 14-45. Twenty-five participants with ASD
   and 28 TD participants were included in the final analyses. ASD
   participants were administered the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised
   and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Adult participants were
   administered the Beck Depression Inventory II and the Beck Anxiety
   Inventory. Functional connectivity analyses were conducted from three
   amygdalar subregions: centromedial (CM), laterobasal (LB) and
   superficial (SF). In addition, correlations with the behavioral measures
   were tested in the adult participants. In general, the ASD group showed
   significantly decreased connectivity from the LB subregion and increased
   connectivity from the CM and SF subregions compared to the TD group. We
   found evidence that social symptoms are primarily associated with
   under-connectivity from the LB subregion whereas over-connectivity and
   under-connectivity from the CM, SF and LB subregions are related to
   co-morbid depression and anxiety in ASD, in brain regions that were
   distinct from those associated with social dysfunction, and in different
   patterns than were observed in mildly symptomatic TD participants. Our
   findings provide new evidence for functional subregional differences in
   amygdala pathophysiology in ASD. (C) 2015 International Society for

Abstract = {{Maternal depression is associated with increased risk for offspring mood
   and anxiety disorders. One possible impact of maternal depression during
   offspring development is on the emotional autobiographical memory
   system.
   We investigated the neural mechanisms of emotional autobiographical
   memory in adult offspring of mothers with postnatal depression (N = 16)
   compared to controls (N = 21). During fMRI, recordings of participants
   describing one pleasant and one unpleasant situation with their mother
   and with a companion, were used as prompts to re-live the situations.
   Compared to controls we predicted the PND offspring would show: greater
   activation in medial and posterior brain regions implicated in
   autobiographical memory and rumination; and decreased activation in
   lateral prefrontal cortex and decreased connectivity between lateral
   prefrontal and posterior regions, reflecting reduced control of
   autobiographical recall.
   For negative situations, we found no group differences. For positive
   situations with their mothers, PND offspring showed higher activation
   than controls in left lateral prefrontal cortex, right frontal pole,
   cingulate cortex and precuneus, and lower connectivity of right middle
   frontal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, thalamus and lingual gyrus
   with the posterior cingulate.
   Our results are consistent with adult offspring of PND mothers having
   less efficient prefrontal regulation of personally relevant pleasant
   autobiographical memories. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Social well-being represents primarily public phenomena, which is
   crucial for mental and physical health. However, little is known about
   the neural basis of this construct, especially how it is maintained
   during resting state. To explore the neural correlates of social
   well-being, this study correlated the regional fractional amplitude of
   low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) with social well-being of healthy
   individuals. The results revealed that the fALFF in the bilateral
   posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), right anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), right thalamus and right insula positively predicted
   individual differences in social well-being. Furthermore, we
   demonstrated the different role of three pursuits of human well-being
   (i.e., pleasure, meaning and engagement) in these associations.
   Specifically, the pursuits of meaning and engagement, not pleasure
   mediated the effect of the fALFF in right pSTG on social well-being,
   whereas the pursuit of engagement mediated the effect of the fALFF in
   right thalamus on social well-being. Taken together, we provide the
   first evidence that spontaneous brain activity in multiple regions
   related to self-regulatory and social-cognitive processes contributes to
   social well-being, suggesting that the spontaneous activity of the human
   brain reflects the efficiency of social well-being. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recently, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the CAMKK2 gene
   (rs1063843) was found to be associated with lower expression of the gene
   in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and with schizophrenia
   (SCZ) and deficits in working memory and executive function. However,
   the brain mechanism underlying this association is poorly understood. A
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (N = 84 healthy
   volunteers) involving multiple cognitive tasks, including a Stroop task
   (to measure attentional executive control), an N-back task (to measure
   working memory), and a delay discounting task (to measure decision
   making) to identify the brain regions affected by rs1063843 was
   performed. Across all three tasks, it was found that carriers of the
   risk allele consistently exhibited increased activation of the left
   DLPFC. In addition, the risk allele carriers also exhibited increased
   activation of the right DLPFC and the left cerebellum during the Stroop
   task and of the left caudate nucleus during the N-back task. These
   findings helped to elucidate the role of CAMKK2 in cognitive functions
   and in the etiology of SCZ. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{When talkers speak in masking sounds, their speech undergoes a variety
   of acoustic and phonetic changes. These changes are known collectively
   as the Lombard effect. Most behavioural research and neuroimaging
   research in this area has concentrated on the effect of energetic
   maskers such as white noise on Lombard speech. Previous fMRI studies
   have argued that neural responses to speaking in noise are driven by the
   quality of auditory feedback-that is, the audibility of the speaker's
   voice over the masker. However, we also frequently produce speech in the
   presence of informational maskers such as another talker. Here, speakers
   read sentences over a range of maskers varying in their informational
   and energetic content: speech, rotated speech, speech modulated noise,
   and white noise. Subjects also spoke in quiet and listened to the
   maskers without speaking. When subjects spoke in masking sounds, their
   vocal intensity increased in line with the energetic content of the
   masker. However, the opposite pattern was found neurally. In the
   superior temporal gyrus, activation was most strongly associated with
   increases in informational, rather than energetic, masking. This
   suggests that the neural activations associated with speaking in noise
   are more complex than a simple feedback response. (C) 2016 Author(s).

Abstract = {{Children diagnosed with a Disruptive Behavior Disorder (DBD, i.e.
   Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder), especially those
   with psychopathic traits, are at risk of developing persistent and
   severe antisocial behavior. Reduced fear conditioning has been proposed
   to underlie persistent antisocial development. However, we have recently
   shown that both DBD persisters and desisters are characterized by
   increased fear conditioning compared with healthy controls (HCs). In
   this study, we investigated whether brain function during fear
   extinction is associated with DBD subgroup-membership and psychopathic
   traits. Adolescents from a childhood arrestee cohort (mean age 17.6
   years, s.d. 1.4) who met criteria for a DBD diagnosis during previous
   assessments were re-assessed and categorized as persistent DBD (n = 25)
   or desistent DBD ( = 25). Functional MRI during the extinction phase of
   a classical fear-conditioning task was used to compare regional brain
   function between these subgroups and 25 matched controls. Both DBD
   persisters and desisters showed hyperreactivity during fear extinction,
   when compared with HCs. Impulsive-irresponsible psychopathic traits were
   positively associated with responses in the fear neurocircuitry and
   mediated the association between neural activation and group membership.
   These results suggest that fear acquisition and fear extinction deficits
   may provide an endophenotype for an emotionally hyperreactive subtype of
   antisocial development.}},

Abstract = {{People sometimes experience an emotional state known as `nostalgia',
   which involves experiencing predominantly positive emotions while
   remembering autobiographical events. Nostalgia is thought to play an
   important role in psychological resilience. Previous neuroimaging
   studies have shown involvement of memory and reward systems in such
   experiences. However, it remains unclear how these two systems are
   collaboratively involved with nostalgia experiences. Here, we conducted
   a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of healthy females to
   investigate the relationship between memory-reward co-activation and
   nostalgia, using childhood-related visual stimuli. Moreover, we examined
   the factors constituting nostalgia and their neural correlates. We
   confirmed the presence of nostalgia-related activity in both memory and
   reward systems, including the hippocampus (HPC), substantia
   nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), and ventral striatum (VS). We
   also found significant HPC-VS co-activation, with its strength
   correlating with individual `nostalgia tendencies'. Factor analyses
   showed that two dimensions underlie nostalgia: emotional and personal
   significance and chronological remoteness, with the former correlating
   with caudal SN/VTA and left anterior HPC activity, and the latter
   correlating with rostral SN/VTA activity. These findings demonstrate the
   cooperative activity of memory and reward systems, where each system has
   a specific role in the construction of the factors that underlie the
   experience of nostalgia.}},

Abstract = {{Affective prosody is that aspect of speech that conveys a speaker's
   emotional state through modulations in various vocal parameters, most
   prominently pitch. While a large body of research implicates the
   cingulate vocalization area in controlling affective vocalizations in
   monkeys, no systematic test of functional homology for this area has yet
   been reported in humans. In this study, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to compare brain activations when subjects produced
   affective vocalizations in the form of exclamations vs non-affective
   vocalizations with similar pitch contours. We also examined the
   perception of affective vocalizations by having participants make
   judgments about either the emotions being conveyed by recorded affective
   vocalizations or the pitch contours of the same vocalizations.
   Production of affective vocalizations and matched pitch contours
   activated a highly overlapping set of brain areas, including the
   larynx-phonation area of the primary motor cortex and a region of the
   anterior cingulate cortex that is consistent with the macro-anatomical
   position of the cingulate vocalization area. This overlap contradicts
   the dominant view that these areas form two distinct vocal pathways with
   dissociable functions. Instead, we propose that these brain areas are
   nodes in a single vocal network, with an emphasis on pitch modulation as
   a vehicle for affective expression.}},

Abstract = {{Loneliness is a distressing state indicating that one's basic need for
   social connection is not being met. In an effort to satisfy the need for
   social connection, loneliness may increase the processing of social cues
   and desire to connect with others. Yet the neural substrates that
   contribute to the drive for increased connection in response to
   loneliness are not known. The ventral striatum (VS), previously shown to
   increase in response to craving food and other rewarding stimuli, may
   contribute to ``social craving{''} when one is lonely. That is, the VS
   may track one's `hunger' for reconnection much as it tracks hunger for
   food. To examine this, participants reported on their feelings of
   loneliness before undergoing an fMRI scan where they viewed cues of
   potential social reconnection (images of a close other). Consistent with
   the hypothesis that loneliness stems from an unmet need for connection,
   loneliness was associated with reduced feelings of connection with the
   close other. Furthermore, greater reported loneliness was associated
   with increased VS activity to viewing a close other (vs stranger).
   Results extend the current literature by showing that lonely individuals
   show increased activity in reward-related regions to their closest loved
   ones, possibly reflecting an increased desire for social connection.}},

Abstract = {{Externalizing proneness, or trait disinhibition, is a concept relevant
   to multiple high-impact disorders involving impulsive-aggressive
   behavior. Its mechanisms remain disputed: major models posit
   hyperresponsive reward circuitry or heightened threat-system reactivity
   as sources of disinhibitory tendencies. This study evaluated alternative
   possibilities by examining relations between trait disinhibition and
   brain reactivity during preparation for and processing of visual
   affective stimuli. Forty females participated in a functional
   neuroimaging procedure with stimuli presented in blocks containing
   either pleasurable or aversive pictures interspersed with neutral, with
   each picture preceded by a preparation signal. Preparing to view
   elicited activation in regions including nucleus accumbens, whereas
   visual regions and bilateral amygdala were activated during viewing of
   emotional pictures. High disinhibition predicted reduced nucleus
   accumbens activation during preparation within pleasant/neutral picture
   blocks, along with enhanced amygdala reactivity during viewing of
   pleasant and aversive pictures. Follow-up analyses revealed that the
   augmented amygdala response was related to reduced preparatory
   activation. Findings indicate that participants high in disinhibition
   are less able to process implicit cues and mentally prepare for upcoming
   stimuli, leading to limbic hyperreactivity during processing of actual
   stimuli. This outcome is helpful for integrating findings from studies
   suggesting reward-system hyperreactivity and others suggesting
   threat-system hyperreactivity as mechanisms for externalizing proneness.}},

Abstract = {{With congruent stimulation of one's limb together with a fake
   counterpart, an illusory self-attribution of the fake limb can be
   induced. Such illusions have brought profound insights into the
   cognitive and neuronal mechanisms underlying temporary changes in body
   representation, but to put them in perspective, they need to be compared
   with ownership as experienced for one's real body. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the neuronal correlates of
   touch under different degrees of body ownership. Participants' left and
   right arms were stimulated either alone or together with a fake
   counterpart while this stimulation was synchronous, ambiguous or
   asynchronous. Synchronous stimulation induced illusory fake arm
   ownership, but the brain still differentiated between touch to one's
   real arm and to an illusory `owned' arm: the degree of arm ownership was
   encoded positively by activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and
   lateral occipitotemporal cortex and negatively in the temporoparietal
   cortex. Conversely, the ventral premotor cortex responded more strongly
   to synchronous stimulation compared with asynchronous stimulation and
   with real arm only stimulation. These results offer new insights into
   the differential representation of the real body vs a body that is
   temporarily self-attributed following the resolution of multisensory

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{People can conceptualize the same action (e.g. `riding a bike') at
   different levels of abstraction (LOA), where higher LOAs specify the
   abstract motives that explain why the action is performed (e.g. `getting
   exercise'), while lower LOAs specify the concrete steps that indicate
   how the action is performed (e.g. `gripping handlebars'). Prior
   neuroimaging studies have shown that why and how questions about actions
   differentially activate two cortical networks associated with
   mental-state reasoning and action representation, respectively; however,
   it remains unknown whether this is due to the differential demands of
   the questions per se or to the shifts in LOA those questions produce. We
   conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants
   judged pairs of action phrases that varied in LOA and that could be
   framed either as a why question (Why ride a bike? Get exercise.) or a
   how question (How to get exercise? Ride a bike.). Question framing (why
   vs how) had no effect on activity in regions of the two networks.
   Instead, these regions uniquely tracked parametric variation in LOA,
   both across and within trials. This suggests that the human capacity to
   understand actions at different LOA is based in the relative activity of
   two cortical networks.}},

Abstract = {{Action observation leads to a representation of both the motor aspect of
   an observed action (motor simulation) and its somatosensory consequences
   (action-based somatosensory simulation) in the observer's brain. In the
   current electroencephalography-study, we investigated the neuronal
   interplay of action-based somatosensory simulation and felt touch. We
   presented index or middle finger tapping movements of a human or a
   wooden hand, while simultaneously presenting `tap-like' tactile
   sensations to either the corresponding or non-corresponding fingertip of
   the participant. We focused on an early stage of somatosensory
   processing {[}P50, N100 and N140 sensory evoked potentials (SEPs)] and
   on a later stage of higher-order processing (P3-complex). The results
   revealed an interaction effect of animacy and congruency in the early
   P50 SEP and an animacy effect in the N100/N140 SEPs. In the P3-complex,
   we found an interaction effect indicating that the influence of
   congruency was larger in the human than in the wooden hand. We argue
   that the P3-complex may reflect higher-order self-other distinction by
   signaling simulated action-based touch that does not match own tactile
   information. As such, the action-based somatosensory congruency paradigm
   might help understand higher-order social processes from a somatosensory
   point of view.}},

Abstract = {{Most of daily life hums along peacefully but provocations tip the
   balance toward aggression. Negative feelings are often invoked to
   explain why people lash out after an insult. Yet people might retaliate
   because provocation makes aggression hedonically rewarding. To test this
   alternative hypothesis, 69 participants underwent functional
   neuroimaging while they completed a behavioral aggression task that
   repeatedly manipulated whether aggression was preceded by an instance of
   provocation or not. After provocation, greater activity in the nucleus
   accumbens (NAcc) (a brain region reliably associated with reward) during
   aggressive decisions predicted louder noise blasts administered in
   retaliation. Greater NAcc activation was also associated with
   participants' history of real-world violence. Functional connectivity
   between the NAcc and a regulatory region in the lateral prefrontal
   cortex related to lower retaliatory aggression. These findings suggest
   that provocation tips the neural balance towards hedonic reward, which
   fosters retaliatory aggression. Although such pleasure of inflicting
   pain may promote retaliatory aggression, self-regulatory processes can
   keep such aggressive urges at bay. Implications for theory and violence
   reduction are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The testing effect refers to superior retention when study
   is followed by a test rather than followed by another study. Most
   research to date on why the testing effect occurs has been behavioral,
   but we employed neuroimaging methods in this study in order to shed
   light on the underlying processes. Methods: Subjects were scanned while
   studying, restudying, and taking cued-recall tests of word pairs (with
   no feedback). We analyzed the BOLD responses by back sorting the
   encoding and test trials based on whether the subsequent test was
   correct or incorrect. We compared the subsequent memory patterns in
   initial study, restudy, and test trials. Results: Overall, brain
   activity during test trials was a better predictor of later performance
   than brain activity during restudy trials. For test trials, we
   separately examined brain regions associated with the retrieval attempt
   process during successful retrieval and regions associated with the
   re-encoding process during retrieval in terms of prediction of
   subsequent memory. Regions associated with retrieval attempts were found
   to always predict subsequent memory success (the greater the activation,
   the more likely the correct recall); however, the regions associated
   with re-encoding would sometimes predict subsequent failure,
   specifically when subjects had correctly recalled the associated word
   several times already. Conclusions: These results suggest that whether a
   testing effect advantage is observed depends on both on the retrieval
   process and the re-encoding process which follows that retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{Resting state brain networks are implicated in a variety of relevant
   brain functions. Importantly, abnormal patterns of functional
   connectivity (FC) have been reported in several neurodevelopmental
   disorders. In particular, the Default Mode Network (DMN) has been found
   to be associated with social cognition. We hypothesize that the DMN may
   be altered in Williams syndrome (WS), a neurodevelopmental genetic
   disorder characterized by an unique cognitive and behavioral phenotype.
   In this study, we assessed the architecture of the DMN using fMRI in WS
   patients and typically developing matched controls (sex and age) in
   terms of FC and volumetry of the DMN. Moreover, we complemented the
   analysis with a functional connectome approach. After excluding
   participants due to movement artifacts (n=3), seven participants with WS
   and their respective matched controls were included in the analyses. A
   decreased FC between the DMN regions was observed in the WS group when
   compared with the typically developing group. Specifically, we found a
   decreased FC in a posterior hub of the DMN including the precuneus,
   calcarine and the posterior cingulate of the left hemisphere. The
   functional connectome approach showed a focalized and global increased
   FC connectome in the WS group. The reduced FC of the posterior hub of
   the DMN in the WS group is consistent with immaturity of the brain FC
   patterns and may be associated with the singularity of their visual
   spatial phenotype.}},

Title = {{Affective responses to dance}},
Journal = {{ACTA PSYCHOLOGICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{168}},
Pages = {{91-105}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The objective of the present work was the characterization of mechanisms
   by which affective experiences are elicited in observers when watching
   dance movements. A total of 203 dance stimuli from a normed stimuli
   library were used in a series of independent experiments. The following
   measures were obtained: (i) subjective measures of 97 dance-naive
   participants' affective responses (Likert scale ratings, interviews);
   and (ii) objective measures of the physical parameters of the stimuli
   (motion energy, luminance), and of the movements represented in the
   stimuli (roundedness, impressiveness). Results showed that (i)
   participants' ratings of felt and perceived affect differed, (ii) felt
   and perceived valence but not arousal ratings correlated with physical
   parameters of the stimuli (motion energy and luminance), (iii)
   roundedness in posture shape was related to the experience of more
   positive emotion than edgy shapes (1 of 3 assessed rounded shapes showed
   a clear effect on positiveness ratings while a second reached trend
   level significance), (iv) more impressive movements resulted in more
   positive affective responses, (v) dance triggered affective experiences
   through the imagery and autobiographical memories it elicited in some
   people, and (vi) the physical parameters of the video stimuli correlated
   only weakly and negatively with the aesthetics ratings of beauty, liking
   and interest. The novelty of the present approach was twofold; (i) the
   assessment of multiple affect-inducing mechanisms, and (ii) the use of
   one single normed stimulus set. The results from this approach lend
   support to both previous and present findings. Results are discussed
   with regards to current literature in the field of empirical aesthetics
   and affective neuroscience. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Hemispheric involvement in the processing of Chinese idioms: An fMRI
   study}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{12-24}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Although the left hemisphere is believed to handle major language
   functions, the role of the right hemisphere in language comprehension
   remains controversial. Recently researchers have investigated
   hemispheric language processing with figurative language materials
   (e.g., metaphors, jokes, and idioms). The current study capitalizes on
   the pervasiveness and distinct features of Chinese idioms to examine the
   brain mechanism of figurative language processing. Native Chinese
   speakers performed a non-semantic task while reading opaque idioms,
   transparent idioms, and non-idiomatic literal phrases. Whole-brain
   analyses indicated strong activations for all three conditions in an
   overlapping brain network that includes the bilateral inferior/middle
   frontal gyrus and the temporo-parietal and occipital-temporal regions.
   The two idiom conditions elicited additional activations in the right
   superior parietal lobule and right precuneus. Item-based modulation
   analyses further demonstrated that activation amplitudes in the right
   angular gyrus, right superior parietal lobule and right precuneus, as
   well as left inferior temporo-occipital cortex, are negatively
   correlated with the semantic transparency of the idioms. These results
   suggest that both hemispheres are involved in idiom processing but they
   play different roles. Implications of the findings are discussed in
   light of theories of figurative language processing and hemispheric
   functions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The role of prosody and context in sarcasm comprehension: Behavioral and
   fMRI evidence}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{74-84}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{A hearer's perception of an utterance as sarcastic depends on
   integration of the heard statement, the discourse context, and the
   prosody of the utterance, as well as evaluation of the incongruity among
   these aspects. The effect of prosody in sarcasm comprehension is evident
   in everyday conversation, but little is known about its underlying
   mechanism or neural substrates. To elucidate the neural underpinnings of
   sarcasm comprehension in the auditory modality, we conducted a
   functional MRI experiment with 21 adult participants. The participants
   were provided with a short vignette in which a child had done either a
   good or bad deed, about which a parent made a positive comment. The
   participants were required to judge the degree of the sarcasm in the
   parent's positive comment (praise), which was accompanied by either
   positive or negative affective prosody. The behavioral data revealed
   that an incongruent combination of utterance and the context (i.e., the
   parent's positive comment on a bad deed by the child) induced perception
   of sarcasm. There was a significant interaction between context and
   prosody: sarcasm perception was enhanced when positive prosody was used
   in the context of a bad deed or, vice versa, when negative prosody was
   used in the context of a good deed. The corresponding interaction effect
   was observed in the rostro-ventral portion of the left inferior frontal
   gyrus corresponding to Brodmann's Area (BA) 47. Negative prosody
   incongruent with a positive utterance (praise) activated the bilateral
   insula extending to the right inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate
   cortex, and brainstem. Our findings provide evidence that the left
   inferior frontal gyrus, particularly BA 47, is involved in integration
   of discourse context and utterance with affective prosody in the
   comprehension of sarcasm. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Volume = {{87}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Adolescents are particularly sensitive to peer influence. This may
   partly be due to an increased salience of peers during adolescence. We
   investigated the effect of being observed by a peer on a cognitively
   challenging task, relational reasoning, which requires the evaluation
   and integration of multiple mental representations. Relational reasoning
   tasks engage a fronto-parietal network including the inferior parietal
   cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, dorsolateral and rostrolateral
   prefrontal cortices. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   peer audience effects on activation in this fronto-parietal network were
   compared in a group of 19 female mid-adolescents (aged 14-16 years) and
   14 female adults (aged 23-28 years). Adolescent and adult relational
   reasoning accuracy was influenced by a peer audience as a function of
   task difficulty: the presence of a peer audience led to decreased
   accuracy in the complex, relational integration condition in both groups
   of participants. The fMRI results demonstrated that a peer audience
   differentially modulated activation in regions of the fronto-parietal
   network in adolescents and adults. Activation was increased in
   adolescents in the presence of a peer audience, while this was not the
   case in adults. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback can reduce

Abstract = {{It has been shown that in alcoholic patients, alcohol-related cues
   produce increased activation of reward-related brain regions like the
   ventral striatum (VS), which has been proposed as neurobiological basis
   of craving. Modulating this activation might be a promising option in
   the treatment of alcohol addiction. One approach might be real-time
   functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI NF). This
   study was set up to implement and evaluate a rtfMRI approach in a group
   of non-addicted heavy social drinkers. Thirty-eight heavy drinking
   students were assigned to a real feedback group (rFB, n=13), a yoke
   feedback group (yFB, n=13) and a passive control group (noFB, n=12).
   After conducting a reward task as functional localizer to identify
   ventral striatal regions, the participants viewed alcohol cues during
   three NF training blocks in a 3T MRI scanner. The rFB group received
   feedback from their own and the yFB from another participants' VS. The
   noFB group received no feedback. The rFB and the yFB groups were
   instructed to downregulate the displayed activation. Activation of the
   VS and prefrontal control regions was compared between the groups. We
   found significant downregulation of striatal regions specifically in the
   rFB group. While the rFB and the yFB groups showed significant
   activation of prefrontal regions during feedback, this activation was
   only correlated to the reduction of striatal activation in the rFB
   group. We conclude that rtfMRI NF is a suitable method to reduce
   striatal activation to alcohol cues. It might be a promising supplement
   to the treatment of alcoholic patients.}},

   an Emerging Research Field}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{In bioethics, the first decade of the twenty-first century was
   characterized by the emergence of interest in the ethical, legal, and
   social aspects of neuroscience research. At the same time an ongoing
   extension of the topics and phenomena addressed by neuroscientists was
   observed alongside its rise as one of the leading disciplines in the
   biomedical science. One of these phenomena addressed by neuroscientists
   and moral psychologists was the neural processes involved in moral
   decision-making. Today both strands of research are often addressed
   under the label of neuroethics. To understand this development we
   recalled literature from 1995 to 2012 stored in the Mainz Neuroethics
   Database (i) to investigate the quantitative development of scientific
   publications in neuroethics; (ii) to explore changes in the topics of
   neuroethics research within the defined time interval; (iii) to
   illustrate the interdependence of different research topics within the
   neuroethics literature; (iv) to show the development of the distribution
   of neuroethics research on peer-reviewed journals; and (v) to display
   the academic background and affiliations of neuroethics researchers. Our
   analysis exposes that there has been a demonstrative increase of
   neuroethics research while the issues addressed under this label had
   mostly been present before the establishment of the field. We show that
   the research on the ethical, legal and social aspects of neuroscience
   research is hardly related to neuroscience research on moral
   decision-making and that the academic backgrounds and affiliations of
   many neuroethics researchers speak for a very close entanglement of
   neuroscience and neuroethics. As our article suggests that after more
   than one decade there still is no dominant agenda for the future of
   neuroethics research, it calls for more reflection about the theoretical
   underpinnings and prospects to establish neuroethics as a marked-off
   research field distinct from neuroscience and the diverse branches of
   bioethics.}},

Title = {{Salience Network Connectivity in Autism Is Related to Brain and
   Behavioral Markers of Sensory Overresponsivity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The salience network, an intrinsic brain network thought to
   modulate attention to internal versus external stimuli, has been
   consistently found to be atypical in autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
   However, little is known about how this altered resting-state
   connectivity relates to brain activity during information processing,
   which has important implications for understanding sensory
   overresponsivity (SOR), a common and impairing condition in ASD related
   to difficulty downregulating brain responses to sensory stimuli. This
   study examined how SOR in youth with ASD relates to atypical salience
   network connectivity and whether these atypicalities are associated with
   abnormal brain response to basic sensory information.
   Method: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine how
   parent-rated SOR symptoms related to salience network connectivity in 61
   youth (aged 8-17 years; 28 with ASD and 33 IQ-matched typically
   developing youth). Correlations between resting-state salience network
   connectivity and brain response to mildly aversive tactile and auditory
   stimuli were examined.
   Results: SOR in youth with ASD was related to increased resting-state
   functional connectivity between salience network nodes and brain regions
   implicated in primary sensory processing and attention. Furthermore, the
   strength of this connectivity at rest was related to the extent of brain
   activity in response to auditory and tactile stimuli.
   Conclusion: Results support an association between intrinsic brain
   connectivity and specific atypical brain responses during information
   processing. In addition, findings suggest that basic sensory information
   is overly salient to individuals with SOR, leading to overattribution of
   attention to this information. Implications for intervention include
   incorporating sensory coping strategies into social interventions for
   individuals with SOR.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   experiments to investigate the neural underpinnings of knowledge and
   misperception of lyrics. In fMRI experiment 1, a linear relationship
   between familiarity with lyrics and activation was found in
   left-hemispheric speech-related as well as bilateral striatal areas
   which is in line with previous research on generation of lyrics. In fMRI
   experiment 2, we employed so called Mondegreens and Soramimi to induce
   misperceptions of lyrics revealing a bilateral network including middle
   temporal and inferior frontal areas as well as anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) and mediodorsal thalamus. ACC activation also correlated with the
   extent to which misperceptions were judged as amusing corroborating
   previous neuroimaging results on the role of this area in mediating the
   pleasant experience of chills during music perception. Finally, we
   examined the areas engaged during misperception of lyrics using
   diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to determine their structural
   connectivity. These combined fMRI/DWI results could serve as a
   neurobiological model for future studies on other types of
   misunderstanding which are events with potentially strong impact on our
   social life. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Symbolic artifacts present a challenge to theories of neurocognitive
   processing due to their hybrid nature: they are at the same time
   physical objects and vehicles of intangible social meanings. While their
   physical properties can be read of their perceptual appearance, the
   meaning of symbolic artifacts depends on the perceiver's interpretative
   attitude and embeddedness in cultural practices. In this study,
   participants built models of LEGO bricks to illustrate their
   understanding of abstract concepts. They were then scanned with fMRI
   while presented to photographs of their own and others' models. When
   participants attended to the meaning of the models in contrast to their
   bare physical properties, we observed activations in mPFC and TPJ, areas
   often associated with social cognition, and IFG, possibly related to
   semantics. When contrasting own and others' models, we also found
   activations in precuneus, an area associated with autobiographical
   memory and agency, while looking at one's own collective models yielded
   interaction effects in rostral ACC, right IFG and left Insula.
   Interestingly, variability in the insula was predicted by individual
   differences in participants' feeling of relatedness to their fellow
   group members during LEGO construction activity. Our findings support a
   view of symbolic artifacts as neurocognitive trails of human social
   interactions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{132-141}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Happiness is one of the most fundamental human goals, which has led
   researchers to examine the source of individual happiness. Happiness has
   usually been discussed regarding two aspects (a temporary positive
   emotion and a trait-like long-term sense of being happy) that are
   interrelated; for example, individuals with a high level of trait-like
   subjective happiness tend to rate events as more pleasant. In this
   study, we hypothesized that the interaction between the two aspects of
   happiness could be explained by the interaction between structure and
   function in certain brain regions. Thus, we first assessed the
   association between gray matter density (GMD) of healthy participants
   and trait-like subjective happiness using voxel-based morphometry (VBM).
   Further, to assess the association between the GMD and brain function,
   we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the task
   of positive emotion induction (imagination of several emotional life
   events). VBM indicated that the subjective happiness was positively
   correlated with the GMD of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC).
   Functional MRI demonstrated that experimentally induced temporal happy
   feelings were positively correlated with subjective happiness level and
   rACC activity. The rACC response to positive events was also positively
   correlated with its GMD. These results provide convergent structural and
   functional evidence that the rACC is related to happiness and suggest
   that the interaction between structure and function in the rACC may
   explain the trait-state interaction in happiness. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{How do human brains integrate content with social context in
   communication? Recent research demonstrates that the perceived
   communicative embedding of perceptually identical language messages
   alters their cortical processing. When emotional trait-adjectives are
   perceived as human-generated personality feedback, event-related brain
   potentials are considerably larger than when the same adjectives are
   perceived as random computer-generated feedback. Here, we investigate
   the unique role of ascribed sender humanness for the underlying neural
   mechanisms. Participants were told that they were going to receive
   written positive, negative, or neutral feedback from an unknown stranger
   or from a socially intelligent computer system while high-density EEG
   was recorded. In the event-related potential (ERP), feedback from the
   `human sender' elicited larger P2, Early Posterior Negativity (EPN), P3,
   and Late Positive Potential (LPP) components. The sources of this
   activity were localized in extended visual cortex, but also in the right
   superior frontal gyri, related to mentalizing about others, and the
   bilateral postcentral gyri implicated in embodied language processing.
   For emotional feedback, larger EPN, P3 and LPP amplitudes were also
   observed, resulting from enhanced activity in visual and temporal
   regions. Finally, for the EPN an interaction between sender and emotion
   was found, showing substantially increased visual processing of
   human-generated emotional feedback. These data confirm visual
   amplification effects induced by motivated attention but crucially also
   reveal distinct effects of perceiving a communication partner as human
   that activate `social brain' structures. Obviously who is perceived as
   saying something can be as relevant as what is said and induce specific
   brain activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of training and transfer effects in working memory in
   older adults}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{236-249}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{As indicated by previous research, aging is associated with a decline in
   working memory (WM) functioning, related to alterations in
   fronto-parietal neural activations. At the same time, previous studies
   showed that WM training in older adults may improve the performance in
   the trained task (training effect), and more importantly, also in
   untrained WM tasks (transfer effects). However, neural correlates of
   these transfer effects that would improve understanding of its
   underlying mechanisms, have not been shown in older participants as yet.
   In this study, we investigated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
   signal changes during n-back performance and an untrained delayed
   recognition (Sternberg) task following 12 sessions (45 min each) of
   adaptive n-back training in older adults. The Sternberg task used in
   this study allowed to test for neural training effects independent of
   specific task affordances of the trained task and to separate
   maintenance from updating processes. Thirty-two healthy older
   participants (60-75 years) were assigned either to an n-back training or
   a no-contact control group. Before (t1) and after (t2) training/waiting
   period, both the n-back task and the Sternberg task were conducted while
   BOLD signal was measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   (fMRI) in all participants. In addition, neuropsychological tests were
   performed outside the scanner. WM performance improved with training and
   behavioral transfer to tests measuring executive functions, processing
   speed, and fluid intelligence was found. In the training group, BOLD
   signal in the right lateral middle frontal gyrus/caudal superior frontal
   sulcus (Brodmann area, BA 6/8) decreased in both the trained n-back and
   the updating condition of the untrained Sternberg task at t2, compared
   to the control group. fMRI findings indicate a training-related increase
   in processing efficiency of WM networks, potentially related to the
   process of WM updating. Performance gains in untrained tasks suggest
   that transfer to other cognitive tasks remains possible in aging. (C)

Title = {{Mindful attention to breath regulates emotions via increased

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{305-313}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Mindfulness practice is beneficial for emotion regulation; however, the
   neural mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood. The
   current study focuses on effects of attention-to-breath (ATB) as a basic
   mindfulness practice on aversive emotions at behavioral and brain
   levels. A key finding across different emotion regulation strategies is
   the modulation of amygdala and prefrontal activity. It is unclear how
   ATB relevant brain areas in the prefrontal cortex integrate with
   amygdala activation during emotional stimulation. We proposed that,
   during emotional stimulation, ATB down-regulates activation in the
   amygdala and increases its integration with prefrontal regions. To
   address this hypothesis, 26 healthy controls were trained in
   mindfulness-based attention-to-breath meditation for two weeks and then
   stimulated with aversive pictures during both attention-to-breath and
   passive viewing while undergoing fMRI. Data were controlled for
   breathing frequency. Results indicate that (1) ATB was effective in
   regulating aversive emotions. (2) Left dorso-medial prefrontal cortex
   was associated with ATB in general. (3) A fronto-parietal network was
   additionally recruited during emotional stimulation. (4) ATB down
   regulated amygdala activation and increased amygdala-prefrontal
   integration, with such increased integration being associated with
   mindfulness ability. Results suggest amygdala-dorsal prefrontal cortex
   integration as a potential neural pathway of emotion regulation by
   mindfulness practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to understand the perspectives,
   mental states and beliefs of others in order to anticipate their
   behaviour and is therefore crucial to social interactions. Although fMRI
   has been widely used to establish the neural networks implicated in ToM,
   little is known about the timing of ToM-related brain activity. We used
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the neural processes underlying
   ToM, as MEG provides very accurate timing and excellent spatial
   localization of brain processes. We recorded MEG activity during a false
   belief task, a reliable measure of ToM, in twenty young adults (10
   females). MEG data were recorded in a 151 sensor CTF system (MISL,
   Coquitlam, BC) and data were co-registered to each participant's MRI
   (Siemens 3T) for source reconstruction. We found stronger right
   temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) activations in the false belief
   condition from 150 ms to 225 ms, in the right precuneus from 275 ms to
   375 ms, in the right inferior frontal gyrus from 200 ms to 300 ms and
   the superior frontal gyrus from 300 ms to 400 ms. Our findings extend
   the literature by demonstrating the timing and duration of neural
   activity in the main regions involved in the ``mentalizing{''} network,
   showing that activations related to false belief in adults are
   predominantly right lateralized and onset around 100 ms. The sensitivity
   of MEG will allow us to determine spatial and temporal differences in
   the brain processes in ToM in younger populations or those who
   demonstrate deficits in this ability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{The differential effect of trigeminal vs. peripheral pain stimulation on
   visual processing and memory encoding is influenced by pain-related fear}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{386-395}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Compared to peripheral pain, trigeminal pain elicits higher levels of
   fear, which is assumed to enhance the interruptive effects of pain on
   concomitant cognitive processes. In this fMRI study we examined the
   behavioral and neural effects of trigeminal (forehead) and peripheral
   (hand) pain on visual processing and memory encoding. Cerebral activity
   was measured in 23 healthy subjects performing a visual categorization
   task that was immediately followed by a surprise recognition task.
   During the categorization task subjects received concomitant noxious
   electrical stimulation on the forehead or hand. Our data show that fear
   ratings were significantly higher for trigeminal pain. Categorization
   and recognition performance did not differ between pictures that were
   presented with trigeminal and peripheral pain. However, object
   categorization in the presence of trigeminal pain was associated with
   stronger activity in task-relevant visual areas (lateral occipital
   complex, LOC), memory encoding areas (hippocampus and parahippocampus)
   and areas implicated in emotional processing (amygdala) compared to
   peripheral pain. Further, individual differences in neural activation
   between the trigeminal and the peripheral condition were positively
   related to differences in fear ratings between both conditions.
   Functional connectivity between amygdala and LOC was increased during
   trigeminal compared to peripheral painful stimulation. Fear-driven
   compensatory resource activation seems to be enhanced for trigeminal
   stimuli, presumably due to their exceptional biological relevance. (C)

Abstract = {{Activation of the sympathetic nervous systemis essential for coping with
   environmental stressors such as fearful stimuli. Recent human imaging
   studies demonstrated that activity in some cortical regions, such as the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula cortex (aIC), is
   related to sympathetic activity. However, little is known about the
   functional brain connectivity related to sympathetic response to fearful
   stimuli. The participants were 32 healthy, right-handed volunteers.
   Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to examine brain
   activity when watching horror and control movies. Fingertip temperature
   was taken during the scanning as a measure of sympathetic response. The
   movies were watched a second time, and the degree of fear (9-point
   Likert-type scale) was evaluated every three seconds. The brain activity
   of the ACC, bilateral aIC, and bilateral anterior prefrontal cortex
   (aPFC) was correlated with the change rate of fingertip temperature,
   with or without fearful stimuli. Functional connectivity analysis
   revealed significantly greater positive functional connectivity between
   the amygdala and the ACC and between the amygdala and the aIC when
   watching the horror movie than when watching the control movie.
   Whole-brain psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed
   that the functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the ACC
   was modulated according to the fear rating. Our results indicate that
   the increased functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the
   ACC represents a sympathetic response to fearful stimuli. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Oxytocin receptor polymorphism and childhood social experiences shape
   adult personality, brain structure and neural correlates of mentalizing}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{134}},
Pages = {{671-684}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The oxytocin system is involved in human social behavior
   and social cognition such as attachment, emotion recognition and
   mentalizing (i.e. the ability to represent mental states of oneself and
   others). It is shaped by social experiences in early life, especially by
   parent-infant interactions. The single nucleotid polymorphism rs53576 in
   the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene has been linked to social behavioral
   phenotypes.
   Method: In 195 adult healthy subjects we investigated the interaction of
   OXTR rs53576 and childhood attachment security (CAS) on the personality
   traits ``adult attachment style{''} and ``alexithymia{''} (i.e.
   emotional self-awareness), on brain structure (voxel-based morphometry)
   and neural activation (fMRI) during an interactive mentalizing paradigm
   (prisoner's dilemma game; subgroup: n = 163).
   Results: We found that in GG-homozygotes, but not in A-allele carriers,
   insecure childhood attachment is - in adulthood -associated with a)
   higher attachment-related anxiety and alexithymia, b) higher brain gray
   matter volume of left amygdala and lower volumes in right superior
   parietal lobule (SPL), left temporal pole (TP), and bilateral frontal
   regions, and c) higher mentalizing-related neural activity in bilateral
   TP and precunei, and right middle and superior frontal gyri. Interaction
   effects of genotype and CAS on brain volume and/ or function were
   associated with individual differences in alexithymia and
   attachment-related anxiety. Interactive effects were in part sexually
   dimorphic.
   Conclusion: The interaction of OXTR genotype and CAS modulates adult
   personality as well as brain structure and function of areas implicated
   in salience processing and mentalizing. Rs53576 GG-homozygotes are
   partially more susceptible to childhood attachment experiences than
   A-allele carriers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging has shown promise as a tool to predict likelihood of
   treatment response in adult anxiety disorders, with potential
   implications for clinical decision-making. Despite the relatively high
   prevalence and emergence of anxiety disorders in youth, very little work
   has evaluated neural predictors of response to treatment. The goal of
   the current study was to examine brain function during emotional face
   processing as a predictor of response to treatment in children and
   adolescents (age 7-19 years; N = 41) with generalized, social, and/or
   separation anxiety disorder. Prior to beginning treatment with the
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline or cognitive
   behavior therapy (CBT), participants completed an emotional faces
   matching task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Whole
   brain responses to threatening (ie, angry and fearful) and happy faces
   were examined as predictors of change in anxiety severity following
   treatment. Greater activation in inferior and superior frontal gyri,
   including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex, as well as precentral/postcentral gyri during processing of
   threatening faces predicted greater response to CBT and SSRI treatment.
   For processing of happy faces, activation in postcentral gyms was a
   significant predictor of treatment response. Post-hoc analyses indicated
   that effects were not significantly moderated by type of treatment.
   Findings suggest that greater activation in prefrontal regions involved
   in appraising and regulating responses to social signals of threat
   predict better response to SSRI and CBT treatment in anxious youth and
   that neuroimaging may be a useful tool for predicting how youth will
   respond to treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been suggested as a promising
   pharmacological agent for medication-enhanced psychotherapy in
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) because of its anxiolytic and
   prosocial properties. We therefore investigated the behavioral and
   neurobiological effects of a single intranasal OT administration (40 IU)
   in PTSD patients. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled,
   cross-over resting-state fMRI study in male and female police officers
   with (n = 37, 21 males) and without PTSD (n = 40, 20 males). We
   investigated OT administration effects on subjective anxiety and
   functional connectivity of basolateral (BLA) and centromedial (CeM)
   amygdala subregions with prefrontal and salience processing areas. In
   PTSD patients, OT administration resulted in decreased subjective
   anxiety and nervousness. Under placebo, male PTSD patients showed
   diminished right CeM to left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
   connectivity compared with male trauma-exposed controls, which was
   reinstated after OT administration. Additionally, female PTSD patients
   showed enhanced right BLA to bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (dACC) connectivity compared with female trauma-exposed controls, which
   was dampened after OT administration. Although caution is warranted, our
   findings tentatively suggest that OT has the potential to diminish
   anxiety and fear expression of the amygdala in PTSD, either via
   increased control of the vmPFC over the CeM (males) or via decreased
   salience processing of the dACC and BLA (females). Our findings add to
   accumulating evidence that OT administration could potentially enhance
   treatment response in PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{It is unclear if and how exogenous oxytocin (OT) reaches the brain to
   improve social behavior and cognition and what is the optimal dose for
   OT response. To better understand the delivery routes of intranasal OT
   administration to the brain and the dose-response, we compared amygdala
   response to facial stimuli by means of functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) in four treatment conditions, including two different
   doses of intranasal OT using a novel Breath Powered device, intravenous
   (IV) OT, which provided similar concentrations of blood plasma OT, and
   placebo. We adopted a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, crossover
   design, with 16 healthy male adults administering a single-dose of these
   four treatments. We observed a treatment effect on right amygdala
   activation during the processing of angry and happy face stimuli, with
   pairwise comparisons revealing reduced activation after the 8IU low dose
   intranasal treatment compared to placebo. These data suggest the
   dampening of amygdala activity in response to emotional stimuli occurs
   via direct intranasal delivery pathways rather than across the
   blood-brain barrier via systemically circulating OT. Trial registration:

Abstract = {{Humans display a strong tendency to make spontaneous inferences
   concerning the thoughts and intentions of others. Although this ability
   relies upon the concerted effort of multiple brain regions, the dorsal
   medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) is most closely associated with the
   ability to reason about other people's mental states and form
   impressions of their character. Here, we investigated this region's
   putative social category preference using fMRI as 34 participants
   engaged in uninstructed viewing of a complex naturalistic stimulus.
   Using a data-driven ``reverse correlation{''} approach, we characterize
   the DMPFC's stimulus response profile from ongoing neural responses to a
   dynamic movie stimulus. Results of this analysis demonstrate that the
   DMPFC's response profile is dominated by the presence of scenes
   involving social interactions between characters. Subsequent content
   analysis of video clips created from this response profile confirmed
   this finding. In contrast, regions of the inferotemporal and parietal
   cortex were selectively tuned to faces and actions, both features that
   often covary with social interaction but may be difficult to disentangle
   using standard event-related approaches. Together, these findings
   suggest that the DMPFC is finely tuned for processing social interaction
   above other categories and that this preference is maintained during
   unrestricted viewing of complex natural stimuli such as movies.}},

Title = {{Disentangling the autism - anxiety overlap: fMRI of reward processing in
   a community-based longitudinal study}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Up to 40\% of youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also suffer from
   anxiety, and this comorbidity is linked with significant functional
   impairment. However, the mechanisms of this overlap are poorly
   understood. We investigated the interplay between ASD traits and anxiety
   during reward processing, known to be affected in ASD, in a community
   sample of 1472 adolescents (mean age = 14.4 years) who performed a
   modified monetary incentive delay task as part of the Imagen project.
   Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses to reward anticipation and
   feedback were compared using a 2x2 analysis of variance test (ASD
   traits: low/high; anxiety symptoms: low/high), controlling for plausible
   covariates. In addition, we used a longitudinal design to assess whether
   neural responses during reward processing predicted anxiety at 2-year
   follow-up. High ASD traits were associated with reduced BOLD responses
   in dorsal prefrontal regions during reward anticipation and negative
   feedback. Participants with high anxiety symptoms showed increased
   lateral prefrontal responses during anticipation, but decreased
   responses following feedback. Interaction effects revealed that youth
   with combined ASD traits and anxiety, relative to other youth, showed
   high right insula activation when anticipating reward, and low
   right-sided caudate, putamen, medial and lateral prefrontal activations
   during negative feedback (all clusters P-FWE < 0.05). BOLD activation
   patterns in the right dorsal cingulate and right medial frontal gyrus
   predicted new-onset anxiety in participants with high but not low ASD
   traits. Our results reveal both quantitatively enhanced and
   qualitatively distinct neural correlates underlying the comorbidity
   between ASD traits and anxiety. Specific neural responses during reward
   processing may represent a risk factor for developing anxiety in ASD
   youth.}},

Abstract = {{Unpredictability about upcoming emotional events disrupts our ability to
   prepare for them and ultimately results in anxiety. Here, we
   investigated how attention modulates the neural responses to
   unpredictable emotional events. Brain activity was recorded using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while participants
   performed a variation of the emotional task. Behaviorally, we reported a
   fear-unpredictable effect and a happy-unpredictable effect. The fMRI
   results showed increased activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (dIPFC) for unpredictable fear faces (Experiment 1) and decreased
   activity in the left dIPFC for unpredictable happy faces (Experiment 2)
   when these faces were unattended, probably reflecting that
   unpredictability amplifies the negative impact of fear faces and reduces
   the positive impact of happy faces. More importantly, it was found that
   the right dIPFC activity to unpredictable fear faces was diminished
   (Experiment 1) and the left dIPFC activity to unpredictable happy faces
   was enhanced (Experiment 2) when these faces were attended. These
   results suggest that attention may contribute to reducing the
   unpredictability about future emotional events.}},

   Phonological Processing for Chinese Character Reading}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Visual word recognition involves mappings among orthographic,
   phonological, and semantic codes. In alphabetic languages, it is hard to
   disentangle the effects of these codes, because orthographically well
   formed words are typically pronounceable, confounding orthographic and
   phonological processes, and orthographic cues to meaning are rare, and
   where they occur are morphological, confounding orthographic and
   semantic processes. In Chinese character recognition, it is possible to
   explore orthography to phonology (O-P) and orthography to semantics
   (O-S) processes independently by taking advantage of the distinct
   phonetic and semantic components in Chinese phonograms. We analyzed data
   from an fMRI experiment using lexical decision for Chinese characters to
   explore the sensitivity of areas associated with character recognition
   to orthographic, phonological, and semantic processing. First, a
   correlation approach was used to identify regions associated with
   reaction time, frequency, consistency and visual complexity. Then, these
   ROIs were examined for their responses to stimuli with different types
   of information available. These results revealed two neural pathways,
   one for O-S processing relying on left middle temporal gyrus and angular
   gyrus, and the other for O-P processing relying on inferior frontal
   gyrus and insula. The two neural routes form a shared neural network
   both for real and pseudo characters, and their cooperative division of
   labor reflects the neural basis for processing different types of
   characters. Results are broadly consistent with findings from alphabetic
   languages, as predicted by reading models that assume the same general
   architecture for logographic and alphabetic scripts.}},

Abstract = {{The neural processes giving rise tohumanmemorystrength signals remain
   poorly understood. Inspired by formal computational models that posit a
   central role of global matching in memory strength, we tested a novel
   hypothesis that the strengths of both true and false memories arise from
   the global similarity of an item's neural activation pattern during
   retrieval to that of all the studied items during encoding (i.e., the
   encoding-retrieval neural global pattern similarity {[}ER-nGPS]). We
   revealed multiple ER-nGPS signals that carried distinct information and
   contributed differentially to true and false memories: Whereas the
   ER-nGPS in the parietal regions reflected semantic similarity and was
   scaled with the recognition strengths of both true and false memories,
   ER-nGPS in the visual cortex contributed solely to true memory.
   Moreover, ER-nGPS differences between the parietal and visual cortices
   were correlated with frontal monitoring processes. By combining
   computational and neuroimaging approaches, our results advance a
   mechanistic understanding of memory strength in recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Humor is crucial in human social interactions. To study the underlying
   neural processes, three comedy clips were shown twice to 20 volunteers
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Inter-subject
   similarities in humor ratings, obtained immediately after fMRI,
   explained inter-subject correlation of hemodynamic activity in right
   frontal pole and in a number of other brain regions. General linear
   model analysis also indicated activity in right frontal pole, as well as
   in additional cortical areas and subcortically in striatum, explained by
   humorousness. The association of the right frontal pole with experienced
   humorousness is a novel finding, which might be related to humor
   unfolding over longer time scales in the movie clips. Specifically,
   frontal pole has been shown to exhibit longer temporal receptive windows
   than, e.g., sensory areas, which might have enabled processing of humor
   in the clips based on holding information and reinterpreting that in
   light of new information several (even tens of) seconds later. As
   another novel finding, medial and lateral prefrontal areas, frontal
   pole, posterior-inferior temporal areas, posterior parietal areas,
   posterior cingulate, striatal structures and amygdala showed reduced
   activity upon re-viewing of the clips, suggesting involvement in
   processing of humor related to novelty of the comedic events.}},

Title = {{Neurobiological differences in mental rotation and instrument
   interpretation in airline pilots}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Airline pilots and similar professions require reliable spatial
   cognition abilities, such as mental imagery of static and moving
   three-dimensional objects in space. A well-known task to investigate
   these skills is the Shepard and Metzler mental rotation task (SMT),
   which is also frequently used during pre-assessment of pilot candidates.
   Despite the intuitive relationship between real-life spatial cognition
   and SMT, several studies have challenged its predictive value. Here we
   report on a novel instrument interpretation task (IIT) based on a
   realistic attitude indicator used in modern aircrafts that was designed
   to bridge the gap between the abstract SMT and a cockpit environment. We
   investigated 18 professional airline pilots using fMRI. No significant
   correlation was found between SMT and IIT task accuracies. Contrasting
   both tasks revealed higher activation in the fusiform gyrus, angular
   gyrus, and medial precuneus for IIT, whereas SMT elicited significantly
   stronger activation in pre- and supplementary motor areas, as well as
   lateral precuneus and superior parietal lobe. Our results show that SMT
   skills per se are not sufficient to predict task accuracy during (close
   to) real-life instrument interpretation. While there is a substantial
   overlap of activation across the task conditions, we found that there
   are important differences between instrument interpretation and
   non-aviation based mental rotation.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to exert self-control is key to social insertion and
   professional success. An influential literature in psychology has
   developed the theory that self-control relies on a limited common
   resource, so that fatigue effects might carry over from one task to the
   next. However, the biological nature of the putative limited resource
   and the existence of carry-over effects have been matters of
   considerable controversy. Here, we targeted the activity of the lateral
   prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a common substrate for cognitive control,
   and we prolonged the time scale of fatigue induction by an order of
   magnitude. Participants performed executive control tasks known to
   recruit the LPFC (working memory and task-switching) over more than 6 h
   (an approximate workday). Fatigue effects were probed regularly by
   measuring impulsivity in intertemporal choices, i.e., the propensity to
   favor immediate rewards, which has been found to increase under LPFC
   inhibition. Behavioral data showed that choice impulsivity increased in
   a group of participants who performed hard versions of executive tasks
   but not in control groups who performed easy versions or enjoyed some
   leisure time. Functional MRI data acquired at the start, middle, and end
   of the day confirmed that enhancement of choice impulsivity was related
   to a specific decrease in the activity of an LPFC region (in the left
   middle frontal gyrus) that was recruited by both executive and choice
   tasks. Our findings demonstrate a concept of focused neural fatigue that
   might be naturally induced in real-life situations and have important
   repercussions on economic decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The primary motor cortex (M1) is traditionally implicated in voluntary
   movement control. In order to test the hypothesis that there is a
   functional topography of M1 activation in studies where it has been
   implicated in higher cognitive tasks we performed
   activation-likelihood-estimation (ALE) meta-analyses of functional
   neuroimaging experiments reporting M1 activation in relation to six
   cognitive functional categories for which there was a sufficient number
   of studies to include, namely motor imagery, working memory, mental
   rotation, social/ernotion/empathy, language, and auditory processing.
   The six categories activated different sub-sectors of M1, either
   bilaterally or lateralized to one hemisphere. Notably, the activations
   found in the M1 of the left or right hemisphere detected in our study
   were unlikely due to button presses. In fact, all contrasts were
   selected in order to eliminate M1 activation due to activity related to
   the finger button press. In addition, we identified the M1 sub-region of
   Area 4a commonly activated by 4/6 categories, namely motor imagery and
   working memory, emotion/empathy, and language. Overall, our findings
   lend support to the idea that there is a functional topography of M1
   activation in studies where it has been found activated in higher
   cognitive tasks and that the left Area 4a can be involved in a number of
   cognitive processes, likely as a product of implicit mental simulation
   processing.}},

Title = {{Differing Connectivity of Exner's Area for Numbers and Letters}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing body of evidence indicating a crucial role of Exner's
   area in (hand-) writing symbolic codes such as letters and words.
   However, a recent study reported a patient with a lesion affecting
   Broca's and Exner's area, who suffered from severe peripheral agraphia
   for letters but not for Arabic digits. The authors suggested a
   speculative account postulating differential connectivity of Exner's
   area for numbers and letters in order to explain this dissociation. In
   the present study, we evaluated this account, employing atlas-based
   tractography for the patient's anatomy, deterministic fiber-tracking as
   well as an automated toolkit to investigate the connectivity of Exner's
   area in healthy adults. In particular, fiber pathways connecting Exner's
   area with areas associated with language processing (e.g., the arcuate
   fascicle, ventral pathways encompassing the external/extreme capsule
   system) reached the inferior part of Exner's area, while fronto-parietal
   fibers (e.g., the superior longitudinal fascicle) connected the upper
   part of Exner's area with the intraparietal sulcus typically involved in
   number processing. Our results substantiated the differential
   connectivity account for Exner's area by identifying the neural
   connections between fiber tracts and cortex areas of interest. Our data
   strongly suggest that white matter connectivity should be taken into
   account when investigating the neural underpinnings of impaired and
   intact human cognition.}},

Abstract = {{The functional organization of human medial frontal cortex (MFC) is a
   subject of intense study. Using fMRI, the MFC has been associated with
   diverse psychological processes, including motor function, cognitive
   control, affect, and social cognition. However, there have been few
   large-scale efforts to comprehensively map specific psychological
   functions to subregions of medial frontal anatomy. Here we applied a
   meta-analytic data-driven approach to nearly 10,000 fMRI studies to
   identify putatively separable regions of MFC and determine which
   psychological states preferentially recruit their activation. We
   identified regions at several spatial scales on the basis of
   meta-analytic coactivation, revealing three broad functional zones along
   a rostrocaudal axis composed of 2-4 smaller subregions each.
   Multivariate classification analyses aimed at identifying the
   psychological functions most strongly predictive of activity in each
   region revealed a tripartite division within MFC, with each zone
   displaying a relatively distinct functional signature. The posterior
   zone was associated preferentially with motor function, the middle zone
   with cognitive control, pain, and affect, and the anterior with reward,
   social processing, and episodic memory. Within each zone, the more
   fine-grained subregions showed distinct, but subtler, variations in
   psychological function. These results provide hypotheses about the
   functional organization of medial prefrontal cortex that can be tested
   explicitly in future studies.}},

   pain intensity in out-of-sample individuals. Critically, each pattern
   was at chance in predicting the other experience, demonstrating separate
   modifiability of both patterns. Somatotopy (upper versus lower limb:
   93\% accuracy for both conditions) was also distinct, located in
   somatosensory versus mentalizing-related circuits for somatic and
   vicarious pain, respectively. Two additional studies demonstrated the
   generalizability of the somatic pain pattern (which was originally
   developed on thermal pain) to mechanical and electrical pain, and also
   demonstrated the replicability of the somatic/vicarious dissociation.
   These findings suggest possible mechanisms underlying limitations in
   feeling others' pain, and present new, more specific, brain targets for
   studying pain empathy.}},

Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{The neurohormone oxytocin (OXT) has been found to mediate the regulation
   of complex socioemotional cognition in multiple ways both in humans and
   other animals. Recent studies have investigated the effects of OXT in
   different levels of analysis (from genetic to behavioral) chiefly
   targeting its impact on the social component and only indirectly
   indicating its implications in other components of our socio-interactive
   abilities. This article aims at shedding light onto how OXT might be
   modulating the multimodality that characterizes our higher-order
   linguistic abilities (vocal-auditory-attentional-memory-social systems).
   Based on evidence coming from genetic, EEG, fMRI, and behavioral
   studies, I attempt to establish the promises of this perspective with
   the goal of stressing the need for neuropeptide treatments to enter
   clinical practice.}},

Title = {{Doubt in the Insula: Risk Processing in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Extensive cleaning or checking of patients with obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OCD) are often interpreted as strategies to avoid harm and as
   an expression of the widespread belief that OCD patients are more
   risk-averse. However, despite its clinical significance, the neural
   basis of risk attitude in OCD is unknown. Here, we investigated neural
   activity during risk processing using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging and simultaneously assessed risk attitude using a separate
   behavioral paradigm in OCD patients with different symptoms versus
   healthy controls (HCs). We found opposite insula responses to high
   versus low risk in OCD patients compared to HCs: a positive correlation
   between insula activity and risk-aversion in patients versus a negative
   correlation in controls. Although OCD patients overall were not more
   risk-averse than controls, there were differences between subgroups of
   OCD patients: patients with doubt/checking symptoms were more
   risk-averse than other patients. Taken together, OCD patients show a
   reversed pattern of risk processing by the insula compared to HCs.
   Moreover, the data suggest that increased activation of the insula
   signals an abnormal urge to avoid risks in the subpopulation of OCD
   patients with doubt and checking symptoms. These results indicate a role
   for the insula in excessive risk-avoidance relevant to OCD.}},

Title = {{Characterization of Face-Selective Patches in Orbitofrontal Cortex}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 14}},
Abstract = {{Face processing involves a complex, multimodal brain network. While
   visual-perceptual face patches in posterior parts of the brain have been
   studied for over a decade, the existence and properties of
   face-selective regions in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a relatively new
   area of research. While regions of OFC are implicated in the emotional
   processing of faces, this is typically interpreted as a domain-general
   response to affective value rather than a face- or socially-specific
   response. However, electrophysiology studies in monkeys have identified
   neurons in OFC that respond more to faces than any other stimuli. Here,
   we characterize the prevalence and location of OFC face-selective
   regions in 20 healthy college students. We did this by including another
   biologically motivating category (appetizing foods) in a variant of the
   standard face localizer. Results show that face-selective patches can be
   identified at the individual level. Furthermore, in both a region of
   interest (ROI) and a whole brain analysis, medial regions of the OFC
   were face-selective, while lateral regions were responsive to faces and
   foods, indicating a domain-general response in lateral OFC. Medial OFC
   (mOFC) response to faces scales in relationship to a measure of social
   motivation that is distinct from face processing abilities associated
   with fusiform cortex.}},

Title = {{Group cognitive behavioral therapy modulates the resting-state
   functional connectivity of amygdala-related network in patients with
   generalized social anxiety disorder}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Amygdala is considered as the core pathogenesis of
   generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD). However, it is still unclear
   whether effective group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could
   modulate the function of amygdala-related network. We aimed to examine
   the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the amygdala before
   and after group CBT.
   Methods: Fifteen patients with GSAD were scanned on a 3T MR system
   before and after 8 weeks of group CBT. For comparison, nineteen healthy
   control participants also underwent baseline fMRI scanning. We used
   bilateral amygdala as seed regions and the rsFC maps of the right and
   left amygdala were created separately in a voxel-wise way. Clusters
   survived two-tailed Gaussian Random Field (GRF) correction at p < 0.05
   (voxel z value > 2.3).
   Results: Compared with baseline, patients with CBT showed significantly
   decreased connectivity of the left amygdala with the right putamen, the
   left dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the right dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Especially, the changes of the
   connectivity between the left amygdala and the dACC positively
   correlated with changes of the anxiety symptom in patients. Furthermore,
   in relative to controls, patients showed higher connectivity of left
   amygdala with dmPFC and dACC at baseline, while normal after CBT.
   Conclusions: Short-term group CBT could down-regulate the abnormal
   higher connectivity of prefrontal-amygdala network, along with clinical
   improvement. This may provide a potential biomarker to monitor the
   treatment effect of CBT in GSAD patients.}},

   Multivoxel Pattern Analysis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Observing the style of an action done by others allows the observer to
   understand the cognitive state of the agent. This information has been
   defined by Stern ``vitality forms{''}. Previous experiments showed that
   the dorso-central insula is selectively active both during vitality form
   observation and execution. In the present study, we presented
   participants with videos showing hand actions performed with different
   velocities and asked them to judge either their vitality form (gentle,
   neutral, rude) or their velocity (slow, medium, fast). The aim of the
   present study was to assess, using multi-voxel pattern analysis, whether
   vitality forms and velocities of observed goal-directed actions are
   differentially processed in the insula, and more specifically whether
   action velocity is encoded per se or it is an element that triggers
   neural populations of the insula encoding the vitality form. The results
   showed that, consistently across subjects, in the dorsocentral sector of
   the insula there were voxels selectively tuned to vitality forms, while
   voxel tuned to velocity were rare. These results indicate that the
   dorso-central insula, which previous data showed to be involved in the
   vitality form processing, contains voxels specific for the action style
   processing.}},

Title = {{Resting State Functional Connectivity MRI among Spectral MEG Current
   Sources in Children on the Autism Spectrum}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Social and communicative impairments are among the core symptoms of
   autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and a great deal of evidence supports
   the notion that these impairments are associated with aberrant
   functioning and connectivity of various cortical networks. The present
   study explored the links between sources of MEG amplitude in various
   frequency bands and functional connectivity MRI in the resting state.
   The goal of combining these modalities was to use sources of neural
   oscillatory activity, measured with MEG, as functionally relevant seed
   regions for a more traditional pairwise fMRI connectivity analysis. We
   performed a seed-based connectivity analysis on resting state fMRI data,
   using seed regions derived from frequency-specific amplitude sources in
   resting state MEG data in the same nine subjects with ASD (10-17 years
   of age). We then compared fMRI connectivity among these
   MEG-source-derived regions between participants with autism and
   typically developing, age-matched controls. We used a source modeling
   technique designed for MEG data to detect significant amplitude sources
   in six frequency bands: delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz),
   beta (12-30 Hz), low gamma (30-60 Hz), and high gamma (60-120 Hz).
   MEG-derived source maps for each participant were co-registered in
   standard MNI space, and group-level source maps were obtained for each
   frequency. For each frequency band, the 10 largest clusters resulting
   from these t-tests were used as regions of interest (ROls) for the fMRI
   functional connectivity analysis. Pairwise BOLD signal correlations were
   obtained between each pair of these ROls for each frequency band. Each
   pairwise correlation was compared between the ASD and TD groups using
   t-tests. We also constrained these pairwise correlations to known
   network structures, resulting in a follow-up set of correlation matrices
   specific to each network we considered. Frequency-specific MEG sources
   had distinct patterns of fMRI resting state functional connectivity in
   the ASD group, but perhaps the most significant was a finding of
   hypoconnectivity between many sources of low and high gamma activity.
   These novel findings suggest that in ASD there are differences in
   functionally defined networks as shown in previous fMRI studies, as well
   as between sets of regions defined by magnetoencephalographic neural

Title = {{Testosterone during Puberty Shifts Emotional Control from Pulvinar to

Abstract = {{Increased limbic and striatal activation in adolescence has been
   attributed to a relative delay in the maturation of prefrontal areas,
   resulting in the increase of impulsive reward-seeking behaviors that are
   often observed during puberty. However, it remains unclear whether and
   how this general developmental pattern applies to the control of social
   emotional actions, a fundamental adult skill refined during adolescence.
   This domain of control pertains to decisions involving emotional
   responses. When faced with a social emotional challenge (e.g., an angry
   face), we can follow automatic response tendencies and avoid the
   challenge or exert control over those tendencies by selecting an
   alternative action. Using an fMRI-adapted social approach-avoidance
   task, this study identifies how the neural regulation of emotional
   action control changes as a function of human pubertal development in
   14-year-old adolescents (n = 47). Pubertal maturation, indexed by
   testosterone levels, shifted neural regulation of emotional actions from
   the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus and the amygdala to the anterior
   prefrontal cortex (aPFC). Adolescents with more advanced pubertal
   maturation showed greater aPFC activity when controlling their emotional
   action tendencies, reproducing the same pattern consistently observed in
   adults. In contrast, adolescents of the same age, but with less advanced
   pubertal maturation, showed greater pulvinar and amygdala activity when
   exerting similarly effective emotional control. These findings qualify
   how, in the domain of social emotional actions, executive control shifts
   from subcortical to prefrontal structures during pubertal development.
   The pulvinar and the amygdala are suggested as the ontogenetic
   precursors of the mature control system centered on the anterior
   prefrontal cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers from multiple fields have sought to understand how sex
   moderates human social behavior. While over 50 years of research has
   revealed differences in cooperation behavior of males and females, the
   underlying neural correlates of these sex differences have not been
   explained. A missing and fundamental element of this puzzle is an
   understanding of how the sex composition of an interacting dyad
   influences the brain and behavior during cooperation. Using fNIRS-based
   hyperscanning in 111 same- and mixed-sex dyads, we identified
   significant behavioral and neural sex-related differences in association
   with a computer-based cooperation task. Dyads containing at least one
   male demonstrated significantly higher behavioral performance than
   female/female dyads. Individual males and females showed significant
   activation in the right frontopolar and right inferior prefrontal
   cortices, although this activation was greater in females compared to
   males. Female/female dyad's exhibited significant inter-brain coherence
   within the right temporal cortex, while significant coherence in
   male/male dyads occurred in the right inferior prefrontal cortex.
   Significant coherence was not observed in mixed-sex dyads. Finally, for
   same-sex dyads only, task-related inter-brain coherence was positively
   correlated with cooperation task performance. Our results highlight
   multiple important and previously undetected influences of sex on
   concurrent neural and behavioral signatures of cooperation.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Being in a social world requires an understanding of other people that
   is co-determined in its meaning by the situation at hand. Therefore, we
   investigated the underlying neural activation occurring when we
   encounter someone acting in angry or joyful situation. We hypothesized a
   dynamic interplay between the right insula, both involved in mapping
   visceral states associated with emotional experiences and autonomic
   control, and the bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG), part of the
   `social brain', when facing angry vs. joyful situations. Twenty
   participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   scanning session while watching video clips of actors grasping objects
   in joyful and angry situations. The analyses of functional connectivity,
   psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM),
   all revealed changes in functional connectivity associated with the
   angry situation. Indeed, the DCM model showed that the modulatory effect
   of anger increased the ipsilateral forward connection from the right
   insula to the right STG, while it suppressed the contralateral one. Our
   findings reveal a critical role played by the right insula when we are
   engaged in angry situations. In addition, they suggest that facing angry
   people modulates the effective connectivity between these two nodes
   associated, respectively, with autonomic responses and bodily movements
   and human-agent motion recognition. Taken together, these results add
   knowledge to the current understanding of hierarchical brain network for
   social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) is characterised by a disregard
   for social obligations and callous unconcern for the feelings of others.
   Studies have demonstrated that ASPD is associated with abnormalities in
   brain regions and aberrant functional connectivity. In this paper,
   topological organisation was examined in resting-state fMRI data
   obtained from 32 ASPD patients and 32 non-ASPD controls. The
   frequency-dependent functional networks were constructed using
   wavelet-based correlations over 90 brain regions. The topology of the
   functional networks of ASPD subjects was analysed via graph theoretical
   analysis. Furthermore, the abnormal functional connectivity was
   determined with a network-based statistic (NBS) approach. Our results
   revealed that, compared with the controls, the ASPD patients exhibited
   altered topological configuration of the functional connectome in the
   frequency interval of 0.016-0.031 Hz, as indicated by the increased
   clustering coefficient and decreased betweenness centrality in the
   medial superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, Rolandic operculum,
   superior parietal gyrus, angular gyrus, and middle temporal pole. In
   addition, the ASPD patients showed increased functional connectivity
   mainly located in the default-mode network. The present study reveals an
   aberrant topological organisation of the functional brain network in
   individuals with ASPD. Our findings provide novel insight into the
   neuropathological mechanisms of ASPD.}},

Abstract = {{Movement sequencing difficulties are part of the neurological soft signs
   (NSS), they have high clinical value because they are not always present
   in schizophrenia. We investigated the neuronal correlates of movement
   sequencing in 24 healthy controls and 24 schizophrenia patients, with
   (SZP SQ+) or without (SZP SQ-) sequencing difficulties. We characterized
   simultaneous and lagged functional connectivity between brain regions
   involved in movement sequencing using psychophysiological interaction
   (PPI) and the Granger causality modeling (GCM), respectively. Left
   premotor cortex (PMC) and superior parietal lobule (SPL) were
   specifically activated during sequential movements in all participants.
   Right PMC and precuneus, ipsilateral to the hand executing the task,
   activated during sequential movements only in healthy controls and SZP
   SQ-. SZP SQ+ showed hyper-activation in contralateral PMC, as compared
   to the other groups. PPI analysis revealed a deficit in inhibitory
   connections within this fronto-parietal network in SZP SQ+ during
   sequential task. GCM showed a significant lagged effective connectivity
   from right PMC to left SPL during task and rest periods in all groups
   and from right PMC to right precuneus in SZP SQ+ group only. Both SZP
   groups had a significant lagged connectivity from right to left PMC,
   during sequential task. Our results indicate that aberrant
   fronto-parietal network connectivity with cortical inhibition deficit
   and abnormal reliance on previous network activity are related to
   movement sequencing in SZP. The overactivation of motor cortex seems to
   be a good compensating strategy, the hyperactivation of parietal cortex
   is linked to motor deficit symptoms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A major open question is whether computational strategies thought to be
   used during experiential learning, specifically model-based and
   model-free reinforcement learning, also support observational learning.
   Furthermore, the question of how observational learning occurs when
   observers must learn about the value of options from observing outcomes
   in the absence of choice has not been addressed. In the present study we
   used a multi-armed bandit task that encouraged human participants to
   employ both experiential and observational learning while they underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found evidence for the
   presence of model-based learning signals during both observational and
   experiential learning in the intraparietal sulcus. However, unlike
   during experiential learning, model-free learning signals in the ventral
   striatum were not detectable during this form of observational learning.
   These results provide insight into the flexibility of the model-based
   learning system, implicating this system in learning during observation
   as well as from direct experience, and further suggest that the
   model-free reinforcement learning system may be less flexible with
   regard to its involvement in observational learning.}},

Abstract = {{The neurobiological mechanisms that underlie facial affect recognition
   deficits after traumatic brain injury (TBI) have not yet been
   identified. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), study
   aims were to 1) determine if there are differences in brain activation
   during facial affect processing in people with TBI who have facial
   affect recognition impairments (TBI-I) relative to people with TBI and
   healthy controls who do not have facial affect recognition impairments
   (TBI-N and HC, respectively); and 2) identify relationships between
   neural activity and facial affect recognition performance. A facial
   affect recognition screening task performed outside the scanner was used
   to determine group classification; TBI patients who performed greater
   than one standard deviation below normal performance scores were
   classified as TBI-I, while TBI patients with normal scores were
   classified as TBI-N. An fMRI facial recognition paradigm was then
   performed within the 3T environment. Results from 35 participants are
   reported (TBI-I=11, TBI-N=12, and HC=12). For the fMRI task, TBI-I and
   TBI-N groups scored significantly lower than the HC group. Blood
   oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals for facial affect recognition
   compared to a baseline condition of viewing a scrambled face, revealed
   lower neural activation in the right fusiform gyrus (FG) in the TBI-I
   group than the HC group. Right fusiform gyrus activity correlated with
   accuracy on the facial affect recognition tasks (both within and outside
   the scanner). Decreased FG activity suggests facial affect recognition
   deficits after TBI may be the result of impaired holistic face
   processing. Future directions and clinical implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety disorders are characterized by hyperactivity in both the
   amygdala and the anterior insula. Interventions that normalize activity
   in these areas may therefore be effective in treating anxiety disorders.
   Recently, there has been significant interest in the potential use of
   oxytocin (OT), as well as vasopressin (AVP) antagonists, as treatments
   for anxiety disorders. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled,
   pharmaco-fMRI study, 153 men and 151 women were randomized to treatment
   with either 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP, or placebo and
   imaged with fMRI as they played the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game
   with same-sex human and computer partners. In men, OT attenuated the
   fMRI response to unreciprocated cooperation (CD), a negative social
   interaction, within the amygdala and anterior insula. This effect was
   specific to interactions with human partners. In contrast, among women,
   OT unexpectedly attenuated the amygdala and anterior insula response to
   unreciprocated cooperation from computer but not human partners. Among
   women, AVP did not significantly modulate the response to unreciprocated
   cooperation in either the amygdala or the anterior insula. However,
   among men, AVP attenuated the BOLD response to CD outcomes with human
   partners across a relatively large cluster including the amygdala and
   the anterior insula, which was contrary to expectations. Our results
   suggest that OT may decrease the stress of negative social interactions
   among men, whereas these effects were not found in women interacting
   with human partners. These findings support continued investigation into
   the possible efficacy of OT as a treatment for anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work on the neural underpinnings of emotional conflict
   processing has largely focused on designs that instruct participants to
   ignore a distracter which conflicts with a target. In contrast, this
   study investigated the noninstructed experience and evaluation of an
   emotional conflict, where positive or negative cues can be subjectively
   prioritized. To this end, healthy participants freely watched short film
   scenes that evoked emotional conflicts while their BOLD responses were
   measured. Participants' individual ratings of conflict and valence
   perception during the film scenes were collected immediately afterwards,
   and the individual ratings were regressed against the BOLD data. Our
   analyses revealed that (a) amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex were
   significantly involved in prioritizing positive or negative cues, but
   not in subjective evaluations of conflict per se, and (b) superior
   temporal sulcus (STS) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL), which have
   been implicated in social cognition and emotion control, were involved
   in both prioritizing positive or negative cues and subjectively
   evaluating conflict, and may thus constitute ``hubs{''} or
   ``switches{''} in emotional conflict processing. Psychophysiological
   interaction (PPI) analyses further revealed stronger functional
   connectivity between IPL and ventral prefrontal-medial parietal areas in
   prioritizing negative cues, and stronger connectivity between STS and
   dorsal-rostral prefrontal-medial parietal areas in prioritizing positive
   cues. In sum, our results suggest that IPL and STS are important in the
   subjective evaluation of complex conflicts and influence valence
   prioritization via prefrontal and parietal control centers. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Depression is linked to increased amygdala activation to neutral and
   negatively valenced facial expressions. Amygdala activation may be
   predictive of changes in depressive symptoms over time. However, most
   studies in this area have focused on small, predominantly female and
   homogenous clinical samples. Studies are needed to examine how amygdala
   reactivity relates to the course of depressive symptoms dimensionally,
   prospectively and in populations diverse in gender, race and
   socioeconomic status. A total of 156 men from predominately low-income
   backgrounds completed an fMRI task where they viewed emotional facial
   expressions. Left and right amygdala reactivity to neutral, but not
   angry or fearful, facial expressions relative to a non-face baseline at
   age 20 predicted greater depressive symptoms 2 years later, controlling
   for age 20 depressive symptoms. Heightened bilateral amygdala reactivity
   to neutral facial expressions predicted increases in depressive symptoms
   2 years later in a large community sample. Neutral facial expressions
   are affectively ambiguous and a tendency to interpret these stimuli
   negatively may reflect to cognitive biases that lead to increases in
   depressive symptoms over time. Individual differences in amygdala
   reactivity to neutral facial expressions appear to identify those at
   most risk for a more problematic course of depressive symptoms across

Abstract = {{Current neural models of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) and anxiety
   disorders suggest hyperactivation of amygdala in anxiety, but
   hypoactivation of amygdala in ASD. The objectives of this study were to
   ( i) test the hypothesis that amygdala activity measured by functional
   magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) represents a hybrid signal of
   opposing social functions and anxiety symptoms, and ( ii) determine
   whether longstanding findings of decreased amygdala activation in ASD
   apply only to those individuals with ASD and low levels of anxiety.
   During fMRI scanning, 81 youth with ASD and 67 non-ASD control
   participants completed a face recognition paradigm that elicits robust
   amygdala activation. Only individuals with ASD and low anxiety levels (
   a subsample of 28 participants) showed decreased amygdala activation
   relative to controls. In the ASD group, anxiety symptoms were positively
   correlated with amygdala activity across the full ASD group, whereas
   core ASD symptoms ( including social deficits) were negatively
   correlated. Results indicate that hypoactivation of amygdala in ASD, a
   suggestive finding first reported nearly 20 years ago, can be masked by
   comorbid anxiety-thus bringing enhanced clarity to this line of work.
   Amygdala activity represents a hybrid signal of emotion and social
   processes that cannot be reduced to either alone.}},

Abstract = {{Social stratification has important implications for health and
   well-being, with individuals lower in standing in a hierarchy
   experiencing worse outcomes than those higher up the social ladder.
   Separate lines of past research suggest that alterations in inflammatory
   processes and neural responses to threat may link lower social status
   with poorer outcomes. This study was designed to bridge these
   literatures to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms linking
   subjective social status and inflammation. Thirty-one participants
   reported their subjective social status, and underwent a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging scan while they were socially evaluated.
   Participants also provided blood samples before and after the stressor,
   which were analysed for changes in inflammation. Results showed that
   lower subjective social status was associated with greater increases in
   inflammation. Neuroimaging data revealed lower subjective social status
   was associated with greater neural activity in the dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex ( DMPFC) in response to negative feedback. Finally,
   results indicated that activation in the DMPFC in response to negative
   feedback mediated the relation between social status and increases in
   inflammatory activity. This study provides the first evidence of a
   neurocognitive pathway linking subjective social status and
   inflammation, thus furthering our understanding of how social
   hierarchies shape neural and physiological responses to social
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A unique feature of adolescent social re-orientation is heightened
   sensitivity to peer influence when taking risks. However, positive peer
   influence effects are not yet well understood. The present fMRI study
   tested a novel hypothesis, by examining neural correlates of prosocial
   peer influence on donation decisions in adolescence. Participants ( age
   12-16 years; N - 61) made decisions in anonymous groups about the
   allocation of tokens between themselves and the group in a public goods
   game. Two spectator groups of same-age peers-in fact youth actors-were
   allegedly online during some of the decisions. The task had a
   within-subjects design with three conditions: ( 1) Evaluation:
   spectators evaluated decisions with likes for large donations to the
   group, ( 2) Spectator: spectators were present but no evaluative
   feedback was displayed and ( 3) Alone: no spectators nor feedback.
   Results showed that prosocial behavior increased in the presence of
   peers, and even more when participants received evaluative feedback from
   peers. Peer presence resulted in enhanced activity in several social
   brain regions including medial prefrontal cortex, temporal parietal
   junction ( TPJ), precuneus and superior temporal sulcus. TPJ activity
   correlated with donations, which suggests similar networks for prosocial
   behavior and sensitivity to peers. These findings highlight the
   importance of peers in fostering prosocial development throughout
   adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{Although behavioral research has shown that positive mood leads to
   desired outcomes in nearly every major life domain, no studies have
   directly examined the effects of positive mood on the neural processes
   underlying reward-related affect and goal-directed behavior. To address
   this gap, participants in the present fMRI study experienced either a
   positive ( n = 20) or neutral ( n = 20) mood induction and subsequently
   completed a monetary incentive delay task that assessed reward and loss
   processing. Consistent with prediction, positive mood elevated activity
   specifically during reward anticipation in corticostriatal neural
   regions that have been implicated in reward processing and goal-directed
   behavior, including the nucleus accumbens, caudate, lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex and putamen, as well as related paralimbic regions,
   including the anterior insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These
   effects were not observed during reward outcome, loss anticipation or
   loss outcome. Critically, this is the first study to report that
   positive mood enhances reward-related neural activity. Our findings have
   implications for uncovering the neural mechanisms by which positive mood
   enhances goal-directed behavior, understanding the malleability of
   reward-related neural activity, and developing targeted treatments for
   psychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in reward processing.}},

Abstract = {{With the use of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging
   neurofeedback ( NF), amygdala activitiy can be visualized in real time.
   In this study, continuous amygdala NF was provided to patients with
   borderline personality disorder ( BPD) with the instruction to
   down-regulate. During four sessions of NF training, patients viewed
   aversive pictures and received feedback from a thermometer display,
   which showed the amygdala blood oxygenation level-dependent signal.
   Conditions of regulation and viewing without regulation were presented.
   Each session started with a resting-state scan and was followed by a
   transfer run without NF. Amygdala regulation, task-related and
   resting-state functional brain connectivity were analyzed. Self-ratings
   of dissociation and difficulty in emotion regulation were collected. BPD
   patients down-regulated right amygdala activation but there were no
   improvements over time. Task-related amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex connectivity was altered across the four sessions, with an
   increased connectivity when regulating vs viewing pictures.
   Resting-state amygdala-lateral prefrontal cortex connectivity was
   altered and dissociation, as well as scores for `lack of emotional
   awareness', decreased with training. Results demonstrated that amygdala
   NF may improve healthy brain connectivity, as well as emotion
   regulation. A randomized-controlled trial is needed to investigate
   whether amygdala NF is instrumental for improving neural regulation and
   emotion regulation in BPD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Goal conflict situations, involving the simultaneous presence of reward
   and punishment, occur commonly in real life, and reflect well-known
   individual differences in the behavioral tendency to approach or avoid.
   However, despite accumulating neural depiction of motivational
   processing, the investigation of naturalistic approach behavior and its
   interplay with individual tendencies is remarkably lacking. We developed
   a novel ecological interactive scenario which triggers motivational
   behavior under high or low goal conflict conditions. Fifty-five healthy
   subjects played the game during a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   scan. A machine-learning approach was applied to classify
   approach/avoidance behaviors during the game. To achieve an independent
   measure of individual tendencies, an integrative profile was composed
   from three established theoretical models. Results demonstrated that
   approach under high relative to low conflict involved increased activity
   in the ventral tegmental area ( VTA), peri-aquaductal gray, ventral
   striatum ( VS) and precuneus. Notably, only VS and VTA activations
   during high conflict discriminated between approach/avoidance
   personality profiles, suggesting that the relationship between
   individual personality and naturalistic motivational tendencies is
   uniquely associated with the mesostriatal pathway. VTA-VS further
   demonstrated stronger coupling during high vs low conflict. These
   findings are the first to unravel the multilevel relationship among
   personality profile, approach tendencies in naturalistic set-up and
   their underlying neural manifestation, thus enabling new avenues for
   investigating approach-related psychopathologies.}},

Abstract = {{Although negative emotion can strengthen memory of an event it can also
   result in memory disturbances, as in posttraumatic stress disorder (
   PTSD). We examined the effects of negative item content on amygdalar and
   hippocampal function in memory for the items themselves and for the
   associations between them. During fMRI, we examined encoding and
   retrieval of paired associates made up of all four combinations of
   neutral and negative images. At test, participants were cued with an
   image and, if recognised, had to retrieve the associated ( target)
   image. The presence of negative images increased item memory but reduced
   associative memory. At encoding, subsequent item recognition correlated
   with amygdala activity, while subsequent associative memory correlated
   with hippocampal activity. Hippocampal activity was reduced by the
   presence of negative images, during encoding and correct associative
   retrieval. In contrast, amygdala activity increased for correctly
   retrieved negative images, even when cued by a neutral image. Our
   findings support a dual representation account, whereby negative emotion
   up-regulates the amygdala to strengthen item memory but downregulates
   the hippocampus to weaken associative representations. These results
   have implications for the development and treatment of clinical
   disorders in which diminished associations between emotional stimuli and
   their context contribute to negative symptoms, as in PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations of fear conditioning have elucidated the neural
   mechanisms of fear acquisition, consolidation and extinction, but it is
   not clear how the neural activation following fear reminder influence
   the following extinction. To address this question, we measured human
   brain activity following fear reminder using resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, and investigated whether the extinction
   effect can be predicted by resting-state functional connectivity (
   RSFC). Behaviorally, we found no significant differences of fear ratings
   between the reminder group and the no reminder group at the fear
   acquisition and extinction stages, but spontaneous recovery during
   re-extinction stage appeared only in the no reminder group. Imaging data
   showed that functional connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex ( vmPFC) and amygdala in the reminder group was greater than that
   in the no reminder group after fear memory reactivation. More
   importantly, the functional connectivity between amygdala and vmPFC of
   the reminder group after fear memory reactivation was positively
   correlated with extinction effect. These results suggest RSFC between
   amygdala and the vmPFC following fear reminder can predict fear
   extinction, which provide important insight into the neural mechanisms
   of fear memory after fear memory reactivation.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders ( ASD) are far more prevalent in males than in
   females. Little is known however about the differential neural
   expression of ASD in males and females. We used a resting-state
   fMRI-dataset comprising 42 males/42 females with ASD and 75 male/75
   female typical-controls to examine whether autism-related alterations in
   intrinsic functional connectivity are similar or different in males and
   females, and particularly whether alterations reflect `neural
   masculinization', as predicted by the Extreme Male Brain theory. Males
   and females showed a differential neural expression of ASD,
   characterized by highly consistent patterns of hypo-connectivity in
   males with ASD ( compared to typical males), and hyper-connectivity in
   females with ASD ( compared to typical females). Interestingly, patterns
   of hyper-connectivity in females with ASD reflected a shift towards the
   ( high) connectivity levels seen in typical males ( neural
   masculinization), whereas patterns of hypo-connectivity observed in
   males with ASD reflected a shift towards the ( low) typical feminine
   connectivity patterns ( neural feminization). Our data support the
   notion that ASD is a disorder of sexual differentiation rather than a
   disorder characterized by masculinization in both genders. Future work
   is needed to identify underlying factors such as sex hormonal
   alterations that drive these sex-specific neural expressions of ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Changed reward functions have been proposed as a core feature of
   stimulant addiction, typically observed as reduced neural responses to
   non-drug-related rewards. However, it was unclear yet how specific this
   deficit is for different types of non-drug rewards arising from social
   and non-social reinforcements. We used functional neuroimaging in
   cocaine users to investigate explicit social reward as modeled by
   agreement of music preferences with music experts. In addition, we
   investigated non-social reward as modeled by winning desired music
   pieces. The study included 17 chronic cocaine users and 17 matched
   stimulant-naive healthy controls. Cocaine users, compared with controls,
   showed blunted neural responses to both social and non-social reward.
   Activation differences were located in the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex overlapping for both reward types and, thus, suggesting a
   non-specific deficit in the processing of non-drug rewards.
   Interestingly, in the posterior lateral orbitofrontal cortex, social
   reward responses of cocaine users decreased with the degree to which
   they were influenced by social feedback from the experts, a response
   pattern that was opposite to that observed in healthy controls. The
   present results suggest that cocaine users likely suffer from a
   generalized impairment in value representation as well as from an
   aberrant processing of social feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Using functional MRI (fMRI) in Study 1, we examined the effect of 2
   personality dimensions related to altruism, such as Agreeableness and

   employed by Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) to request help. For
   all the participants, the brain response across the whole brain was not

   regression analyses revealed that while Agreeableness was related to the
   activation of mentalizing brain areas (i.e., the precuneus), Neuroticism
   was related more to the activation of the brain areas related to reward
   and donation. Study 2 was a psychometric study and confirmed that
   Neuroticism showed a greater association with donation behavior and

Title = {{Pruning or tuning? Maturational profiles of face specialization during
   typical development}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{IntroductionFace processing undergoes significant developmental change
   with age. Two kinds of developmental changes in face specialization were
   examined in this study: specialized maturation, or the continued tuning
   of a region to faces but little change in the tuning to other
   categories; and competitive interactions, or the continued tuning to
   faces accompanied by decreased tuning to nonfaces (i.e., pruning).
   MethodsUsing fMRI, in regions where adults showed a face preference, a
   face- and object-specialization index were computed for younger children
   (5-8 years), older children (9-12 years) and adults (18-45 years). The
   specialization index was scaled to each subject's maximum activation
   magnitude in each region to control for overall age differences in the
   activation level.
   ResultsAlthough no regions showed significant face specialization in the
   younger age group, regions strongly associated with social cognition
   (e.g., right posterior superior temporal sulcus, right inferior orbital
   cortex) showed specialized maturation, in which tuning to faces
   increased with age but there was no pruning of nonface responses.
   Conversely, regions that are associated with more basic perceptual
   processing or motor mirroring (right middle temporal cortex, right
   inferior occipital cortex, right inferior frontal opercular cortex)
   showed competitive interactions in which tuning to faces was accompanied
   by pruning of object responses with age.
   ConclusionsThe overall findings suggest that cortical maturation for
   face processing is regional-specific and involves both increased tuning
   to faces and diminished response to nonfaces. Regions that show
   competitive interactions likely support a more generalized function that
   is co-opted for face processing with development, whereas regions that
   show specialized maturation increase their tuning to faces, potentially
   in an activity-dependent, experience-driven manner.}},

Abstract = {{Intravenous infusion of lanicemine (formerly AZD6765), a low trapping
   non-selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, induces
   antidepressant effects with a similar time course to ketamine. We
   investigated whether a single dose lanicemine infusion would reproduce
   the previously reported decrease in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex
   (sgACC) activity evoked by ketamine, a potential mechanism of
   antidepressant efficacy. Sixty unmedicated adults meeting the criteria
   for major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to receive constant
   intravenous infusions of ketamine, lanicemine or saline during a 60 min
   pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) scan. Both ketamine
   and lanicemine gradually increased the blood oxygen level dependent
   signal in sgACC and rostral ACC as the primary outcome measure. No
   decreases in signal were seen in any region. Interviewer-rated psychotic
   and dissociative symptoms were minimal following administration of
   lanicemine. There was no significant antidepressant effect of either
   infusion compared to saline. The previously reported deactivation of
   sgACC after ketamine probably reflects the rapid and pronounced
   subjective effects evoked by the bolus-infusion method used in the
   previous study. Activation of the ACC was observed following two
   different NMDA compounds in both Manchester and Oxford using different 3
   T MRI scanners, and this effect predicted improvement in mood 1 and 7
   days post-infusion. These findings suggest that the initial site of
   antidepressant action for NMDA antagonists may be the ACC (NCT01046630.

Title = {{Evaluation of Quantified Social Perception Circuit Activity as a
   Neurobiological Marker of Autism Spectrum Disorder}},
Journal = {{JAMA PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is marked by social disability
   and is associated with dysfunction in brain circuits supporting social
   cue perception. The degree to which neural functioning reflects
   individual-level behavioral phenotype is unclear, slowing the search for
   functional neuroimaging biomarkers of ASD.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether quantified neural function in social
   perception circuits may serve as an individual-level marker of ASD in
   children and adolescents.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The cohort study was conducted at the
   Yale Child Study Center and involved children and adolescents diagnosed
   as having ASD and typically developing participants. Participants
   included a discovery cohort and a larger replication cohort.
   Individual-level social perception circuit functioning was assessed as
   functional magnetic resonance imaging brain responses to point-light
   displays of coherent vs scrambled human motion.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcome measures included performance of
   quantified brain responses in affected male and female participants in
   terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC),
   sensitivity and specificity, and correlations between brain responses
   and social behavior.
   RESULTS Of the 39 participants in the discovery cohort aged 4 to 17
   years, 22 had ASD and 30 were boys. Of the 75 participants in the
   replication cohort aged 7 to 20 years, 37 had ASD and 52 were boys. A
   relative reduction in social perception circuit responses was identified
   in discovery cohort boys with ASD at an AUC of 0.75 (95\% CI, 0.52-0.89;
   P = .01); however, typically developing girls and girls with ASD could
   not be distinguished (P = .54). The results were confirmed in the
   replication cohort, where brain responses were identified in boys with
   ASD at an AUC of 0.79 (95\% CI, 0.64-0.91; P < .001) and failed to
   distinguish affected and unaffected girls (P = .82). Across both
   cohorts, boys were identified at an AUC of 0.77 (95\% CI, 0.64-0.86)
   with corresponding sensitivity and specificity of 76\% each.
   Additionally, brain responses were associated with social behavior in
   boys but not in girls.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Quantified social perception circuit activity
   is a promising individual-level candidate neural marker of the male ASD
   behavioral phenotype. Our findings highlight the need to better
   understand effects of sex on social perception processing in relation to
   ASD phenotype manifestations.}},

Abstract = {{Categorical models of emotions posit neurally and physiologically
   distinct human basic emotions. We tested this assumption by using
   multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to classify brain activity patterns
   of 6 basic emotions (disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, anger, and
   surprise) in 3 experiments. Emotions were induced with short movies or
   mental imagery during functional magnetic resonance imaging. MVPA
   accurately classified emotions induced by both methods, and the
   classification generalized from one induction condition to another and
   across individuals. Brain regions contributing most to the
   classification accuracy included medial and inferior lateral prefrontal
   cortices, frontal pole, precentral and postcentral gyri, precuneus, and
   posterior cingulate cortex. Thus, specific neural signatures across
   these regions hold representations of different emotional states in
   multimodal fashion, independently of how the emotions are induced.
   Similarity of subjective experiences between emotions was associated
   with similarity of neural patterns for the same emotions, suggesting a
   direct link between activity in these brain regions and the subjective
   emotional experience.}},

Abstract = {{Processing eye-gaze information is a key step to human social
   interaction. Neuroimaging studies have shown that superior temporal
   sulcus (STS) is highly implicated in eye-gaze perception. In autism, a
   lack of preference for the eyes, as well as anatomo-functional
   abnormalities within the STS, has been described. To date, there are no
   experimental data in humans showing whether it is possible to interfere
   with eye-gaze processing by modulating STS neural activity. Here, we
   measured eye-gaze perception before and after inhibitory transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over the posterior STS (pSTS) in
   young healthy volunteers. Eye-gaze processing, namely overt orienting
   toward the eyes, was measured using eye tracking during passive
   visualization of social movies. Inhibition of the right pSTS led
   participants to look less to the eyes of characters during visualization
   of social movies. Such effect was specific for the eyes and was not
   observed after inhibition of the left pSTS nor after placebo TMS. These
   results indicate for the first time that interfering with the right pSTS
   neural activity transitorily disrupts the behavior of orienting toward
   the eyes and thus indirectly gaze perception, a fundamental process for
   human social cognition. These results could open up new perspectives in
   therapeutic interventions in autism.}},

Abstract = {{Current models of the functional architecture of human cortex emphasize
   areas that capture coarse-scale features of cortical topography but
   provide no account for population responses that encode information in
   fine-scale patterns of activity. Here, we present a linear model of
   shared representational spaces in human cortex that captures fine-scale
   distinctions among population responses with response-tuning basis
   functions that are common across brains and models cortical patterns of
   neural responses with individual-specific topographic basis functions.
   We derive a common model space for the whole cortex using a new
   algorithm, searchlight hyperalignment, and complex, dynamic stimuli that
   provide a broad sampling of visual, auditory, and social percepts. The
   model aligns representations across brains in occipital, temporal,
   parietal, and prefrontal cortices, as shown by between-subject
   multivariate pattern classification and intersubject correlation of
   representational geometry, indicating that structural principles for
   shared neural representations apply across widely divergent domains of
   information. The model provides a rigorous account for individual
   variability of well-known coarse-scale topographies, such as retinotopy
   and category selectivity, and goes further to account for fine-scale
   patterns that are multiplexed with coarse-scale topographies and carry
   finer distinctions.}},

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{58-69}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Episodic memory relies on a distributed network of brain regions, with
   the hippocampus playing a critical and irreplaceable role. Few studies
   have examined how changes in this network contribute to episodic memory
   development early in life. The present addressed this gap by examining
   relations between hippocampal functional connectivity and episodic
   memory in 4- and 6-year-old children (n = 40). Results revealed similar
   hippocampal functional connectivity between age groups, which included
   lateral temporal regions, precuneus, and multiple parietal and
   prefrontal regions, and functional specialization along the longitudinal
   axis. Despite these similarities, developmental differences were also
   observed. Specifically, 3 (of 4) regions within the hippocampal memory
   network were positively associated with episodic memory in 6-year-old
   children, but negatively associated with episodic memory in 4-year-old
   children. In contrast, all 3 regions outside the hippocampal memory
   network were negatively associated with episodic memory in older
   children, but positively associated with episodic memory in younger
   children. These interactions are interpreted within an interactive
   specialization framework and suggest the hippocampus becomes
   functionally integrated with cortical regions that are part of the
   hippocampal memory network in adults and functionally segregated from
   regions unrelated to memory in adults, both of which are associated with
   age-related improvements in episodic memory ability. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Early-life stress (ELS) exposure is associated with adverse outcomes
   across the lifespan. We examined the relation of ELS exposure to
   resting-state fMRI in children ages 4-7 years. ELS in the first years of
   life, but not concurrent, was associated with higher regional
   homogeneity of resting-state fMRI in the left lateral frontal cortex.
   Resting-state fMRI functional connectivity analyses showed that the
   region of left lateral frontal cortex demonstrating heightened regional
   homogeneity associated with ELS was negatively correlated with right
   temporal/parahippocampal areas. Moreover, higher regional homogeneity in
   the left lateral frontal cortex and its negative coupling with the right
   middle temporal/parahippocampal areas were associated with poorer
   performance on a reversal-learning task performed outside the scanner.
   Association of ELS exposure with regional homogeneity was independent of
   other early adversities. These findings suggest that ELS may influence
   the development of cognitive control in the lateral prefrontal cortex
   and its interactions with temporal cortex. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Social exclusion is a distressing experience and can lead to both
   retaliatory and prosocial reactions toward the sources of exclusion. The
   way people react to social exclusion has been hypothesized to be shaped
   through chronic exposure to peer rejection. This functional Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging study examined associations between chronic peer
   rejection and retaliatory (i.e. punishing) and prosocial (i.e.
   forgiving) reactions to social exclusion and the neural processes
   underlying them. Chronically rejected (n= 19) and stably highly accepted
   adolescents (n = 27) distributed money between themselves and unknown
   others who previously included or excluded them in a virtual
   ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Decreasing the excluders' monetary
   profits (i.e., punishment) was associated with increased activity in the
   ventral striatum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal
   cortex in both groups. Compared to stably highly accepted adolescents,
   chronically rejected adolescents exhibited higher activity in the dorsal
   striatum and lateral prefrontal cortex - brain regions implicated in
   cognitive control - when they refrained from punishment and shared their
   money equally with (i.e. forgave) the excluders. These results provide
   insights into processes that might underlie the maintenance of peer
   rejection across development, such as difficulties controlling the urge
   to retaliate after exclusion. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Studies in generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) have reported both
   structural and functional alterations in the brain. However, changes in
   spontaneous neuronal functional organization in GTCS remain largely
   unknown.
   In this study, 70 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy
   characterized by tonic-clonic seizures and 70 age-and sex-matched
   healthy controls were recruited. Here, functional connectivity density
   (FCD) mapping, an ultrafast data-driven method based on functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), was applied for the first time to
   investigate the changes of spontaneous functional brain activity caused
   by epilepsy.
   The results showed significantly decreased long-range FCD in the middle
   and inferior temporal, prefrontal, and inferior parietal cortices as
   well as increased long-range FCD in the cerebellum anterior lobe and
   sensorimotor areas.
   Negative correlation between duration of disease and reduced long-range
   FCD was found. In addition, most regions with reduced long-range FCD
   showed decreased resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within
   default mode network. Negative correlation between duration of disease
   and long-range FCD may reflect an adverse consequence eventually from
   original. Furthermore, the observed FCD and rsFC alterations have been
   speculated to be associated with the social-cognitive impairments as
   well as motor control. Our study provided novel evidences to look into
   neuro-pathophysiological mechanisms underlying GTCS.}},

Title = {{Dynamic emotion perception and prior expectancy}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{131-140}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Social interactions require the ability to rapidly perceive emotion from
   various incoming dynamic, multisensory cues. Prior expectations reduce
   incoming emotional information and direct attention to cues that are
   aligned with what is expected. Studies to date have investigated the
   prior expectancy effect using static emotional images, despite the fact
   that dynamic stimuli would represent greater ecological validity. The
   objective of the study was to create a novel functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm to examine the influence of prior
   expectations on naturalistic emotion perception. For this purpose, we
   developed a dynamic emotion perception task, which consisted of
   audio-visual videos that carry emotional information congruent or
   incongruent with prior expectations. The results show that emotional
   congruency was associated with activity in prefrontal regions, amygdala,
   and putamen, whereas emotional incongruency was associated with activity
   in temporoparietal junction and midcingulate gyrus. Supported by the
   behavioural results, our findings suggest that prior expectations are
   reinforced after repeated experience and learning, whereas unexpected
   emotions may rely on fast change detection processes. The results from
   the current study are compatible with the notion that the ability to
   automatically detect unexpected changes in complex dynamic environments
   allows for adaptive behaviours in potentially advantageous or
   threatening situations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Reward value enhances post-decision error-related activity in the
   cingulate cortex}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{38-46}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{By saying ``Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything
   new{''}, Albert Einstein himself allegedly implied that the making and
   processing of errors are essential for behavioral adaption to a new or
   changing environment. These essential error-related cognitive and neural
   processes are likely influenced by reward value. However, previous
   studies have not dissociated accuracy and value and so the distinct
   effect of reward on error processing in the brain remained unknown.
   Therefore, we set out to investigate this at various points in
   decision-making. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan
   participants while they completed a random dot motion discrimination
   task where reward and non-reward were associated with stimuli via
   classical conditioning. Pre-error activity was found in the medial
   frontal cortex prior to response but this was not related to reward
   value. At response time, error-related activity was found to be
   significantly greater in reward than non-reward trials in the
   midcingulate cortex. Finally at outcome time, error-related activity was
   found in the anterior cingulate cortex in non-reward trials. These
   results show that reward value enhances post-decision but not
   pre-decision error-related activities and these results therefore have
   implications for theories of error correction and confidence. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Working memory is essential for many of our distinctly human abilities,
   including reasoning, problem solving, and planning. Research spanning
   many decades has helped to refine our understanding of this high-level
   function as comprising several hierarchically organized components, some
   which maintain information in the conscious mind, and others which
   manipulate and reorganize this information in useful ways. In the
   neocortex, these processes are likely implemented by a distributed
   frontoparietal network, with more posterior regions serving to maintain
   volatile information, and more anterior regions subserving the
   manipulation of this information. Recent meta-analytic findings have
   identified the anterior lateral prefrontal cortex, in particular, as
   being generally engaged by working memory tasks, while the posterior
   lateral prefrontal cortex was more strongly associated with the
   cognitive load required by these tasks. These findings suggest specific
   roles for these regions in the cognitive control processes underlying
   working memory. To further characterize these regions, we applied three
   distinct seed-based methods for determining cortical connectivity.
   Specifically, we employed meta-analytic connectivity mapping across
   task-based fMRI experiments, resting-state BOLD correlations, and
   VBM-based structural covariance. We found a frontoparietal pattern of
   convergence which strongly resembled the working memory networks
   identified in previous research. A contrast between anterior and
   posterior parts of the lateral prefrontal cortex revealed distinct
   connectivity patterns consistent with the idea of a hierarchical
   organization of frontoparietal networks. Moreover, we found a
   distributed network that was anticorrelated with the anterior seed
   region, which included most of the default mode network and a
   subcomponent related to social and emotional processing. These findings
   fit well with the internal attention model of working memory, in which
   representation of information is processed according to an
   anteroposterior gradient of abstract-to-concrete representations.}},

Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{While cortical thinning has been associated with HIV infection, it is
   unclear whether this reflects a direct effect of the virus, whether it
   is related to disruption of subcortical function or whether it is better
   explained by epiphenomena, such as drug abuse or comorbid medical
   conditions. The present study investigated the relationship between
   cortical thickness and subcortical function in HIV+ patients.
   Specifically, we examined the relationship between prefrontal cortical
   thickness and striatal function. Twenty-three largely treatment na < ve,
   non-substance abusing HIV+ participants and 19 healthy controls matched
   for age, gender, and educational status were included. Cortical
   morphometry was performed using FreeSurfer software analysis. Striatal
   function was measured during an fMRI stop-signal anticipation task known
   to engage the striatum. Any cortical regions showing significant
   thinning were entered as dependent variables into a single linear
   regression model which included subcortical function, age, CD4 count,
   and a measure of global cognitive performance as independent predictors.
   The only cortical region that was significantly reduced after correction
   for multiple comparisons was the right superior frontal gyrus. Striatal
   activity was found to independently predict superior frontal gyral
   cortical thickness. While cortical thinning in HIV infection is likely
   multifactorial, viral induced subcortical dysfunction appears to play a
   role.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety is a multidimensional construct that includes stable trait
   anxiety and momentary state anxiety, which have a combined effect on our
   mental and physical well-being. However, the relationship between
   intrinsic brain activity and the feeling of anxiety, particularly trait
   and state anxiety, remain unclear. In this study, we used resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo)) to determine the
   effects of intrinsic brain activity on stable inter-individual trait
   anxiety and intra-individual state anxiety variability in a
   cross-sectional and test-retest study. We found that at both time
   points, the trait anxiety score was significantly associated with
   intrinsic brain activity (both the ALFF and ReHo) in the right ventral
   medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ALFF of the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex/anterior midcingulate cortex (dACC/aMCC). More
   importantly, the change in intrinsic brain activity in the right insula
   was predictive of intra-individual state anxiety variability over a
   9-month interval. The test-retest nature of this study's design could
   provide an opportunity to distinguish between the intrinsic brain
   activity associated with state and trait anxiety. These results could
   deepen our understanding of anxiety from a neuroscientific perspective.

Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{430-437}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{It is as yet unknown if behavioral and neural correlates of performance
   monitoring in socially anxious individuals are affected by whether
   feedback is provided by a person or a computer. This fMRI study
   investigated modulation of feedback processing by feedback source
   (person vs. computer) in participants with high (HSA) (N = 16) and low
   social anxiety (LSA) (N= 16). Subjects performed a choice task in which
   they were informed that they would receive positive or negative feedback
   from a person or the computer. Subjective ratings indicated increased
   arousal and anxiety in HSA versus LSA, most pronounced for social and
   negative feedback. FMRI analyses yielded hyperactivation in ventral
   medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and
   insula for social relative to computer feedback, and in mPFC/ventral ACC
   for positive relative to negative feedback in HSA as compared to LSA.
   These activation patterns are consistent with increased interoception
   and self-referential processing in social anxiety, especially during
   processing of positive feedback. Increased ACC activation in HSA to
   positive feedback may link to unexpectedness of (social) praise as
   posited in social anxiety disorder (SAD) psychopathology. Activation in
   rostral ACC showed a reversed pattern, with decreased activation to
   positive feedback in HSA, possibly indicating altered action values
   depending on feedback source and valence. The present findings
   corroborate a crucial role of mPFC for performance monitoring in social
   anxiety. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{16-32}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{When exposed to self-face images, individuals often experience
   embarrassment, which is enhanced by being observed. This self-evaluative
   emotion is related to activity in the right anterior insula and the
   functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate and prefrontal
   cortices. Coupling between cognitive evaluation of self-face images and
   emotional response to them (cognitive-emotional coupling) is weaker in
   individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), in parallel with
   reduced activity of the right insula. To determine whether
   self-evaluative emotions of individuals with ASD are less strongly
   impacted by observation, we conducted functional MRI in 14 adult men
   with ASD and 18 age-matched control men while the participants viewed
   self-face images. Increased embarrassment upon observation was
   positively correlated with increased activity in the right anterior
   insula in the control group, but not in the ASD group. In addition,
   awareness of being observed enhanced cognitive-emotional coupling in the
   controls but not in the ASD group. The coupling was correlated with the
   functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate and medial
   prefrontal cortices. These results suggest that the reduced impact of
   observation on embarrassment induced by self-face images in individuals
   with ASD is related to impairment in the right anterior insula, which is
   involved in creating subjective feelings, and the anterior cingulate
   cortex, which acts as a hub for integrating information from others
   during self-face evaluation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Holding biological motion (BM), the movements of animate entities, in
   working memory (WM) is important to our daily life activities. However,
   the neural substrates underlying the WM processing of BM remain largely
   unknown. Employing the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   technique, the current study directly investigated this issue. We used
   point-light BM animations as the tested stimuli, and explored the neural
   substrates involved in encoding and retaining BM information in WM.
   Participants were required to remember two or four BM stimuli in a
   change-detection task. We first defined a set of potential brain regions
   devoted to the BM processing in WM in one experiment. We then conducted
   the second fMRI experiment, and performed time course analysis over the
   pre-defined regions, which allowed us to differentiate the encoding and
   maintenance phases of WM. The results showed that a set of brain regions
   were involved in encoding BM into WM, including the middle frontal
   gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, inferior
   parietal lobule, superior temporal sulcus, fusiform gyrus, and middle
   occipital gyrus. However, only the middle frontal gyrus, inferior
   frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and inferior parietal lobule
   were involved in retaining BM into WM. These results suggest that an
   overlapped network exists between the WM encoding and maintenance for
   BM; however, retaining BM in WM predominately relies on the mirror
   neuron system.}},

Title = {{The influence of androstadienone during psychosocial stress is modulated
   by gender, trait anxiety and subjective stress: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{126-139}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Androstadienone (ANDR), a bodily secreted steroid compound, is a
   socially relevant chemosignal that modulates subjective and
   (neuro)physiological responses, predominantly in females. The impact of
   ANDR on stress responses in males and females has not been explored.
   Therefore, this fMRI study aimed to examine psychosocial stress
   reactions induced by mental arithmetic and social evaluation on
   behavioral and hormonal levels (46 participants: 15 naturally cycling
   females in their early follicular phase (EF), 15 females on hormonal
   contraceptives (HC) and 16 males); and on a neural level (40
   participants: 13 EF-females, 13 HC-females and 14 males) in an ANDR and
   placebo treatment repeated-measures design.
   While no gender differences emerged in subjective ratings and
   performance during stress, neural activation patterns differed
   significantly. Besides, ANDR attenuated the post-stress increase of
   negative mood in all participants. Region of interest analyses showed
   that irrespective of treatment, males showed stronger activation of the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than females. At the whole brain
   level, gender differences emerged indicating stronger fronto-parietal
   activation in males compared to HC-females on both treatments. Males
   showed stronger visual and fusiform activation than EF-females under
   ANDR. Both female groups did not show stronger activation than males.
   Further, error ratio in the ANDR-stress condition was positively
   associated with their post-stress cortisol level and increase in
   subjective stress in males; and male DLPFC activity in the ANDR-stress
   condition was negatively associated with trait anxiety. Surprisingly,
   compared to HC-females, EF-female only showed stronger activation of
   arousal-related areas under placebo treatment.
   Taken together, these findings suggest that the male stress reaction
   under social evaluative threat was stronger than female stress reactions
   as a function of ANDR. More specifically, this effect on behavioral and
   neural stress reactions seems to depend on trait anxiety in males only.
   The study highlights the significance of a chemosignal in enhancing
   social threat that may facilitate adaptive stress responses. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Women on average outperform men in cognitive-empathic abilities, such as
   the capacity to infer motives from the bodily cues of others, which is
   vital for effective social interaction. The steroid hormone testosterone
   is thought to play a role in this sexual dimorphism. Strikingly, a
   previous study shows that a single administration of testosterone in
   women impairs performance on the `Reading the Mind in Eyes' Test (RMET),
   a task in which emotions have to be inferred from the eye-region of a
   face. This effect was mediated by the 2D:4D ratio, the ratio between the
   length of the index and ring finger, a proxy for fetal testosterone.
   Research in typical individuals, in individuals with autism spectrum
   conditions (ASC), and in individuals with brain lesions has established
   that performance on the RMET depends on the left inferior frontal gyrus
   (IFG). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that
   a single administration of testosterone in 16 young women significantly
   altered connectivity of the left IFG with the anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) during RMET performance,
   independent of 2D:4D ratio. This IFG-ACC-SMA network underlies the
   integration and selection of sensory information, and for action
   preparation during cognitive empathic behavior. Our findings thus reveal
   a neural mechanism by which testosterone can impair emotion-recognition
   ability, and may link to the symptomatology of ASC, in which the same
   neural network is implicated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Narcissists behave aggressively when their egos are threatened by
   interpersonal insults. This effect has been explained in terms of
   narcissists' motivation to reduce the discrepancy between their
   grandiose self and its threatened version, though no research has
   directly tested this hypothesis. If this notion is true, the link
   between narcissism and retaliatory aggression should be moderated by
   neural structures that subserve discrepancy detection, such as the
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). This study tested the
   hypothesis that narcissism would only predict greater retaliatory
   aggression in response to social rejection when the dACC was recruited
   by the threat. Thirty participants (15 females; M-age=18.86, SD=1.25;
   77\% White) completed a trait narcissism inventory, were socially
   accepted and then rejected while undergoing fMRI, and then could behave
   aggressively toward one of the rejecters by blasting him or her with
   unpleasant noise. When narcissists displayed greater dACC activation
   during rejection, they behaved aggressively. But there was only a weak
   or nonsignificant relation between narcissism and aggression among
   participants with a blunted dACC response. Narcissism's role in
   aggressive retaliation to interpersonal threats is likely determined by
   the extent to which the brain's discrepancy detector registers the newly
   created gap between the grandiose and threatened selves.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To test differences in neural sensitivity to facial
   expressions, including expressions with open versus closed mouths,
   exhibited by (1) adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared to
   neurotypical adults, and by (2) short versus long serotonin transporter
   allele (SLC6A4) carriers.
   Methods: Event related potentials (ERPs) to happy, fearful, and neutral
   expressions were collected from neurotypical adults (n = 25) and adults
   with ASD (n = 27)-of whom 32 had short and 13 had homozygous long SLC6A4
   alleles.
   Results: In the neurotypical group, we confirmed that the N170, VPP and
   EPN, but not the P1, were influenced by emotional expressions, and
   determined the EPN was the earliest component modulated by open mouth.
   Compared to the neurotypical group, individuals with ASD exhibited
   differences in EPN amplitude in response to open versus closed mouths
   and in hemispheric distribution. Across groups, short serotonin
   transporter allele carriers had reduced P1 amplitude compared to long
   allele carriers.
   Conclusions: Individuals with ASD exhibited a different pattern of
   neural response when encoding and recognizing facial expressions at the
   EPN component. Across groups, SLC6A4 allele type modulated early sensory
   attention at the P1.
   Significance: These results provide insight into the nature of early
   responses to emotional information according to genetic variation and
   clinical condition. (C) 2016 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {{BackgroundMemory impairment is considered a hallmark of amnestic mild
   cognitive impairment (aMCI) and dementia. Emerging evidence suggests
   that the prefrontal lobe is required to maintain memory functions. The
   purpose of this study was to clarify whether older adults with aMCI have
   decreased prefrontal oxygenation during memory encoding and retrieval
   compared with age-matched healthy older adults, using multi-channel
   near-infrared spectroscopy.
   MethodsWe examined 64 older adults with aMCI (mean 71.8years) and 66
   cognitively healthy control subjects comparable in age and gender (mean
   71.7years). The concentration of oxy-hemoglobin, which is a reliable
   biomarker of changes in regional cerebral blood flow, was measured in
   the prefrontal cortex during encoding and delayed retrieval of a list of
   10 target words. Task performance was evaluated as average number of
   correct answers in the retrieval task.
   ResultsSubjects with aMCI showed reduced activation in the bilateral
   dorsolateral cortex (approximately Brodmann area 9) and provided fewer
   correct answers in the retrieval period than control subjects. There
   were no significant differences during encoding.
   ConclusionsReduced activation in the dorsolateral cortex during
   retrieval may cause deficits in memory performance, which may be used as
   a marker of aMCI. Further studies are required to examine the predictive
   validity of this decreased activation pattern for the incidence of
   Alzheimer's disease. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{62-67}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Procrastination is to voluntarily delay an intended course of action and
   is considered an archetypal human failing. A popular hypothesis is that
   procrastination is representative of self-regulatory failure. Although
   there is extensive behavioral evidence consistent with the predictions
   of this theory, there is no neural evidence for it. To test directly the
   extent to which individual differences in trait procrastination can be
   related to resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between brain
   regions implicated in self-regulation, we applied resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) in a group of 77 healthy
   participants. RSFC 1) between ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)
   and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), 2) between dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) and caudate, and 3) within ventral lateral
   prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), negatively predicted the severity of
   procrastination. These results provide direct evidence for the validity
   of self-regulatory failure account of procrastination, and implicate
   that trait procrastination is reflected in the intrinsic functional
   dynamics of neural systems associated with impulse control, performance
   monitoring, and behavioral inhibition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{622}},
Pages = {{49-54}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{In many social animals, early exposure to conspecific stimuli is
   critical for the development of accurate species recognition. Obligate
   brood parasitic songbirds, however, forego parental care and young are
   raised by heterospecific hosts in the absence of conspecific stimuli.
   Having evolved from non-parasitic, parental ancestors, how brood
   parasites recognize their own species remains unclear. In parental
   songbirds (e.g. zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata), the primary and
   secondary auditory forebrain areas are known to be critical in the
   differential processing of conspecific vs. heterospecific songs. Here we
   demonstrate that the same auditory brain regions underlie song
   discrimination in adult brood parasitic pin-tailed whydahs (Vidua
   macroura), a close relative of the zebra finch lineage. Similar to zebra
   finches, whydahs showed stronger behavioral responses during conspecific
   vs. heterospecific song and tone pips as well as increased neural
   responses within the auditory forebrain, as measured by both functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and immediate early gene (IEG)
   expression. Given parallel behavioral and neuroanatomical patterns of
   song discrimination, our results suggest that the evolutionary
   transition to brood parasitism from parental songbirds likely involved
   an ``evolutionary tinkering{''} of existing proximate mechanisms, rather
   than the wholesale reworking of the neural substrates of species
   recognition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A core symptom of anxiety disorders is the tendency to interpret
   ambiguous information as threatening. Using electroencephalography and
   blood oxygenation level dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI),
   several studies have begun to elucidate brain processes involved in
   fear-related perceptual biases, but thus far mainly found evidence for
   general hypervigilance in high fearful individuals. Recently,
   multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has become popular for decoding
   cognitive states from distributed patterns of neural activation. Here,
   we used this technique to assess whether biased fear generalization,
   characteristic of clinical fear, is already present during the initial
   perception and categorization of a stimulus, or emerges during the
   subsequent interpretation of a stimulus. Individuals with low spider
   fear (n = 20) and high spider fear (n = 18) underwent functional MRI
   scanning while viewing series of schematic flowers morphing to spiders.
   In line with previous studies, individuals with high fear of spiders
   were behaviorally more likely to classify ambiguous morphs as spiders
   than individuals with low fear of spiders. Univariate analyses of
   BOLD-MRI data revealed stronger activation toward spider pictures in
   high fearful individuals compared to low fearful individuals in numerous
   areas. Yet, neither average activation, nor support vector machine
   classification (i.e., a form of MVPA) matched the behavioral results -
   i.e., a biased response toward ambiguous stimuli- in any of the regions
   of interest. This may point to limitations of the current design, and to
   challenges associated with classifying emotional and neutral stimuli in
   groups that differ in their judgment of emotionality. Improvements for
   future research are suggested.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 26}},
Abstract = {{Road traffic accidents consistently show a significant
   over-representation for young, novice and particularly male drivers.
   This research examines the prefrontal cortex activation of young drivers
   and the changes in activation associated with manipulations of mental
   workload and inhibitory control. It also considers the explanation that
   a lack of prefrontal cortex maturation is a contributing factor to the
   higher accident risk in this young driver population. The prefrontal
   cortex is associated with a number of factors including mental workload
   and inhibitory control, both of which are also related to road traffic
   accidents. This experiment used functional near infrared spectroscopy to
   measure prefrontal cortex activity during five simulated driving tasks:
   one following task and four overtaking tasks at varying traffic
   densities which aimed to dissociate workload and inhibitory control.
   Age, experience and gender were controlled for throughout the
   experiment. The results showed that younger drivers had reduced
   prefrontal cortex activity compared to older drivers. When both mental
   workload and inhibitory control increased prefrontal cortex activity
   also increased, however when inhibitory control alone increased there
   were no changes in activity. Along with an increase in activity during
   overtaking manoeuvres, these results suggest that prefrontal cortex
   activation is more indicative of workload in the current task. There
   were no differences in the number of overtakes completed by younger and
   older drivers but males overtook significantly more than females. We
   conclude that prefrontal cortex activity is associated with the mental
   workload required for overtaking. We additionally suggest that the
   reduced activation in younger drivers may be related to a lack of
   prefrontal maturation which could contribute to the increased crash risk
   seen in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Growing interest in affective touch has delineated a neural network that
   bypasses primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Several recent studies,
   however, have cast doubt on the segregation of touch discrimination and
   affect, suggesting that S1 also encodes affective qualities. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and repetitive transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to examine the role of S1 in processing
   touch intensity and pleasantness. Twenty-six healthy human adults rated
   brushing on the hand during fMRI. Intensity ratings significantly
   predicted activation in S1, whereas pleasantness ratings predicted
   activation only in the anterior cingulate cortex. Nineteen subjects also
   received inhibitory rTMS over right hemisphere S1 and the vertex
   (control). After S1 rTMS, but not after vertex rTMS, sensory
   discrimination was reduced and subjects with reduced sensory
   discrimination rated touch as more intense. In contrast, rTMS did not
   alter ratings of touch pleasantness. Our findings support divergent
   neural processing of touch intensity and pleasantness, with affective
   touch encoded outside of S1.}},

Title = {{Music Performance As an Experimental Approach to Hyperscanning Studies}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 25}},
Abstract = {{Humans are fundamentally social and tend to create emergent
   organizations when interacting with each other; from dyads to families,
   small groups, large groups, societies, and civilizations. The study of
   the neuronal substrate of human social behavior is currently gaining
   momentum in the young field of social neuroscience. Hyperscanning is a
   neuroimaging technique by which we can study two or more brains
   simultaneously while participants interact with each other. The aim of
   this article is to discuss several factors that we deem important in
   designing hyperscanning experiments. We first review hyperscanning
   studies performed by means of electroencephalography (EEG) that have
   been relying on a continuous interaction paradigm. Then, we provide
   arguments for favoring ecological paradigms, for studying the emotional
   component of social interactions and for performing longitudinal
   studies, the last two aspects being largely neglected so far in the
   hyperscanning literature despite their paramount importance in social
   sciences. Based on these premises, we argue that music performance is a
   suitable experimental setting for hyperscanning and that for such
   studies EEG is an appropriate choice as neuroimaging modality.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 19}},
Abstract = {{Given that extensive cerebral regions are co-atrophic in semantic
   dementia (SD), it is not yet known which critical regions
   (SD-semantic-critical regions) are really responsible for the semantic
   deficits of SD. To identify the SD-semantic-critical regions, we
   explored the relationship between the degree of cerebral atrophy in the
   whole brain and the severity of semantic deficits in 19 individuals with
   SD. We found that the gray matter volumes (GMVs) of two regions {[}left
   fusiform gyrus (IFFG) and left parahippocampal gyrus (IPHG)]
   significantly correlated with the semantic scores of patients with SD.
   Importantly, the effects of the IFFG remained significant after
   controlling for the GMVs of the IPHG. Moreover, the effects of the
   region could not be accounted for by the total GMV, general cognitive
   ability, laterality of brain atrophy, or control task performance. We
   further observed that each atrophic portion of the IFFG along the
   anterior posterior axis might dedicate to the loss of semantic functions
   in SD. These results reveal that the IFFG could be a critical region
   contributing to the semantic deficits of SD.}},

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 17}},
Abstract = {{Executive dysfunction is common during and between mood episodes in
   bipolar disorder (BD), causing social and functional impairment. This
   study investigated the effect of acute exercise on adolescents with BD
   and healthy control subjects (HC) to test for positive or negative
   consequences on neural response during an executive task. Fifty
   adolescents (mean age 16.54 +/- 1.47 years, 56\% female, 30 with BD)
   completed an attention and response inhibition task before and after 20
   min of recumbent cycling at similar to 70\% of age-predicted maximum
   heart rate. 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed
   in a whole brain voxel-wise analysis and as regions of interest (ROI),
   examining Go and NoGo response events. In the whole brain analysis of Go
   trials, exercise had larger effect in BD vs HC throughout ventral
   prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus; the profile of these
   effects was of greater disengagement after exercise. Pre-exercise ROI
   analysis confirmed this `deficit in deactivation' for BDs in rostral ACC
   and found an activation deficit on NoGo errors in accumbens.
   Pre-exercise accumbens NoGo error activity correlated with depression
   symptoms and Go activity with mania symptoms; no correlations were
   present after exercise. Performance was matched to controls and results
   survived a series of covariate analyses. This study provides evidence
   that acute aerobic exercise transiently changes neural response during
   an executive task among adolescents with BD, and that pre-exercise
   relationships between symptoms and neural response are absent after
   exercise. Acute aerobic exercise constitutes a biological probe that may
   provide insights regarding pathophysiology and treatment of BD.}},

Title = {{The effect of aging on fronto-striatal reactive and proactive inhibitory
   control}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{51-58}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Inhibitory control, like most cognitive processes, is subject to an
   age-related decline. The effect of age on neurofunctional inhibition
   processing remains uncertain, with age-related increases as well as
   decreases in activation being reported. This is possibly because
   reactive (i.e., outright stopping) and proactive inhibition (i.e.,
   anticipation of stopping) have not been evaluated separately. Here, we
   investigate the effects of aging on reactive as well as proactive
   inhibition, using functional MRI in 73 healthy subjects aged 30-70
   years.
   We found reactive inhibition to slow down with advancing age, which was
   paralleled by increased activation in the motor cortex. Behaviorally,
   older adults did not exercise increased proactive inhibition strategies
   compared to younger adults. However, the pattern of activation in the
   right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) showed a clear age-effect on
   proactive inhibition: rather than flexibly engaging the rIFG in response
   to varying stop-signal probabilities, older subjects showed an overall
   hyperactivation. Whole-brain analyses revealed similar hyperactivations
   in various other frontal and parietal brain regions. These results are
   in line with the neural compensation hypothesis of aging: processing
   becomes less flexible and efficient with advancing age, which is
   compensated for by overall enhanced activation. Moreover, by
   disentangling reactive and proactive inhibition, we can show for the
   first time that the age-related increase in activation during inhibition
   that is reported generally by prior studies may be the result of
   compensation for reduced neural flexibility related to proactive control
   strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During public addresses, speakers accompany their discourse with
   spontaneous hand gestures (beats) that are tightly synchronized with the
   prosodic contour of the discourse. It has been proposed that speech and
   beat gestures originate from a common underlying linguistic process
   whereby both speech prosody and beats serve to emphasize relevant
   information. We hypothesized that breaking the consistency between beats
   and prosody by temporal desynchronization, would modulate activity of
   brain areas sensitive to speech-gesture integration. To this aim, we
   measured BOLD responses as participants watched a natural discourse
   where the speaker used beat gestures.
   In order to identify brain areas specifically involved in processing
   hand gestures with communicative intention, beat synchrony was evaluated
   against arbitrary visual cues bearing equivalent rhythmic and spatial
   properties as the gestures. Our results revealed that left MTG and IFG
   were specifically sensitive to speech synchronized with beats, compared
   to the arbitrary vision-speech pairing. Our results suggest that
   listeners confer beats a function of visual prosody, complementary to
   the prosodic structure of speech. We conclude that the emphasizing
   function of beat gestures in speech perception is instantiated through a
   specialized brain network sensitive to the communicative intent conveyed
   by a speaker with his/her hands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Social evaluation is a ubiquitous feature of daily interpersonal
   interactions and can produce strong positive or negative emotional
   reactions. While previous research has highlighted neural correlates of
   static or dynamic facial expressions, little is known about neural
   processing of more naturalistic social interaction simulations or the
   modulating role of inter-individual differences such as trait fear of
   negative/positive evaluation. The present fMRI study investigated neural
   activity of 37 (21 female) healthy participants while watching videos of
   posers expressing a range of positive, negative, and neutral statements
   tapping into several basic and social emotions. Unpleasantness ratings
   linearly increased in response to positive to neutral to negative videos
   whereas arousal ratings were elevated in both emotional video
   conditions. At the whole brain level, medial prefrontal and rostral
   anterior cingulate cortex activated strongly in both emotional
   conditions which may be attributed to the cognitive processing demands
   of responding to complex social evaluation. Region of interest analysis
   for basic emotion processing areas revealed enhanced amygdala activation
   in both emotional conditions, whereas anterior and posterior insula
   showed stronger activity during negative evaluations only. Individuals
   with high fear of positive evaluation were characterized by increased
   posterior insula activity during positive videos, suggesting heightened
   interoception. Taken together, these results replicate and extend
   studies that used facial expression stimuli and reveal neurobiological
   systems involved in processing of more complex social-evaluative videos.
   Results also point to vulnerability factors for social-interaction
   related psychopathologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{238-246}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Race disparities in behavior may emerge in several ways, some of which
   may be independent of implicit bias. To mitigate the pernicious effects
   of different race disparities for racial minorities, we must understand
   whether they are rooted in perceptual, affective, or cognitive
   processing with regard to race perception. We used fMRI to disentangle
   dynamic neural mechanisms predictive of two separable race disparities
   that can be obtained from a trustworthiness ratings task. Increased
   coupling between regions involved in perceptual and affective processing
   when viewing Black versus White faces predicted less later racial trust
   disparity, which was related to implicit bias. In contrast, increased
   functional coupling between regions involved in controlled processing
   predicted less later disparity in the differentiation of Black versus
   White faces with regard to perceived trust, which was unrelated to bias.
   These findings reveal that distinct neural signatures underlie separable
   race disparities in social cognition that may or may not be related to
   implicit bias. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have suggested cerebro-cerebellar circuitry in working

   cerebro-cerebellar activation patterns in verbal and visual working

   of the activation patterns observed. Consistent with Chen and Desmond
   (2005a,b) predictions, verbal working memory activated a
   cerebro-cerebellar circuitry that comprised left-lateralized
   language-related brain regions including the inferior frontal and
   posterior parietal areas, and subcortically, right-lateralized superior
   (lobule VI) and inferior cerebellar (lobule VIIIA/VIIB) areas. In
   contrast, a distributed network of bilateral inferior frontal and
   inferior temporal areas, and bilateral superior (lobule VI) and inferior
   (lobule VIIB) cerebellar areas, was recruited during visual working
   memory. Results of the study verified that a distinct cross
   cerebro-cerebellar circuitry underlies verbal working memory. However, a
   neural circuitry involving specialized brain areas in bilateral
   neocortical and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres subserving visual
   working memory is observed. Findings are discussed in the light of

Abstract = {{Common or folk knowledge about animals is dominated by three dimensions:
   (1) level of cognitive complexity or ``animacy;{''} (2) dangerousness or
   ``predacity;{''} and (3) size. We investigated the neural basis of the
   perceived dangerousness or aggressiveness of animals, which we refer to
   more generally as ``perception of threat.{''} Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed neural activity evoked by viewing
   images of animal categories that spanned the dissociable semantic
   dimensions of threat and taxonomic class. The results reveal a
   distributed network for perception of threat extending along the right
   superior temporal sulcus. We compared neural representational spaces
   with target representational spaces based on behavioral judgments and a
   computational model of early vision and found a processing pathway in
   which perceived threat emerges as a dominant dimension: whereas visual
   features predominate in early visual cortex and taxonomy in lateral
   occipital and ventral temporal cortices, these dimensions fall away
   progressively from posterior to anterior temporal cortices, leaving
   threat as the dominant explanatory variable. Our results suggest that
   the perception of threat in the human brain is associated with neural
   structures that underlie perception and cognition of social actions and
   intentions, suggesting a broader role for these regions than has been
   thought previously, one that includes the perception of potential threat
   from agents independent of their biological class.}},

Abstract = {{People have a greater desire to date highly attractive partners, which
   induces intrasexual competition between same-sex individuals. The
   present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore
   whether and how intrasexual competition modulates pain empathy for a

   scanned while processing the pain of a same-sex `lucky guy' who had an
   attractive partner and one with a plain partner. The results revealed
   that participants reported lower pain intensity for the lucky guy.
   Neurally, reduced pain-related activations in anterior insula and
   anterior mid-cingulate cortex and increased activations in right
   superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and medial prefrontal gyrus (MPFC) were
   found for the lucky guy compared to the one with a plain partner. Right
   SFG and MPFC activations could predict participants' subsequent pain
   intensity ratings for the lucky guy. These findings suggest intrasexual
   competition can modulate normal empathic responses.}},

   resonance imaging was performed in 26 healthy adult participants during
   a social perception task concerning dynamic visual stimuli
   simultaneously depicting facial expressions of emotion and tactile
   sensations that could be either congruent or incongruent. Confounding
   effects due to affective valence, inhibitory top down influences,
   cross-modal integration, and conflict processing were minimized. The
   results showed that the perception of congruent, compared to incongruent
   stimuli, elicited enhanced neural activity in a set of brain regions
   including left amygdala, bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and
   left superior parietal cortex. These congruency effects did not differ
   as a function of emotion or sensation. A complementary task-related
   functional interaction analysis preliminarily suggested that amygdala
   activity depended on previous processing stages in fusiform gyrus and
   PCC. The findings provide support for the integrative processing of
   social information about others' feelings from manifold bodily sources
   (sensory-affective information) in amygdala and PCC. Given that the
   congruent stimuli were also judged as being more self-related and more
   familiar in terms of personal experience in an independent sample of
   participants, we speculate that such integrative processing might be
   mediated by the linking of external stimuli with self-experience.
   Finally, the prediction of task-related responses in amygdala by
   intrinsic functional connectivity between amygdala and PCC during a
   task-free state implies a neuro-functional basis for an individual
   predisposition for the integrative processing of social stimulus
   content.}},

Abstract = {{This multi-methodological study applied functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to investigate neural activation in a group of adolescent
   students (N = 88) during a probabilistic reinforcement learning task. We
   related patterns of emerging brain activity and individual learning
   rates to socio-motivational (in-)dependence manifested in four different
   motivation types (MTs): (1) peer-dependent MT, (2) teacher dependent MT,
   (3) peer-and-teacher-dependent MT, (4) peer-and-teacher-independent MT.
   A multinomial regression analysis revealed that the individual learning
   rate predicts students' membership to the independent MT, or the
   peer-and-teacher-dependent MT. Additionally, the striatum, a brain
   region associated with behavioral adaptation and flexibility, showed
   increased learning-related activation in students with motivational
   independence. Moreover, the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in
   behavioral control, was more active in students of the
   peer-and-teacher-dependent MT. Overall, this study offers new insights
   into the interplay of motivation and learning with (1) a focus on inter
   individual differences in the role of peers and teachers as source of
   students' individual motivation and (2) its potential neurobiological
   basis.}},

Title = {{Abnormalities of Inter- and Infra-Hemispheric Functional Connectivity in
   Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Study Using the Autism Brain Imaging Data
   Exchange Database}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) project
   revealed decreased functional connectivity in individuals with Autism
   Spectrum Disorders (ASD) relative to the typically developing controls
   (TDCs). However, it is still questionable whether the source of
   functional under-connectivity in subjects with ASD is equally
   contributed by the ipsilateral and contralateral parts of the brain. In
   this study, we decomposed the inter- and intra-hemispheric regions and
   compared the functional connectivity density (FCD) between 458 subjects
   with ASD and 517 TDCs from the ABIDE database. We quantified the inter-
   and intra-hemispheric FCDs in the brain by counting the number of
   functional connectivity with all voxels in the opposite and same
   hemispheric brain regions, respectively. Relative to TDCs, both inter-
   and intra-hemispheric FCDs in the posterior cingulate cortex,
   lingual/parahippocampal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus were significantly
   decreased in subjects with ASD. Moreover, in the ASD group, the
   restricted and repetitive behavior subscore of the Autism Diagnostic
   Observation Schedule (ADOS-RRB) score showed significant negative
   correlations with the average inter-hemispheric FCD and contralateral
   FCD in the lingual/parahippocampal gyms cluster. Also, the ADOS-RRB
   score showed significant negative correlations with the average
   contralateral FCD in the default mode network regions such as the
   posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. Taken together, our findings
   imply that a deficit of non-social functioning processing in ASD such as
   restricted and repetitive behaviors and sensory hypersensitivity could
   be determined via both inter- and intra-hemispheric functional
   disconnections.}},

Abstract = {{Social ties are crucial for physical and mental health. However,
   psychiatric patients frequently encounter social rejection. Moreover, an
   increased reactivity to social exclusion influences the development,
   progression, and treatment of various psychiatric disorders.
   Nevertheless, the neuromodulatory substrates of rejection experiences
   are largely unknown. The preferential serotonin (5-HT) 2A/1A receptor
   agonist, psilocybin (Psi), reduces the processing of negative stimuli,
   but whether 5-HT2A/1A receptor stimulation modulates the processing of
   negative social interactions remains unclear. Therefore, this
   double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over study assessed the
   neural response to social exclusion after the acute administration of
   Psi (0.215 mg/kg) or placebo (Pla) in 21 healthy volunteers by using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting-state magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Participants reported a reduced feeling of
   social exclusion after Psi vs. Pla administration, and the neural
   response to social exclusion was decreased in the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) and the middle frontal gyrus, key regions for
   social pain processing. The reduced neural response in the dACC was
   significantly correlated with Psi-induced changes in self-processing and
   decreased aspartate (Asp) content. In conclusion, 5-HT2A/1A receptor
   stimulation with psilocybin seems to reduce social pain processing in
   association with changes in self-experience. These findings may be
   relevant to the normalization of negative social interaction processing
   in psychiatric disorders characterized by increased rejection
   sensitivity. The current results also emphasize the importance of
   5-HT2A/1A receptor subtypes and the Asp system in the control of social
   functioning, and as prospective targets in the treatment of
   sociocognitive impairments in psychiatric illnesses.}},

Abstract = {{The true intentions of humans are sometimes difficult to ascertain
   exclusively from explicit expressions, such as speech, gestures, or
   facial expressions. In this experiment, functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate implicit intentions that were
   generated while a subject was reading self-relevant sentences. Short
   sentences, which were presented visually, consisted of self-relevant
   statements and a substantive verb, which indicated sentence polarity as
   either affirmative or negative. Each sentence was divided into the
   contents and the sentence ending, and the subjects were asked to respond
   with either agreement or disagreement after the complete sentence was
   presented. The overall group analysis suggested that the intention of
   the sentence response was found even before the reading of the complete
   sentences. Increased neural activation was found in the left medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during feelings of agreement compared to
   feelings of disagreement during self-relevant decision-making. In
   addition, according to the sentence ending, the decision of a response
   activated the frontopolar cortex (FPC) in the switching condition. These
   findings indicated that the implicit intentions of responses to the
   given statements were internally generated before an explicit response
   occurred, and, hence, intentions can be used to predict a subject's
   future answer.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated neural overlap between resting state
   activity and self-referential processing. This ``rest-self{''} overlap
   occurs especially in anterior cortical midline structures like the
   perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC). However, the exact
   neurotemporal and biochemical mechanisms remain to be identified.
   Therefore, we conducted a combined electroencephalography (EEG)-magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study. EEG focused on pre-stimulus (e.g.,
   prior to stimulus presentation or perception) power changes to assess
   the degree to which those changes can predict subjects' perception (and
   judgment) of subsequent stimuli as high or low self-related. MRS
   measured resting state concentration of glutamate, focusing on PACC.
   High pre-stimulus (e.g., prior to stimulus presentation or perception)
   alpha power significantly correlated with both perception of stimuli
   judged to be highly self-related and with resting state glutamate
   concentrations in the PACC. In sum, our results show (i) pre-stimulus
   (e.g., prior to stimulus presentation or perception) alpha power and
   resting state glutamate concentration to mediate rest-self overlap that
   (ii) dispose or incline subjects to assign high degrees of
   self-relatedness to perceptual stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{This neuroimaging study compares brain activation during causal
   attribution to three different attribution loci (i.e., self, another
   person, and situation) across a typical population without (N=20) or
   with subclinical autism spectrum symptoms (N=18) and a clinical
   population with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; N=11). While they
   underwent fMRI, all participants read short sentences describing
   positive and negative behaviors and thoughts of another person directed
   toward the participant (i.e., ``you{''}). Participants were then asked
   to attribute these behaviors to themselves, the other person, or the
   situation. Behavioral measures revealed self-serving attributions (i.e.,
   attributing positive events to the self, while attributing negative
   events externally from the self) in all three participant groups. Neural
   measures revealed a great deal of shared activation across the three
   attribution loci and across the three participant groups in the
   temporo-parietal junction, the posterior superior sulcus, and the
   precuneus. Comparison between groups revealed more widespread activation
   in both subclinical and clinical ASD participants, which may be
   indicative of the extraneural resources these participants invest to
   compensate their impairments.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we investigated the relationship among three
   emotion-motivation systems (adult attachment, romantic love, and sex).
   We recorded event-related potentials in 37 healthy volunteers who had
   experienced romantic love while they viewed SEX, LOVE, FRIEND, SPORT,
   and NEUTRAL images. We also measured adult attachment styles, level of
   passionate love and sexual attitudes. As expected, results showed that,
   firstly, response to love related image-stimuli and sex related
   image-stimuli on the electrophysiological data significantly different
   on N1, N2, and positive slow wave (PSW) components. Secondly, the
   different adult attachment styles affected individuals' recognition
   processing in response to love-related and sex-related images,
   especially, to sex-related images. Further analysis showed that voltages
   elicited by fearful attachment style individuals were significantly
   lower than voltages elicited by secure and dismissing attachment style
   individuals on sex-related images at frontal sites, on N1 and N2
   components. Thirdly, from behavior data, we found that adult attachment
   styles were not significantly related to any dimension of sexual
   attitudes but were significantly related to passionate love scale (PLS)
   total points. Thus, the behavior results were not in line with the
   electrophysiological results. The present study proved that adult
   attachment styles might mediate individuals' lust and attraction
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Some individuals who try electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) continue
   to use long-term. Previous research has investigated the safety of
   e-cigarettes and their potential for use in smoking cessation, but
   comparatively little research has explored chronic or habitual
   e-cigarette use. In particular, the relationship between e-cigarette
   cues and craving is unknown. We sought to bridge this gap by developing
   a novel set of e-cigarette (salient) and electronic toothbrush (neutral)
   videos for use in cue-reactivity paradigms. Additionally, we demonstrate
   the utility of this approach in a pilot fMRI study of 7 experienced
   e-cigarette users. Participants were scanned while viewing the cue
   videos before and after 10 min use of their own e-cigarettes (producing
   an 11.7 ng/ml increase in plasma nicotine concentration). A significant
   session (pre- and post-use) by video type (salient and neutral)
   interaction was exhibited in many sensorimotor areas commonly activated
   in other cue-reactivity paradigms. We did not detect significant
   cue-related activity in other brain regions notable in the craving
   literature. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed,
   including the importance of matching cue stimuli to participants'
   experiences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anhedonia is an important but understudied element of a neuroadaptive
   model underlying vulnerability to relapse in opioid dependence. Previous
   research using fMRI has shown reduced activation to pleasant stimuli in
   rostral prefrontal cortex among heroin-dependent patients in early
   recovery. This study evaluated the presence of anhedonia among recently
   withdrawn prescription opiate dependent patients (PODP) in residential
   treatment compared to control subjects. Anhedonia was assessed using
   self-report, affect-modulated startle response (AMSR), and a cue
   reactivity task during which participant's rostral prefrontal cortex
   (RPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) was monitored with
   functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The cue reactivity task
   included three distinct categories of natural reward stimuli: highly
   palatable food, positive social situations, and intimate (non-erotic)
   interactions. PODP reported greater anhedonia on self-report
   (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale), and showed reduced hedonic response to
   positive stimuli in the AMSR task relative to controls. PODP also
   exhibited reduced neural activation in bilateral RPFC and left VLPFC in
   response to food images and reduced left VLPFC in response to images
   depicting positive social situations relative to controls. No
   differences were found for emotionally intimate stimuli. When patients
   were divided into groups based on the Snaith-Hamilton criteria for the
   presence or absence of anhedonia, patients endorsing anhedonia showed
   reduced neural responses to images depicting positive social stimuli and
   food relative to patients who did not endorse anhedonia. Activations
   were in areas of RPFC that support the retrieval of episodic memories.
   The results suggest the presence of anhedonia in a subsample of PODP.

Abstract = {{The ability to experience pleasant or unpleasant feelings or to
   represent objects as ``positive{''} or ``negative{''} is known as
   representing hedonic ``valence.{''} Although scientists overwhelmingly
   agree that valence is a basic psychological phenomenon, debate continues
   about how to best conceptualize it scientifically. We used a
   meta-analysis of 397 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   positron emission tomography studies (containing 914 experimental
   contrasts and 6827 participants) to test 3 competing hypotheses about
   the brain basis of valence: the bipolarity hypothesis that positive and
   negative affect are supported by a brain system that monotonically
   increases and/or decreases along the valence dimension, the bivalent
   hypothesis that positive and negative affect are supported by
   independent brain systems, and the affective workspace hypothesis that
   positive and negative affect are supported by a flexible set of
   valence-general regions. We found little evidence for the bipolar or
   bivalent hypotheses. Findings instead supported the hypothesis that, at
   the level of brain activity measurable by fMRI, valence is flexibly
   implemented across instances by a set of valence-general limbic and

Abstract = {{Over the recent years, neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural
   mechanisms underlying the influence of expectations on perception.
   However, it seems equally reasonable to assume that expectations impact
   cognitive functions. Here we used fMRI to explore the role of
   expectations on task performance and its underlying neural mechanisms.
   43 healthy participants were randomly assigned to two groups. Using
   verbal instructions, group 1 was led to believe that pain enhances task
   performance while group 2 was instructed that pain hampers their
   performance. All participants performed a Rapid
   Serial-Visual-Presentation (RSVP) Task (target detection and short-term
   memory component) with or without concomitant painful heat stimulation
   during 3T fMRI scanning. As hypothesized, short-term memory performance
   showed an interaction between painful stimulation and expectation.
   Positive expectations induced stronger neural activation in the right
   inferior parietal cortex (IPC) during painful stimulation than negative
   expectation. Moreover, IPC displayed differential functional coupling
   with the left inferior occipital cortex under pain as a function of
   expectancy. Our data show that an individual's expectation can influence
   cognitive performance in a visual short-term memory task which is
   associated with activity and connectivity changes in brain areas
   implicated in attentional processing and task performance. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Objective: We sought to evaluate the neurophysiology of
   mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for children (MBCT-C) in youth with
   generalized, social, and/or separation anxiety disorder who were at risk
   for developing bipolar disorder. Methods: Nine youth (mean age: 132
   years) with a generalized, social, and/or separation anxiety disorder
   and a parent with bipolar disorder completed functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a continuous processing task
   with emotional and neutral distractors (CPT-END) prior to and following
   12 weeks of MBCT-C. Results: MBCT-C was associated with increases in
   activation of the bilateral insula, lentiform nucleus, and thalamus, as
   well as the left anterior cingulate while viewing emotional stimuli
   during the CPT-END, and decreases in anxiety were correlated with change
   in activation in the bilateral insula and anterior cingulate during the
   viewing of emotional stimuli (p<0.05, uncorrected; p<0.005 corrected;
   cluster size, 37 voxels). Conclusions: MBCT-C treatment in anxious youth
   with a familial history of bipolar disorder is associated with increased
   activation of brain structures that subserve interoception and the
   processing of internal stimulifunctions that are ostensibly improved by
   this treatment.}},

Title = {{Altered striatal intrinsic functional connectivity in pediatric anxiety}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{159-168}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders of
   adolescence. Behavioral and task-based imaging studies implicate altered
   reward system function, including striatal dysfunction, in adolescent
   anxiety. However, no study has yet examined alterations of the striatal
   intrinsic functional connectivity in adolescent anxiety disorders.
   The current study examines striatal intrinsic functional connectivity
   (iFC), using six bilateral striatal seeds, among 35 adolescents with
   anxiety disorders and 36 healthy comparisons.
   Anxiety is associated with abnormally low iFC within the striatum (e.g.,
   between nucleus accumbens and caudate nucleus), and between the striatum
   and prefrontal regions, including subgenual anterior cingulate cortex,
   posterior insula and supplementary motor area.
   The current findings extend prior behavioral and task-based imaging
   research, and provide novel data implicating decreased striatal iFC in
   adolescent anxiety. Alterations of striatal neurocircuitry identified in
   this study may contribute to the perturbations in the processing of
   motivational, emotional, interoceptive, and motor information seen in
   pediatric anxiety disorders. This pattern of the striatal iFC
   perturbations can guide future research on specific mechanisms
   underlying anxiety. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The self-regulation of brain activation via neurofeedback training
   offers a method to study the relationship between brain areas and
   perception in a more direct manner than the conventional mapping of
   brain responses to different types of stimuli. The current
   proof-of-concept study aimed to demonstrate that healthy volunteers can
   self-regulate activity in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) over the
   fusiform face area (FFA). Both areas are involved in higher order visual
   processing and are activated during the imagery of scenes and faces
   respectively. Participants (N=9) were required to upregulate PPA
   relative to FFA activity, and all succeeded at the task, with imagery of
   scenes being the most commonly reported mental strategy. A control group
   (N=8) underwent the same imagery and testing procedure, albeit without
   neurofeedback, in a mock MR scanner to account for any non-specific
   training effects. The up regulation of PPA activity occurred
   concurrently with activation of prefrontal and parietal areas, which
   have been associated with ideation and mental image generation. We
   tested whether successful upregulation of the PPA relative to FFA had
   consequences on perception by assessing bistable perception of faces and
   houses in a binocular rivalry task (before and after the scanning
   sessions) and categorisation of faces and scenes presented in
   transparent composite images (during scanning, interleaved with the self
   regulation blocks). Contrary to our expectations, upregulation of the
   PPA did not alter the duration of face or house perception in the
   rivalry task and response speed and accuracy in the categorisation task.
   This conclusion was supported by the results of another control
   experiment (N=10 healthy participants) that involved intensive exposure
   to category-specific stimuli and did not show any behavioural or
   perceptual changes. We conclude that differential self-regulation of
   higher visual areas can be achieved, but that perceptual biases under
   conditions of stimulus rivalry are relatively robust against such
   internal modulation of localised brain activity. This study sets the
   basis for future investigations of perceptual and behavioural
   consequences of localised self-regulation of neural activity. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Psychosis is often characterized by paranoia and poor social
   functioning. Neurally, there is evidence of functional dysconnectivity
   including abnormalities when processing facial affect. We sought to
   establish whether these abnormalities are resolved by cognitive
   behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp). The study involved 38
   outpatients with one or more persistent positive psychotic symptoms, and
   20 healthy participants. All participants completed an implicit facial
   affect processing task during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Subsequently, patients either continued to receive standard care
   only (SCO, n = 16) or received CBTp on top of standard care (+CBTp, n =
   22), with fMRI repeated 6-8 months later. To examine the mechanisms
   underlying CBTp-led changes in threat processing and appraisal,
   functional connectivity during the social threat (angry faces) condition
   was assessed separately from left amygdala and right dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) seeds. At baseline, patients, compared with
   healthy participants, showed greater amygdala connectivity with the
   insula and visual areas, but less connectivity with somatosensory areas.
   These differences normalized following CBTp and, compared with the SCO
   group, the + CBTp group showed greater increases in amygdala
   connectivity with DLPFC and inferior parietal lobule, with the latter
   correlating with improvement in positive symptoms. From the DLPFC seed,
   the + CBTp (compared with SCO) group showed significantly greater
   increase in DLPFC connectivity with other prefrontal regions including
   dorsal anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These
   findings indicate that CBTp strengthens connectivity between
   higher-order cognitive systems and those involved in threat and
   salience, potentially facilitating reappraisal.}},

Abstract = {{Depressive symptoms are common in schizophrenia, often left untreated,
   and associated with a high relapse rate, suicidal ideation, increased
   mortality, reduced social adjustment and poor quality of life. The
   neural mechanisms underlying depression in psychosis are poorly
   understood. Given reports of altered brain response to negative facial
   affect in depressive disorders, we examined brain response to emotive
   facial expressions in relation to levels of depression in people with
   psychosis. Seventy outpatients (final N = 63) and 20 healthy
   participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during an
   implicit affect processing task involving presentation of facial
   expressions of fear, anger, happiness as well as neutral expressions and
   a (no face) control condition. All patients completed Beck Depression
   Inventory (BDI-II) and had their symptoms assessed on the Positive and
   Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). In patients, depression (BDI-II) scores
   associated positively with activation of the left thalamus, extending to
   the putamen-globus pallidus, insula, inferior-middle frontal and
   para-post-pre-central gyri during fearful expressions. Furthermore,
   patients with moderate-to-severe depression had significantly higher
   activity in these brain regions during fearful expressions relative to
   patients with no, minimal, or mild depression and healthy participants.
   The study provides first evidence of enhanced brain response to fearful
   facial expressions, which signal an uncertain source of threat in the
   environment, in patients with psychosis and a high level of
   self-reported depression.}},

Abstract = {{Guilt is thought to maintain social harmony by motivating reparation.
   This study compared two methodologies commonly used to identify the
   neural correlates of guilt. The first, imagined guilt, requires
   participants to read hypothetical scenarios and then imagine themselves
   as the protagonist. The second, recollected guilt, requires participants
   to reflect on times they personally experienced guilt. In the fMRI
   scanner, participants were presented with guilt/neutral memories and
   guilt/neutral hypothetical scenarios. Contrasts confirmed a priori
   predictions that guilt memories, relative to guilt scenarios, were
   associated with significantly greater activity in regions associated
   with affect {[}anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), Caudate, Insula, orbital
   frontal cortex (OFC)] and social cognition {[}temporal pole (TP),
   precuneus). Similarly, results indicated that guilt memories, relative
   to neutral memories, were also associated with greater activity in
   affective (ACC, amygdala, Insula, OFC) and social cognition (mPFC, TP,
   precuneus, temporo-parietal junction) regions. There were no significant
   differences between guilt hypothetical scenarios and neutral
   hypothetical scenarios in either affective or social cognition regions.
   The importance of distinguishing between different guilt inductions
   inside the scanner is discussed. We offer explanations of our results
   and discuss ideas for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Negative social feedback often generates aggressive feelings and
   behavior. Prior studies have investigated the neural basis of negative
   social feedback, but the underlying neural mechanisms of aggression
   regulation following negative social feedback remain largely
   undiscovered. In the current study, participants viewed pictures of
   peers with feedback (positive, neutral or negative) to the participant's
   personal profile. Next, participants responded to the peer feedback by
   pressing a button, thereby producing a loud noise toward the peer, as an
   index of aggression. Behavioral analyses showed that negative feedback
   led to more aggression (longer noise blasts). Conjunction neuroimaging
   analyses revealed that both positive and negative feedback were
   associated with increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   and bilateral insula. In addition, more activation in the right dorsal
   lateral PFC (dlPFC) during negative feedback vs neutral feedback was
   associated with shorter noise blasts in response to negative social
   feedback, suggesting a potential role of dlPFC in aggression regulation,
   or top-down control over affective impulsive actions. This study
   demonstrates a role of the dlPFC in the regulation of aggressive social
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{We present neuroimaging markers of the remitted state of major
   depressive disorder (rMDD) during facial emotion perception in 84
   individuals during fMRI. Participants comprised 47 individuals (aged
   18-23) diagnosed with rMDD and 37 healthy controls (HCs). Participants
   classified emotional faces or animals (control condition) in the Facial
   Emotion Perception Test (FEPT) during fMRI. Behavioural performance on
   the FEPT did not differ significantly between groups. During fMRI, both
   groups demonstrated significant blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   activity in bilateral inferior frontal gyri for the faces minus animals
   (F-A) contrast. The rMDD group additionally showed BOLD activity during
   F-A in numerous regions, including the bilateral paracingulate gyri,
   middle temporal gyri and right amygdala. The rMDD group exhibited
   significantly greater activity than the HC group in regions including
   the bilateral middle temporal gyri and left superior frontal gyrus.
   Although the rMDD group did not manifest the behavioural performance
   deficits on facial emotion recognition tasks that have been observed in
   actively depressed individuals, the rMDD group nevertheless showed
   increased BOLD activity compared with never-depressed controls during
   F-A in multiple posterior brain regions, suggesting that persistent
   effects of illness or possible trait vulnerabilities may distinguish
   individuals with rMDD from never-depressed controls.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothalamic peptide oxytocin (OXT) has been identified as a key
   modulator of pair-bonding in men, but its effects in women are still
   elusive. Moreover, there is substantial evidence that hormonal
   contraception (HC) influences partner preferences and sexual
   satisfaction, which constitute core domains of OXT function. We thus
   hypothesized that OXT effects on partner-related behavioral and neural
   responses could be significantly altered in women using HC. In this
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study involving 40 pair-bonded
   women, 21 of whom were using HC, we investigated whether a 24-IU nasal
   dose of OXT would modulate brain reward responses evoked by the romantic
   partner's face relative to the faces of familiar and unfamiliar people.
   Treatment with OXT increased the perceived attractiveness of the partner
   relative to other men, which was paralleled by elevated responses in
   reward-associated regions, including the nucleus accumbens. These
   effects of OXT were absent in women using HC. Our results confirm and
   extend previous findings in men that OXT interacts with the brain reward
   system to reinforce partner value representations, indicating a common
   OXT-dependent mechanism underlying partner attraction in both sexes.
   This mechanism may be disturbed in women using HC, suggesting that
   gonadal steroids could alter partner-specific OXT effects.}},

Abstract = {{Unpredictable environments can be anxiety-provoking and elicit
   exaggerated emotional responses to aversive stimuli. Even neutral
   stimuli, when presented in an unpredictable fashion, prime anxiety-like
   behavior and elicit heightened amygdala activity. The amygdala plays a
   key role in initiating responses to biologically relevant information,
   such as facial expressions of emotion. While some expressions clearly
   signal negative (anger) or positive (happy) events, other expressions
   (e.g. surprise) are more ambiguous in that they can predict either
   valence, depending on the context. Here, we sought to determine whether
   unpredictable presentations of ambiguous facial expressions would bias
   participants to interpret them more negatively. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and facial electromyography (EMG) to
   characterize responses to predictable vs unpredictable presentations of
   surprised faces. We observed moderate but sustained increases in
   amygdala reactivity to predictable presentations of surprised faces, and
   relatively increased amygdala responses to unpredictable faces that then
   habituated, similar to previously observed responses to clearly negative
   (e.g. fearful) faces. We also observed decreased corrugator EMG
   responses to predictable surprised face presentations, similar to happy
   faces, and increased responses to unpredictable surprised face
   presentations, similar to angry faces. Taken together, these data
   suggest that unpredictability biases people to interpret ambiguous
   social cues negatively.}},

Abstract = {{Although it has been proposed that schizophrenia is characterized by
   impaired empathy, several recent studies found intact neural responses
   on tasks measuring the affective subdomain of empathy. This study
   further examined affective empathy in 21 schizophrenia outpatients and
   21 healthy controls using a validated pain empathy paradigm with two
   components: (i) observing videos of people described as medical patients
   who were receiving a painful sound stimulation treatment; (ii) listening
   to the painful sounds (to create regions of interest). The observing
   videos component incorporated experimental manipulations of perspective
   taking (instructions to imagine `Self' vs `Other' experiencing pain) and
   cognitive appraisal (information about whether treatment was `Effective'
   vs `Not Effective'). When considering activation across experimental
   conditions, both groups showed similar dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (dACC) and anterior insula (AI) activation while merely observing others
   in pain. However, there were group differences associated with
   perspective taking: controls showed relatively greater dACC and AI
   activation for the Self vs Other contrast whereas patients showed
   relatively greater activation in these and additional regions for the
   Other vs Self contrast. Although patients demonstrated grossly intact
   neural activity while observing others in pain, they showed more subtle
   abnormalities when required to toggle between imagining themselves vs

Abstract = {{The accurate estimation of the proximity of threat is important for
   biological survival and to assess relevant events of everyday life. We
   addressed the question of whether proximal as compared with distal vocal
   threat would lead to a perceptual advantage for the perceiver.
   Accordingly, we sought to highlight the neural mechanisms underlying the
   perception of proximal vs distal threatening vocal signals by the use of
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although we found that the
   inferior parietal and superior temporal cortex of human listeners
   generally decoded the spatial proximity of auditory vocalizations,
   activity in the right voice-sensitive auditory cortex was specifically
   enhanced for proximal aggressive relative to distal aggressive voices as
   compared with neutral voices. Our results shed new light on the
   processing of imminent danger signaled by proximal vocal threat and show
   the crucial involvement of the right mid voice-sensitive auditory cortex
   in such processing.}},

Abstract = {{Being a complex phenotype with substantial heritability, anxiety and
   related phenotypes are characterized by a complex polygenic basis.
   Thereby, one candidate pathway is neuronal nitric oxide (NO) signaling,
   and accordingly, rodent studies have identified NO synthase (NOS-I),
   encoded by NOS1, as a strong molecular candidate for modulating anxiety
   and hippocampus-dependent learning processes. Using a multi-dimensional
   and -methodological replication approach, we investigated the impact of
   a functional promoter polymorphism (NOS1-ex1f-VNTR) on human
   anxiety-related phenotypes in a total of 1019 healthy controls in five
   different studies. Homozygous carriers of the NOS1-ex1f short-allele
   displayed enhanced trait anxiety, worrying and depression scores.
   Furthermore, short-allele carriers were characterized by increased
   anxious apprehension during contextual fear conditioning. While
   autonomous measures (fear-potentiated startle) provided only suggestive
   evidence for a modulatory role of NOS1-ex1f-VNTR on (contextual) fear
   conditioning processes, neural activation at the amygdala/anterior
   hippocampus junction was significantly increased in short-allele
   carriers during context conditioning. Notably, this could not be
   attributed to morphological differences. In accordance with data from a
   plethora of rodent studies, we here provide converging evidence from
   behavioral, subjective, psychophysiological and neuroimaging studies in
   large human cohorts that NOS-I plays an important role in anxious
   apprehension but provide only limited evidence for a role in
   (contextual) fear conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{In real world situations, we typically listen to voice prosody against a
   background crowded with auditory stimuli. Voices and background can both
   contain behaviorally relevant features and both can be selectively in
   the focus of attention. Adequate responses to threat-related voices
   under such conditions require that the brain unmixes reciprocally masked
   features depending on variable cognitive resources. It is unknown which
   brain systems instantiate the extraction of behaviorally relevant
   prosodic features under varying combinations of prosody valence,
   auditory background complexity and attentional focus. Here, we used
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the
   effects of high background sound complexity and attentional focus on
   brain activation to angry and neutral prosody in humans. Results show
   that prosody effects in mid superior temporal cortex were gated by
   background complexity but not attention, while prosody effects in the
   amygdala and anterior superior temporal cortex were gated by attention
   but not background complexity, suggesting distinct emotional prosody
   processing limitations in different regions. Crucially, if attention was
   focused on the highly complex background, the differential processing of
   emotional prosody was prevented in all brain regions, suggesting that in
   a distracting, complex auditory world even threatening voices may go
   unnoticed.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The habenula has been implicated in predicting negative events and in
   responding to unexpected negative outcomes. Animal models of depression
   have supported the hypothesis that perturbations in habenula activity
   contribute to the pathophysiology of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a
   psychiatric illness characterized by abnormalities in responding to
   negative feedback and by pessimism in evaluating the likelihood of
   future events. No research to date, however, has examined human habenula
   responses to potential and experienced negative outcomes in MDD. In this
   study, depressed and healthy control participants performed a
   probabilistic guessing task for monetary rewards and penalties during
   high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging of the habenula.
   In healthy adults, we observed a pattern of habenula activation
   consistent with its hypothesized role in predicting future losses and
   responding to suboptimal outcomes. In contrast, in depressed
   participants the left habenula was not activated significantly during
   the prediction or experience of monetary penalty. Complementing this
   group difference, attenuated habenula activation to negative feedback in
   control participants was associated with levels of shame and rumination.
   The results of this study suggest that depressed individuals are
   characterized by dysfunction in a neural system involved in generating
   expectations and comparing expectations with objective outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex and global phenomenon that
   requires a multi-perspective analysis. Nevertheless, the number of
   neuroscientific studies conducted on this issue is scarce as compared
   with studies of other types of violence, and no neuroimaging studies
   comparing batterers to other criminals have been conducted. Thus, the
   main aim of this study was to compare the brain functioning of batterers
   to that of other criminals when they are exposed to IPV or general
   violence pictures. An fMRI study was conducted in 21 batterers and 20
   other criminals while they observed IPV images (IPVI), general violence
   images (GVI) and neutral images (NI). Results demonstrated that
   batterers, compared with other criminals, exhibited a higher activation
   in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and in the middle
   prefrontal cortex and a decreased activation in the superior prefrontal
   cortex to IPVI compared to NI. The paired t-test comparison between IPVI
   and GVI for each group showed engagement of the medial prefrontal
   cortex, the posterior cingulate and the left angular cortices to IPVI in
   the batterer group only. These results could have important implications
   for a better understanding of the IPV phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Cognitive control as well as stress reactivity is assumed to
   depend on prefrontal dopamine and decline with age. Because Ginkgo
   biloba extract EGb761 increases prefrontal dopamine in animals, we
   assessed its effects on cognitive functions related to prefrontal
   dopamine.
   Methods Effects of 240-mg EGb761 daily on task-set-switching,
   response-inhibition, delayed response, prospective-memory, task-related
   fMRI-BOLD-signals and the Trier Social Stress-Test were explored in a
   randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind pilot-trial in 61 elderly
   volunteers with subjective memory impairment.
   Results Baseline-FMRI-data showed BOLD-responses in regions commonly
   activated by the specific tasks. Task-switch-costs decreased with EGb761
   compared to placebo (ANOVA-interaction: GroupxTimexSwitch-Costs p=0.018,
   multiple tests uncorrected), indicating improved cognitive flexibility.
   Go-NoGo-task reaction-times corrected for error-rates indicated a trend
   for improved response inhibition. No treatment effects were found for
   the delayed response and prospective-memory tasks and fMRI-data. A
   non-significant trend indicated a potentially accelerated endocrine
   stress-recovery. EGb761 was safe and well tolerated.
   Conclusion We observed indications for improved cognitive flexibility
   without changes in brain activation, suggesting increased processing
   efficiency with EGb761. Together with a trend for improved response
   inhibition results are compatible with mild enhancement of prefrontal
   dopamine. These conclusions on potential beneficial effect of EGb761 on
   prefrontal dopaminergic functions should be confirmed by direct
   measurements. (C) 2016 The Authors. Human Psychopharmacology: Clinical

Abstract = {{Background Negative symptoms of schizophrenia can be grouped in 2
   dimensions: apathy and diminished expression. Increasing evidence
   suggests that negative symptoms are associated with altered neural
   activity of subcortical and cortical regions in the brain reward system.
   However, the neurobiological basis of the distinct symptom dimensions
   within negative symptoms is still poorly understood. The primary aim of
   our study was to examine the neural correlates of the negative symptom
   dimensions apathy and diminished expression during a reward processing
   task.
   Methods Patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls underwent
   event-related fMRI while performing a variant of the Monetary Incentive
   Delay Task. We assessed negative symptom dimensions using the Brief
   Negative Symptom Scale.
   Results We included 27 patients and 25 controls in our study. Both
   groups showed neural activation indicated by blood oxygen-level
   dependent signal in the ventral striatum during reward anticipation.
   Ventral striatal activation during reward anticipation showed a strong
   negative correlation with apathy. Importantly, this effect was not
   driven by cognitive ability, medication, depressive or positive
   symptoms. In contrast, no significant correlation with the diminished
   expression dimension was observed.
   Limitations Although the results remain significant when controlling for
   chlorpromazine equivalents, we cannot fully exclude potential
   confounding effects of medication with atypical antipsychotics.
   Conclusion The specific correlation of ventral striatal hypoactivation
   during reward anticipation with apathy demonstrates a differentiation of
   apathy and diminished expression on a neurobiological level and provides
   strong evidence for different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying
   these 2 negative symptom dimensions. Our findings contribute to a
   multilevel framework in which apathy and motivational impairment in
   patients with schizophrenia can be described on psychopathological,
   behavioural and neural levels.}},

Abstract = {{Background Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and Williams-Beuren syndrome
   (WBS) are 2 conditions with major differences in terms of genetics,
   development and cognitive profiles. Both conditions are associated with
   compromised abilities in overlapping areas, including social approach,
   processing of social emotional cues and gaze behaviour, and to some
   extent they are associated with opposite behaviours in these domains. We
   examined common and distinct patterns of brain activation during a
   facial emotion processing paradigm in patients with SAD and WBS.
   Methods We examined patients with SAD and WBS and healthy controls
   matched by age and laterality using functional MRI during the processing
   of happy, fearful and angry faces.
   Results We included 20 patients with SAD and 20 with WBS as well as 20
   matched controls in our study. Patients with SAD and WBS did not differ
   in the pattern of limbic activation. We observed differences in early
   visual areas of the face processing network in patients with WBS and
   differences in the cortical prefrontal regions involved in the top-down
   regulation of anxiety and in the fusiform gyrus for patients with SAD.
   Compared with those in the SAD and control groups, participants in the
   WBS group did not activate the right lateral inferior occipital cortex.
   In addition, compared with controls, patients with WBS hypoactivated the
   posterior primary visual cortex and showed significantly less
   deactivation in the right temporal operculum. Participants in the SAD
   group showed decreased prefrontal activation compared with those in the
   WBS and control groups. In addition, compared with controls,
   participants with SAD showed decreased fusiform activation. Participants
   with SAD and WBS also differed in the pattern of activation in the
   superior temporal gyrus, a region that has been linked to gaze
   processing.
   Limitations The results observed in the WBS group are limited by the IQ
   of the WBS sample; however, the specificity of findings suggests that
   the pattern of brain activation observed for WBS is more likely to
   reflect a neurobiological substrate rather than intellectual impairment
   per se.
   Conclusion Patients with SAD and WBS showed common and specific patterns
   of brain activation. Our results highlight the role of cortical regions
   during facial emotion processing in individuals with SAD and WBS.}},

Abstract = {{Background The mesolimbic dopamine system, composed primarily of
   dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area that project to
   striatal structures, is considered to be the key mediator of
   reinforcement-related mechanisms in the brain. Prompted by a genome-wide
   association meta-analysis implicating the Ras-specific guanine
   nucleotide-releasing factor 2 (RASGRF2) gene in the regulation of
   alcohol intake in men, we have recently shown that male Rasgrf2(-/-)
   mice exhibit reduced ethanol intake and preference accompanied by a
   perturbed mesolimbic dopamine system. We therefore propose that these
   mice represent a valid model to further elucidate the precise genes and
   mechanisms regulating mesolimbic dopamine functioning.
   Methods Transcriptomic data from the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) of male
   Rasgrf2(-/-) mice and wild-type controls were analyzed by weighted gene
   coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). We performed follow-up genetic
   association tests in humans using a sample of male adolescents from the
   IMAGEN study characterized for binge drinking (n = 905) and ventral
   striatal activation during an fMRI reward task (n = 608).
   Results The WGCNA analyses using accumbal transcriptomic data revealed
   37 distinct modules, or functionally related groups of genes. Two of
   these modules were significantly associated with Rasgrf2 knockout
   status: M5 (p < 0.001) and M6 (p < 0.001). In follow-up translational
   analyses we found that human orthologues for the M5 module were
   significantly (p < 0.01) enriched with genetic association signals for
   binge drinking in male adolescents. Furthermore, the most significant
   locus, originating from the EH-domain containing 4 (EHD4) gene (p <
   0.001), was also significantly associated with altered ventral striatal
   activity in male adolescents performing an fMRI reward task
   (p(empirical) < 0.001).
   Limitations It was not possible to determine the extent to which the M5
   module was dysregulated in Rasgrf2(-/-) mice by perturbed mesolimbic
   dopamine signalling or by the loss of Rasgrf2 function in the NAcc.
   Conclusion Taken together, our findings indicate that the accumbal M5
   module, initially identified as being dysregulated in male Rasgrf2(-/-)
   mice, is also relevant for human alcohol-related phenotypes potentially
   through the modulation of reinforcement mechanisms in the NAcc. We
   therefore propose that the genes comprising this module represent
   important candidates for further elucidation within the context of
   alcohol-related phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Spatial working memory (SWM) dysfunction is a feature of
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Previous studies
   suggested that behavioral performance in self-generated SWM improves
   through development in children with and without ADHD. Nevertheless,
   developmental changes in the neural underpinnings of self-generated SWM
   are unknown.
   Method: Using near-infrared spectroscopy, hemodynamic activity in the
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) was measured in 30 children with ADHD (9.5 +/-
   1.6 years-old) and 35 TD children (9.0 +/- 1.6 years-old) while they
   performed a self-generated SWM task. We then investigated correlations
   between age and behavioral performance, and between age and hemodynamic
   activity in the PFC for each group.
   Results: Both groups showed a negative correlation with age and number
   of errors {[}ADHD: r(28) = -0.37, p = 0.040; TD: r(33) = -0.59, p <
   0.001], indicating that self-generated SWM improves through development.
   The TD group showed a positive correlation between age and oxygenated
   hemoglobin in the frontal pole {[}10ch: r(33) = 0.41, p = 0.013; 11ch;
   r(33) = 0.44, p = 0.008] and bilateral lateral PFC {[}4ch: r(33) = 0.34,
   p = 0.049; 13ch; r(33) = 0.54, p = 0.001], while no significant
   correlation was found in the ADHD group. Furthermore, regression slopes
   for the frontal pole significantly differed between the TD and ADHD
   groups {[}10ch: t(61) = 2.35, p = 0.021; 11ch: t(61) = 2.05, p = 0.044].
   Conclusion: Children with ADHD showed abnormalities in functional
   maturation of the frontal pole, which plays a role in manipulating and
   maintaining information associated with self-generated behavior. (C)

Abstract = {{The ability to process and respond to emotional facial expressions is a
   critical skill for healthy social and emotional development. There has
   been growing interest in understanding the neural circuitry underlying
   development of emotional processing, with previous research implicating
   functional connectivity between amygdala and frontal regions. However,
   existing work has focused on threatening emotional faces, raising
   questions regarding the extent to which these developmental patterns are
   specific to threat or to emotional face processing more broadly. In the
   current study, we examined age-related changes in brain activity and
   amygdala functional connectivity during an fMRI emotional face matching
   task (including angry, fearful, and happy faces) in 61 healthy subjects
   aged 7-25 years. We found age-related decreases in ventral medial
   prefrontal cortex activity in response to happy faces but not to angry
   or fearful faces, and an age-related change (shifting from positive to
   negative correlation) in amygdala-anterior cingulate cortex/medial
   prefrontal cortex (ACC/mPFC) functional connectivity to all emotional
   faces. Specifically, positive correlations between amygdala and ACC/mPFC
   in children changed to negative correlations in adults, which may
   suggest early emergence of bottom-up amygdala excitatory signaling to
   ACC/mPFC in children and later development of top-down inhibitory
   control of ACC/mPFC over amygdala in adults. Age-related changes in
   amygdala-ACC/mPFC connectivity did not vary for processing of different
   facial emotions, suggesting changes in amygdala-ACC/mPFC connectivity
   may underlie development of broad emotional processing, rather than
   threat-specific processing. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1684-1695, 2016. (c) 2016

Abstract = {{Face perception is essential for daily and social activities.
   Neuroimaging studies have revealed a distributed face network (FN)
   consisting of multiple regions that exhibit preferential responses to
   invariant or changeable facial information. However, our understanding
   about how these regions work collaboratively to facilitate facial
   information processing is limited. Here, we focused on changeable facial
   information processing, and investigated how the functional integration
   of the FN is related to the performance of facial expression
   recognition. To do so, we first defined the FN as voxels that responded
   more strongly to faces than objects, and then used a voxel-based global
   brain connectivity method based on resting-state fMRI to characterize
   the within-network connectivity (WNC) of each voxel in the FN. By
   relating the WNC and performance in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes
   Test across participants, we found that individuals with stronger WNC in
   the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) were better at
   recognizing facial expressions. Further, the resting-state functional
   connectivity (FC) between the rpSTS and right occipital face area
   (rOFA), early visual cortex (EVC), and bilateral STS were positively
   correlated with the ability of facial expression recognition, and the
   FCs of EVC-pSTS and OFA-pSTS contributed independently to facial
   expression recognition. In short, our study highlights the behavioral
   significance of intrinsic functional integration of the FN in facial
   expression processing, and provides evidence for the hub-like role of
   the rpSTS for facial expression recognition. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{We asked whether brain connectomics can predict response to treatment
   for a neuropsychiatric disorder better than conventional clinical
   measures. Pre-treatment resting-state brain functional connectivity and
   diffusion-weighted structural connectivity were measured in 38 patients
   with social anxiety disorder (SAD) to predict subsequent treatment
   response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We used a priori
   bilateral anatomical amygdala seed-driven resting connectivity and
   probabilistic tractography of the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus
   together with a data-driven multivoxel pattern analysis of whole-brain
   resting-state connectivity before treatment to predict improvement in
   social anxiety after CBT. Each connectomic measure improved the
   prediction of individuals' treatment outcomes significantly better than
   a clinical measure of initial severity, and combining the multimodal
   connectomics yielded a fivefold improvement in predicting treatment
   response. Generalization of the findings was supported by leave-one-out
   cross-validation. After dividing patients into better or worse
   responders, logistic regression of connectomic predictors and initial
   severity combined with leave-one-out cross-validation yielded a
   categorical prediction of clinical improvement with 81\% accuracy, 84\%
   sensitivity and 78\% specificity. Connectomics of the human brain,
   measured by widely available imaging methods, may provide brain-based
   biomarkers (neuromarkers) supporting precision medicine that better
   guide patients with neuropsychiatric diseases to optimal available
   treatments, and thus translate basic neuroimaging into medical practice.}},

Abstract = {{The neural correlates of encoding mode, or the state of forming new
   memory episodes, have been found to change with age and mnemonic
   training. However, it is unclear whether neural correlates of encoding
   success, termed subsequent-memory (SM) effects, also differ by age and
   mnemonic skill. In a multi-session training study, we investigated
   whether SM effects are altered by instruction and training in a mnemonic
   skill, and whether such alterations differ among children, younger
   adults, and older adults. Before and after strategy training, fMRI data
   were collected while participants were memorizing word pairs. In all age
   groups, participants receiving training showed greater performance gains
   than control group participants. Analysis of task-relevant regions
   showed training-induced reductions in SM effects in left frontal
   regions. Reductions in SM effects largely generalized across age and
   primarily reflected greater training-induced activation increases for
   omissions than for remembered items, indicating that training resulted
   in more consistent use of the mnemonic strategy. The present results
   reveal no major age differences in SM effects in children, younger
   adults, and older adults. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and social anxiety
   disorder (SAD) are characterized by biased perception and processing of
   potentially threatening stimuli. A hyper-reactivity of the fear-circuit
   {[}e. g. amygdala, anterior cingulate (ACC)] has been consistently
   reported using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in SAD in
   comparison with healthy controls (HCs). Studies investigating the
   processing of specific emotional stimuli in OCD reported mainly
   orbitofrontal-striatal abnormalities. The goal of this study was to
   examine similar/common and differential neurobiological responses in OCD
   and SAD using unspecific emotional stimuli.
   Method. Fifty-four subjects participated: two groups (each n = 18) of
   outpatients with a current diagnosis of OCD or SAD, and 18 HCs. All
   subjects underwent fMRI while anticipating and perceiving unspecific
   visual stimuli with prior announced emotional valence (e. g. positive).
   Results. Compared to HCs, the combined patient group showed increased
   activation in amygdala, caudate and prefrontal/ orbitofrontal cortex
   while anticipating unspecific emotional stimuli. Caudate was more active
   in the combined patient group during perception. A comparison between
   the OCD and the SAD samples revealed increased amygdala and decreased
   rostral ACC activation in OCD patients during perception, but no
   differences in the anticipation phase.
   Conclusions. Overall, we could identify common fronto-subcortical
   hyper-reactivity in OCD and SAD while anticipating and perceiving
   unspecific emotional stimuli. While differential neurobiological
   responses between OCD and SAD when processing specific stimuli are
   evident from the literature, differences were less pronounced using
   unspecific stimuli. This could indicate a disturbance of emotion
   regulation common to both OCD and SAD.}},

   This result was specific to fearful faces and strongest in the
   centromedial subregion of the amygdala. Arrest record was positively
   related to basolateral amygdala reactivity to fearful and angry faces.
   Results were strongest among those identified as African American and

Abstract = {{Subthreshold depression (StD) is a highly prevalent condition associated
   with increased service utilization and social morbidity. Nevertheless,
   due to limitations in current diagnostic systems that set the boundary
   for major depressive disorder (MDD), very few brain imaging studies on
   the neurobiology of StD have been carried out, and its underlying
   neurobiological mechanism remains unclear. In recent years, accumulating
   evidence suggests that the disruption of the default mode network (DMN),
   a network involved in self-referential processing, affective cognition,
   and emotion regulation, is involved in major depressive disorder. Using
   independent component analysis, we investigated resting-state default
   mode network (DMN) functional connectivity (FC) changes in two cohorts
   of StD patients with different age ranges (young and middle-aged, n =
   57) as well as matched controls (n = 79). We found significant FC
   increase between the DMN and ventral striatum (key region in the reward
   network), in both cohorts of StD patients in comparison with controls.
   In addition, we also found the FC between the DMN and ventral striatum
   was positively and significantly associated with scores on the Center
   for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), a measurement of
   depressive symptomatology. We speculate that this enhanced FC between
   the DMN and the ventral striatum may reflect a self compensation to
   ameliorate the lowered reward function. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{Among multiple etiological factors of depressive disorders, childhood
   maltreatment (CM) gains increasing attention as it confers
   susceptibility for depression and predisposes to chronicity. CM
   assumedly inhibits social-cognitive development, entailing interactional
   problems as observed in chronic depression (CD), especially in affective
   theory of mind (ToM). However, the extent of CM among CD patients varies
   notably as does the severity of depressive symptoms. We tested whether
   the extent of CM or depressive symptoms correlates with affective ToM
   functions in CD patients. Regional brain activation measured by
   functional magnetic resonance imaging during an affective ToM task was
   tested for correlation with CM, assessed by the Childhood Trauma
   Questionnaire (CTQ), and symptom severity, assessed by the
   Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), in 25 unmedicated CD
   patients (mean age 4152, SD 11.13). Amygdala activation during affective
   ToM correlated positively with CTQ total scores, while (para)hippocampal
   response correlated negatively with MADRS scores. Our findings suggest
   that differential amygdala activation in affective ToM in CD is
   substantially modulated by previous CM and not by the pathophysiological
   equivalents of current depressive symptoms. This illustrates the
   amygdala's role in the mediation of CM effects. The negative correlation
   of differential (para)hippocampal activation and depressive symptom
   severity indicates reduced integration of interactional experiences
   during depressive states. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Synchronized behavior (chanting, singing, praying, dancing) is found in
   all human cultures and is central to religious, military, and political
   activities, which require people to act collaboratively and cohesively;
   however, we know little about the neural underpinnings of many kinds of
   synchronous behavior (e.g., vocal behavior) or its role in establishing
   and maintaining group cohesion. In the present study, we measured neural
   activity using fMRI while participants spoke simultaneously with another
   person. We manipulated whether the couple spoke the same sentence
   (allowing synchrony) or different sentences (preventing synchrony), and
   also whether the voice the participant heard was ``live{''} (allowing
   rich reciprocal interaction) or prerecorded (with no such mutual
   influence). Synchronous speech was associated with increased activity in
   posterior and anterior auditory fields. When, and only when,
   participants spoke with a partner who was both synchronous and
   ``live,{''} we observed a lack of the suppression of auditory cortex,
   which is commonly seen as a neural correlate of speech production.
   Instead, auditory cortex responded as though it were processing another
   talker's speech. Our results suggest that detecting synchrony leads to a
   change in the perceptual consequences of one'sownactions: they are
   processed as though they were other-, rather than self-produced. This
   may contribute to our understanding of synchronized behavior as a
   group-bonding tool.}},

Abstract = {{Altruistic behavior varies considerably across people and decision
   contexts. The relevant computational and motivational mechanisms that
   underlie its heterogeneity, however, are poorly understood. Using a
   charitable giving task together with multivariate decoding techniques,
   we identified three distinct psychological mechanisms underlying
   altruistic decision-making (empathy, perspective taking, and attentional
   reorienting) and linked them to dissociable neural computations. Neural
   responses in the anterior insula (AI) (but not temporoparietal junction
   {[}TPJ]) encoded trial-wise empathy for beneficiaries, whereas the TPJ
   (but not AI) predicted the degree of perspective taking. Importantly,
   the relative influence of both socio-cognitive processes differed across
   individuals: participants whose donation behavior was heavily influenced
   by affective empathy exhibited higher predictive accuracies for
   generosity in AI, whereas those who strongly relied on cognitive
   perspective taking showed improved predictions of generous donations in
   TPJ. Furthermore, subject-specific contributions of both processes for
   donations were reflected in participants' empathy and perspective taking
   responses in a separate fMRI task (EmpaToM), suggesting that
   process-specific inputs into altruistic choices may reflect
   participants' general propensity to either empathize or mentalize.
   Finally, using independent attention task data, we identified shared
   neural codes for attentional reorienting and generous donations in the
   posterior superior temporal sulcus, suggesting that domain-general
   attention shifts also contribute to generous behavior (but not in TPJ or
   AI). Overall, our findings demonstrate highly specific roles of AI for
   affective empathy and TPJ for cognitive perspective taking as precursors
   of prosocial behavior and suggest that these discrete routes of social
   cognition differentially drive intraindividual and interindividual
   differences in altruistic behavior.}},

Title = {{Neural Correlates of Sex/Gender Differences in Humor Processing for
   Different Joke Types}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Humor operates through a variety of techniques, which first generate
   surprise and then amusement and laughter once the unexpected incongruity
   is resolved. As different types of jokes use different techniques, the
   corresponding humor processes also differ. The present study builds on
   the framework of the `tri-component theory of humor,' which details the
   mechanisms involved in cognition (comprehension), affect (appreciation),
   and laughter (expression). This study seeks to identify differences
   among joke types and between sexes/genders in the neural mechanisms
   underlying humor processing. Three types of verbal jokes,
   bridging-inference jokes (BJs), exaggeration jokes (EJs), and ambiguity
   jokes (AJs), were used as stimuli. The findings revealed differences in
   brain activity for an interaction between sex/gender and joke type. For
   BJs, women displayed greater activation in the ternporoparietal
   mesocortical-motor network than men, demonstrating the importance of the
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ) presumably for `theory of mind'
   processing, the orbitofrontal cortex for motivational functions and
   reward coding, and the supplementary motor area for laughter. Women also
   showed greater activation than men in the frontal-mesolimbic network
   associated with EJs, including the anterior (frontopolar) prefrontal
   cortex (aPFC, BA 10) for executive control processes, and the amygdala
   and midbrain for reward anticipation and salience processes. Conversely,
   AJs elicited greater activation in men than women in the
   frontal-paralimbic network, including the dorsal prefrontal cortex
   (dPFC) and parahippocampal gyrus. All joke types elicited greater
   activation in the aPFC of women than of men, whereas men showed greater
   activation than women in the dPFC. To confirm the findings related to
   sex/gender differences, random group analysis and within group variance
   analysis were also performed. These findings help further establish the
   mechanisms underlying the processing of different joke types for the
   sexes/genders and provide a neural foundation for a theory of sex/gender
   differences in humor.}},

Abstract = {{Anecdotal and correlational evidence suggests a relationship between
   social ostracism and alcohol dependence. Furthermore, a recent fMRI
   investigation found differences in the neural correlates associated with
   ostracism in people with alcohol dependence compared to healthy
   controls. We predicted that acutely administered alcohol would reduce
   the negative effects of social ostracism. Alcohol (0.4 g/kg) or matched
   placebo was administered to a sample of 32 hazardous drinkers over two
   sessions in a randomized, double-blind, cross over design. In each
   session, participants were exposed to an ostracism event via the
   computerized ball passing game, ``Cyberball.{''} In order to quantify
   the effects of ostracism, the fundamental needs questionnaire was
   completed twice on each testing session; immediately after (i) social
   inclusion and (ii) social exclusion. Ostracism caused robust changes to
   scores on the fundamental needs questionnaire, in line with previous
   literature. Alcohol administration did not influence the effects of
   simulated social ostracism, which was supported by a Bayesian analysis.
   Exploratory analyses revealed a negative relationship between age and
   ostracism induced fundamental needs threat across both sessions. In
   conclusion, a moderate dose of alcohol did not influence experience of
   simulated social ostracism in hazardous drinkers. Further research is
   needed to establish the effects of alcohol administration on social
   ostracism using different doses and populations of alcohol users.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{The insular cortex has consistently been associated with various aspects
   of emotion regulation and social interaction, including anger processing
   and overt aggression. Aggression research distinguishes proactive or
   instrumental aggression from retaliation, i. e. aggression in response
   to provocation. Here, we investigated the specific role of the insular
   cortex during retaliation, employing a controlled behavioral aggression
   paradigm implementing different levels of provocation. Fifteen healthy
   male volunteers underwent whole brain functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to identify brain regions involved in interaction with
   either a provoking or a non-provoking opponent. FMRI group analyses were
   complemented by examining the parametric modulations of brain activity
   related to the individual level of displayed aggression. These analyses
   identified a hemispheric lateralization as well as an anatomical
   segregation of insular cortex with specifically the left posterior part
   being involved in retaliation. The left-lateralization of insular
   activity during retaliation is in accordance with evidence from

   frontocortical dominance during anger processing and aggressive acts.
   The posterior localization of insular activity, on the other hand,
   suggests a spatial segregation within insular cortex with particularly
   the posterior part being involved in the processing of emotions that
   trigger intense bodily sensations and immediate action tendencies.}},

   Choices}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{To understand the neural processing that underpins dishonest behavior in
   an economic exchange game task, this study employed both functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potential (ERP)
   methodologies to examine the neural conditions of 25 participants while
   they were making either dishonest or honest choices. It was discovered
   that dishonest choices, contrary to honest choices, elicited stronger
   fMRI activations in bilateral striatum and anterior insula. It also
   induced fluctuations in ERP amplitudes within two time windows, which
   are 270-30 milliseconds before and 110-290 milliseconds after the
   response, respectively. Importantly, when making either dishonest or
   honest choices, human and computer counterparts were associated with
   distinct fMRI activations in the left insula and different ERP
   amplitudes at medial and right central sites from 80 milliseconds before
   to 250 milliseconds after the response. These results support the
   hypothesis that there would be distinct neural processing during making
   dishonest decisions, especially when the subject considers the interests
   of the counterpart. Furthermore, the fMRI and ERP findings, together
   with ERP source reconstruction, clearly delineate the temporal sequence
   of the neural processes of a dishonest decision: the striatum is
   activated before response, then the left insula is involved around the
   time of response, and finally the thalamus is activated after response.}},

Abstract = {{By combining different facial muscle actions, called action units,
   humans can produce an extraordinarily large number of facial
   expressions. Computational models and studies in cognitive science and
   social psychology have long hypothesized that the brain needs to
   visually interpret these action units to understand other people's
   actions and intentions. Surprisingly, no studies have identified the
   neural basis of the visual recognition of these action units. Here,
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging and an innovative machine
   learning analysis approach, we identify a consistent and differential
   coding of action units in the brain. Crucially, in a brain region
   thought to be responsible for the processing of changeable aspects of
   the face, multivoxel pattern analysis could decode the presence of
   specific action units in an image. This coding was found to be
   consistent across people, facilitating the estimation of the perceived
   action units on participants not used to train the multivoxel decoder.
   Furthermore, this coding of action units was identified when
   participants attended to the emotion category of the facial expression,
   suggesting an interaction between the visual analysis of action units
   and emotion categorization as predicted by the computational models
   mentioned above. These results provide the first evidence for a
   representation of action units in the brain and suggest a mechanism for
   the analysis of large numbers of facial actions and a loss of this
   capacity in psychopathologies.}},

Abstract = {{In the current study, we conducted a behavioral experiment to test the
   mate coping effect and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   experiment to test the neural basis involved in the social learning
   process of mate copying. In the behavioral experiment, participants were
   asked to rate the attractiveness of isolated opposite sex (potential
   mates) facial photographs, then shown the targets associating with a
   neutral-faced model with textual cues indicating the models' attitude
   (interested vs. not-interested) toward the potential mates, and then
   asked to re-evaluate the potential mates' attractiveness. Using a
   similar procedure as the behavioral experiment, participants were
   scanned while observing the compound images in the fMRI experiment. The
   mate copying effect was confirmed in the behavioral experiment greater
   increase in attractiveness ratings was observed for opposite-sex
   photographs in the interested than in the not-interested condition. The
   fMRI results showed that the dorsolateral prefrontal gyrus (DLPFC) was
   significantly active in the comparison of interested not-interested
   condition, suggesting that a cognitive integration and selection
   function may be involved when participants process information from
   conditions related to mate copying.}},

Title = {{Increased frequency of social interaction is associated with enjoyment
   enhancement and reward system activation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Positive social interactions contribute to the sense that one's life has
   meaning. Enjoyment of feelings associated through social interaction
   motivates humans to build social connections according to their personal
   preferences. Therefore, we hypothesized that social interaction itself
   activates the reward system in a manner that depends upon individual
   interaction preferences. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which 38
   participants played a virtual ball-toss game in which the number of ball
   tosses to the participant was either similar to (normal-frequency
   condition) or higher than (high-frequency condition) the number of
   tosses to the other players. Participants reported
   greater-than-anticipated enjoyment during the high-frequency condition,
   suggesting that receiving a social reward led to unexpected positive
   feelings. Consistent with this, the high-frequency condition produced
   stronger activation in the ventral striatum, which is part of the reward
   system, and the precuneus, representing positive self-image, which might
   be translated to social reward. Furthermore, ventral striatal activation
   covaried with individual participants' preference for interactions with
   others. These findings suggest that an elevated frequency of social
   interaction is represented as a social reward, which might motivate
   individuals to promote social interaction in a manner that is modulated
   by personal preference.}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Recognition of facial expressions is crucial for effective social
   interactions. Yet, the extent to which the various face-selective
   regions in the human brain classify different facial expressions remains
   unclear. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   support vector machine pattern classification analysis to determine how
   well face-selective brain regions are able to decode different
   categories of facial expression. Subjects participated in a slow
   event-related fMRI experiment in which they were shown 32 face pictures,
   portraying four different expressions: neutral, fearful, angry, and
   happy and belonging to eight different identities. Our results showed
   that only the amygdala and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS)
   were able to accurately discriminate between these expressions, albeit
   in different ways: the amygdala discriminated fearful faces from
   non-fearful faces, whereas STS discriminated neutral from emotional
   (fearful, angry and happy) faces. In contrast to these findings on the
   classification of emotional expression, only the fusiform face area
   (FFA) and anterior inferior temporal cortex (aIT) could discriminate
   among the various facial identities. Further, the amygdala and STS were
   better than FFA and aIT at classifying expression, while FFA and aIT
   were better than the amygdala and STS at classifying identity. Taken
   together, our findings indicate that the decoding of facial emotion and
   facial identity occurs in different neural substrates: the amygdala and
   STS for the former and FFA and aIT for the latter. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Joint attention, the shared attentional focus of at least two people on
   a third significant object, is one of the earliest steps in social
   development and an essential aspect of reciprocal interaction. However,
   the neural basis of joint attention (JA) in the course of development is
   completely unknown. The present study made use of an interactive
   eye-tracking paradigm in order to examine the developmental trajectories
   of JA and the influence of a familiar interaction partner during the
   social encounter. Our results show that across children and adolescents
   JA elicits a similar network of ``social brain{''} areas as well as
   attention and motor control associated areas as in adults. While
   other-initiated JA particularly recruited visual, attention and social
   processing areas, self-initiated JA specifically activated areas related
   to social cognition, decision-making, emotions and motivational/reward
   processes highlighting the rewarding character of self-initiated JA.
   Activation was further enhanced during self-initiated JA with a familiar
   interaction partner. With respect to developmental effects, activation
   of the precuneus declined from childhood to adolescence and additionally
   shifted from a general involvement in JA towards a more specific
   involvement for self-initiated JA. Similarly, the temporoparietal
   junction (TPJ) was broadly involved in JA in children and more
   specialized for self-initiated JA in adolescents. Taken together, this
   study provides first-time data on the developmental trajectories of JA
   and the effect of a familiar interaction partner incorporating the
   interactive character of JA, its reciprocity and motivational aspects.

Abstract = {{Competition enhances learning under certain circumstances. However,
   little is known about how the neural mechanisms involved in a
   competition during the episodic encoding are modulated by the social
   distance of personal relationships with opponents. To investigate this
   issue, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we scanned
   healthy young adults during a competition with their familiar friends
   and unfamiliar others in the episodic encoding. Three major findings
   emerged from this study. First, activations in the right temporoparietal
   junction (rTPJ) were significantly greater in the competition with
   familiar friends than with unfamiliar others, and the activations in
   this region were significantly correlated with the subjective ratings of
   motivation. Second, striatum and amygdala activations increased by the
   competition with familiar friends were significantly correlated with the
   increased ratings of pleasantness, which reflected emotionally positive
   feelings in victory for the competition with familiar opponents. Third,
   the functional connectivity between the rTPJ and reward-related regions,
   including the striatum and substantia nigra, was higher in the
   competition with familiar friends than with unfamiliar others. Taken
   together with our behavioral findings, in which memories encoded by
   competing with familiar friends were remembered more accurately than
   those with unfamiliar others, the interacting mechanisms between the
   rTPJ that is involved in social motivation and the reward-related
   regions that are involved in social reward could contribute to the
   enhancement of memories encoded in the competition with familiar others.

Title = {{A functional neuroimaging study of fusiform response to restricted
   interests in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: While autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by
   both social communication deficits and restricted and repetitive
   patterns of behavior and interest, literature examining possible neural
   bases of the latter class of symptoms is limited. The fusiform face area
   (FFA) is a region in the ventral temporal cortex that not only shows
   preferential responsiveness to faces but also responds to non-face
   objects of visual expertise. Because restricted interests in ASD are
   accompanied by high levels of visual expertise, the objective of this
   study was to determine the extent to which this region responds to
   images related to restricted interests in individuals with ASD, compared
   to individuals without ASD who have a strong hobby or interest.
   Methods: Children and adolescents with and without ASD with hobbies or
   interests that consumed a predetermined minimum amount of time were
   identified, and the intensity, frequency, and degree of interference of
   these interests were quantified. Each participant underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing images related to their
   personal restricted interests (in the ASD group) or strong interest or
   hobby (in the comparison group). A generalized linear model was used to
   compare the intensity and spatial extent of fusiform gyrus response
   between groups, controlling for the appearance of faces in the stimuli.
   Results: Images related to interests and expertise elicited response in
   FFA in both ASD and typically developing individuals, but this response
   was more robust in ASD.
   Conclusions: These findings add neurobiological support to behavioral
   observations that restricted interests are associated with enhanced
   visual expertise in ASD, above and beyond what would be expected for
   simply a strong interest. Further, the results suggest that brain
   regions associated with social functioning may not be inherently less
   responsive in ASD, but rather may be recruited by different
   environmental stimuli. This study contributes to our understanding of
   the neural basis of restricted interests in ASD and may provide clues
   toward developing novel interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Comprehensive analysis of brain function depends on understanding the
   dynamics of diverse neural signaling processes over large tissue volumes
   in intact animals and humans. Most existing approaches to measuring
   brain signaling suffer from limited tissue penetration, poor resolution,
   or lack of specificity for well-defined neural events. Here we discuss a
   new brain activity mapping method that overcomes some of these problems
   by combining MRI with contrast agents sensitive to neural signaling. The
   goal of this ``molecular fMRI{''} approach is to permit noninvasive
   whole-brain neuroimaging with specificity and resolution approaching
   current optical neuroimaging methods. In this article, we describe the
   context and need for molecular fMRI as well as the state of the
   technology today. We explain how major types of MRI probes work and how
   they can be sensitized to neurobiological processes, such as
   neurotransmitter release, calcium signaling, and gene expression
   changes. We comment both on past work in the field and on challenges and
   promising avenues for future development.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to read the minds of others in their eyes plays an important
   role in human adaptation to social environments. Behavioral studies have
   resulted in the development of a test to measure this ability (Reading
   the Mind in the Eyes Test, revised version: Eyes Test), and have
   demonstrated that this ability is consistent over time. Although
   functional neuroimaging studies revealed brain activation while
   performing the Eyes Test, the structural neural substrates supporting
   consistent performance on the Eyes Test remain unclear. In this study,
   we assessed the Eyes Test and analyzed structural magnetic resonance
   images using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in healthy participants. Test
   performance was positively associated with the gray matter volumes of
   the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule
   (temporoparietal junction), and precuneus in the left hemisphere. These
   results suggest that the fronto-temporoparietal network structures
   support the consistent ability to read the mind in the eyes.}},

Title = {{Are Plasma Oxytocin and Vasopressin Levels Reflective of Amygdala
   Activation during the Processing of Negative Emotions? A Preliminary
   Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Plasma oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are associated with
   individual differences in emotional responses and behaviors. The
   amygdala is considered to be an important brain region for regulating
   emotion-based behavior, with OT and AVP modulating activity in the
   amygdala during the processing of negative emotions. In particular,
   increased OT levels may diminish amygdala activation (anxiolytic
   effects) and enhanced AVP levels may augment amygdala activation
   (anxiogenic effects) when negative emotions are processed. A growing
   body of research has shown that the effects of OT and AVP are modulated
   by sex: the aforementioned anxiolytic effects of OT and the anxiogenic
   effects of AVP occur in men, but not in women. However, we have little
   knowledge regarding the biological mechanisms underlying OT and AVP
   plasma levels or their respective anxiogenic and anxiolytic effects;
   similarly, little is known about the causes and nature of sex
   differences related to these neuropeptides and their effects on
   emotional processing. In the current study, we focused on the neural
   functions associated with the biological mechanisms underlying such
   effects. We hypothesized that amygdala activation would correlate with
   trait plasma OT (anxiolytic effects) and AVP (anxiogenic effects) levels
   because the amygdala is thought to affect the coordinated release of
   these neuropeptides following affective experiences. We further
   hypothesized that the effects would be modulated by sex. We assessed 51
   participants (male and female) using a paradigm involving negative
   emotion in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging and
   measurements of plasma OT and AVP levels. We determined that increased
   plasma AVP levels were positively associated with amygdala activation
   (anxiogenic effects) in men, but not in women. These findings highlight
   the potential underlying neural mechanisms of plasma AVP levels in men.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{Impulsivity is associated with a spectrum of psychiatric disorders
   including drug addiction. To investigate genetic associations with
   impulsivity and initiation of drug taking, we took a two-step approach.
   First, we identified genes whose expression level in prefrontal cortex,
   striatum and accumbens were associated with impulsive behavior in the
   5-choice serial reaction time task across 10 BXD recombinant inbred (BXD
   RI) mouse strains and their progenitor C57BL/6J and DBA2/J strains.
   Behavioral data were correlated with regional gene expression using
   GeneNetwork (www.genenetwork.org), to identify 44 genes whose
   probability of association with impulsivity exceeded a false discovery
   rate of <005. We then interrogated the IMAGEN database of 1423
   adolescents for potential associations of SNPs in human homologs of
   those genes identified in the mouse study, with brain activation during
   impulsive performance in the Monetary Incentive Delay task, and with
   novelty seeking scores from the Temperament and Character Inventory, as
   well as alcohol experience. There was a significant overall association
   between the human homologs of impulsivity-related genes and percentage
   of premature responses in the MID task and with fMRI BOLD-response in
   ventral striatum NS) during reward anticipation. In contrast, no
   significant association was found between the polygenic scores and
   anterior cingulate cortex activation. Univariate association analyses
   revealed that the G allele (major) of the intronic SNP rs6438839 in the
   KALRN gene was significantly associated with increased VS activation.
   Additionally, the A-allele (minor) of KALRN intronic SNP rs4634050,
   belonging to the same haplotype block, was associated with increased
   frequency of binge drinking.}},

Abstract = {{Self-referential processing is a core component of social cognition.
   However, few studies have focused on whether self-referential processing
   deficits present in bipolar disorder. The current study combined a
   high-time-resolution event-related potential (ERP) technique with the
   self-referential memory (SRM) task to evaluate self-referential
   processing in 23 bipolar patients and 27 healthy controls. All subjects
   showed a reliable SRM effect, but the bipolar group had poorer
   recognition scores for the self-and other-referential conditions. The
   bipolar group presented with smaller voltages in both the self-and
   other-referential conditions for the N1 (150-220 ms) and the P2
   components (130-320 ms) but larger voltages in the positive slow wave
   (600-1600 ms) component. Larger P3 amplitudes were elicited in the
   self-referential condition compared with the other-referential condition
   in controls but not in bipolar patients. Additionally, non-psychotic
   bipolar patients had a comparative normal SRM effect which was abolished
   in psychotic bipolar patients; non-psychotic bipolar patients had larger
   amplitudes of the positive slow wave than the normal controls, whereas
   it was not differed between psychotic bipolar patients and the healthy
   subjects. The present study suggests that self-and other-referential
   processing is impaired in bipolar patients and the deficits may be more
   pronounced in psychotic bipolar patients.}},

Abstract = {{When an organism receives a reward, it is crucial to know which of many
   candidate actions caused this reward. However, recent work suggests that
   learning is possible even when this most fundamental assumption is not
   met. We used novel reward-guided learning paradigms in two fMRI studies
   to show that humans deploy separable learning mechanisms that operate in
   parallel. While behavior was dominated by precise contingent learning,
   it also revealed hallmarks of noncontingent learning strategies. These
   learning mechanisms were separable behaviorally and neurally. Lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex supported contingent learning and reflected
   contingencies between outcomes and their causal choices. Amygdala
   responses around reward times related to statistical patterns of
   learning. Time-based heuristic mechanisms were related to activity in
   sensorimotor corticostriatal circuitry. Our data point to the existence
   of several learning mechanisms in the human brain, of which only one
   relies on applying known rules about the causal structure of the task.}},

   Amygdala Revealed by fMRI}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that emotional stimuli can be processed
   through the amygdala without conscious awareness. The amygdala is also
   involved in processing animate and social information. However, it is
   unclear whether different categories of pictures (e.g., animals,
   objects) elicit different activity in the amygdale and other regions
   without conscious awareness. The objective of this study was to explore
   whether the factors of category, emotion and picture context modulate
   brain activation for unconscious processing. Pictures denoting different
   nonhuman animals and objects in negative and neutral emotional valences
   were presented using a sandwich-masking paradigm. Half of them were
   presented with human-related information in the contexts, and half were
   not. Our results showed significant interaction among category, emotion
   and context in the amygdala and subcortical regions. Specifically,
   negative animals elicited stronger activation in these regions than
   negative objects, especially with human contexts. In addition, there
   were different correlation patterns between the amygdala and cortical
   regions according to whether they included human context. There were
   limited activations in cortical category-related networks. These results
   suggest that the amygdala and subcortical regions dominantly process
   negative animals, and contextual information modulates their activities,
   making threatening stimuli that are most relevant to human survival
   preferentially processed without conscious awareness.}},

Title = {{An Evolutionary Computation Approach to Examine Functional Brain
   Plasticity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{One common research goal in systems neurosciences is to understand how
   the functional relationship between a pair of regions of interest (ROls)
   evolves over time. Examining neural connectivity in this way is
   well-suited for the study of developmental processes, learning, and even
   in recovery or treatment designs in response to injury. For most fMRI
   based studies, the strength of the functional relationship between two
   ROls is defined as the correlation between the average signal
   representing each region. The drawback to this approach is that much
   information is lost due to averaging heterogeneous voxels, and
   therefore, the functional relationship between a ROI-pair that evolve at
   a spatial scale much finer than the ROls remain undetected. To address
   this shortcoming, we introduce a novel evolutionary computation (EC)
   based voxel-level procedure to examine functional plasticity between an
   investigator defined ROI-pair by simultaneously using subject-specific
   BOLD-fMRI data collected from two sessions seperated by finite duration
   of time. This data-driven procedure detects a sub-region composed of
   spatially connected voxels from each ROI (a so-called sub-regional-pair)
   such that the pair shows a significant gain/loss of functional
   relationship strength across the two time points. The procedure is
   recursive and iteratively finds all statistically significant
   sub-regional-pairs within the ROls. Using this approach, we examine
   functional plasticity between the default mode network (DMN) and the
   executive control network (ECN) during recovery from traumatic brain
   injury (TBI); the study includes 14 TBI and 12 healthy control subjects.
   We demonstrate that the EC based procedure is able to detect functional
   plasticity where a traditional averaging based approach fails. The
   subject-specific plasticity estimates obtained using the EC-procedure
   are highly consistent across multiple runs. Group-level analyses using
   these plasticity estimates showed an increase in the strength of
   functional relationship between DMN and ECN for TBI subjects, which is
   consistent with prior findings in the TBI-literature. The EC-approach
   also allowed us to separate sub-regional-pairs contributing to positive
   and negative plasticity; the detected sub-regional-pairs significantly
   overlap across runs thus highlighting the reliability of the
   EC-approach. These sub-regional-pairs may be useful in performing
   nuanced analyses of brain-behavior relationships during recovery from
   TBI.}},

Abstract = {{Our attitude toward risk plays a crucial role in influencing our
   everyday decision-making. Despite its importance, little is known about
   how human risk-preference can be modulated by observing risky behavior
   in other agents at either the behavioral or the neural level. Using fMRI
   combined with computational modeling of behavioral data, we show that
   human risk-preference can be systematically altered by the act of
   observing and learning from others' risk-related decisions. The
   contagion is driven specifically by brain regions involved in the
   assessment of risk: the behavioral shift is implemented via a neural
   representation of risk in the caudate nucleus, whereas the
   representations of other decision-related variables such as expected
   value are not affected. Furthermore, we uncover neural computations
   underlying learning about others' risk-preferences and describe how
   these signals interact with the neural representation of risk in the
   caudate. Updating of the belief about others' preferences is associated
   with neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).
   Functional coupling between the dlPFC and the caudate correlates with
   the degree of susceptibility to the contagion effect, suggesting that a
   frontal-subcortical loop, the so-called dorsolateral prefrontal-striatal
   circuit, underlies the modulation of risk-preference. Taken together,
   these findings provide a mechanistic account for how observation of
   others' risky behavior can modulate an individual's own risk-preference.}},

Abstract = {{Dysfunctional reward processing is implicated in various mental

   addictions. Such impairments might involve different components of the
   reward process, including brain activity during reward anticipation. We

   and identified a network containing a core striatal node and cortical
   nodes facilitating outcome prediction and response preparation. Distinct
   nodes and functional connections were preferentially associated with
   either adolescent hyperactivity or alcohol consumption, thus conveying
   specificity of reward processing to clinically relevant behavior. We
   observed associations between the striatal node, hyperactivity, and the
   vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 4A (VPS4A) gene in humans,
   and the causal role of Vps4 for hyperactivity was validated in
   Drosophila. Our data provide a neurobehavioral model explaining the
   heterogeneity of reward-related behaviors and generate a hypothesis
   accounting for their enduring nature.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging of the domestic dog is a rapidly expanding research topic
   in terms of the cognitive domains being investigated. Because dogs have
   shared both a physical and social world with humans for thousands of
   years, they provide a unique and socially relevant means of
   investigating a variety of shared human and canine psychological
   phenomena. Additionally, their trainability allows for neuroimaging to
   be carried out noninvasively in an awake and unrestrained state. In this
   review, a brief overview of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   is followed by an analysis of recent research with dogs using fMRI.
   Methodological and conceptual concerns found across multiple studies are
   raised, and solutions to these issues are suggested. With the research
   capabilities brought by canine functional imaging, findings may improve
   our understanding of canine cognitive processes, identify neural
   correlates of behavioral traits, and provide early-life selection
   measures for dogs in working roles.}},

Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging investigations of pain have discovered a
   reliable pattern of activation within limbic regions of a putative
   ``pain matrix{''} that has been theorized to reflect the affective
   dimension of pain. To test this theory, we evaluated the experience of
   pain in a rare neurological patient with extensive bilateral lesions
   encompassing core limbic structures of the pain matrix, including the
   insula, anterior cingulate, and amygdala. Despite widespread damage to
   these regions, the patient's expression and experience of pain was
   intact, and at times excessive in nature. This finding was consistent
   across multiple pain measures including self-report, facial expression,
   vocalization, withdrawal reaction, and autonomic response. These results
   challenge the notion of a ``pain matrix{''} and provide direct evidence
   that the insula, anterior cingulate, and amygdala are not necessary for
   feeling the suffering inherent to pain. The patient's heightened degree
   of pain affect further suggests that these regions may be more important
   for the regulation of pain rather than providing the decisive substrate
   for pain's conscious experience.}},

   Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) delivered to college-aged

   participants to complete two functional magnetic resonance imaging scans
   during which time gamblers completed a slot machine activity. Following
   the initial scan, ten subjects were exposed to 8 h of ACT delivered 1:1
   by a therapist, and the other eight remained untreated. Using a mixed 2
   (group: ACT, Control) x 2 (condition: wins, losses) x 2 (time: pre,
   lost) design, the self-report and behavioral aspects of the slot machine
   activity, in addition to the brain activation data were compared across
   time. Results indicated that post-treatment, disordered gamblers
   reported higher rates of psychological flexibility and mindfulness than
   control gamblers. Similarly, brain activation patterns differed
   significantly between groups for winning outcomes when compared to
   losing outcomes following treatment. These data suggest that
   psychological reconditioning of behavioral and neurological responses to
   various addictive stimuli are possible using ACT. Implications for the
   future of contextual control, human language, and understanding

Abstract = {{Phonological processing is a fundamental ability which underlies
   language comprehension. Functional neuroanatomy of phonology constitutes
   a matter of ongoing debate. In the present study, subjects performed
   visual (rhyme detection) and auditory (identification of spoken words
   starting with a given consonant) tasks that were contrasted with matched
   nonverbal tasks. We identified regions critical for phonological
   processing which were either stimulus specific or supramodal. The
   results revealed a high degree of modality specificity in both visual
   and auditory networks. Moreover, we observed a modality independent
   region in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG)/superior temporal sulcus
   (STS), between a more anterior temporal area with auditory specificity
   and a more posterior temporal area with visual specificity. This
   dissociation in functional neuroanatomy suggests that this area may be a
   core region for supramodal phonological processing, acting as a gateway
   between spatially separate, but stimulus specific, phonological
   processes and more general linguistic functions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Critique of the use of neuroscience in forensic psychiatric assessments:
   The case of criminal responsibility}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTION PSYCHIATRIQUE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{434-445}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. - This paper sets out to examine the way in which
   neuroscientific knowledge and techniques have been used in some European
   courts, in order to assess their impact on the assessment of criminal
   responsibility and to anticipate potential misuse of neuroscience in the
   courts.
   Method. - We conducted a case-law search and examined two European cases
   in which neuroscientific techniques were used in order to prove the
   diminished responsibility or irresponsibility of the accused.
   Results. - After reviewing these cases we concluded that there were
   significant difficulties and limitations of technical/scientific,
   conceptual and legal nature, concerning the use of neuroscience for the
   assessment of responsibility.
   Discussion. - Neuroscientific data, no matter how accurate and reliable
   may become, will only make sense in the quest for the assessment of
   criminal responsibility if they are contextualized and supplemented with
   data collected from other levels of analysis.
   Conclusion. - Despite the importance of the contribution of neuroscience
   to forensic assessments for a more refined understanding of the complex
   interaction between the brain, mental states and behavior, the use of
   neuroscientific evidence in legal contexts will not dispense with the
   need to define the limits of responsibility and irresponsibility of the
   accused. It is a social, moral, political and, ultimately, legal
   question. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to perceive facial expressions of emotion is essential for
   effective social communication. We investigated how the perception of
   facial expression emerges from the image properties that convey this
   important social signal, and how neural responses in face-selective
   brain regions might track these properties. To do this, we measured the
   perceptual similarity between expressions of basic emotions, and
   investigated how this is reflected in image measures and in the neural
   response of different face-selective regions. We show that the
   perceptual similarity of different facial expressions (fear, anger,
   disgust, sadness, happiness) can be predicted by both surface and
   feature shape information in the image. Using block design fMRI, we
   found that the perceptual similarity of expressions could also be
   predicted from the patterns of neural response in the face-selective
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS), but not in the fusiform face
   area (FFA). These results show that the perception of facial expression
   is dependent on the shape and surface properties of the image and on the
   activity of specific face-selective regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Enforcement of social norms by impartial bystanders in the human species
   reveals a possibly unique capacity to sense and to enforce norms from a
   third party perspective. Such behavior, however, cannot be accounted by
   current computational models based on an egocentric notion of norms.
   Here, using a combination of model-based fMRI and third party punishment
   games, we show that brain regions previously implicated in egocentric
   norm enforcement critically extend to the important case of norm
   enforcement by unaffected third parties. Specifically, we found that
   responses in the ACC and insula cortex were positively associated with
   detection of distributional inequity, while those in the anterior DLPFC
   were associated with assessment of intentionality to the violator.
   Moreover, during sanction decisions, the subjective value of sanctions
   modulated activity in both vmPFC and rTPJ. These results shed light on
   the neurocomputational underpinnings of third party punishment and
   evolutionary origin of human norm enforcement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Stimulus-dependent amygdala involvement in affective theory of mind
   generation}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{450-459}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Successful social interaction requires knowledge about another person's
   emotional states, represented in an affective theory of mind (ToM). This
   information can be acquired either directly or indirectly, i.e., by
   observing emotional facial expressions (EFE) or indirectly by inferring
   emotions through cognitive perspective taking. Therefore, it is of great
   interest how the function of the cortical ToM network and the limbic
   system in affective ToM depends on the presence of facial expressions.
   We addressed this question in a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study. The experimental paradigm applied a well-established ToM
   cartoon task to test functional effects of EFE on the activation of the
   amygdala and the anterior ToM network during affective ToM judgments.
   During the task, 22 healthy participants had to judge the changes of the
   emotional state of the stories protagonist in the presence or absence of
   EFE. After quality control, 21 data sets entered the final analyses.
   The presence of EFE during affective ToM judgments was associated with
   shorter reaction times as well as increased activation of the right
   amygdala, most probably located in the basolateral nucleus (BLA),
   coincident with reduced activation of ToM-related regions of the
   prefrontal cortex. Psychophysiological interactions (PPI) revealed
   EFE-dependent modulation of connectivity between the right BLA and the
   contralateral ToM network regions.
   In combination with the functional interaction of EFE and affective ToM
   in the right amygdala, our data suggest a complementary but parallel
   organization of EFE processing and affective ToM. In this framework, the
   amygdala seems to act as an EFE detector when affective ToM judgments
   are demanded. Additionally, the facts that EFE induced exclusively
   right-sided amygdala activation and modulated the connectivity with the
   contralateral ToM network support the idea of a functional
   lateralization of stimulus driven components of affective ToM. (C) 2016

Title = {{Interaction matters: A perceived social partner alters the neural
   processing of human speech}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{129}},
Pages = {{480-488}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Mounting evidence suggests that social interaction changes how
   communicative behaviors (e.g., spoken language, gaze) are processed, but
   the precise neural bases by which social-interactive context may alter
   communication remain unknown. Various perspectives suggest that live
   interactions are more rewarding, more attention-grabbing, or require
   increased mentalizing-thinking about the thoughts of others.
   Dissociating between these possibilities is difficult because most
   extant neuroimaging paradigms examining social interaction have not
   directly compared live paradigms to conventional ``offline{''} (or
   recorded) paradigms. We developed a novel fMRI paradigm to assess
   whether and how an interactive context changes the processing of speech
   matched in content and vocal characteristics. Participants listened to
   short vignettes-which contained no reference to people or mental
   states-believing that some vignettes were prerecorded and that others
   were presented over a real-time audio-feed by a live social partner. In
   actuality, all speech was prerecorded. Simply believing that speech was
   live increased activation in each participant's own mentalizing regions,
   defined using a functional localizer. Contrasting live to recorded
   speech did not reveal significant differences in attention or reward
   regions. Further, higher levels of autistic-like traits were associated
   with altered neural specialization for live interaction. These results
   suggest that humans engage in ongoing mentalizing about social partners,
   even when such mentalizing is not explicitly required, illustrating how
   social context shapes social cognition. Understanding communication in
   social context has important implications for typical and atypical
   social processing, especially for disorders like autism where social
   difficulties are more acute in live interaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Emotion processing fails to modulate putative mirror neuron response to
   trained visuomotor associations}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{7-13}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that activation of the
   putative human mirror neuron system (MNS) can be elicited via visuomotor
   training. This is generally interpreted as supporting an associative
   learning account of the mirror neuron system (MNS) that argues against
   the ontogeny of the MNS to be an evolutionary adaptation for social
   cognition. The current study assessed whether a central component of
   social cognition, emotion processing, would influence the MNS activity
   to trained visuomotor associations, which could support a broader role
   of the MNS in social cognition. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), we assessed repetition suppression to the presentation
   of stimulus pairs involving a simple hand action and a geometric shape
   that was either congruent or incongruent with earlier association
   training. Each pair was preceded by an image of positive, negative, or
   neutral emotionality. In support of an associative learning account of
   the MNS, repetition suppression was greater for trained pairs compared
   with untrained pairs in several regions, primarily supplementary motor
   area (SMA) and right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG). This response,
   however, was not modulated by the valence of the emotional images. These
   findings argue against a fundamental role of emotion processing in the
   mirror neuron response, and are inconsistent with theoretical accounts
   linking mirror neurons to social cognition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The present review elucidated the use of optical imaging technique

   NIRS-Neurofeedback and NIRS-BCI (Brain Computer Interface) were also
   explored as possible tools to produce a specific long-lasting learning

   domain where NIRS was found to be useful to test neuroplasticity is the

Abstract = {{Learning about other peoples' attributes, e.g. whether an individual is
   generous or selfish, is central to human social cognition. It is well
   documented that a network of cortical regions is reliably activated when
   we engage social processes. However, little is known about the specific
   computations performed by these regions or whether such processing is
   specialized for the social domain. We investigated these questions using
   a task in which participants (N = 26) learned about four peoples'
   generosity by watching them choose to sharemoney with third party
   partners, or not. In a non-social control condition, participants
   learned the win/loss rates of four lotteries. fMRI analysis revealed
   learning-related general (social + non-social) prediction error signals
   in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (bilaterally),
   and in the right lateral parietal cortex. Socially specific (social >
   non-social) prediction error signals were found in the precuneus.
   Interestingly, the region that exhibited social prediction errors was a
   distinct subregion of the area in the precuneus and posterior cingulate
   cortex that exhibited a commonly reported main effect of higher overall
   activity for social vs non-social stimuli. These findings elucidate the
   domain-general and-specific computations underlying learning about other
   people and demonstrate the increased explanatory power of computational
   approaches to social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Adapting behavior to changes in the environment is a crucial ability for
   survival but such adaptation varies widely across individuals. Here, we
   asked how humans alter their economic decision-making in response to
   emotional cues, and whether this is related to trait anxiety. Developing
   an emotional decision-making task for functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, in which gambling decisions were preceded by emotional and
   non-emotional primes, we assessed emotional influences on loss aversion,
   the tendency to overweigh potential monetary losses relative to gains.
   Our behavioral results revealed that only low-anxious individuals
   exhibited increased loss aversion under emotional conditions. This
   emotional modulation of decision-making was accompanied by a
   corresponding emotion-elicited increase in amygdala-striatal functional
   connectivity, which correlated with the behavioral effect across
   participants. Consistent with prior reports of `neural loss aversion',
   both amygdala and ventral striatum tracked losses more strongly than
   gains, and amygdala loss aversion signals were exaggerated by emotion,
   suggesting a potential role for this structure in integrating value and
   emotion cues. Increased loss aversion and striatal-amygdala coupling
   induced by emotional cues may reflect the engagement of adaptive
   harm-avoidance mechanisms in low-anxious individuals, possibly promoting
   resilience to psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence from functional neuroimaging studies of emotional perception
   shows that when attention is focused on external features of emotional
   stimuli (external perceptual orienting-EPO), the amygdala is primarily
   engaged, but when attention is turned inwards towards one's own
   emotional state (interoceptive self-orienting-ISO), regions of the
   salience network, such as the anterior insula (AI) and the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), also play a major role. Yet, it is
   unknown if ISO boosts the contributions of AI and dACC not only to
   emotional `perception' but also to emotional `memory'. To investigate
   this issue, participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) while viewing emotional and neutral pictures under ISO or
   EPO, and memory was tested several days later. The study yielded three
   main findings: (i) emotion boosted perception-related activity in the
   amygdala during both ISO and EPO and in the right AI exclusively during
   ISO; (ii) emotion augmented activity predicting subsequent memory in AI
   and dACC during ISO but not during EPO and (iii) high confidence memory
   was associated with increased amygdala-dACC connectivity, selectively
   for ISO encoding. These findings show, for the first time, that ISO
   promotes emotional memory formation via regions associated with
   interoceptive awareness of emotional experience, such as AI and dACC.}},

Abstract = {{Healthy social relationships are linked to myriad positive physical and
   mental health outcomes, raising the question of how to enhance
   relationship formation and quality. Behavioral data suggest that theory
   of mind (ToM) may be one such process. ToM is supported by a network of
   brain regions including the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), medial
   prefrontal cortex and precuneus (PC). However, little research has
   investigated how the ToM network supports healthy social relationships.
   Here, we investigate whether recruitment of the ToM network when
   thinking about the mental states of one's romantic partner predicts the
   partner's well-being. We find that selectivity in left TPJ (LTPJ) and PC
   for beliefs vs physical attributes of one's partner is positively
   associated with partner well-being the day of and day after a meaningful
   encounter. Furthermore, LTPJ and PC selectivity moderated how the
   partner's perception of being understood during the encounter affected
   their later well-being. Finally, we find the association between
   ToM-related neural selectivity and well-being robust to other factors
   related to the relationship and the encounter. Together, these data
   suggest that selective engagement of the neural network supporting ToM
   may be a key ingredient for the development and maintenance of healthy
   romantic relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Relapse represents a major limitation to long-term remission of
   psychopathology (anxiety, addiction). Relapse of anxiety can be modeled
   in the laboratory as return of fear (ROF) following un-signaled
   re-presentation of the aversive event (reinstatement, RI) after
   extinction. In humans, response enhancement to both the CS+ and CS-
   (generalized RI) or specifically to the CS+ (differential RI) has been
   described following RI. The (psychological) mechanisms and boundary
   conditions underlying these different RI qualities were investigated in
   76 healthy participants using autonomic measures and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. Our results suggest that both processes reflect
   distinct albeit intertwined (psychological) processes which are
   reflected in different neural activation patterns. Differential RI was
   linked to CS+ related hippocampal activation and CS- related
   disinhibition of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The latter
   likely contributes to robust generalized RI which was mirrored in
   thalamic and visual areas (as well as the bed nucleus of the striatum
   and inusula) possibly indicating generally facilitated salience
   processing. In addition, we also present data on experimental boundary
   conditions of RI (trial sequence effects, time stability). Taken
   together, this first comprehensive analysis of RI-induced ROF aids not
   only experimental research on ROF but also understanding of factors
   promoting clinical relapse and the role of the vmPFC.}},

Abstract = {{Self-affirmation theory posits that people are motivated to maintain a
   positive self-view and that threats to perceived self-competence are met
   with resistance. When threatened, self-affirmations can restore
   self-competence by allowing individuals to reflect on sources of
   self-worth, such as core values. Many questions exist, however, about
   the underlying mechanisms associated with self-affirmation. We examined
   the neural mechanisms of self-affirmation with a task developed for use
   in a functional magnetic resonance imaging environment. Results of a
   region of interest analysis demonstrated that participants who were
   affirmed (compared with unaffirmed participants) showed increased
   activity in key regions of the brain's self-processing (medial
   prefrontal cortex + posterior cingulate cortex) and valuation (ventral
   striatum + ventral medial prefrontal cortex) systems when reflecting on
   future-oriented core values (compared with everyday activities).
   Furthermore, this neural activity went on to predict changes in
   sedentary behavior consistent with successful affirmation in response to
   a separate physical activity intervention. These results highlight
   neural processes associated with successful self-affirmation, and
   further suggest that key pathways may be amplified in conjunction with
   prospection.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated with aberrant

   Perceptual load has been shown to modulate ACC activity such that under

   distractors yet under low load, there is evidence of reduced activation.
   It is not known if neural predictors of response to cognitive behavioral
   therapy (CBT), based on such emotional conflict resolution, interact
   with demands on controlled processes. Prior to CBT, 32 patients with
   gSAD completed an fMRI task involving a target letter in a string of
   identical targets (low perceptual load) or a target letter in a mixed
   letter string (high perceptual load) superimposed on fearful, angry and
   neutral face distractors. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses revealed
   better CBT outcome was predicted by more frontopartial activity that
   included dorsal ACC (dACC) and insula to threat (vs neutral) distractors
   during high, but not low, perceptual load. Psychophysiological
   interaction analysis with dACC as the seed region revealed less

Abstract = {{Neuroscience research has examined separately how we detect human agents
   on the basis of their face and body (person perception) and how we
   reason about their thoughts, traits or intentions (person knowledge).
   Neuroanatomically distinct networks have been associated with person
   perception and person knowledge, but it remains unknown how multiple
   features of a person (e.g. thin and kind) are linked to form a holistic
   identity representation. In this fMRI experiment, we investigated the
   hypothesis that when encountering another person specialised person
   perception circuits would be functionally coupled with circuits involved
   in person knowledge. In a factorial design, we paired bodies or names
   with trait-based or neutral statements, and independent localiser scans
   identified body-selective and mentalising networks. When observing a

   analyses demonstrated that body-selective patches in bilateral fusiform
   gyri were functionally coupled with nodes of the mentalising network. We
   demonstrate that when forming a representation of a person circuits for
   representing another person's physical appearance are linked to circuits
   that are engaged when reasoning about trait-based character. These data
   support the view that a `who' system for social cognition involves
   communication between perceptual and inferential mechanisms when forming
   a representation of another's identity.}},

Abstract = {{Stress exposure is known to precipitate psychological disorders.
   However, large differences exist in how individuals respond to stressful
   situations. A major marker for stress sensitivity is
   hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis function. Here, we studied how
   interindividual variance in both basal cortisol levels and
   stress-induced cortisol responses predicts differences in neural
   vigilance processing during stress exposure. Implementing a randomized,
   counterbalanced, crossover design, 120 healthy male participants were
   exposed to a stress-induction and control procedure, followed by an
   emotional perception task (viewing fearful and happy faces) during fMRI
   scanning. Stress sensitivity was assessed using physiological (salivary
   cortisol levels) and psychological measures (trait questionnaires). High
   stress-induced cortisol responses were associated with increased stress
   sensitivity as assessed by psychological questionnaires, a stronger
   stress-induced increase in medial temporal activity and greater
   differential amygdala responses to fearful as opposed to happy faces
   under control conditions. In contrast, high basal cortisol levels were
   related to relative stress resilience as reflected by higher
   extraversion scores, a lower stress-induced increase in amygdala
   activity and enhanced differential processing of fearful compared with
   happy faces under stress. These findings seem to reflect a critical role
   for HPA-axis signaling in stress coping; higher basal levels indicate
   stress resilience, whereas higher cortisol responsivity to stress might
   facilitate recovery in those individuals prone to react sensitively to
   stress.}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests that individuals with conduct disorder (CD) are marked
   by social impairments, such as difficulties in processing the affective
   reactions of others. Little is known, though, about how they make
   decisions during social interactions in response to emotional
   expressions of others. In this study, we therefore investigated the
   neural mechanisms underlying fairness decisions in response to
   communicated emotions of others in aggressive, criminal justice-involved
   boys with CD (N = 32) compared with typically developing (TD) boys (N =
   33), aged 15-19 years. Participants received written emotional responses
   (angry, disappointed or happy) from peers in response to a previous
   offer and then had to make fairness decisions in a version of the
   Dictator Game. Behavioral results showed that CD boys did not make
   differential fairness decisions in response to the emotions, whereas the
   TD boys did show a differentiation and also responded more unfair to
   happy reactions than the CD boys. Neuroimaging results revealed that
   when receiving happy vs disappointed and angry reactions, the CD boys
   showed less activation than the TD boys in the temporoparietal junction
   and supramarginal gyrus, regions involved in perspective taking and
   attention. These results suggest that boys with CD have difficulties

Abstract = {{The first year of life is an important period for emergence of fear in
   humans. While animal models have revealed developmental changes in
   amygdala circuitry accompanying emerging fear, human neural systems
   involved in early fear development remain poorly understood. To increase
   understanding of the neural foundations of human fear, it is important
   to consider parallel cognitive development, which may modulate
   associations between typical development of early fear and subsequent
   risk for fear related psychopathology. We, therefore, examined amygdala
   functional connectivity with rs-fcMRI in 48 neonates (M=3.65 weeks, SD =
   1.72), and measured fear and cognitive development at 6-months-of-age.
   Stronger, positive neonatal amygdala connectivity to several regions,
   including bilateral anterior insula and ventral striatum, was
   prospectively associated with higher fear at 6-months. Stronger amygdala
   connectivity to ventral anterior cingulate/anterior medial prefrontal
   cortex predicted a specific phenotype of higher fear combined with more
   advanced cognitive development. Overall, findings demonstrate unique
   profiles of neonatal amygdala functional connectivity related to
   emerging fear and cognitive development, which may have implications for
   normative and pathological fear in later years. Consideration of infant
   fear in the context of cognitive development will likely contribute to a
   more nuanced understanding of fear, its neural bases, and its
   implications for future mental health. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{A fundamental and largely unanswered question in neuroscience is whether
   extrinsic connectivity and function are closely related at a fine
   spatial grain across the human brain. Using a novel approach, we found
   that the anatomical connectivity of individual gray-matter voxels
   (determined via diffusion-weighted imaging) alone can predict functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to 4 visual categories
   (faces, objects, scenes, and bodies) in individual subjects, thus
   accounting for both functional differentiation across the cortex and
   individual variation therein. Furthermore, this approach identified the
   particular anatomical links between voxels that most strongly predict,
   and therefore plausibly define, the neural networks underlying specific
   functions. These results provide the strongest evidence to date for a
   precise and fine-grained relationship between connectivity and function
   in the human brain, raise the possibility that early-developing
   connectivity patterns may determine later functional organization, and
   offer a method for predicting fine-grained functional organization in
   populations who cannot be functionally scanned.}},

Abstract = {{Self-affirmation (reflecting on important personal values) has been
   shown to have a range of positive effects; however, the neural basis of
   self-affirmation is not known. Building on studies showing that thinking
   about self-preferences activates neural reward pathways, we hypothesized
   that self-affirmation would activate brain reward circuitry during
   functional MRI (fMRI) studies. In Study 1, with college students, making
   judgments about important personal values during self-affirmation
   activated neural reward regions (i.e., ventral striatum), whereas making
   preference judgments that were not self-relevant did not. Study 2
   replicated these results in a community sample, again showing that
   self-affirmation activated the ventral striatum. These are among the
   first fMRI studies to identify neural processes during self-affirmation.
   The findings extend theory by showing that self-affirmation may be
   rewarding and may provide a first step toward identifying a neural
   mechanism by which self-affirmation may produce a wide range of
   beneficial effects.}},

Abstract = {{An individual is typically considered an adult at age 18, although the
   age of adulthood varies for different legal and social policies. A key
   question is how cognitive capacities relevant to these policies change
   with development. The current study used an emotional go/no-go paradigm
   and functional neuroimaging to assess cognitive control under sustained
   states of negative and positive arousal in a community sample of one
   hundred ten 13- to 25-year-olds from New York City and Los Angeles. The
   results showed diminished cognitive performance under brief and
   prolonged negative emotional arousal in 18- to 21-year-olds relative to
   adults over 21. This reduction in performance was paralleled by
   decreased activity in fronto-parietal circuitry, implicated in cognitive
   control, and increased sustained activity in the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex, involved in emotional processes. The findings suggest a
   developmental shift in cognitive capacity in emotional situations that
   coincides with dynamic changes in prefrontal circuitry. These findings
   may inform age-related social policies.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral inhibition has classically been considered to rely upon a
   neural network centered at the right inferior frontal cortex {[}rIFC;
   Aron et al. (8:170-177, 2004; 18:177-185, 2014)]. However, the vast
   majority of inhibition studies have entailed exogenous stop signals
   instructing participants to withhold responding. More recent work has
   begun to examine the neural underpinnings of endogenous inhibition,
   revealing a distinct cortical basis in the dorsal fronto-median cortex
   {[}dFMC; Brass and Haggard (27:9141-9145, 2007); Kuhn et al.
   (30:2834-3843, 2009)]. Yet, contrary to everyday experiences of
   voluntary behavioral suppression, the paradigms employed to investigate
   action inhibition have thus far been somewhat artificial, and involve
   little persuasive motivation to act. Accordingly, the present fMRI study
   seeks to compare and contrast intentional with instructed inhibition in
   a novel pain paradigm that recruits `hot' incentive response systems.
   Participants received increasing thermal stimulation to their inner
   wrists, and were required to occasionally withhold their natural impulse
   to withdraw from the compelling pain sensation at peak temperature, in
   both instructed and free-choice conditions. Consistent with previous
   research, we observed inhibition-related activity in the dFMC and the
   rIFC. However, these regions displayed equivalent activation levels for
   both inhibition types. These data extend previous research by
   demonstrating that under ecologically valid conditions with a strong
   motivation to act, both stopping networks operate in concert to enable
   suppression of unwanted behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility to use functional MRI (fMRI) during natural sleep to
   assess low-frequency basal brain activity fluctuations in human neonates
   has been demonstrated, although its potential to characterise
   pathologies of prenatal origin has not yet been exploited. In the
   present study, we used intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) as a model
   of altered neurodevelopment due to prenatal condition to show the
   suitability of brain networks to characterise functional brain
   organisation at neonatal age. Particularly, we analysed resting-state
   fMRI signal of 20 neonates with IUGR and 13 controls, obtaining
   whole-brain functional networks based on correlations of blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) signal in 90 grey matter regions of an anatomical
   atlas (AAL). Characterisation of the networks obtained with graph
   theoretical features showed increased network infrastructure and raw
   efficiencies but reduced efficiency after normalisation, demonstrating
   hyper-connected but sub-optimally organised IUGR functional brain
   networks. Significant association of network features with
   neurobehavioral scores was also found. Further assessment of
   spatiotemporal dynamics displayed alterations into features associated
   to frontal, cingulate and lingual cortices. These findings show the
   capacity of functional brain networks to characterise brain
   reorganisation from an early age, and their potential to develop
   biomarkers of altered neurodevelopment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious lifelong condition,
   its underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Recently,
   neuroimaging-based classifiers for ASD and typically developed (TD)
   individuals were developed to identify the abnormality of functional
   connections (FCs). Due to over-fitting and interferential effects of
   varying measurement conditions and demographic distributions, no
   classifiers have been strictly validated for independent cohorts. Here
   we overcome these difficulties by developing a novel machine-learning
   algorithm that identifies a small number of FCs that separates ASD
   versus TD. The classifier achieves high accuracy for a Japanese
   discovery cohort and demonstrates a remarkable degree of generalization
   for two independent validation cohorts in the USA and Japan. The
   developed ASD classifier does not distinguish individuals with major
   depressive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder from
   their controls but moderately distinguishes patients with schizophrenia
   from their controls. The results leave open the viable possibility of
   exploring neuroimaging-based dimensions quantifying the
   multiple-disorder spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) plays a central role in intrinsic thought
   processes. Altered DMN connectivity has been linked to diminished
   cerebral serotonin synthesis. Diminished brain serotonin synthesis is
   further associated with a lack of impulse control and various
   psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated the serotonergic modulation
   of intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) within the DMN in healthy
   adult females, controlling for the menstrual cycle phase. Eighteen
   healthy women in the follicular phase (aged 20-31 years) participated in
   a double-blind controlled cross-over study of serotonin depletion. Acute
   tryptophan depletion (ATD) and a balanced amino acid load (BAL), used as
   the control condition, were applied on two separate days of assessment.
   Neural resting state data using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and individual trait impulsivity scores were obtained. ATD
   compared with BAL significantly reduced FC with the DMN in the precuneus
   (associated with self-referential thinking) and enhanced FC with the DMN
   in the frontal cortex (associated with cognitive reasoning).
   Connectivity differences with the DMN between BAL and ATD in the
   precentral gyrus were significantly correlated with the magnitude of
   serotonin depletion. Right medial frontal gyrus and left superior
   frontal gyrus connectivity differences with the DMN were inversely
   correlated with trait impulsivity. These findings partially deviate from
   previous findings obtained in males and underline the importance of
   gender-specific studies and controlling for menstrual cycle to further
   elucidate the mechanism of ATD-induced changes within intrinsic thought
   processes.}},

Title = {{Intranasal oxytocin enhances neural processing of monetary reward and

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anhedonia is a significant clinical problem in
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD patients show reduced
   motivational approach behavior, which may underlie anhedonic symptoms.
   Oxytocin administration is known to increase reward sensitivity and
   approach behavior. We therefore investigated whether oxytocin
   administration affected neural responses during motivational processing
   in PTSD patients and trauma-exposed controls.
   Methods: 35 police officers with PTSD (21 males) and 37 trauma-exposed
   police officers without PTSD (19 males) were included in a
   within-subjects, randomized, placebo-controlled fMRI study. Neural
   responses during anticipation of monetary reward and loss were
   investigated with a monetary incentive delay task (MID) after placebo
   and oxytocin (40 IU) administration.
   Results: Oxytocin increased neural responses during reward and loss
   anticipation in PTSD patients and controls in the striatum, dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex and insula, key regions in the reward pathway.
   Although PTSD patients did not differ from controls in motivational
   processing under placebo, anhedonia severity in PTSD patients was
   negatively related to reward responsiveness in the ventral striatum.
   Furthermore, oxytocin effects on reward processing in the ventral
   striatum were positively associated with anhedonia.
   Conclusions: Oxytocin administration increased reward pathway
   sensitivity during reward and loss anticipation in PTSD patients and
   trauma-exposed controls. Thus, oxytocin administration may increase
   motivation for goal-directed approach behavior in PTSD patients and
   controls, providing evidence for a neurobiological pathway through which
   oxytocin could potentially increase motivation and reward sensitivity in
   PTSD patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of social exchanges during the Prisoner's Dilemma game

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Background Depression is a disabling disorder that significantly impacts
   on the interpersonal functioning of individuals. However, little is
   known about the neural substrates of such difficulties. In the last few
   years neuroeconomics, which combines imaging with multiplayer
   behavioural economic paradigms, has been used to study the neural
   substrates of normal and abnormal interpersonal interactions.
   Method This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   investigate neural activity in unmedicated depressed participants (n =
   25) and matched healthy controls (n = 25). During scanning, participants
   played a behavioural economic game, the Prisoner's Dilemma. In this
   game, the participant and a co-player independently choose either to
   cooperate or not cooperate with each other.
   Results Depressed participants reported higher levels of negative
   feelings (betrayal, guilt) during the game than did controls. Neural
   activation was compared between imbalanced' events {[}when one of the
   players cooperated and the other defected (CD' and DC')] and draw'
   events {[}when both players either cooperated or defected (CC' and
   DD')]. Participants preferentially activated the anterior insula and the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a region implicated in cognitive
   control and regulation of emotions. Importantly, compared to controls
   depressed participants showed reduced activation in the left DLPFC, with
   the extent of signal reduction correlating with increased self-report
   feelings of guilt associated with DC outcomes.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that depression is associated with
   reduced activation of the DLPFC during social events that involve
   unreciprocated cooperation. This abnormality may underlie anomalies in
   cognitive control and top-down regulation of emotions during challenging
   social exchanges.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is usually conceived of as independent of the non-verbal
   behaviors which mediate its experience, though embodied cognition theory
   predicts that individual differences in action representation will
   affect empathic traits. The ``Actions and Feelings Questionnaire{''}
   (AFQ) was designed to capture individual differences in self-awareness
   of own and others' actions, particularly those associated with feelings,
   which we predicted would correlate with levels of empathic traits. A
   pilot 30-item questionnaire included items on perceptual sensitivity to
   action, imitation, action imagery, and gestural and facial expression.
   It was completed by a sample of 278 adults (mean age 21.2 years; 189
   females, 89 males) along with the 15-item Empathic Quotient (EQ)
   Questionnaire. Total scores on the final 18-item questionnaire showed
   strong internal coherence (Cronbach's alpha of 0.81) and test-retest
   reliability (ICC=0.88), marked effect of sex and highly significant
   correlation with EQ. The questionnaire was administered to participants
   in an fMRI study investigating the neural correlates of facial
   imitation. Total AFQ score correlated with activity in somatosensory
   cortex, insula, anterior cingulate, and visual cortex. The AFQ shows
   promise as a brief and simple self-report measure sensitive to
   variability in the self-awareness of actions associated with feelings.
   It suggests that much of the variability of empathic traits in typical
   populations is accounted for by variance in this capacity. We suggest
   that being more empathic really is about being ``touchy-feely,{''} and
   this questionnaire provides a novel measure of action-based empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Prior work has shown that whether or not someone is similar to the self
   influences person memory-a type of self-reference effect for others. In
   this study, we were interested in understanding the neural regions
   supporting the generation of impressions and subsequent memory for
   targets who vary in similarity to the self. Participants underwent fMRI
   scanning while forming positive or negative impressions of face-behavior
   pairs. We tested participants' memory for their generated impressions
   and then back-sorted the impression trials (encoding) into different
   levels of self-similarity (high, medium, low) using a self-similarity
   posttest that came after recognition. Extending prior behavioral work,
   our data confirmed our hypothesis that memory would be highest for
   self-similar others and lowest for self-dissimilar others. Dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activity increased with self-similarity
   (high > medium > low) to targets, regardless of later memory for them.
   An analysis of regions supporting impression memory revealed a double
   dissociation within medial temporal lobe regions: for similar others,
   amygdala recruitment supported memory, whereas for dissimilar others,
   hippocampal activation supported memory. These results suggest that
   self-similarity influences evaluation and memory for targets but also
   affects the underlying neural resources engaged when thinking about
   others who vary in self-similarity.}},

Abstract = {{Interpersonal trust and distrust are important components of human
   social interaction. Although several studies have shown that brain
   function is associated with either trusting or distrusting others, very
   little is known regarding brain function during the control of social
   attitudes, including trust and distrust. This study was designed to
   investigate the neural mechanisms involved when people attempt to
   control their attitudes of trust or distrust toward another person. We
   used a novel control-of-attitudes fMRI task, which involved explicit
   instructions to control attitudes of interpersonal trust and distrust.
   Control of trust or distrust was operationally defined as changes in
   trustworthiness evaluations of neutral faces before and after the
   control-of-attitudes fMRI task. Overall, participants (n = 60) evaluated
   faces paired with the distrust instruction as being less trustworthy
   than faces paired with the trust instruction following the
   control-of-distrust task. Within the brain, both the control-of-trust
   and control-of-distrust conditions were associated with increased
   temporoparietal junction, precuneus (PrC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG),
   and medial prefrontal cortex activity. Individual differences in the
   control of trust were associated with PrC activity, and individual
   differences in the control of distrust were associated with IFG
   activity. Together, these findings identify a brain network involved in
   the explicit control of distrust and trust and indicate that the PrC and
   IFG may serve to consolidate interpersonal social attitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Emotionally-laden tactile stimulationsuch as a caress on the skin or the
   feel of velvetmay represent a functionally distinct domain of touch,
   underpinned by specific cortical pathways. In order to determine
   whether, and to what extent, cortical functional neuroanatomy supports a
   distinction between affective and discriminative touch, an activation
   likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis was performed. This
   meta-analysis statistically mapped reported functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) activations from 17 published affective touch
   studies in which tactile stimulation was associated with positive
   subjective evaluation (n=291, 34 experimental contrasts). A separate ALE
   meta-analysis mapped regions most likely to be activated by tactile
   stimulation during detection and discrimination tasks (n=1,075, 91
   experimental contrasts). These meta-analyses revealed dissociable
   regions for affective and discriminative touch, with posterior insula
   (PI) more likely to be activated for affective touch, and primary
   somatosensory cortices (SI) more likely to be activated for
   discriminative touch. Secondary somatosensory cortex had a high
   likelihood of engagement by both affective and discriminative touch.
   Further, meta-analytic connectivity (MCAM) analyses investigated
   network-level co-activation likelihoods independent of task or stimulus,
   across a range of domains and paradigms. Affective-related PI and
   discriminative-related SI regions co-activated with different networks,
   implicated in dissociable functions, but sharing somatosensory
   co-activations. Taken together, these meta-analytic findings suggest
   that affective and discriminative touch are dissociable both on the
   regional and network levels. However, their degree of shared activation
   likelihood in somatosensory cortices indicates that this dissociation
   reflects functional biases within tactile processing networks, rather
   than functionally and anatomically distinct pathways. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder (PD) are most
   common anxiety disorders with high lifetime prevalence while the
   pathophysiology and disease-specific alterations still remain largely
   unclear. Few studies have taken a whole-brain perspective in the
   functional connectivity (FC) analysis of these two disorders in resting
   state. It limits the ability to identify regionally and
   psychopathologically specific network abnormalities with their
   subsequent use as diagnostic marker and novel treatment strategy. The
   whole brain FC using a novel FC metric was compared, that is, scaled
   correlation, which they demonstrated to be a reliable FC statistics, but
   have higher statistical power in two-sample t-test of whole brain FC
   analysis. About 21 GAD and 18 PD patients were compared with 22 matched
   control subjects during resting-state, respectively. It was found that
   GAD patients demonstrated increased FC between
   hippocampus/parahippocampus and fusiform gyrus among the most
   significantly changed FC, while PD was mainly associated with greater FC
   between somatosensory cortex and thalamus. Besides such regional
   specificity, it was observed that psychopathological specificity in that
   the disrupted FC pattern in PD and GAD correlated with their respective
   symptom severity. The findings suggested that the increased FC between
   hippocampus/parahippocampus and fusiform gyrus in GAD were mainly
   associated with a fear generalization related neural circuit, while the
   greater FC between somatosensory cortex and thalamus in PD were more
   likely linked to interoceptive processing. Due to the observed regional
   and psychopathological specificity, their findings bear important
   clinical implications for the potential treatment strategy. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{Humans seem to place a positive reward value on prosocial behavior.
   Evidence suggests that this prosocial inclination is driven by our
   reflexive tendency to share in the observed sensations, emotions and
   behavior of others, or self-other resonance. In this study, we examine
   how neural correlates of self-other resonance relate to prosocial
   decision-making. Subjects performed two tasks while undergoing fMRI:
   observation of a human hand pierced by a needle, and observation and
   imitation of emotional facial expressions. Outside the scanner, subjects
   played the Dictator Game with players of low or high income (represented
   by neutral-expression headshots). Subjects' offers in the Dictator Game
   were correlated with activity in neural systems associated with
   self-other resonance and anticorrelated with activity in systems
   implicated in the control of pain, affect, and imitation. Functional
   connectivity between areas involved in self-other resonance and top-down
   control was negatively correlated with subjects' offers. This study
   suggests that the interaction between self-other resonance and top-down
   control processes are an important component of prosocial inclinations
   towards others, even when biological stimuli associated with self-other
   resonance are limited. These findings support a view of prosocial
   decision-making grounded in embodied cognition. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Our understanding of altered emotional processing in social anxiety
   disorder (SAD) is hampered by a heterogeneity of findings, which is
   probably due to the vastly different methods and materials used so far.
   This is why the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study investigated immediate disorder-related threat processing in 30
   SAD patients and 30 healthy controls (HC) with a novel, standardized set
   of highly ecologically valid, disorder-related complex visual scenes.
   SAD patients rated disorder-related as compared with neutral scenes as
   more unpleasant, arousing and anxiety-inducing than HC. On the neural
   level, disorder-related as compared with neutral scenes evoked
   differential responses in SAD patients in a widespread emotion
   processing network including (para-)limbic structures (e.g. amygdala,
   insula, thalamus, globus pallidus) and cortical regions (e.g.
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),
   and precuneus). Functional connectivity analysis yielded an altered
   interplay between PCC/precuneus and paralimbic (insula) as well as
   cortical regions (dmPFC, precuneus) in SAD patients, which emphasizes a
   central role for PCC/precuneus in disorder-related scene processing.
   Hyperconnectivity of globus pallidus with amygdala, anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) additionally underlines
   the relevance of this region in socially anxious threat processing. Our
   findings stress the importance of specific disorder-related stimuli for
   the investigation of altered emotion processing in SAD. Disorder-related
   threat processing in SAD reveals anomalies at multiple stages of emotion
   processing which may be linked to increased anxiety and to
   dysfunctionally elevated levels of self-referential processing reported
   in previous studies. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1559-1572, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the effects of LSD on mental time travel during
   spontaneous mentation. Twenty healthy volunteers participated in a
   placebo-controlled crossover study, incorporating intravenous
   administration of LSD (75 g) and placebo (saline) prior to functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Six independent, blind judges
   analysed mentation reports acquired during structured interviews
   performed shortly after the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   scans (approximately 2.5 h post-administration). Within each report,
   specific linguistic references to mental spaces for the past, present
   and future were identified. Results revealed significantly fewer mental
   spaces for the past under LSD and this effect correlated with the
   general intensity of the drug's subjective effects. No differences in
   the number of mental spaces for the present or future were observed.
   Consistent with the previously proposed role of the default-mode network
   (DMN) in autobiographical memory recollection and ruminative thought,
   decreased resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the DMN
   correlated with decreased mental time travel to the past. These results
   are discussed in relation to potential therapeutic applications of LSD
   and related psychedelics, e.g. in the treatment of depression, for which
   excessive reflection on one's past, likely mediated by DMN functioning,
   is symptomatic.}},

Journal = {{APPETITE}},

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have started to explore the role of food
   characteristics (e.g., calorie-content) and psychological factors (e.g.,
   restrained eating, craving) for the human appetitive system, motivated
   by the significant health implications of food-choice, overeating and
   overweight/obesity. However, one key aspect of modern food environments,
   food availability, especially of high energy foods, has not been
   adequately modeled in experimental research. Food that is immediately
   available for consumption could elicit stronger reward system activity
   and associated cognitive control than food that is not currently
   available for consumption and this could vary as a function of energy
   density. To examine this question, 32 healthy participants (16 women)
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while passively viewing
   available foods - i.e. foods that could be eaten during and after the
   experiment - and unavailable foods of either high or low-caloric density
   in a 2 x 2 design. Available compared to unavailable foods elicited
   higher palatability ratings as well as stronger neural activation in the
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, and left caudate nucleus as well
   as in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) - and thus structures
   implicated in reward and appetitive motivation as well as cognitive
   control, respectively. Availability effects in the caudate were mainly
   attributable to the high calorie condition (availability x calorie
   density interaction). These neuroimaging results support the contention
   that foods are particularly rewarding when immediately available and
   particularly so when high in caloric density. Thus, our results are
   consistent with health promoting interventions utilizing a nudging
   approach, i.e. aiming at decreasing accessibility of high calorie and
   increasing accessibility of low calorie foods in daily life. Results
   also imply that controlling/manipulating food availability may be an
   important methodological aspect in neuroscientific eating research. (C)

Abstract = {{Cognitive control, a set of functions that develop throughout
   adolescence, is important in the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders.
   Whether cognitive control has a role in conferring vulnerability for the
   development of psychotic illness is still unknown. The aim of this study
   was to investigate the neural systems supporting cognitive control in
   individuals deemed to be potentially prodromal for psychotic illness. We
   recruited 56 participants at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis
   based on the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS)
   and 49 healthy controls. Twelve of the CHR participants eventually
   developed psychosis. We compared functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) BOLD signal during the performance of the Simon task. We tested
   for differences between CHR individuals and controls in conflict-related
   functional activity. In the CHR group when compared with controls, we
   detected smaller conflict-related activations in several cortical areas,
   including the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore,
   conflict-related activations in the DLPFC of those CHR individuals who
   ultimately developed psychosis (CHR converters) were smaller than in
   non-converters (CHR non-converters). Higher levels of conflict-related
   activation were associated with better social and role outcome. Risk for
   psychosis was associated at the neural level with reduced
   conflict-related brain activity. This neural phenotype appears
   correlated within the DLPFC with the development of psychosis and with
   functional outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 10\% of trauma-exposed individuals go on to develop
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Neural emotion regulation may be
   etiologically involved in PTSD development. Oxytocin administration
   early post-trauma may be a promising avenue for PTSD prevention, as
   intranasal oxytocin has previously been found to affect emotion
   regulation networks in healthy individuals and psychiatric patients. In
   a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled between-subjects functional
   magnetic resonance (fMRI) study, we assessed the effects of a single
   intranasal oxytocin administration (40 IU) on seed-based amygdala
   resting-state FC with emotion regulation areas (ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC)), and salience
   processing areas (insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)) in 37
   individuals within 11 days post trauma. Two resting-state scans were
   acquired; one after neutral-and one after trauma-script-driven imagery.
   We found that oxytocin administration reduced amygdala-left vlPFC FC
   after trauma script-driven imagery, compared with neutral script-driven
   imagery, whereas in PL-treated participants enhanced amygdala-left vlPFC
   FC was observed following trauma script-driven imagery. Irrespective of
   script condition, oxytocin increased amygdala-insula FC and decreased
   amygdalavm-PFC FC. These neural effects were accompanied by lower levels
   of sleepiness and higher flashback intensity in the oxytocin group after
   the trauma script. Together, our findings show that oxytocin
   administration may impede emotion regulation network functioning in
   response to trauma reminders in recently trauma-exposed individuals.
   Therefore, caution may be warranted in administering oxytocin to prevent
   PTSD in distressed, recently trauma-exposed individuals.}},

Title = {{Stimulation over primary motor cortex during action observation impairs
   effector recognition}},
Journal = {{COGNITION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{84-94}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recent work suggests that motor cortical processing during action
   observation plays a role in later recognition of the object involved in
   the action. Here, we investigated whether recognition of the effector
   making an action is also impaired when transcranial magnetic stimulation
   (TMS) - thought to interfere with normal cortical activity - is applied
   over the primary motor cortex (M1) during action observation. In two
   experiments, single-pulse TMS was delivered over the hand area of M1
   while participants watched short clips of hand actions. Participants
   were then asked whether an image (experiment 1) or a video (experiment
   2) of a hand presented later in the trial was the same or different to
   the hand in the preceding video. In Experiment 1, we found that
   participants' ability to recognise static images of hands was
   significantly impaired when TMS was delivered over M1 during action
   observation, compared to when no TMS was delivered, or when stimulation
   was applied over the vertex. Conversely, stimulation over M1 did not
   affect recognition of dot configurations, or recognition of hands that
   were previously presented as static images (rather than action movie
   clips) with no object. In Experiment 2, we found that effector
   recognition was impaired when stimulation was applied part way through
   (300 ms) and at the end (500 ms) of the action observation period,
   indicating that 200 ms of action-viewing following stimulation was not
   long enough to form a new representation that could be used for later
   recognition. The findings of both experiments suggest that interfering
   with, cortical motor activity during action observation impairs
   subsequent recognition of the effector involved in the action, which
   complements previous findings of motor system involvement in object
   memory. This work provides some of the first evidence that motor
   processing during action observation is involved in forming
   representations of the effector that are useful beyond the action
   observation period. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Central autonomic nervous system response to autonomic challenges is

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aims: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an intriguing disease characterized by
   acute transient left ventricular dysfunction usually triggered by an
   episode of severe stress. The excessive levels of catecholamines and the
   overactivation of the sympathetic system are believed to be the main
   pathophysiologic mechanisms of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, but it is
   unclear whether there is a structural or functional signature of the
   disease. In this sense, our aim was to characterize the central
   autonomic system response to autonomic challenges in patients with a
   previous episode of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy when compared with a
   control group of healthy volunteers.
   Methods and results: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
   performed in four patients with a previous episode of Takotsubo
   cardiomyopathy (average age of 6712 years) and in eight healthy
   volunteers (average age of 66 +/- 5 years) while being submitted to
   different autonomic challenges (cold exposure and Valsalva manoeuvre).
   The fMRI analysis revealed a significant variation of the blood oxygen
   level dependent signal triggered by the Valsalva manoeuvre in specific
   areas of the brain involved in the cortical control of the autonomic
   system and significant differences in the pattern of activation of the
   insular cortex, amygdala and the right hippocampus between patients with
   Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and controls, even though these regions did not
   present significant volumetric changes.
   Conclusion: The central autonomic response to autonomic challenges is
   altered in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, thus suggesting a
   dysregulation of the central autonomic nervous system network.
   Subsequent studies are needed to unveil whether these alterations are
   causal or predisposing factors to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.}},

   level}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{182-186}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The mirror-neuron-system (MNS) is involved in the perception of actions
   of humans and anthropomorphic robots. The current study investigates
   whether social interaction with a non-anthropomorphic robot is
   sufficient for a response of the MNS.
   Fifty-seven participants observed movements of a vacuum cleaning robot
   before and after it was handled by its owner. The robot was either
   humanized, being treated aggressively (n = 30), or it was treated as an
   object (n = 27). Electroencephalographic mu-activity is used as an index
   of MNS activity, because both are inversely correlated. Activity within
   the 8-13 Hz band was measured at central (mu activity) and occipital
   (alpha-activity) electrodes. Further, the level of aggressiveness
   displayed by the robot's owner, and the participants' compassion were
   rated on visual analog scales.
   Mu-activity showed medium-sized correlations with rated aggressiveness
   and compassion: The more aggressive the action towards the robot was
   perceived (r = -.379, p = .004), and the more compassion was felt for
   the robot (r = -.339, p = .010), the less pronounced mu-activity was at
   electrode C3 in response to the robot's movement.
   Thus social interaction with a non-anthropomorphic robot might establish
   the robot as a social entity and is sufficient to activate the human
   MNS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Spatiotemporal Brain Dynamics of Empathy for Pain and Happiness in
   Friendship}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although a large number of functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) studies have investigated the neural bases of empathy,
   little is known about its spatiotemporal dynamics or its modulation by
   the level of friendship between the observer and the agent who is being
   hurt. Moreover, most of the previous studies on empathy have focused on
   empathy for pain rather than empathy for positive emotions, such as
   happiness. In the present study, we addressed this question by
   investigating the spatiotemporal brain dynamics of two different kinds
   of empathy (empathy for pain, empathy for happiness) with a behavioral
   priming empathy task involving two different level of primes (a close
   friend, a stranger).
   Method/Principal Findings: Electrical brain activity and behavioral data
   were analyzed from 30 subjects (12 males and 18 females). Half of the
   subjects performed a behavioral task on empathy for pain task (EPT),
   while the other half performed a behavioral task on empathy for
   happiness task (EHT). In each task, participants viewed prime
   photographs of either: (1) a stranger; or (2) a close friend(primes)
   followed by target photographs showing either a hand being hurt (or not;
   targets in the EPT), or a hand in happy circumstances (or not; targets
   in the EHT). In each task, participants were asked to judge the target
   situation and report whether they could feel the pain(in EPT) or the
   happiness(in the EHT), as a function of the primes i.e., either from the
   close friend's or from the stranger's perspective. Although our
   behavioral results didn't reveal any explicit differences among the
   different types of primes within each task, our electrophysiological
   results showed variations as a function of the primes. First, a early
   smaller N110 amplitude for pain was observed in the anterior prefrontal
   cortex during the friend prime condition compared to the stranger prime
   condition. No similar early effects were found for happiness. On the
   other hand, both empathy for happiness (EHT) and empathy for pain (EPT)
   elicited later differences. In the EPT, the friend prime elicited a
   larger late positive potential (LPP) than the stranger prime. In the
   EHT, the friend prime elicited a larger N250, a smaller P300, and a
   smaller LPP than the stranger prime.
   Conclusions: Taking the perspective of a close friend (as a prime
   stimulus) does have a dual-stage effect on empathy that is characterized
   by an early modulation for pain and later modulations for both pain and
   happiness. The early differences between friend and stranger primes for
   pain (but not for happiness) suggest that empathy for pain is an
   automatic process that has been socially learned and passed among
   friends. On the other hand, the later differences observed between
   stranger and friend prime suggest that additional cognitive appraisal
   take place for both pain and happiness. Our results suggest that it
   takes more cognitive attentional efforts to judge a stranger's happiness
   than a friend's happiness, whereas the opposite is true for pain. These
   findings open new avenues toward a better understanding of the empathic
   mind.}},

Abstract = {{Face processing is mediated by interactions between functional areas in
   the occipital and temporal lobe, and the fusiform face area (FFA) and
   anterior temporal lobe play key roles in the recognition of facial
   identity. Individuals with developmental prosopagnosia (DP), a lifelong
   face recognition impairment, have been shown to have structural and
   functional neuronal alterations in these areas. The present study
   investigated how face selectivity is generated in participants with
   normal face processing, and how functional abnormalities associated with
   DP, arise as a function of network connectivity. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and dynamic causal modeling, we examined
   effective connectivity in normal participants by assessing network
   models that include early visual cortex (EVC) and face-selective areas
   and then investigated the integrity of this connectivity in participants
   with DP. Results showed that a feedforward architecture from EVC to the
   occipital face area, EVC to FFA, and EVC to posterior superior temporal
   sulcus(pSTS) best explained how face selectivity arises in both controls
   and participants with DP. In this architecture, the DP group showed
   reduced connection strengths on feed forward connections carrying face
   information from EVC to FFA and EVC to pSTS. These altered network
   dynamics in DP contribute to the diminished face selectivity in the
   posterior occipitotemporal areas affected in DP. These findings suggest
   a novel view on the relevance of feedforward projection from EVC to
   posterior occipitotemporal face areas in generating cortical face
   selectivity and differences in face recognition ability.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal care during the first year of life provides the foundation for
   the infant's emotional and cognitive development. Depressive symptoms in
   mothers can undermine their early dyadic interaction, which may lead to
   various psychopathological disorders with long-term consequences. During
   this period, the mother-child interaction is exclusively preverbal and
   is based on the mother's ability to understand her infant's needs and
   feelings (i.e., empathy) and on reciprocal imitation of facial
   expressions that promote a social dialog that influences the development
   of the infant self. To study the effects of maternal depressive symptoms
   on neural circuits underlying these processes, we studied 16 healthy
   mothers (H) and 14 mothers with depressive symptoms (D), as assessed by
   the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Subjects
   underwent functional magnetic resonance during observation/empathizing
   (OE) and imitation (IM) of the faces of both their own child and of that
   of an unknown child aged between 6 and 12 months. During OE, D
   deactivated the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex to a greater extent
   (compared with H), thus pointing to an increased internally focused
   cognitive style during rest. Moreover, D, in respect to H, displayed a
   greater reactivity of the right amygdala, which may be an expression of
   emotional dysregulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH-NEUROIMAGING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{249}},
Pages = {{91-96}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Neural models of major depressive disorder (MDD) posit that
   over-response of components of the brain's salience network (SN) to
   negative stimuli plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of MDD. In
   the present proof-of-concept study, we tested this formulation directly
   by examining the affective consequences of training depressed persons to
   down-regulate response of SN nodes to negative material. Ten
   participants in the real neurofeedback group saw, and attempted to learn
   to down-regulate, activity from an empirically identified node of the
   SN. Ten other participants engaged in an equivalent procedure with the
   exception that they saw SN-node neurofeedback indices from participants
   in the real neurofeedback group. Before and after scanning, all
   participants completed tasks assessing emotional responses to negative
   scenes and to negative and positive self-descriptive adjectives.
   Compared to participants in the sham-neurofeedback group, from pre- to
   post-training, participants in the realneurofeedback group showed a
   greater decrease in SN-node response to negative stimuli, a greater
   decrease in self-reported emotional response to negative scenes, and a
   greater decrease in self-reported emotional response to negative
   self-descriptive adjectives. Our findings provide support for a neural
   formulation in which the SN plays a primary role in contributing to
   negative cognitive biases in MDD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

   Identity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Faces contain a variety of information such as one's identity and
   expression. One prevailing model suggests a functional division of labor
   in processing faces that different aspects of facial information are
   processed in anatomically separated and functionally encapsulated brain
   regions. Here, we demonstrate that facial identity and expression can be
   processed in the same region, yet with different neural coding
   strategies. To this end, we employed functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to examine two types of coding schemes, namely univariate
   activity and multivariate pattern, in the posterior superior temporal
   cortex (pSTS) - a face-selective region that is traditionally viewed as
   being specialized for processing facial expression. With the individual
   difference approach, we found that participants with higher overall face
   selectivity in the right pSTS were better at differentiating facial
   expressions measured outside of the scanner. In contrast, individuals
   whose spatial pattern for faces in the right pSTS was less similar to
   that for objects were more accurate in identifying previously presented
   faces. The double dissociation of behavioral relevance between overall
   neural activity and spatial neural pattern suggests that the
   functional-division-of-labor model on face processing is
   over-simplified, and that coding strategies shall be incorporated in a
   revised model.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines implications of the expanded use of mobile platforms

   utilizing mobile platforms for dementia screen. The Saint Louis
   University Mental State examination (SLUMS) was ported onto a
   computerized mobile application named the Cambridge University Pen to
   Digital Equivalence assessment (CUPDE). CUPDE was piloted and compared
   to the traditional pen and paper version, with a common comparator test
   for both groups. Sixty healthy participants (aged 50-79) completed both
   measurements. Differences were tested between overall outcomes,
   individual items, and relationship with the comparator. Significant
   differences in the overall scores between the two testing versions as
   well as within individual items were observed. Even when groups were
   matched by cognitive function and age, scores on SLUMS original version
   (M = 19.75, SD = 3) were significantly higher than those on CUPDE (M =
   15.88, SD = 3.5), t((15)) = 3.02, p < 0.01. Mobile platforms require the
   development of new normative standards, even when items can be directly
   translated. Furthermore, these must fit aging populations with
   significant variance in familiarity with mobile technology. Greater

   and visual systems, which are not well understood yet in the context of

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are a hallmark of schizophrenia
   and can significantly impair patients' emotional, social, and
   occupational functioning. Despite progress in psychopharmacology, over
   25\% of schizophrenia patients suffer from treatment-resistant
   hallucinations. In the search for alternative treatment methods,
   neurofeedback (NF) emerges as a promising therapy tool. NF based on
   real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) allows
   voluntarily change of the activity in a selected brain region - even in
   patients with schizophrenia. This study explored effects of NF on
   ongoing AVHs. The selected participants were trained in the
   self-regulation of activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a
   key monitoring region involved in generation and intensity modulation of
   AVHs. Using rt-fMRI, three right-handed patients, suffering from
   schizophrenia and ongoing, treatment-resistant AVHs, learned control
   over ACC activity on three separate days. The effect of NF training on
   hallucinations' severity was assessed with the Auditory Vocal
   Hallucination Rating Scale (AVHRS) and on the affective state - with the
   Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). All patients yielded
   significant upregulation of the ACC and reported subjective improvement
   in some aspects of AVHs (AVHRS) such as disturbance and suffering from
   the voices. In general, mood (PANAS) improved during NF training, though
   two patients reported worse mood after NF on the third day. ACC and
   reward system activity during NF learning and specific effects on mood
   and symptoms varied across the participants. None of them profited from
   the last training set in the prolonged three-session training. Moreover,
   individual differences emerged in brain networks activated with NF and
   in symptom changes, which were related to the patients' symptomatology
   and disease history. NF based on rt-fMRI seems a promising tool in
   therapy of AVHs. The patients, who suffered from continuous
   hallucinations for years, experienced symptom changes that may be
   attributed to the NF training. In order to assess the effectiveness of
   NF as a therapeutic method, this effect has to be studied systematically
   in larger groups; further, long-term effects need to be assessed.
   Particularly in schizophrenia, future NF studies should take into
   account the individual differences in reward processing, fatigue, and
   motivation to develop individualized training protocols.}},

Abstract = {{The right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) is thought to be closely
   related to theory of mind (ToM) and cognitive empathy. In the present
   study, we investigated whether these socio-cognitive abilities could be
   modulated with non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation
   (tDCS) of the rTPJ. Participants received anodal (excitatory), cathodal
   (inhibitory), or sham stimulation before performing a social cognitive
   task which included inferring other's intention (the ToM condition) and
   inferring other's emotion (the cognitive empathy condition). Our results
   showed that the accuracy of both ToM and cognitive empathy decreased
   after receiving the cathodal stimulation, suggesting that altering the
   cortical excitability in the rTPJ could influence human's
   socio-cognitive abilities. The results of this study emphasize the
   critical role of the rTPJ in ToM and cognitive empathy and demonstrate
   that these socio-cognitive abilities could be modulated by the tDCS.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},

Volume = {{616}},

Abstract = {{Blue wavelength light has been used as an effective treatment for some
   types of mood disorders and circadian rhythm related sleep problems. We
   hypothesized that acute exposure to blue wavelength light would directly
   affect the functioning of neurocircuity implicated in emotion regulation
   (i.e., ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, insula, and anterior
   cingulate cortex {[}ACC]) during `certain' and `uncertain' anticipation
   of negative and positive stimuli. Thirty-five healthy adults were
   randomized to receive a thirty-minute exposure to either blue (active)
   or amber (placebo) light, immediately followed by an emotional
   anticipation task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   In contrast to placebo, participants in the blue light group showed
   significantly reduced activation within the rostral ACC during
   `uncertain' anticipation (i.e., uncertainty regarding whether a positive
   or negative stimulus would be shown) in comparison to `certain'
   anticipation of a positive stimulus. These findings may be explicable in
   terms of interactions between blue light exposure and the influence of
   specific neuromodulators on ACC-mediated decision-making mechanisms. (C)

Title = {{Dismissing Attachment Characteristics Dynamically Modulate Brain
   Networks Subserving Social Aversion}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Attachment patterns influence actions, thoughts and feeling through a
   person's ``inner working model{''}. Speech charged with
   attachment-dependent content was proposed to modulate the activation of
   cognitive-emotional schemata in listeners. We performed a 7 Tesla
   rest-task-rest functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)experiment,
   presenting auditory narratives prototypical of dismissing attachment
   representations to investigate their effect on 23 healthy males. We then
   examined effects of participants' attachment style and childhood trauma
   on brain state changes using seed based functional connectivity (FC)
   analyses, and finally tested whether subjective differences in
   responsivity to narratives could be predicted by baseline network
   states. In comparison to a baseline state, we observed increased FC in a
   previously described ``social aversion network{''} including dorsal
   anterior cingulated cortex (dACC) and left anterior middle temporal
   gyrus (aMTG) specifically after exposure to insecure-dismissing
   attachment narratives. Increased dACC-seeded FC within the social
   aversion network was positively related to the participants' avoidant
   attachment style and presence of a history of childhood trauma. Anxious
   attachment style on the other hand was positively correlated with FC
   between the dACC and a region outside of the ``social aversion
   network{''}, namely the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which suggests
   decreased network segregation as a function of anxious attachment.
   Finally, the extent of subjective experience of friendliness towards the
   dismissing narrative was predicted by low baseline FC values between
   hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Taken together, our
   study demonstrates an activation of networks related to social aversion
   in terms of increased connectivity after listening to
   insecure-dismissing attachment narratives. A causal interrelation of
   brain state changes and subsequent changes in social reactivity was
   further supported by our observation of direct prediction of neuronal
   responses by individual attachment and trauma characteristics and
   reversely prediction of subjective experience by intrinsic functional
   connections. We consider these findings of activation of within-network
   and between-network connectivity modulated by inter-individual
   differences as substantial for the understanding of interpersonal
   processes, particularly in clinical settings.}},

   during Cooperative Jenga Game with Face-to-Face Communication}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular
   technology for studying social cognition. In particular, fNIRS permits
   simultaneous measurement of hemodynamic activity in two or more
   individuals interacting in a naturalistic setting. Here, we used fNIRS
   hyperscanning to study social cognition and communication in human dyads
   engaged in cooperative and obstructive interaction while they played the
   game of Jenga (TM). Novel methods were developed to identify
   synchronized channels for each dyad and a structural node-based spatial
   registration approach was utilized for inter dyad analyses. Strong
   inter-brain neural synchrony (INS) was observed in the posterior region
   of the right middle and superior frontal gyrus, in particular Brodmann
   area 8 (BA8), during cooperative and obstructive interaction. This
   synchrony was not observed during the parallel game play condition and
   the dialog section, suggesting that BA8 was involved in goal-oriented
   social interaction such as complex interactive movements and social
   decision-making. INS was also observed in the dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex (dmPFC), in particular Brodmann 9, during cooperative interaction
   only. These additional findings suggest that BA9 may be particularly
   engaged when theory-of-mind (ToM) is required for cooperative social
   interaction. The new methods described here have the potential to
   significantly extend fNIRS applications to social cognitive research.}},

Title = {{Sharing self-related information is associated with intrinsic functional
   connectivity of cortical midline brain regions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Human beings are social animals and they vary in the degree to which
   they share information about themselves with others. Although brain
   networks involved in self-related cognition have been identified,
   especially via the use of resting-state experiments, the neural
   circuitry underlying individual differences in the sharing of
   self-related information is currently unknown. Therefore, we
   investigated the intrinsic functional organization of the brain with
   respect to participants' degree of self-related information sharing
   using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and
   self-reported social media use. We conducted seed-based correlation
   analyses in cortical midline regions previously shown in meta-analyses
   to be involved in self-referential cognition: the medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC), central precuneus (CP), and caudal anterior cingulate
   cortex (CACC). We examined whether and how functional connectivity
   between these regions and the rest of the brain was associated with
   participants' degree of self-related information sharing. Analyses
   revealed associations between the MPFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (DLPFC), as well as the CP with the right DLPFC, the left lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex and left anterior temporal pole. These findings
   extend our present knowledge of functional brain connectivity,
   specifically demonstrating how the brain's intrinsic functional
   organization relates to individual differences in the sharing of
   self-related information.}},

Abstract = {{Despite extensive research on the neural basis of empathic responses for
   pain and disgust, there is limited data about the brain regions that
   underpin affective response to other people's emotional facial
   expressions. Here, we addressed this question using event-related
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess neural responses to
   emotional faces, combined with online ratings of subjective state. When
   instructed to rate their own affective response to others' faces,
   participants recruited anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate,
   inferior frontal gyrus, and amygdala, regions consistently implicated in
   studies investigating empathy for disgust and pain, as well as emotional
   saliency. Importantly, responses in anterior insula and amygdala were
   modulated by trial-by-trial variations in subjective affective responses
   to the emotional facial stimuli. Furthermore, overall task-elicited
   activations in these regions were negatively associated with
   psychopathic personality traits, which are characterized by low
   affective empathy. Our findings suggest that anterior insula and
   amygdala play important roles in the generation of affective internal
   states in response to others' emotional cues and that attenuated
   function in these regions may underlie reduced empathy in individuals
   with high levels of psychopathic traits.}},

Title = {{Our Faces in the Dog's Brain: Functional Imaging Reveals Temporal Cortex
   Activation during Perception of Human Faces}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Dogs have a rich social relationship with humans. One fundamental aspect
   of it is how dogs pay close attention to human faces in order to guide
   their behavior, for example, by recognizing their owner and his/her
   emotional state using visual cues. It is well known that humans have
   specific brain regions for the processing of other human faces, yet it
   is unclear how dogs' brains process human faces. For this reason, our
   study focuses on describing the brain correlates of perception of human
   faces in dogs using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We
   trained seven domestic dogs to remain awake, still and unrestrained
   inside an MRI scanner. We used a visual stimulation paradigm with block
   design to compare activity elicited by human faces against everyday
   objects. Brain activity related to the perception of faces changed
   significantly in several brain regions, but mainly in the bilateral
   temporal cortex. The opposite contrast (i.e., everyday objects against
   human faces) showed no significant brain activity change. The temporal
   cortex is part of the ventral visual pathway, and our results are
   consistent with reports in other species like primates and sheep, that
   suggest a high degree of evolutionary conservation of this pathway for
   face processing. This study introduces the temporal cortex as candidate
   to process human faces, a pillar of social cognition in dogs.}},

Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is activated in association with a
   large range of functions, including social cognition, episodic memory
   retrieval, and attentional reorienting. An ongoing debate is whether the
   TPJ performs an overarching, domain-general computation, or whether
   functions reside in domain-specific subdivisions. We scanned subjects
   with fMRI during five tasks known to activate the TPJ, probing social,
   attentional, and memory functions, and used data-driven parcellation
   (independent component analysis) to isolate task-related functional
   processes in the bilateral TPJ. We found that one dorsal component in
   the right TPJ, which was connected with the frontoparietal control
   network, was activated in all of the tasks. Other TPJ subregions were
   specific for attentional reorienting, oddball target detection, or
   social attribution of belief. The TPJ components that participated in
   attentional reorienting and oddball target detection appeared spatially
   separated, but both were connected with the ventral attention network.
   The TPJ component that participated in the theory-of-mind task was part
   of the default-mode network. Further, we found that the BOLD response in
   the domain-general dorsal component had a longer latency than responses
   in the domain-specific components, suggesting an involvement in
   distinct, perhaps postperceptual, computations. These findings suggest
   that the TPJ performs both domain-general and domain-specific
   computations that reside within spatially distinct functional
   components.}},

Abstract = {{Context Abnormal emotion processing is frequent in schizophrenia and
   affects social and functional outcome. Past event-related potential
   (ERP) research investigating processing of affective stimuli in
   schizophrenia was done mainly with facial expressions and revealed
   impaired facial emotion recognition in patients relative to control
   subjects. Experimentations involving fMRI with this group of patients,
   showed alteration of limbic and frontal regions in response to emotional
   unpleasant images, compared to neutral stimuli during a memory task.
   Other studies have also noted an increase in brain activity when the
   activation of the stimuli was high compared to low arousal stimuli. This
   may indicate a different sensitivity threshold to emotional arousal and
   emotional valence involving frontal pathways in these patients. But very
   few studies attempted to separate the contributions of emotional valence
   and arousal within an episodic memory protocol with ERP, in that
   population.
   Goal The aim of the current research is to investigate brain
   electro-cortical activity in schizophrenia in response to emotional
   images during an episodic memory task.
   Method ERP components were analyzed in 16 schizophrenic and 17 control
   participants matched for age, sex and intelligence. ERPs were obtained
   from 56 EEG electrodes. The tasks consisted in a classical episodic
   memory task that presented 100 repeated old and 100 new photographic
   images divided into four categories (unpleasant-high arousal,
   unpleasant-low arousal, pleasant-high arousal and pleasant-low arousal)
   selected from the International Affective Picture System. The N200, P300
   and late positive component (LPC) mean amplitude, were analyzed using
   repeated-measure analyses of variance (MANOVA).
   Results Patients with schizophrenia and control subjects gave comparable
   subjective evaluations of arousal and valence. However, the frontal N200
   and the P300 both showed an interaction of the group x memory x valence
   x hemisphere (F {[}1.32]= 8.36; p < .01). Thus, this complex interaction
   denotes an increase of the episodic memory effect in the right
   hemisphere in response to unpleasant stimuli, with schizophrenic
   patients. With respect to the control group, there is also an increase
   of this memory effect in the right hemisphere, but in response to
   pleasant stimuli. The schizophrenic patients presented a smaller LPC
   memory effect, especially at the frontal region. More specifically, the
   frontal LPC was reduced, and the clinical group was less reactive to the
   emotional arousal content, compared to the control group.
   Discussion Altogether, our results revealed that while the subjective
   evaluation of emotional pictures is equivalent across groups, cerebral
   differences are present in schizophrenic patients during emotional
   recognition. N200 and P300 results in the frontal region suggest
   impaired selective attention and episodic memory to unpleasant stimuli
   in patients, while later processes related to conscious recollection
   parietal LPC) are not affected with patients affected with
   schizophrenia.
   Conclusion This finding provides further support for the notion of a
   possible discrepancy between the subjective experience and the
   physiological expression of emotions in schizophrenia patients. Those
   results could open the door to new clinical research investigations in
   psychiatry, particularly in the comprehension of a relationship between
   frontal cortex vulnerability and episodic memory often present in
   psychosis.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, research on human functional brain imaging using
   resting-state fMRI techniques has been increasingly prevalent. The term
   ``default mode{''} was proposed to describe a baseline or default state
   of the brain during rest. Recent studies suggested that the default mode
   network (DMN) is comprised of two functionally distinct subsystems: a
   dorsal-medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) subsystem involved in
   self-oriented cognition (i.e., theory of mind) and a medial temporal
   lobe (MTL) subsystem engaged in memory and scene construction; both
   subsystems interact with the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC)
   and posterior cingulate (PCC) as the core regions of DMN. The present
   study explored the development of DMN core regions and these two
   subsystems in both hemispheres from 3- to 5-year-old children. The
   analysis of the intrinsic activity showed strong developmental changes
   in both subsystems, and significant changes were specifically found in
   MTL subsystem, but not in DMPFC subsystem, implying distinct
   developmental trajectories for DMN subsystems. We found stronger
   interactions between the DMPFC and MTL subsystems in 5-year-olds,
   particularly in the left subsystems that support the development of
   environmental adaptation and relatively complex mental activities. These
   results also indicate that there is stronger right hemispheric
   lateralization at age 3, which then changes as bilateral development
   gradually increases through to age 5, suggesting in turn the hemispheric
   dominance in DMN subsystems changing with age. The present results
   provide primary evidence for the development of DMN subsystems in early
   life, which might be closely related to the development of social
   cognition in childhood.}},

Abstract = {{Heightened neural responsiveness of alcoholics to alcohol cues and
   social emotion may impede sobriety. To test mesocorticolimbic network
   responsivity, 10 (8 men) alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients sober for 3
   weeks to 10 months and 11 (8 men) controls underwent fMRI whilst viewing
   pictures of alcohol and non-alcohol beverages and of emotional faces
   (happy, sad, angry). AUD and controls showed similarities in
   mesocorticolimbic activity: both groups activated fusiform for emotional
   faces and hippocampal and pallidum regions during alcohol picture
   processing. In AUD, less fusiform activity to emotional faces and more
   pallidum activity to alcohol pictures were associated with longer
   sobriety. Using graph theory-based network efficiency measures to
   specify the role of the mesocorticolimbic network nodes for emotion and
   reward in sober AUD revealed that the left hippocampus was less
   efficiently connected with the other task-activated network regions in
   AUD than controls when viewing emotional faces, while the pallidum was
   more efficiently connected when viewing alcohol beverages. Together our
   findings identified lower occipito-temporal sensitivity to emotional
   faces and enhanced striatal sensitivity to alcohol stimuli in AUD than
   controls. Considering the role of the striatum in encoding reward, its
   activation enhancement with longer sobriety may reflect adaptive neural
   changes in the first year of drinking cessation and mesocorticolimbic
   system vulnerability for encoding emotional salience and reward
   potentially affecting executive control ability and relapse propensity
   during abstinence.}},

Pages = {{26-41}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A cognitive-stimulation tool was created to regulate functional
   connectivity within the brain Default Mode Network (DMN). Computerized
   exercises were designed based on the hypothesis that repeated
   task-dependent coactivation of multiple DMN regions would translate into
   regulation of resting-state network connectivity.
   Forty seniors (mean age: 65.90 years; SD: 8.53) were recruited and
   assigned either to an experimental group (n = 21) who received one month
   of intensive cognitive stimulation, or to a control group (n=19) who
   maintained a regime of daily-life activities explicitly focused on
   social interactions. An MRI protocol and a battery of neuropsychological
   tests were administered at baseline and at the end of the study. Changes
   in the DMN (measured via functional connectivity of posterior-cingulate
   seeds), in brain volumes, and in cognitive performance were measured
   with mixed models assessing group-by-timepoint interactions. Moreover,
   regression models were run to test gray-matter correlates of the various
   stimulation tasks.
   Significant associations were found between task performance and
   gray-matter volume of multiple DMN core regions. Training-dependent
   up-regulation of functional connectivity was found in the posterior DMN
   component. This interaction was driven by a pattern of increased
   connectivity in the training group, while little or no up-regulation was
   seen in the control group. Minimal changes in brain volumes were found,
   but there was no change in cognitive performance.
   The training-dependent regulation of functional connectivity within the
   posterior DMN component suggests that this stimulation program might
   exert a beneficial impact in the prevention and treatment of early AD
   neurodegeneration, in which this neurofunctional pathway is
   progressively affected by the disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Background The desirable goals of the treatment of major depressive
   disorder (MDD) are considered both to achieve symptom remission and to
   help the patients be restored to their premorbid levels of functioning.
   Remission has often been defined clinically as a threshold using
   standardized scales. Such a definition, however, allows several residual
   symptoms to be present in the remitted state. The aim of this study was
   to examine the relationship between the levels of residual symptoms and
   social functioning and also the relationship between residual symptoms
   and brain function.
   Methods The subjects were 21 patients with MDD in remission, defined
   operationally using clinician-rated 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale.
   Depressive symptoms and social functioning were self-assessed with the
   Japanese versions of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
   Scale (CES-D) and the Social Adaptation Self-evaluation Scale (SASS),
   respectively. Brain function was measured by the changes in
   concentration of oxy-hemoglobin ({[}oxy-Hb]) in the prefrontal and
   temporal cortices during verbal fluency task using nearinfrared
   spectroscopy (NIRS).
   Results The mean CES-D total score was 18.0, s = 13.2, indicating that
   they have on average mild depression. Scores of CES-D total and those of
   its four factors showed a significantly negative correlation with the
   SASS total score. Among the four factors, ``Interpersonal problems{''}
   factor showed the strongest correlation with it. CES-D total score and
   those of its three factors, ``Depressed affect{''}, ``Somatic and
   retarded activity{''} and ``Positive affect{''}, showed significantly
   negative correlations with the mean {[}oxy-Hb] changes mainly in the
   left hemisphere, whereas ``Interpersonal problems{''} factor showed a
   significantly positive correlation with the size of NIRS activation
   predominantly in right prefrontal regions.
   Conclusion Our results indicate that remitted patients with MDD possibly
   have residual symptoms which are most likely to impair their social
   functioning and that these symptoms are differentially associated with
   brain function measured with NIRS.}},

Abstract = {{Research on error observation has focused predominantly on situations in
   which individuals are passive observers of errors. In daily life,
   however, we are often jointly responsible for the mistakes of others. In
   the current study, we examined how information on agency is integrated
   in the error observation network. It was found that activation in the
   anterior insula but not in the posterior medial frontal cortex or
   lateral prefrontal cortex differentiates between observed errors for
   which we are partly responsible or not. Interestingly, the activation
   pattern of the AI was mirrored by feelings of guilt and shame. These
   results suggest that the anterior insula is crucially involved in
   evaluating the consequences of our actions for other persons.
   Consequently, this region may be thought of as critical in guiding
   social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Self-esteem is an affective, self-evaluation of oneself and has a
   significant effect on mental and behavioral health. Although research
   has focused on the neural substrates of self-esteem, little is known
   about the spontaneous brain activity that is associated with trait
   self-esteem (TSE) during the resting state. In this study, we used the
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal of the
   amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and resting state
   functional connectivity (RSFC) to identify TSE-related regions and
   networks. We found that a higher level of TSE was associated with higher
   ALFFs in the left ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and lower
   ALFFs in the left cuneus/lingual gyrus and right lingual gyrus. RSFC
   analyses revealed that the strengths of functional connectivity between
   the left vmPFC and bilateral hippocampus were positively correlated with
   TSE; however, the connections between the left vmPFC and right inferior
   frontal gyrus and posterior superior temporal sulcus were negatively
   associated with TSE. Furthermore, the strengths of functional
   connectivity between the left cuneus/lingual gyrus and right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex were
   positively related to TSE. These findings indicate that TSE is linked to
   core regions in the default mode network and social cognition network,
   which is involved in self-referential processing, autobiographical
   memory and social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Early life stress (ELS) is strongly associated with negative outcomes in
   adulthood, including reduced motivation and increased negative mood. The
   mechanisms mediating these relations, however, are poorly understood. We
   examined the relation between exposure to ELS and reward-related brain
   activity, which is known to predict motivation and mood, at age 26, in a
   sample followed since kindergarten with annual assessments. Using
   functional neuroimaging, we assayed individual differences in the
   activity of the ventral striatum (VS) during the processing of monetary
   rewards associated with a simple card-guessing task, in a sample of 72
   male participants. We examined associations between a cumulative measure
   of ELS exposure and VS activity in adulthood. We found that greater
   levels of cumulative stress during childhood and adolescence predicted
   lower reward-related VS activity in adulthood. Extending this general
   developmental pattern, we found that exposure to stress early in
   development (between kindergarten and grade 3) was significantly
   associated with variability in adult VS activity. Our results provide an
   important demonstration that cumulative life stress, especially during
   this childhood period, is associated with blunted reward-related VS
   activity in adulthood. These differences suggest neurobiological
   pathways through which a history of ELS may contribute to reduced
   motivation and increased negative mood.}},

Abstract = {{Social approval is a reward that uses abstract social reinforcers to
   guide interpersonal interactions. Few studies have specifically explored
   social reward processing and its related neural substrates in
   schizophrenia. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia and fifteen healthy
   controls participated in a two-part study to explore the functional
   neural correlates of social approval. In the first session, participants
   were led to believe their personality would be assessed based on their
   results from various questionnaires and an interview. Participants were
   then presented with the results of their supposed evaluation in the
   scanner, while engaging in a relevant fMRI social approval task.
   Subjects provided subjective reports of pleasure associated with
   receiving self-directed positive or negative feedback. Higher activation
   of the right parietal lobe was found in controls compared with
   individuals with schizophrenia. Both groups rated traits from the high
   social reward condition as more pleasurable than the low social reward
   condition, while intergroup differences emerged in the low social reward
   condition. Positive correlations were found in patients only between
   subjective ratings of positive feedback and right insula activation, and
   a relevant behavioural measure. Evidence suggests potential neural
   substrates underlying the cognitive representation of social reputation
   in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Defects in experiencing disgust may contribute to obesity by allowing
   for the overconsumption of food. However, the relationship of disgust
   proneness and its associated neural locus has yet to be explored in the
   context of obesity. Thirty-three participants (17 obese, 16 lean)
   completed the Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale-Revised and a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm where images from 4
   categories (food, contaminates, contaminated food or fixation) were
   randomly presented. Independent two-sample t-tests revealed
   significantly lower levels of Disgust Sensitivity for the obese group
   (mean score = 14.7) compared with the lean group (mean score = 17.6, P =
   0.026). The obese group had less activation in the right insula than the
   lean group when viewing contaminated food images. Multiple regression
   with interaction analysis revealed one left insula region where the
   association of Disgust Sensitivity scores with activation differed by
   group when viewing contaminated food images. These interaction effects
   were driven by the negative correlation of Disgust Sensitivity scores
   with beta values extracted from the left insula in the obese group (r =
   -0.59) compared with a positive correlation in the lean group (r =
   0.65). Given these body mass index-dependent differences in Disgust
   Sensitivity and neural responsiveness to disgusting food images, it is
   likely that altered Disgust Sensitivity may contribute to obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Social closeness is a potent moderator of vicarious affect and
   specifically vicarious embarrassment. The neural pathways of how social
   closeness to another person affects our experience of vicarious
   embarrassment for the other's public flaws, failures and norm violations
   are yet unknown. To bridge this gap, we examined the neural response of
   participants while witnessing threats to either a friend's or a
   stranger's social integrity. The results show consistent responses of
   the anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), shared
   circuits of the aversive quality of affect, as well as the medial
   prefrontal cortex and temporal pole, central structures of the
   mentalizing network. However, the ACC/AI network activation was
   increased during vicarious embarrassment in response to a friend's
   failures. At the same time, the precuneus, a brain region associated
   with self-related thoughts, showed a specific activation and an increase
   in functional connectivity with the shared circuits in the frontal lobe
   while observing friends. This might indicate a neural systems mechanism
   for greater affective sharing and self-involvement while people interact
   with close others that are relevant to oneself.}},

Abstract = {{Recent behavioral evidence indicates a key role for intent in moral
   judgments of harmful acts (e.g. assault) but not impure acts (e.g.
   incest). We tested whether the neural responses in regions for mental
   state reasoning, including the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ),
   are greater when people evaluate harmful vs impure violations. In
   addition, using multivoxel pattern analysis, we investigated whether the
   voxel-wise pattern in these regions distinguishes intentional from
   accidental actions, for either kind of violation. The RTPJ was
   preferentially recruited in response to harmful vs impure acts.
   Moreover, although its response was equally high for intentional and
   accidental acts, the voxel-wise pattern in the RTPJ distinguished
   intentional from accidental acts in the harm domain but not the purity
   domain. Finally, we found that the degree to which the RTPJ
   discriminated between intentional and accidental acts predicted the
   impact of intent information on moral judgments but again only in the
   harm domain. These findings reveal intent to be a uniquely critical
   factor for moral evaluations of harmful vs impure acts and shed light on
   the neural computations for mental state reasoning.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence indicates that empathic responses to others' pain are
   modulated by various situational and individual factors. However, few
   studies have examined how empathy and underlying brain functions are
   modulated by social hierarchies, which permeate human society with an
   enormous impact on social behavior and cognition. In this study, social
   hierarchies were established based on incidental skill in a perceptual
   task in which all participants were mediumly ranked. Afterwards,
   participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging
   while watching inferior-status or superior-status targets receiving
   painful or non-painful stimulation. The results revealed that painful
   stimulation applied to inferior-status targets induced higher
   activations in the anterior insula (AI) and anterior medial cingulate
   cortex (aMCC), whereas these empathic brain activations were
   significantly attenuated in response to superior-status targets' pain.
   Further, this neural empathic bias to inferior-status targets was
   accompanied by stronger functional couplings of AI with brain regions
   important in emotional processing (i.e. thalamus) and cognitive control
   (i.e. middle frontal gyrus). Our findings indicate that emotional
   sharing with others' pain is shaped by relative positions in a social
   hierarchy such that underlying empathic neural responses are biased
   toward inferior-status compared with superior-status individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, experimentally induced flow experiences have been
   demonstrated with perfusion imaging during activation blocks of 3 min
   length to accommodate with the putatively slowly evolving ``mood{''}
   characteristics of flow. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) in a sample of 23 healthy, male participants to
   investigate flow in the context of a typical fMRI block design with
   block lengths as short as 30 s. To induce flow, demands of arithmetic
   tasks were automatically and continuously adjusted to the individual
   skill level. Compared against conditions of boredom and overload,
   experience of flow was evident from individuals' reported subjective
   experiences and changes in electrodermal activity. Neural activation was
   relatively increased during flow, particularly in the anterior insula,
   inferior frontal gyri, basal ganglia and midbrain. Relative activation
   decreases during flow were observed in medial prefrontal and posterior
   cingulate cortex, and in the medial temporal lobe including the
   amygdala. Present findings suggest that even in the context of
   comparably short activation blocks flow can be reliably experienced and
   is associated with changes in neural activation of brain regions
   previously described. Possible mechanisms of interacting brain regions
   are outlined, awaiting further investigation which should now be
   possible given the greater temporal resolution compared with previous
   perfusion imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The vicarious reward we receive from watching likable others obtaining a
   positive outcome is a pervasive phenomenon, yet its neural correlates
   are poorly understood. Here, we conducted a series of functional
   magnetic resonance imaging experiments to test the hypothesis that the
   brain areas responsible for action observation and reward processing
   work in a coordinated fashion during vicarious reward. In the first
   experiment (manipulation phase), the participant was instructed to cheer
   for a particular player in a two-player competitive game
   (Rock-Paper-Scissors). This manipulation made participants feel more
   unity with that player and resulted in unity-related activation in the
   premotor area during action observation. In the following main
   experiment, the participant witnessed the previously cheered-for or
   non-cheered-for player succeed in a new solitary game (a stopwatch
   game). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was activated when the
   cheered-for player succeeded in the game but not when the other player
   did. Interestingly, this vmPFC activation was functionally connected
   with premotor activation only during the cheered-for player's success.
   These results suggest that vicarious reward is processed in the
   vmPFC-premotor network, which is activated specifically by the success
   of the other person with whom the individual feels unity and closeness.}},

Abstract = {{Happiness refers to people's cognitive and affective evaluation of their
   life. Why are some people happier than others? One reason might be that
   unhappy people are prone to ruminate more than happy people. The default
   mode network (DMN) is normally active during rest and is implicated in
   rumination. We hypothesized that unhappiness may be associated with
   increased default-mode functional connectivity during rest, including
   the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
   and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). The hyperconnectivity of these areas
   may be associated with higher levels of rumination. One hundred
   forty-eight healthy participants underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. A
   group-independent component analysis identified the DMNs. Results
   indicated increased functional connectivity in the DMN was associated
   with lower levels of happiness. Specifically, relative to happy people,
   unhappy people exhibited greater functional connectivity in the anterior
   medial cortex (bilateral MPFC), posterior medial cortex regions
   (bilateral PCC) and posterior parietal cortex (left IPL). Moreover, the
   increased functional connectivity of the MPFC, PCC and IPL, correlated
   positively with the inclination to ruminate. These results highlight the
   important role of the DMN in the neural correlates of happiness, and
   suggest that rumination may play an important role in people's perceived
   happiness.}},

   affective and psycholinguistic norms for 619 German idiomatic
   expressions and explores the relationships between affective and
   psycholinguistic idiom properties. German native speakers rated each
   idiom for emotional valence, arousal, familiarity, semantic
   transparency, figurativeness, and concreteness. They also described the
   figurative meaning of each idiom and rated how confident they were about
   the attributed meaning. The results showed that idioms rated high in
   valence were also rated high in arousal. Negative idioms were rated as
   more arousing than positive ones, in line with results from single
   words. Furthermore, arousal correlated positively with figurativeness
   (supporting the idea that figurative expressions are more emotionally
   engaging than literal expressions) and with concreteness and semantic
   transparency. This suggests that idioms may convey a more direct
   reference to sensory representations, mediated by the meanings of their
   constituting words. Arousal correlated positively with familiarity. In
   addition, positive idioms were rated as more familiar than negative
   idioms. Finally, idioms without a literal counterpart were rated as more
   emotionally valenced and arousing than idioms with a literal
   counterpart. Although the meanings of ambiguous idioms were less
   correctly defined than those of unambiguous idioms, ambiguous idioms
   were rated as more concrete than unambiguous ones. We also discuss the
   relationships between the various psycholinguistic variables
   characterizing idioms, with reference to the literature on idiom
   structure and processing.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in language learning studies is to identify objective,
   pre-training predictors of success. Variation in the low-frequency
   fluctuations (LFFs) of spontaneous brain activity measured by
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has been
   found to reflect individual differences in cognitive measures. In the
   present study, we aimed to investigate the extent to which initial
   spontaneous brain activity is related to individual differences in
   spoken language learning. We acquired RS-fMRI data and subsequently
   trained participants on a sound-to-word learning paradigm in which they
   learned to use foreign pitch patterns (from Mandarin Chinese) to signal
   word meaning. We performed amplitude of spontaneous low-frequency
   fluctuation (ALFF) analysis, graph theory-based analysis, and
   independent component analysis (ICA) to identify functional components
   of the LFFs in the resting-state. First, we examined the ALFF as a
   regional measure and showed that regional ALFFs in the left superior
   temporal gyrus were positively correlated with learning performance,
   whereas ALFFs in the default mode network (DMN) regions were negatively
   correlated with learning performance. Furthermore, the graph
   theory-based analysis indicated that the degree and local efficiency of
   the left superior temporal gyrus were positively correlated with
   learning performance. Finally, the default mode network and several
   task-positive resting-state networks (RSNs) were identified via the ICA.
   The ``competition{''} (i.e., negative correlation) between the DMN and
   the dorsal attention network was negatively correlated with learning
   performance. Our results demonstrate that a) spontaneous brain activity
   can predict future language learning outcome without prior hypotheses
   (e.g., selection of regions of interest - ROIs) and b) both regional
   dynamics and network-level interactions in the resting brain can account
   for individual differences in future spoken language learning success.

Title = {{Adaptive coding of the value of social cues with oxytocin, an fMRI study
   in autism spectrum disorder}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{79-88}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) is one of the major targets of research
   in neuroscience, with respect to social functioning. Oxytocin promotes
   social skills and improves the quality of face processing in individuals
   with social dysfunctions such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
   Although one of OT's key functions is to promote social behavior during
   dynamic social interactions, the neural correlates of this function
   remain unknown. Here, we combined acute intranasal OT (IN-OT)
   administration (24 IU) and fMRI with an interactive ball game and a
   face-matching task in individuals with ASD (N = 20). We found that IN-OT
   selectively enhanced the brain activity of early visual areas in
   response to faces as compared to non-social stimuli. OT inhalation
   modulated the BOLD activity of amygdala and hippocampus in a
   context-dependent manner. Interestingly, IN-OT intake enhanced the
   activity of mid-orbitofrontal cortex in response to a fair partner, and
   insula region in response to an unfair partner. These OT-induced neural
   responses were accompanied by behavioral improvements in terms of
   allocating appropriate feelings of trust toward different partners'
   profiles. Our findings suggest that OT impacts the brain activity of key
   areas implicated in attention and emotion regulation in an adaptive
   manner, based on the value of social cues. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Psychosocial stress can affect inflammatory processes that have
   important consequences for cancer outcomes and the behavioral side
   effects of cancer treatment. To date, however, little is known about the
   upstream neural processes that may link psychosocial stressors and
   inflammation in cancer patients and survivors. To address this issue, 15
   women who had been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer and
   completed cancer treatment and 15 age- and ethnicity-matched women with
   no cancer history were recruited for a neuroimaging study. Participants
   provided a blood sample for levels of circulating inflammatory markers
   (CRP and IL-6), underwent an fMRI scan in which they completed a threat
   reactivity task designed to elicit activity in the amygdala, and
   reported their levels of perceived social attachment/support. There were
   no significant differences between cancer survivors and controls in
   levels of CRP or IL-6, in amygdala reactivity to the socially
   threatening images, or in levels of perceived social support. However,
   results showed a strong, positive correlation between CRP concentration
   and left amygdala reactivity in the survivor group that was not apparent
   in controls. Higher levels of social support in the survivor group were
   also associated with reduced amygdala reactivity and CRP. These data
   suggest the possibility of a stronger ``neural-immune pipeline{''} among
   breast cancer survivors, such that peripheral inflammation is more
   strongly associated with neural activity in threat-related brain
   regions. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

   in patients with Tourette syndrome.
   MethodsPerforming a Go/NoGo task, 12 patients with Tourette syndrome and
   12 matched controls were recorded using whole-head
   magnetoencephalography.
   ResultsCompared to healthy participants, patients showed less beta
   suppression in the sensorimotor area and enhanced beta power in
   parieto-occipital brain regions contralaterally to the response hand.
   Average beta power and power gain correlated negatively with tic
   severity.
   ConclusionsIncreased motor inhibitory as well as visuomotor attentional

Abstract = {{The right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) is engaged by tasks that
   manipulate biological motion processing, Theory of Mind attributions,
   and attention reorienting. The proximity of activations elicited by
   these tasks raises the question of whether these tasks share common
   cognitive component processes that are subserved by common neural
   substrates. Here, we used high-resolution whole-brain functional
   magnetic resonance imaging in a within-subjects design to determine
   whether these tasks activate common regions of the rTPJ. Each
   participant was presented with the 3 tasks in the same imaging session.
   In a whole-brain analysis, we found that only the right and left TPJs
   were activated by all 3 tasks. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed that
   the regions of overlap could still discriminate the 3 tasks. Notably, we
   found significant cross-task classification in the right TPJ, which
   suggests a shared neural process between the 3 tasks. Taken together,
   these results support prior studies that have indicated functional
   heterogeneity within the rTPJ but also suggest a convergence of function
   within a region of overlap. These results also call for further
   investigation into the nature of the function subserved in this overlap
   region.}},

Title = {{Identification of segregated regions in the functional brain connectome

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY \& NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Several neuroimaging studies support the model of abnormal development
   of brain connectivity in patients with autism-spectrum disorders (ASD).
   In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis of reduced functional
   network segregation in autistic patients compared with controls.
   Methods
   Functional MRI data from children acquired under a resting-state
   protocol (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange {[}ABIDE]) were submitted
   to both fuzzy spectral clustering (FSC) with entropy analysis and graph
   modularity analysis.
   Results
   We included data from 814 children in our analysis. We identified 5
   regions of interest comprising the motor, temporal and occipito-temporal
   cortices with increased entropy (p < 0.05) in the clustering structure
   (i.e., more segregation in the controls). Moreover, we noticed a
   statistically reduced modularity (p < 0.001) in the autistic patients
   compared with the controls. Significantly reduced eigenvector centrality
   values (p < 0.05) in the patients were observed in the same regions that
   were identified in the FSC analysis.
   Limitations
   There is considerable heterogeneity in the fMRI acquisition protocols
   among the sites that contributed to the ABIDE data set (e.g., scanner
   type, pulse sequence, duration of scan and resting-state protocol).
   Moreover, the sites differed in many variables related to sample
   characterization (e.g., age, IQ and ASD diagnostic criteria). Therefore,
   we cannot rule out the possibility that additional differences in
   functional network organization would be found in a more homogeneous
   data sample of individuals with ASD.
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that the organization of the whole-brain functional
   network in patients with ASD is different from that observed in
   controls, which implies a reduced modularity of the brain functional
   networks involved in sensorimotor, social, affective and cognitive
   processing.}},

Volume = {{221}},

Abstract = {{Agenesis of the corpus callosum (AgCC) is a congenital condition
   associated with wide-ranging emotional and social impairments often
   overlapping with the diagnostic criteria for autism. Mapping functional
   connectivity in the acallosal brain can help identify neural correlates
   of the deficits associated with this condition, and elucidate how
   congenital white matter alterations shape the topology of large-scale
   functional networks. By using resting-state BOLD functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rsfMRI), here we show that acallosal BTBR T+tpr3tf/J
   (BTBR) mice, an idiopathic model of autism, exhibit impaired
   intra-hemispheric connectivity in fronto-cortical, but not in posterior
   sensory cortical areas. We also document profoundly altered subcortical
   and intra-hemispheric connectivity networks, with evidence of marked
   fronto-thalamic and striatal disconnectivity, along with aberrant
   spatial extension and strength of ipsilateral and local connectivity.
   Importantly, inter-hemispheric tracing of monosynaptic connections in
   the primary visual cortex using recombinant rabies virus confirmed the
   absence of direct homotopic pathways between posterior cortical areas of
   BTBR mice, suggesting a polysynaptic origin for the synchronous rsfMRI
   signal observed in these regions. Collectively, the observed long-range
   connectivity impairments recapitulate hallmark neuroimaging findings in
   autism, and are consistent with the behavioral phenotype of BTBR mice.
   In contrast to recent rsfMRI studies in high functioning AgCC
   individuals, the profound fronto-cortical and subcortical
   disconnectivity mapped suggest that compensatory mechanism may not
   necessarily restore the full connectional topology of the brain,
   resulting in residual connectivity alterations that serve as plausible
   substrates for the cognitive and emotional deficits often associated
   with AgCC.}},

Abstract = {{Human behavior in social dilemmas is strongly framed by the social
   context, but the mechanisms underlying this framing effect remain poorly
   understood. To identify the behavioral and neural responses mediating
   framing of social interactions, participants underwent functional MRI
   while playing a prisoner's dilemma game. In separate neuroimaging
   sessions, the game was either framed as a cooperation game or a
   competition game. The framing of social decisions engaged the
   hippocampal formation, precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and
   lateral temporal gyrus. Among these regions, the engagement of the left
   hippocampus was further modulated by individual differences in empathy.
   Social decisions not adhering to the frame were associated with stronger
   engagement of the angular gyrus and trend increases in lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex, posterior intraparietal cortex, and temporopolar
   cortex. Our findings provide the first insight into the mechanisms
   underlying framing of behavior in social dilemmas, indicating increased
   engagement of the hippocampus and neocortical areas involved in memory,
   social reasoning, and mentalizing when participants make decisions that
   conform to the imposed social frame.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the neural correlates of behavior that leads
   individuals to ascribe different value to property acquired through
   their own effort than to property received as a windfall gain. We
   examine individuals' neural response to anticipated and experienced
   monetary losses from earned and unearned monetary endowments using
   functional MRI. We show that the neural processing of monetary losses is
   modulated by the effort one has put into earning the money at stake. In
   particular, we find that the loss of earned monetary endowment leads to
   a decreasing activity in the brain's reward system. Our results suggest
   that the exertion of one's own effort to gain ownership increases the
   neurally measured value of ownership rights. Our results and method may
   prove useful in developing the first steps toward a biologically
   informed valuation of property rights. Neural methods may help in the
   future to design efficient and just compensation schemes for property
   taken by eminent domain.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{50-61}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Empathy is highly relevant for social behavior and can be verbally
   expressed by voicing sympathy and concern (emotional empathy) as well as
   by paraphrasing or stating that one can mentally reconstruct and
   understand another person's thoughts and feelings (cognitive empathy).
   In this study, we investigated the emotional effects and neural
   correlates of receiving empathic social responses after negative
   performance feedback and compared the effects of emotionally vs.
   cognitively empathic comments. 20 participants (10 male) underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while receiving negative
   performance feedback for a cognitive task. Performance feedback was
   followed by verbal comments either expressing cognitive and emotional
   empathy or demonstrating a lack of empathy. Empathic comments in general
   led to less negative self-reported feelings and calmer breathing. At the
   neural level, empathic comments induced activity in regions associated
   with social cognition and emotion processing, specifically in right
   postcentral gyrus and left cerebellum (cognitively empathic comments),
   right precentral gyrus, the opercular part of left inferior frontal
   gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus (emotionally empathic comments),
   as well as the orbital part of the left middle frontal gyrus and left
   superior parietal gyrus (emotionally empathic vs. unempathic comments).
   The study shows that cognitively and emotionally empathic comments
   appear to be processed in partially separable neural systems.
   Furthermore, confirming and expanding on another study on the same
   subject, the present results demonstrate that the social display of
   cognitive empathy exerts almost as positive effects on the recipient's
   feelings and emotions in states of distress as emotionally empathic
   response does. This can be relevant for professional settings in which
   strong negative emotions need to be de-escalated while maintaining
   professional impartiality, which may allow the display of cognitive but
   not emotional empathy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A plethora of studies on the Ultimatum Game have shown that responders
   forfeit the rule of profit maximization and punish unfair proposers, by
   rejecting their offers. This behavior has been linked to increased

   have suggested a potential role of testosterone in the Ultimatum Game
   albeit with inconsistent findings. In the present study, we sought to
   further investigate the role of amygdala and testosterone in the
   Ultimatum Game, by conducting a double-blinded, single-administration
   study. Sixty milligram of Tostrex was administered to male and female
   healthy volunteers, 3 h prior to undergoing an fMRI session, during
   which they played a standard version of the Ultimatum Game. The
   behavioral analysis revealed a statistical trend, as participants in the
   testosterone group tended to accept a greater number of unfair offers
   than participants in the placebo group, irrespectively of gender. In
   terms of fMRI results, for the main contrast unfair>fair offers, the
   testosterone group displayed a greater activation in the right dIPFC
   compared to the placebo group. Increased testosterone levels were
   related to greater caudate activity. Our findings suggest a complex role
   of testosterone in social behavior and decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Background: fMRI experiments on olfaction offer new insights into the
   complex, but in contrast to other sensory systems, less studied
   cognition of odors. To perform these experiments is still a challenge.
   New method: To address the challenge posed by MR settings, an
   olfactometer design is presented including specific improvements to the
   limited number of already existing olfactometers. Innovative features
   such as pneumatically controlled pinch valves, useable in the scanner
   and providing exact stimulus timing as well as a 3D-printed nasal mask
   inlet for common sleep laboratory masks that can be used for lateral
   divided stimulus presentation are introduced. To ensure a fully
   automated and mobile system, the use of a flexible and easily-adapted
   Matlab-Code and a portable adaptable container system are presented.
   Results: The functional efficiency of these features are proven by
   results of an fMRI study as well as testing temporal resolution and
   concentration stability with a mass spectrometer.
   Comparison with existing methods: The 24-channel olfactometer design
   presented here provides an inexpensive alternative to the currently
   available olfactometers including the achievement of fast onset times,
   lateral divided stimulus presentation and high flexibility and
   adaptability to different scientific questions.
   Conclusion: The olfactometer design presented in this paper can be seen
   as a realistic and feasible solution to overcome the challenges of
   presenting olfactory stimuli within the MR setting. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Deficits of auditory scene analysis accompany Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   However, the functional neuroanatomy of spatial sound processing has not
   been defined in AD. We addressed this using a ``sparse{''} fMRI virtual
   auditory spatial paradigm in 14 patients with typical AD in relation to
   16 healthy age-matched individuals. Sound stimulus sequences discretely
   varied perceived spatial location and pitch of the sound source in a
   factorial design. AD was associated with loss of differentiated cortical
   profiles of auditory location and pitch processing at the prescribed
   threshold, and significant group differences were identified for
   processing auditory spatial variation in posterior cingulate cortex
   (controls > AD) and the interaction of pitch and spatial variation in
   posterior insula (AD > controls). These findings build on emerging
   evidence for altered brain mechanisms of auditory scene analysis and
   suggest complex dysfunction of network hubs governing the interface of
   internal milieu and external environment in AD. Auditory spatial
   processing may be a sensitive probe of this interface and contribute to
   characterization of brain network failure in AD and other
   neurodegenerative syndromes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{274-280}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Anticipatory and consummatory dissociation of hedonic
   experience may manifest as trait anhedonia in healthy and clinical
   populations. It is still unclear whether the underlying neural
   mechanisms of the monetary-based and affect-based incentive delay
   paradigms are distinct from each other. The present study aimed to
   examine the similarities and differences between the Affect Incentive
   Delay (AID) and the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) imaging paradigms in
   relation to brain activations. Method: We administered the AID and the
   MID imaging tasks to 28 adolescent participants. A cue signaling the
   type of forthcoming feedback (reward or punishment) was displayed to the
   participants, followed by a target-hit task with corresponding reward or
   punishment. Results: The striatal and limbic regions were activated
   during the anticipatory phase of MID, while there was no brain
   activation during the anticipatory phase of AID. In the consummatory
   phase, the MID task activated the medial frontal cortex, while the AID
   task activated the frontal and dorsal limbic regions. We further found
   that the anhedonic group exhibited significant hypoactivation than the
   nonanhedonic group at the left pulvinar, the left claustrum and the left
   insula to positive cues in the anticipatory phase of the AID task.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the AID and the MID tasks have
   unique activation patterns. Our findings also suggest that the AID task
   may be more sensitive in detecting anhedonia in people with trait
   anhedonia.}},

Volume = {{145}},

Abstract = {{Reminders of death often elicit defensive responses in individuals,
   especially among those with low self-esteem. Although empirical evidence
   indicates that self-esteem serves as a buffer against mortality threats,
   the precise neural mechanism underlying this effect remains unknown. We
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis
   that self-esteem modulates neural responses to death-related stimuli,
   especially functional connectivity within the limbic-frontal circuitry,
   thereby affecting subsequent defensive reactions. As predicted,
   individuals with high self-esteem subjected to a mortality threat
   exhibited increased amygdala-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)
   connectivity during the processing of death-related stimuli compared
   with individuals who have low self-esteem. Further analysis revealed
   that stronger functional connectivity between the amygdala and the VLPFC
   predicted a subsequent decline in responding defensively to those who
   threaten one's beliefs. These results suggest that the amygdala-VLPFC
   interaction, which is modulated by self-esteem, can reduce the
   defensiveness caused by death-related stimuli, thereby providing a
   neural explanation for why individuals with high self-esteem exhibit
   less defensive reactions to mortality threats.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Gratitude is a common aspect of social interaction, yet relatively
   little is known about the neural bases of gratitude expression, nor how
   gratitude expression may lead to longer-term effects on brain activity.
   To address these twin issues, we recruited subjects who coincidentally
   were entering psychotherapy for depression and/or anxiety. One group
   participated in a gratitude writing intervention, which required them to
   write letters expressing gratitude. The therapy-as-usual control group
   did not perform a writing intervention. After three months, subjects
   performed a ``Pay It Forward{''} task in the fMRI scanner. In the task,
   subjects were repeatedly endowed with a monetary gift and then asked to
   pass it on to a charitable cause to the extent they felt grateful for
   the gift. Operationalizing gratitude as monetary gifts allowed us to
   engage the subjects and quantify the gratitude expression for subsequent
   analyses. We measured brain activity and found regions where activity
   correlated with self-reported gratitude experience during the task, even
   including related constructs such as guilt motivation and desire to help
   as statistical controls. These were mostly distinct from brain regions
   activated by empathy or theory of mind. Also, our between groups
   cross-sectional study found that a simple gratitude writing intervention
   was associated with significantly greater and lasting neural sensitivity
   to gratitude-subjects who participated in gratitude letter writing
   showed both behavioral increases in gratitude and significantly greater
   neural modulation by gratitude in the medial prefrontal cortex three
   months later. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study predictions of the dual-route cascaded (DRC) model of word
   reading were tested using fMRI. Specifically, patterns of
   co-localization were investigated: (a) between pseudoword length effects
   and a pseudowords vs. fixation contrast, to reveal the sublexical
   grapho-phonemic conversion (GPC) system; and (b) between word frequency
   effects and a words vs. pseudowords contrast, to reveal the orthographic
   and phonological lexicon. Forty four native speakers of Greek were
   scanned at 3 T in an event-related lexical decision task with three
   event types: (a) 150 words in which frequency, length, bigram and
   syllable frequency, neighborhood, and orthographic consistency were
   decorrelated; (b) 150 matched pseudowords; and (c) fixation. Whole-brain
   analysis failed to reveal the predicted co-localizations. Further
   analysis with participant-specific regions of interest defined within
   masks from the group contrasts revealed length effects in left inferior
   parietal cortex and frequency effects in the left middle temporal gyrus.
   These findings could be interpreted as partially consistent with the
   existence of the GPC system and phonological lexicon of the model,
   respectively. However, there was no evidence in support of an
   orthographic lexicon, weakening overall support for the model. The
   results are discussed with respect to the prospect of using neuroimaging
   in cognitive model evaluation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Aberrant neural signatures of decision-making: Pathological gamblers
   display cortico-striatal hypersensitivity to extreme gambles}},

Abstract = {{Pathological gambling is an addictive disorder characterized by an
   irresistible urge to gamble despite severe consequences. One of the
   hallmarks of pathological gambling is maladaptive and highly risky
   decision-making, which has been linked to dysregulation of
   reward-related brain regions such as the ventral striatum. However,
   previous studies have produced contradictory results regarding the
   implication of this network, revealing either hypo-or hypersensitivity
   to monetary gains and losses. One possible explanation is that the
   gambling brain might be misrepresenting the benefits and costs when
   weighting the potential outcomes, and not the gains and losses per se.
   To address this issue, we investigated whether pathological gambling is
   associated with abnormal brain activity during decisions that weight the
   utility of possible gains against possible losses. Pathological gamblers
   and healthy human subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging while they accepted or rejected mixed gain/loss gambles with
   fifty-fifty chances of winning or losing. Contrary to healthy
   individuals, gamblers showed a U-shaped response profile reflecting
   hypersensitivity to the most appetitive and most aversive bets in an
   executive cortico-striatal network including the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex and caudate nucleus. This network is concerned with the
   evaluation of action-outcome contingencies, monitoring recent actions
   and anticipating their consequences. The dysregulation of this specific
   network, especially for extreme bets with large potentials consequences,
   offers a novel understanding of the neural basis of pathological
   gambling in terms of deficient associations between gambling actions and
   their financial impact. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Multiple hypotheses have been offered to explain the impaired
   face-processing behavior and the accompanying underlying disruptions in
   neural circuitry among individuals with autism. We explored the
   specificity of atypical face-processing activation and potential
   alterations to fusiform gyrus (FG) morphology as potential underlying
   mechanisms. Adolescents with high functioning autism (HFA) and
   age-matched typically developing (TD) adolescents were scanned with sMRI
   and fMRI as they observed human and animal faces. In spite of exhibiting
   comparable face recognition behavior, the HFA adolescents evinced
   hypo-activation throughout the face-processing system in response to
   unfamiliar human, but not animal, faces. They also exhibited greater
   activation in affective regions of the face-processing network in
   response to animal, but not human, faces. Importantly, this atypical
   pattern of activation in response to human faces was not related to
   atypical structural properties of the FG. This atypical neural response
   to human faces in autism may stem from abnormalities in the ability to
   represent the reward value of social (i.e. conspecific) stimuli.}},

   the dynamic variation of thalamo-cortical connections to identify
   different states of functional connectivity and performed state-specific
   thalamus parcellation. With normalized spectral clustering successively
   applied in temporal and spatial domains, nine thalamo-cortical
   connectivity states were identified and the dynamic thalamus
   parcellation revealed finer thalamic structures with improved atlas

Abstract = {{Previous functional connectivity studies have found both hypo- and
   hyper-connectivity in brains of individuals having autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD). Here we studied abnormalities in functional brain
   subnetworks in high-functioning individuals with ASD during free viewing
   of a movie containing social cues and interactions. Twenty-six subjects
   (13 with ASD) watched a 68-min movie during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. For each subject, we computed Pearson's correlation
   between haemodynamic time-courses of each pair of 6-mm isotropic voxels.
   From the whole-brain functional networks, we derived individual and
   group-level subnetworks using graph theory. Scaled inclusivity was then
   calculated between all subject pairs to estimate intersubject similarity
   of connectivity structure of each subnetwork. Additional 54 individuals
   (27 with ASD) from the ABIDE resting-state database were included to
   test the reproducibility of the results. Between-group differences were
   observed in the composition of default-mode and ventro-temporal-limbic
   (VTL) subnetworks. The VTL subnetwork included amygdala, striatum,
   thalamus, parahippocampal, fusiform, and inferior temporal gyri.
   Further, VTL subnetwork similarity between subject pairs correlated
   significantly with similarity of symptom gravity measured with autism
   quotient. This correlation was observed also within the controls, and in
   the reproducibility dataset with ADI-R and ADOS scores. Our results
   highlight how the reorganization of functional subnetworks in
   individuals with ASD clarifies the mixture of hypo- and
   hyper-connectivity findings. Importantly, only the functional
   organization of the VTL subnetwork emerges as a marker of
   inter-individual similarities that co-vary with behavioral measures
   across all participants. These findings suggest a pivotal role of
   ventro-temporal and limbic systems in autism. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Several lines of evidence suggest that the amygdala and the bed nucleus
   of the stria terminalis (BNST) are differentially involved in phasic and
   sustained fear. Even though, results from neuroimaging studies support
   this distinction, a specific effect of a temporal dissociation with
   phasic responses to onset versus sustained responses during prolonged
   states of threat anticipation has not been shown yet. To explore this
   issue, we investigated brain activation during anticipation of threat in
   38 healthy participants by means of functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Participants were presented different visual cues indicated the
   temporally unpredictable occurrence of a subsequent aversive or neutral
   stimulus. During the onset of aversive versus neutral anticipatory cues,
   results showed a differential phasic activation of amygdala, anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). In
   contrast, activation in the BNST and other brain regions, including
   insula, dorsolateral PFC, ACC, cuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and
   periaqueductal grey was characterized by a sustained response during the
   threat versus neutral anticipation period. Analyses of functional
   connectivity showed phasic amygdala response as positively associated
   with activation, mainly in sensory cortex areas whereas sustained BNST
   activation was negatively associated with activation in visual cortex
   and positively correlated with activation in the insula and thalamus.
   These findings suggest that the amygdala is responsive to the onset of
   cues signaling the unpredictable occurrence of a potential threat while
   the BNST in concert with other areas is involved in sustained anxiety.
   Furthermore, the amygdala and BNST are characterized by distinctive
   connectivity patterns during threat anticipation. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{The amygdala plays a pivotal role in processing anxiety and connects to
   large-scale brain networks. However, intrinsic functional connectivity
   (iFC) between amygdala and these networks has rarely been examined in
   relation to anxiety, especially across the lifespan. We employed
   resting-state functional MRI data from 280 healthy adults (18-83.5 yrs)
   to elucidate the relationship between anxiety and amygdala iFC with
   common cortical networks including the visual network, somatomotor
   network, dorsal attention network, ventral attention network, limbic
   network, frontoparietal network, and default network. Global and
   network-specific iFC were separately computed as mean iFC of amygdala
   with the entire cerebral cortex and each cortical network. We detected
   negative correlation between global positive amygdala iFC and trait
   anxiety. Network-specific associations between amygdala iFC and anxiety
   were also detectable. Specifically, the higher iFC strength between the
   left amygdala and the limbic network predicted lower state anxiety. For
   the trait anxiety, left amygdala anxiety-connectivity correlation was
   observed in both somatomotor and dorsal attention networks, whereas the
   right amygdala anxiety-connectivity correlation was primarily
   distributed in the frontoparietal and ventral attention networks.
   Ventral attention network exhibited significant anxiety-gender
   interactions on its iFC with amygdala. Together with findings from
   additional vertex-wise analysis, these data clearly indicated that both
   low-level sensory networks and high-level associative networks could
   contribute to detectable predictions of anxiety behaviors by their iFC
   profiles with the amygdala. This set of systems neuroscience findings
   could lead to novel functional network models on neural correlates of
   human anxiety and provide targets for novel treatment strategies on
   anxiety disorders. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1178-1193, 2016. (c) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Depression has been associated with various alterations in magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) derived resting-state functional connectivity.
   Recently, homotopic connectivity, defined as functional connectivity
   between homotopic regions across hemispheres, has been reported to be
   reduced in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However,
   little is known about structural factors underlying alterations of
   homotopic connectivity, which would contribute to the understanding of
   the altered neurophysiological architecture in patients with MDD. We
   compared 368 patients with MDD and 461 never-depressed controls
   regarding voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and potential
   underlying mechanisms such as the structural connectivity of the corpus
   callosum, measured by DTI-derived fractional anisotropy (FA), and
   left-right symmetries in homotopic gray matter volumes. Compared to
   controls, patients with MDD exhibited reduced VMHC in the cuneus,
   putamen, superior temporal gyrus, insula, and precuneus. Within these
   regions, no differences in left-right symmetries in homotopic gray
   matter volumes were evident across cohorts. FA of the corpus callosum
   correlated with VMHC in the entire sample. However, patients with MDD
   and controls did not differ with regard to callosal FA. The findings
   indicate that MDD is associated with a loss of interhemispheric
   synchrony in regions known to be implicated in self-referential and
   reward processing. They also suggest that additional mechanisms are
   implicated in altered homotopic connectivity of patients with MDD, other
   than direct callosal fiber pathways or asymmetries in homotopic gray
   matter volumes. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1209-1217, 2016. (c) 2015 Wiley

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1218-1234}},

Abstract = {{Limited recent evidence implicates the anterior/posterior cingulate
   (ACC/PCC) and lateral prefrontal networks as the neural substrates of
   risky decision-making biases such as illusions of control (IoC) and
   gambler's fallacy (GF). However, investigation is lacking on the dynamic
   interactive effect of those biases during decision making. Employing a
   card-guessing game that independently manipulates trial-by-trial
   perceived control and gamble outcome among 29 healthy female
   participants, we observed both IoC- and GF-type behaviors, as well as an
   interactive effect of previous control and previous outcome, with
   GF-type behaviors only following computer-selected, but not
   self-selected, outcomes. Imaging results implicated the ACC and left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in agency processing, and the
   cerebellum and right DLPFC in previous outcome processing, in accordance
   with past literature. Critically, the right inferior parietal lobule
   (IPL) exhibited significant betting-related activities to the
   interaction of previous control and previous outcome, showing more
   positive signals to previous computer-selected winning versus losing
   outcomes but the reverse pattern following self-selected outcomes, as
   well as responding to the interactive effect of control and outcome
   during feedback. Associations were also found between participants'
   behavioral sensitivity to the interactive effect of previous control and
   previous outcome, and right IPL signals, as well as its functional
   connectivity with neural networks implicated in agency and previous
   outcome processing. We propose that the right IPL provides the neural
   substrate for the interaction of perceived control and GF, through
   coordinating activities in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices
   and working conjunctively with lateral PFC and other parietal networks.

Abstract = {{Studies of semantic dementia, imaging, and repetitive TMS have suggested
   that the bilateral anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) underpin a
   modality-invariant representational hub within the semantic system.
   Questions remain, however, regarding functional specialization across a
   variety of knowledge domains within the ATL region. We investigated
   direct evidence for the functional relevance of the superior ATL in
   processing social concepts. Using converging evidence from noninvasive
   brain stimulation and neuropsychology, we demonstrate graded
   differentiation of right and left superior anterior temporal areas in
   social cognition. Whereas the left superior ATL is necessary for
   processing both social and nonsocial abstract concepts, social
   conceptual processing predominates in the right superior ATL. This
   graded hemispheric specialization is mirrored in the patient results.
   Our data shed new light on the classic debate about hemispheric
   differences in semantic and social cognition. These results are
   considered in the context of models of semantic representation and the
   emerging data on connectivity for left and right ATL regions.}},

Abstract = {{Spoken conversations typically take place in noisy environments, and
   different kinds of masking sounds place differing demands on cognitive
   resources. Previous studies, examining the modulation of neural activity
   associated with the properties of competing sounds, have shown that
   additional speech streams engage the superior temporal gyrus. However,
   the absence of a condition in which target speech was heard without
   additional masking made it difficult to identify brain networks specific
   to masking and to ascertain the extent to which competing speech was
   processed equivalently to target speech. In this study, we scanned young
   healthy adults with continuous fMRI, while they listened to stories
   masked by sounds that differed in their similarity to speech. We show
   that auditory attention and control networks are activated during
   attentive listening to masked speech in the absence of an overt
   behavioral task. We demonstrate that competing speech is processed
   predominantly in the left hemisphere within the same pathway as target
   speech but is not treated equivalently within that stream and that
   individuals who perform better in speech in noise tasks activate the
   left mid-posterior superior temporal gyrus more. Finally, we identify
   neural responses associated with the onset of sounds in the auditory
   environment; activity was found within right lateralized frontal regions
   consistent with a phasic alerting response. Taken together, these
   results provide a comprehensive account of the neural processes involved
   in listening in noise.}},

Abstract = {{People generally experience themselves as the cause of outcomes
   following from their own actions. Such agency inferences occur fluently
   and are essential to social interaction. However, schizophrenia patients
   often experience difficulties in distinguishing their own actions from
   those of others. Building on recent research into the neural substrates
   underlying agency inferences in healthy individuals, the present study
   investigates how these inferences are represented on a neural level in
   patients with schizophrenia. Thirty-one schizophrenia patients and 31
   healthy controls performed an agency inference task while functional
   magnetic resonance images were obtained. Participants were presented
   with a task wherein the relationship between their actions and the
   subsequent outcomes was ambiguous. They received instructions to cause
   specific outcomes to occur by pressing a key, but the task was designed
   to match or mismatch the color outcome with the participants' goal. Both
   groups experienced stronger agency when their goal matched (vs.
   mismatched) the outcome. However, region of interest analyses revealed
   that only controls showed the expected involvement of the medial
   prefrontal cortex and superior frontal gyrus, whereas in patients the
   agency experience was not related to brain activation. These findings
   are discussed in light of a hypofrontality model of schizophrenia. (C)

Title = {{Cost-utility and biological underpinnings of Mindfulness-Based Stress
   Reduction (MBSR) versus a psychoeducational programme (FibroQoL) for
   fibromyalgia: a 12-month randomised controlled trial (EUDAIMON study)}},

Abstract = {{Background: The EUDAIMON study focuses on fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), a
   prevalent chronic condition characterized by pain, fatigue, cognitive
   problems and distress. According to recent reviews and meta-analyses,
   Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a promising therapeutic
   approach for patients with FMS. The measurement of biomarkers as part of
   the analysis of MBSR effects would help to identify the neurobiological
   underpinnings of MBSR and increase our knowledge of FMS pathophysiology.
   The main objectives of this 12-month RCT are: firstly, to examine the
   effectiveness and cost-utility for FMS patients of MBSR as an add-on to
   treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU + the psychoeducational programme
   FibroQoL, and versus TAU only; secondly, to examine pre-post differences
   in brain structure and function, as well as levels of specific
   inflammatory markers in the three study arms and; thirdly, to analyse
   the role of some psychological variables as mediators of 12-month
   clinical outcomes.
   Methods: Effectiveness, cost-utility, and neurobiological analyses
   performed alongside a 12-month RCT. The participants will be 180 adult
   patients with FMS recruited at the Sant Joan de Deu hospital (St. Boi de
   Llobregat, Spain), randomly allocated to one of the three study arms:
   TAU + MBSR vs. TAU + FibroQol vs. TAU. A comprehensive assessment to
   collect functional, quality of life, distress, costs, and psychological
   variables will be conducted pre-, post-intervention, and at 12-month
   post-intervention. Fifty per cent of study participants will be
   evaluated at pre- and post-treatment using Voxel-Based Morphometry,
   Diffusion Tensor Imaging, pseudo-continuous Arterial Spin Labeling, and
   resting state fMRI. A cytokine multiplex kit of high-sensitivity will be
   applied (cytokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 + high-sensitivity CRP test).
   Discussion: The findings obtained from this RCT will indicate whether
   MBSR is potentially cost-effective for FMS and contribute to knowledge
   of any brain and inflammatory changes associated with MBSR in FMS
   patients. Specifically, we will determine whether there are morphometric
   and functional changes associated with participation in MBSR in brain
   regions related to meta-awareness, body awareness, memory
   consolidation-reconsolidation, emotion regulation and in networks
   postulated to underpin the sensory-discriminative, cognitive-evaluative
   and affective-motivational aspects of the pain experience.}},

Title = {{Neural selectivity for communicative auditory signals in Phelan-McDermid
   syndrome}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS), a neurodevelopmental
   disorder caused by deletion or mutation in the SHANK3 gene, is one of
   the more common single-locus causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
   PMS is characterized by global developmental delay, hypotonia, delayed
   or absent speech, increased risk of seizures, and minor dysmorphic
   features. Impairments in language and communication are one of the most
   consistent characteristics of PMS. Although there is considerable
   overlap in the social communicative deficits associated with PMS and
   ASD, there is a dearth of data on underlying abnormalities at the level
   of neural systems in PMS. No controlled neuroimaging studies of PMS have
   been reported to date. The goal of this study was to examine the neural
   circuitry supporting the perception of auditory communicative signals in
   children with PMS as compared to idiopathic ASD (iASD).
   Methods: Eleven children with PMS and nine comparison children with iASD
   were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under
   light sedation. The fMRI paradigm was a previously validated passive
   auditory task, which presented communicative (e.g., speech, sounds of
   agreement, disgust) and non-communicative vocalizations (e.g., sneezing,
   coughing, yawning).
   Results: Previous research has shown that the superior temporal gyrus
   (STG) responds selectively to communicative vocal signals in typically
   developing children and adults. Here, selective activity for
   communicative relative to non-communicative vocalizations was detected
   in the right STG in the PMS group, but not in the iASD group. The PMS
   group also showed preferential activity for communicative vocalizations
   in a range of other brain regions associated with social cognition, such
   as the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), insula, and inferior frontal
   gyrus. Interestingly, better orienting toward social sounds was
   positively correlated with selective activity in the STG and other
   ``social brain{''} regions, including the MPFC, in the PMS group.
   Finally, selective MPFC activity for communicative sounds was associated
   with receptive language level in the PMS group and expressive language
   in the iASD group.
   Conclusions: Despite shared behavioral features, children with PMS
   differed from children with iASD in their neural response to
   communicative vocal sounds and showed relative strengths in this area.
   Furthermore, the relationship between clinical characteristics and
   neural selectivity also differed between the two groups, suggesting that
   shared ASD features may partially reflect different neurofunctional
   abnormalities due to differing etiologies.}},

Abstract = {{The history of humankind is an epic of cooperation, which is ubiquitous
   across societies and increasing in scale. Much human cooperation occurs
   where it is risky to cooperate for mutual benefit because successful
   cooperation depends on a sufficient level of cooperation by others. Here
   we show that arginine vasopressin (AVP), a neuropeptide that mediates
   complex mammalian social behaviors such as pair bonding, social
   recognition and aggression causally increases humans' willingness to
   engage in risky, mutually beneficial cooperation. In two double-blind
   experiments, male participants received either AVP or placebo
   intranasally and made decisions with financial consequences in the
   ``Stag hunt{''} cooperation game. AVP increases humans' willingness to
   cooperate. That increase is not due to an increase in the general
   willingness to bear risks or to altruistically help others. Using
   functional brain imaging, we show that, when subjects make the risky
   Stag choice, AVP down-regulates the BOLD signal in the left dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a risk-integration region, and increases the
   left dlPFC functional connectivity with the ventral pallidum, an AVP
   receptor-rich region previously associated with AVP-mediated social
   reward processing in mammals. These findings show a previously
   unidentified causal role for AVP in social approach behavior in humans,
   as established by animal research.}},

Abstract = {{Life satisfaction is an essential component of subjective well-being and
   provides a fundamental resource for optimal everyday functioning. The
   goal of the present study was to examine how life satisfaction
   influences self-referential processing of emotionally valenced stimuli.
   Nineteen individuals with high life satisfaction (HLS) and 21
   individuals with low life satisfaction (LLS) were scanned using
   functional MRI while performing a face-word relevance rating task, which
   consisted of 3 types of face stimuli (self, public other, and unfamiliar
   other) and 3 types of word stimuli (positive, negative, and neutral). We
   found a significant group x word valence interaction effect, most
   strikingly in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex. In the positive word
   condition dorsal medial prefrontal cortex activity was significantly
   higher in the LLS group, whereas in the negative word condition it was
   significantly higher in the HLS group. The two groups showed distinct
   functional connectivity of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex with
   emotional processing-related regions. The findings suggest that, in
   response to emotional stimuli, individuals with HLS may successfully
   recruit emotion regulation-related regions in contrast to individuals
   with LLS. The difference in functional connectivity during
   self-referential processing may lead to an influence of life
   satisfaction on responses to emotion-eliciting stimuli.}},

Title = {{Overstatement in happiness reporting with ordinal, bounded scale}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{There are various methods by which people can express subjective
   evaluations quantitatively. For example, happiness can be measured on a
   scale from 1 to 10, and has been suggested as a measure of economic
   policy. However, there is resistance to these types of measurement from
   economists, who often regard welfare to be a cardinal, unbounded
   quantity. It is unclear whether there are differences between subjective
   evaluation reported on ordinal, bounded scales and on cardinal,
   unbounded scales. To answer this question, we developed functional
   magnetic resonance imaging experimental tasks for reporting happiness
   from monetary gain and the perception of visual stimulus. Subjects
   tended to report higher values when they used ordinal scales instead of
   cardinal scales. There were differences in neural activation between
   ordinal and cardinal reporting scales. The posterior parietal area
   showed greater activation when subjects used an ordinal scale instead of
   a cardinal scale. Importantly, the striatum exhibited greater activation
   when asked to report happiness on an ordinal scale than when asked to
   report on a cardinal scale. The finding that ordinal (bounded) scales
   are associated with higher reported happiness and greater activation in
   the reward system shows that overstatement bias in happiness data must
   be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies provide evidence that aging is associated with the
   decline of memory function and alterations in the hippocampal (HPC)
   function, including functional connectivity to the medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC). In this study, we investigated if longitudinal (12-week)
   Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin practice can improve memory function and
   modulate HPC resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). Memory
   function measurements and resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (rs-fMRI) were applied at the beginning and the end of the
   experiment. The results showed that (1) the memory quotient (MQ)
   measured by the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese Revision significantly
   increased after Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin practice as compared with
   the control group, and no significant difference was observed in MQ
   between the Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin groups; (2) rs-FC between the
   bilateral hippocampus and mPFC significantly increased in the Tai Chi
   Chuan group compared to the control group (also in the Baduanjin group
   compared to the control group, albeit at a lower threshold), and no
   significant difference between the Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin groups
   was observed; (3) rs-FC increases between the bilateral hippocampus and
   mPFC were significantly associated with corresponding memory function
   improvement across all subjects. Similar results were observed using the
   left or right hippocampus as seeds. Our results suggest that both Tai
   Chi Chuan and Baduanjin may be effective exercises to prevent memory
   decline during aging.}},

Title = {{The Influence of Menstrual Cycle and Androstadienone on Female Stress
   Reactions: An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Communicating threats and stress via biological signaling is common in
   animals. In humans, androstadienone (ANDR), a synthetic male steroid, is
   a socially relevant chemosignal exhibited to increase positive mood and
   cortisol levels specifically in (periovulatory) females in positively
   arousing contexts. In a negative context, we expected that such effects
   of ANDR could amplify social evaluative threat depending on the stress
   sensitivity, which differs between menstrual cycle phases. Therefore,
   this fMRI study aimed to examine psychosocial stress reactions on
   behavioral, hormonal and neural levels in 31 naturally cycling females,
   between 15 early follicular (EF) and 16 mid-luteal (ML) females tested
   with ANDR and placebo treatment in a repeated measures design.
   Regardless of odor stimulation, psychosocial stress (i.e., mental
   arithmetic task with social evaluative threat) led to elevated negative
   mood and anxiety in all females. A negative association of social threat
   related amygdala activation and competence ratings appeared in
   ML-females, indicating enhanced threat processing by ANDR, particularly
   in ML-females who felt less competent early in the stress experience.
   Further, ML-females showed reduced performance and stronger stress
   related hippocampus activation compared to EF-females under ANDR.
   Hippocampal activation in ML-females also correlated positively with
   post-stress subjective stress. Contrarily, such patterns were not
   observed in EF-females or under placebo in either group. Strikingly,
   unlike passive emotional processing, ANDR in a stressful context
   decreased cortisol concentration in all females. This points to a more
   complex interaction of ovarian/gonadal hormones in social threat
   processing and stress reactivity. Our findings suggest that ANDR
   enhanced initial evaluation of self-related social threat in ML-females.
   Female stress reactions are related to stress sensitivity through
   enhanced awareness and processing of social cues in a stressful context,
   with menstrual cycle phase being a critical factor.}},

Title = {{The impact of orientation filtering on face-selective neurons in monkey
   inferior temporal cortex}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Faces convey complex social signals to primates. These signals are
   tolerant of some image transformations (e.g. changes in size) but not
   others (e.g. picture-plane rotation). By filtering face stimuli for
   orientation content, studies of human behavior and brain responses have
   shown that face processing is tuned to selective orientation ranges. In
   the present study, for the first time, we recorded the responses of
   face-selective neurons in monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex to intact
   and scrambled faces that were filtered to selectively preserve
   horizontal or vertical information. Guided by functional maps, we
   recorded neurons in the lateral middle patch (ML), the lateral anterior
   patch (AL), and an additional region located outside of the functionally
   defined face-patches (CONTROL). We found that neurons in ML preferred
   horizontal-passed faces over their vertical-passed counterparts. Neurons
   in AL, however, had a preference for vertical-passed faces, while
   neurons in CONTROL had no systematic preference. Importantly,
   orientation filtering did not modulate the firing rate of neurons to
   phase-scrambled face stimuli in any recording region. Together these
   results suggest that face-selective neurons found in the face-selective
   patches are differentially tuned to orientation content, with horizontal
   tuning in area ML and vertical tuning in area AL.}},

Title = {{Resting-state functional connectivity between the dorsal anterior

   in nicotine addicts}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Nicotine addiction is associated with risky behaviors and abnormalities
   in local brain areas related to risky decision-making such as the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), anterior insula (AI), and thalamus.
   Although these brain abnormalities are anatomically separated, they may
   in fact belong to one neural network. However, it is unclear whether
   circuit-level abnormalities lead to risky decision-making in smokers. In
   the current study, we used task-based functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) and examined resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC)
   to study how connectivity between the dACC, insula, and thalamus
   influence risky decision-making in nicotine addicts. We found that an
   increase in risky decision-making was associated with stronger nicotine
   dependence and stronger RSFC of the dACC-rAI (right AI), the
   dACC-thalamus, the dACC-lAI (left AI), and the rAI-lAI, but that risky
   decision-making was not associated with risk level-related activation.
   Furthermore, the severity of nicotine dependence positively correlated
   with RSFC of the dACC-thalamus but was not associated with risk
   level-related activation. Importantly, the dACC-thalamus coupling fully
   mediated the effect of nicotine-dependent severity on risky
   decision-making. These results suggest that circuit-level connectivity
   may be a critical neural link between risky decision-making and severity
   of nicotine dependence in smokers.}},

Title = {{Anterior insula coordinates hierarchical processing of tactile mismatch
   responses}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{127}},
Pages = {{34-43}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The body underlies our sense of self, emotion, and agency. Signals
   arising from the skin convey warmth, social touch, and the physical
   characteristics of external stimuli. Surprising or unexpected tactile
   sensations can herald events of motivational salience, including
   imminent threats (e.g., an insect bite) and hedonic rewards (e.g., a
   caressing touch). Awareness of such events is thought to depend upon the
   hierarchical integration of body-related mismatch responses by the
   anterior insula. To investigate this possibility, we measured brain
   activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging, while healthy
   participants performed a roving tactile oddball task. Mass-univariate
   analysis demonstrated robust activations in limbic, somatosensory, and
   prefrontal cortical areas previously implicated in tactile deviancy,
   body awareness, and cognitive control. Dynamic Causal Modelling revealed
   that unexpected stimuli increased the strength of forward connections
   along a caudal to rostral hierarchy-projecting from thalamic and
   somatosensory regions towards insula, cingulate and prefrontal cortices.
   Within this ascending flow of sensory information, the AIC was the only
   region to show increased backwards connectivity to the somatosensory
   cortex, augmenting a reciprocal exchange of neuronal signals. Further,
   participants who rated stimulus changes as easier to detect showed
   stronger modulation of descending PFC to AIC connections by deviance.
   These results suggest that the AIC coordinates hierarchical processing
   of tactile prediction error. They are interpreted in support of an
   embodied predictive coding model where AIC mediated body awareness is
   involved in anchoring a global neuronal workspace. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{It is a well-established finding that memory encoding is impaired if an
   external secondary task (e.g. tone discrimination) is performed
   simultaneously. Yet, while studying we are also often engaged in
   internal secondary tasks such as planning, ruminating, or daydreaming.
   It remains unclear whether such a secondary internal task has similar
   effects on memory and what the neural mechanisms underlying such an
   influence are. We therefore measured participants' blood oxygenation
   level dependent responses while they learned word-pairs and
   simultaneously performed different types of secondary tasks (i.e.,
   internal, external, and control). Memory performance decreased in both
   internal and external secondary tasks compared to the easy control
   condition. However, while the external task reduced activity in
   memory-encoding related regions (hippocampus), the internal task
   increased neural activity in brain regions associated with
   self-reflection (anterior medial prefrontal cortex), as well as in
   regions associated with performance monitoring and the perception of
   salience (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex).
   Resting-state functional connectivity analyses confirmed that anterior
   medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula/dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex are part of the default mode network and salience network,
   respectively. In sum, a secondary internal task impairs memory
   performance just as a secondary external task, but operates through
   different neural mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social rewards are processed by the same dopaminergic-mediated brain
   networks as non-social rewards, suggesting a common representation of
   subjective value. Individual differences in personality and motivation
   influence the reinforcing value of social incentives, but it remains
   open whether the pursuit of social incentives is analogously supported
   by the neural reward system when positive social stimuli are connected
   to approach behavior. To test for a modulation of neural activation by
   approach motivation, individuals with high and low approach motivation
   (BAS) completed implicit and explicit social approach-avoidance
   paradigms during fMRI. High approach motivation was associated with
   faster implicit approach reactions as well as a trend for higher
   approach ratings, indicating increased approach tendencies. Implicit and
   explicit positive social approach was accompanied by stronger
   recruitment of the nucleus accumbens, middle cingulate cortex, and
   (pre-) cuneus for individuals with high compared to low approach
   motivation. These results support and extend prior research on social
   reward processing, self-other distinctions and affective judgments by
   linking approach motivation to the engagement of reward-related circuits
   during motivational reactions to social incentives. This interplay
   between motivational preferences and motivational contexts might
   underlie the rewarding experience during social interactions. (C) 2015

Title = {{Attentional Bias Predicts Increased Reward Salience and Risk Taking in
   Bipolar Disorder}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{311-319}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: There is amassing evidence that risky decision-making in
   bipolar disorder is related to reward-based differences in
   frontostriatal regions. However, the roles of early attentional and
   later cognitive processes remain unclear, limiting theoretical
   understanding and development of targeted interventions.
   METHODS: Twenty euthymic bipolar disorder and 19 matched control
   participants played a Roulette task in which they won and lost money.
   Event-related potentials and source analysis were used to quantify
   predominantly sensory-attentional (N1), motivational salience
   (feedback-related negativities {[}FRN]), and cognitive appraisal (P300)
   stages of processing. We predicted that the bipolar disorder group would
   show increased N1, consistent with increased attentional orienting, and
   reduced FRN, consistent with a bias to perceive outcomes more favorably.
   RESULTS: As predicted, the bipolar disorder group showed increased N1
   and reduced FRN but no differences in P300. N1 amplitude was
   additionally associated with real-life risk taking, and N1 source
   activity was reduced in visual cortex but increased activity in
   precuneus, frontopolar, and premotor cortex, compared to those of
   controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate an early attentional bias to
   reward that potentially drives risk taking by priming approach behavior
   and elevating reward salience in the frontostriatal pathway. Although
   later cognitive appraisals of these inputs may be relatively intact in
   remission, interventions targeting attention orienting may also be
   effective in long-term reduction of relapse.}},

   Neuroimaging Data Using the ART Neural Network}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{Research on grounded cognition suggests that the processing of a word or
   concept reactivates the perceptual representations that are associated
   with the referent object. The objective of this work is to demonstrate
   how behavioral and functional neuroimaging data on grounded cognition
   can be understood as different manifestations of the same cortical
   circuit designed to achieve stable category learning, as proposed by the
   adaptive resonance theory (ART). We showed that the ART neural network
   provides a mechanistic explanation of why reaction times in behavioral
   studies depend on the expectation or attentional priming created by the
   word meaning (Richter and Zwaan, 2009). A mismatch between top-down
   expectation and bottom-up sensory data activates an orienting subsystem
   that slows execution of the current task. Furthermore, we simulated the
   data from functional neuroimaging studies of color knowledge retrieval
   that showed anterior shift (Chao and Martin, 1999: Thompson-Schill,
   2003) and an overlap effect (Simmons et al., 2007: Hsu et al., 2011) in
   the left fusiform gyrus. We explain the anterior effect as a result of
   the partial activation of different components of the same ART circuit
   in the condition of passive viewing. Conversely, a demanding perceptual
   task requires activation of the whole ART circuit. This condition is
   reflected in the fMRI image as an overlap between cortical activation
   during perceptual and conceptual processing. We conclude that the ART
   neural network is able to explain how the brain grounds symbols in
   perception via perceptual simulation.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{FEB 9}},
Abstract = {{The human ability of identifying, processing and regulating emotions
   from social stimuli is generally referred as Emotional Intelligence
   (EI). Within EI, Ability EI identifies a performance measure assessing
   individual skills at perceiving, using, understanding and managing
   emotions. Previous models suggest that a brain ``somatic marker
   circuitry{''} (SMC) sustains emotional sub-processes included in EI.
   Three primary brain regions are included: the amygdala, the insula and
   the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Here, our aim was to
   investigate the relationship between Ability EI scores and SMC activity
   during social judgment of emotional faces. Sixty-three healthy subjects
   completed a test measuring Ability EI and underwent fMRI during a social
   decision task (i.e. approach or avoid) about emotional faces with
   different facial expressions. Imaging data revealed that EI scores are
   associated with left insula activity during social judgment of emotional
   faces as a function of facial expression. Specifically, higher EI scores
   are associated with greater left insula activity during social judgment
   of fearful faces but also with lower activity of this region during
   social judgment of angry faces. These findings indicate that the
   association between Ability EI and the SMC activity during social
   behavior is region- and emotionspecific.}},

Abstract = {{A bad reputation can persistently affect judgments of an individual even
   when it turns out to be invalid and ought to be disregarded. Such
   indelible distrust may reflect that the negative evaluation elicited by
   a bad reputation transfers to a person. Consequently, the person
   him/herself may come to activate this negative evaluation irrespective
   of the accuracy of the reputation. If this theoretical model is correct,
   an evaluation-related brain region will be activated when witnessing a
   person whose bad reputation one has learned about, regardless of whether
   the reputation is deemed valid or not. Here, we tested this neural
   hypothesis with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Participants memorized faces paired with either a good or a bad
   reputation. Next, they viewed the faces alone and inferred whether each
   person was likely to cooperate, first while retrieving the reputations,
   and then while trying to disregard them as false. A region of the left
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vIPFC), which may be involved in
   negative evaluation, was activated by faces previously paired with bad
   reputations, irrespective of whether participants attempted to retrieve
   or disregard these reputations. Furthermore, participants showing
   greater activity of the left ventrolateral prefrontal region in response
   to the faces with bad reputations were more likely to infer that these
   individuals would not cooperate. Thus, once associated with a bad
   reputation, a person may elicit evaluation related brain responses on
   their own, thereby evoking distrust independently of their reputation.}},

Title = {{Betel quid dependence is associated with functional connectivity changes
   of the anterior cingulate cortex: a resting-state fMRI study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Objective: It is generally acknowledged that drug dependence is
   connected with abnormal functional organization in the individual's
   brain. The present study aimed to identify the anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) abnormality with the cerebral networks involved in betel quid
   dependence (BQD) by resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Methods: With fMRI data measured from 33 resting-state BQD individuals
   and 32 non-addicted and age-, sex-, education-matched healthy controls,
   we inquired into the BQD-related changes in FC between the regions of
   ACC with the whole brain involved in BQD individuals using a region of
   interest vised method, and to identify the relation of the alteration
   with the severity of BQD and duration.
   Results: Compared to controls, the BQD group showed increased
   connectivity from ACC to the regions of the reward network (brainstem
   including midbrain regions such as the ventral tegmental area and pons,
   caudate, thalamus) and cerebellum. Decreased connectivity was observed
   in the BQD group in regions from ACC to the default mode network (medial
   prefrontal cortex and precuneus) and para Hippocampal/hypothalamus.
   Specifically, the BQD scale was positively correlated with increased FC
   of right ACC to left thalamus and left ACC to pons; the durations were
   negatively correlated with FC of right ACC to left precuneus.
   Conclusion: These disturbances in rsFC from ACC to the reward network
   and DMN revealed by fMRI may have a key function in providing insights
   into the neurological pathophysiology underlying BQD-associated
   executive dysfunction and disinhibition. These findings may contribute
   to our better understanding of the mechanisms underlying BQD.}},

Title = {{The Effect of Oxytocin on Third-Party Altruistic Decisions in Unfair
   Situations: An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Humans display an intriguing propensity to help the victim of social
   norm violations or punish the violators which require theory-of-mind
   (ToM)/mentalizing abilities. The hypothalamic peptide oxytocin (OXT) has
   been implicated in modulating various pro-social behaviors/perception
   including trust, cooperation, and empathy. However, it is still elusive
   whether OXT also influences neural responses during third-party
   altruistic decisions, especially in ToM-related brain regions such as
   the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). To address this question, we
   conducted a pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging
   experiment with healthy male participants in a randomized, double-blind,
   crossover design. After the intranasal administration synthetic OXT
   (OXTIN) or placebo (PLC), participants could transfer money from their
   own endowment to either punish a norm violator or help the victim. In
   some trials, participants observed the decisions made by a computer.
   Behaviorally, participants under OXTIN showed a trend to accelerate
   altruistic decisions. At the neural level, we observed a strong
   three-way interaction between drug treatment (OXT/PLC), agency
   (self/computer), and decision (help/punish), such that OXTIN selectively
   enhanced activity in the left TPJ during observations of others being
   helped by the computer. Collectively, our findings indicate that OXT
   enhances prosocial-relevant perception by increasing ToM-related neural
   activations.}},

Journal = {{PAIN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{157}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{445-455}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Pain can be modulated by contextual stimuli, such as emotions, social
   factors, or specific bodily perceptions. We presented painful laser
   stimuli together with body-related masochistic visual stimuli to persons
   with and without preferred masochistic sexual behavior and used neutral,
   positive, and negative pictures with and without painful stimuli as
   control. Masochists reported substantially reduced pain intensity and
   unpleasantness in the masochistic context compared with controls but had
   unaltered pain perception in the other conditions. Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging revealed that masochists activated brain areas
   involved in sensory-discriminative processing rather than affective pain
   processing when they received painful stimuli on a masochistic
   background. The masochists compared with the controls displayed
   attenuated functional connectivity of the parietal operculum with the
   left and right insulae, the central operculum, and the supramarginal
   gyrus. Masochists additionally showed negative correlations between the
   duration of interest in masochistic activities and activation of areas
   involved in motor activity and affective processing. We propose that the
   parietal operculum serves as an important relay station that attenuates
   the affective-motivational aspects of pain in masochists. This novel
   mechanism of pain modulation might be related to multisensory
   integration and has important implications for the assessment and
   treatment of pain.}},

Abstract = {{Mass media can powerfully affect health decision-making. Pre-testing
   through focus groups or surveys is a standard, though inconsistent,
   predictor of effectiveness. Converging evidence demonstrates that
   activity within brain systems associated with self-related processing
   can predict individual behavior in response to health messages.
   Preliminary evidence also suggests that neural activity in small groups
   can forecast population-level campaign outcomes. Less is known about the
   psychological processes that link neural activity and population-level
   outcomes, or how these predictions are affected by message content. We
   exposed 50 smokers to antismoking messages and used their aggregated
   neural activity within a `self-localizer' defined region of medial
   prefrontal cortex to predict the success of the same campaign messages
   at the population level (n = 400 000 emails). Results demonstrate that:
   (i) independently localized neural activity during health message
   exposure complements existing self-report data in predicting
   population-level campaign responses (model combined R-2 up to 0.65) and
   (ii) this relationship depends on message content-self-related neural
   processing predicts outcomes in response to strong negative arguments
   against smoking and not in response to compositionally similar neutral
   images. These data advance understanding of the psychological link
   between brain and large-scale behavior and may aid the construction of
   more effective media health campaigns.}},

Abstract = {{Recruitment of `top-down' frontal attentional mechanisms is held to
   support detection of changes in task-relevant stimuli. Fluctuations in
   intrinsic frontal activity have been shown to impact task performance
   more generally. Meanwhile, the amygdala has been implicated in
   `bottom-up' attentional capture by threat. Here, 22 adult human
   participants took part in a functional magnetic resonance change
   detection study aimed at investigating the correlates of successful (vs
   failed) detection of changes in facial identity vs expression. For
   identity changes, we expected prefrontal recruitment to differentiate
   `hit' from `miss' trials, in line with previous reports. Meanwhile, we
   postulated that a different mechanism would support detection of
   emotionally salient changes. Specifically, elevated amygdala activation
   was predicted to be associated with successful detection of
   threat-related changes in expression, over-riding the influence of
   fluctuations in top-down attention. Our findings revealed that fusiform
   activity tracked change detection across conditions. Ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortical activity was uniquely linked to detection of changes
   in identity not expression, and amygdala activity to detection of
   changes from neutral to fearful expressions. These results are
   consistent with distinct mechanisms supporting detection of changes in
   face identity vs expression, the former potentially reflecting top-down
   attention, the latter bottom-up attentional capture by stimulus
   emotional salience.}},

Abstract = {{Converging evidence identifies trait optimism and the orbitofrontal

   the nature of their relationships remains unclear. Here, the mechanisms
   underlying the protective role of trait optimismand of increased OFC
   volume against symptoms of anxiety were investigated in 61 healthy
   subjects, who completed measures of trait optimism and anxiety, and
   underwent structural scanning using magnetic resonance imaging. First,
   the OFC gray matter volume (GMV) was associated with increased optimism,
   which in turn was associated with reduced anxiety. Second, trait
   optimismmediated the relation between the left OFC volume and anxiety,
   thus demonstrating that increased GMV in this brain region protects
   against symptoms of anxiety through increased optimism. These results
   provide novel evidence about the brain-personality mechanisms protecting
   against anxiety symptoms in healthy functioning, and identify potential
   targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing
   susceptibility and increasing resilience against emotional disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{As evidenced by a multitude of studies, abnormalities in Theory of Mind
   (ToM) and its neural processing might constitute an intermediate
   phenotype of schizophrenia. If so, neural alterations during ToM should
   be observable in unaffected relatives of patients as well, since they
   share a considerable amount of genetic risk. While behaviorally,
   impaired ToM function is confirmed meta-analytically in relatives,
   evidence on aberrant function of the neural ToM network is sparse and
   inconclusive. The present study therefore aimed to further explore the
   neural correlates of ToM in relatives of schizophrenia. About 297
   controls and 63 unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with
   schizophrenia performed a ToM task during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Consistent with the literature relatives exhibited decreased
   activity of the medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, increased
   recruitment of the right middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate
   cortex was found, which was related to subclinical paranoid symptoms in
   relatives. These results further support decreased medial prefrontal
   activation during ToM as an intermediate phenotype of genetic risk for
   schizophrenia. Enhanced recruitment of posterior ToM areas in relatives
   might indicate inefficiency mechanisms in the presence of genetic risk.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need for effective, early post-trauma preventive
   interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Attenuating
   amygdala hyperreactivity early post-trauma, a likely PTSD vulnerability
   factor, may decrease PTSD risk. Since oxytocin modulates amygdala
   reactivity to emotional stimuli, oxytocin administration early
   post-trauma may be a promising candidate for PTSD prevention. In a
   randomized double-blind placebo-controlled fMRI study, we investigated
   effects of a single intranasal oxytocin administration (40 IU) on
   amygdala reactivity to happy, neutral and fearful faces in 41 recently
   trauma-exposed men and women showing moderate to high distress after
   initial post-trauma screening. We explored treatment interactions with
   sex. Participants were scanned within 11 days post-trauma. Compared with
   placebo, oxytocin significantly increased right amygdala reactivity to
   fearful faces. There was a significant treatment by sex interaction on
   amygdala reactivity to neutral faces, with women showing increased left
   amygdala reactivity after oxytocin. These findings indicate that a
   single oxytocin administration may enhance fearful faces processing in
   recently trauma-exposed individuals and neutral faces processing in
   recently trauma-exposed women. These observations may be explained by
   oxytocin-induced increased salience processing. Clinical implications of
   these findings for PTSD prevention should be further investigated. Trial

Abstract = {{Romantic relationship satisfaction (RRS) is important for
   mental/physical health but varies greatly across individuals. To date,
   we have known little about the biological (genetic and neural)
   correlates of RRS. We tested the hypothesis that the serotonin
   transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), the promoter region of the
   gene SLC6A4 that codes for the serotonin transporter protein, is
   associated with individuals' RRS. Moreover, we investigated neural
   activity that mediates 5-HTTLPR association with RRS by scanning
   short-short (s/s) and long-long (l/l) homozygotes of 5-HTTLPR, using
   functional MRI, during a Cyberball game that resulted in social
   exclusion. l/l compared with s/s allele carriers reported higher RRS but
   lower social interaction anxiety. l/l compared with s/s carriers showed
   stronger activity in the right ventral prefrontal cortex (RVPFC) and
   stronger functional connectivity between the dorsal and rostral ACC when
   being excluded from the Cyberball game. Moreover, the 5-HTTLPR
   association with RRS was mediated by the RVPFC activity and the 5-HTTLPR
   association with social interaction anxiety was mediated by both the
   dorsal-rostral ACC connectivity and RVPFC activity. Our findings suggest
   that 5-HTTLPR is associated with satisfaction of one's own romantic
   relationships and this association is mediated by the neural activity in
   the brain region related to emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of the role played by the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in
   human emotion has recently advanced with STN deep brain stimulation, a
   neurosurgical treatment for Parkinson's disease and obsessive-compulsive
   disorder. However, the potential presence of several confounds related
   to pathological models raises the question of how much they affect the
   relevance of observations regarding the physiological function of the
   STN itself. This underscores the crucial importance of obtaining
   evidence from healthy participants. In this study, we tested the
   structural and functional connectivity between the STN and other brain
   regions related to vocal emotion in a healthy population by combining
   diffusion tensor imaging and psychophysiological interaction analysis
   from a high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging study. As
   expected, we showed that the STN is functionally connected to the
   structures involved in emotional prosody decoding, notably the
   orbitofrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, auditory cortex, pallidum
   and amygdala. These functional results were corroborated by
   probabilistic fiber tracking, which revealed that the left STN is
   structurally connected to the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex.
   These results confirm, in healthy participants, the role played by the
   STN in human emotion and its structural and functional connectivity with
   the brain network involved in vocal emotions.}},

Pages = {{27-33}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence has shown the profound influence of social
   reputation on human behavior and has implicated the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in representing subjective values induced by
   social interaction. However, little is known regarding how the vmPFC
   encodes subjective pleasantness induced by social reputation received
   from others. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   investigate how the vmPFC in males and females encodes the subjective
   pleasantness of social reputation received from the same gender and from
   the opposite gender. Behavioral data showed that positive reputation was
   perceived to be more pleasant than negative reputation. Intriguingly,
   both male and female subjects showed greater differences in the
   pleasantness scores between the positive reputation condition and the
   negative reputation condition from females than between positive and
   negative reputations from males. Imaging data revealed that the left
   vmPFC specifically contributed to the processing of positive reputation.
   The activity patterns of the vmPFC corresponded to the gender
   differences in behavior during the processing of social reputation.
   These results indicate that the vmPFC plays a role in representing the
   subjective value of positive social reputation and that this region
   might be a final computational site in a stream of value-based
   decision-making processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan

Abstract = {{It is well known from literature and religious ceremonies that there is
   a link between physical cleansing and moral transgressions. Only
   recently, psychological experiments explored this association and
   demonstrated that a threat to moral purity increases the demand of
   physical cleansing. Moreover, it has been shown that physical cleansing
   is actually efficacious to cope with threatened morality. This so-called
   Macbeth effect has been explained by an embodiment of the moral-purity
   metaphor. We tested this hypothesis by means of an functional magnetic
   resonsce imaging (fMRI) experiment. Participants were instructed to
   enact scenarios including either an immoral act (lying) or a moral deed
   (telling the truth). Subsequently, the participants were asked to rate
   the desirableness of various products. Results revealed that
   participants rated cleansing products (but not other goods) more
   desirable after performing an immoral than after a moral act. This
   Macbeth effect was accompanied by an active cortical network including
   sensorimotor brain areas during rating of cleansing products (but not
   while evaluating noncleansing goods). The results demonstrate
   neurobiological evidence for an embodiment of the moral-purity metaphor.
   Thus, abstract thoughts about morality can be grounded in sensory
   experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Social threat can have adverse effects on cognitive performance, but the
   brain mechanisms underlying its effects are poorly understood. We
   investigated the effects of social evaluative threat on working memory
   (WM), a core component of many important cognitive capabilities. Social
   threat impaired WM performance during an N-back task and produced
   widespread reductions in activation in lateral prefrontal cortex and
   intraparietal sulcus (IPS), among other regions. In addition, activity
   in frontal and parietal regions predicted WM performance, and mediation
   analyses identified regions in the bilateral IPS that mediated the
   performance-impairing effects of social threat. Social threat also
   decreased connectivity between the IPS and dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex, while increasing connectivity between the IPS and the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region strongly implicated in the
   generation of autonomic and emotional responses. Finally, cortisol
   response to the stressor did not mediate WM impairment but was rather
   associated with protective effects. These results provide a basis for
   understanding interactions between social and cognitive processes at a

Abstract = {{Objectives: Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is
   characterized by early atrophy in the frontotemporoinsular regions.
   These regions overlap with networks that are engaged in social
   cognition-executive functions, two hallmarks deficits of bvFTD. We
   examine (i) whether Network Centrality (a graph theory metric that
   measures how important a node is in a brain network) in the
   frontotemporoinsular network is disrupted in bvFTD, and (ii) the level
   of involvement of this network in social-executive performance. Methods:
   Patients with probable bvFTD, healthy controls, and frontoinsular stroke
   patients underwent functional MRI resting-state recordings and completed
   social-executive behavioral measures. Results: Relative to the controls
   and the stroke group, the bvFTD patients presented decreased Network
   Centrality. In addition, this measure was associated with social
   cognition and executive functions. To test the specificity of these
   results for the Network Centrality of the frontotemporoinsular network,
   we assessed the main areas from six resting-state networks. No group
   differences or behavioral associations were found in these networks.
   Finally, Network Centrality and behavior distinguished bvFTD patients
   from the other groups with a high classification rate. Conclusions:
   bvFTD selectively affects Network Centrality in the frontotemporoinsular
   network, which is associated with high-level social and executive
   profile.}},

Abstract = {{A great deal of evidence suggests that emotion enhances memory. Thus, it
   may be harder to forget emotional information. By means of fMRI, this
   question was investigated in the item-method directed forgetting
   paradigm. Behavioral results demonstrated that although all kinds of
   material could be forgotten, negative words showed reduced directed
   forgetting effect. At the neural level, the initial viewing of negative
   words elicited increased activities in inferior frontal gyrus and
   superior parietal lobule when contrasted with neutral words, which
   reflected the capture of attention by negative content. Forgetting
   instructions for negative and neutral words led to enhanced activations
   in frontal and parietal cortex, consistent with the engagement of an
   active inhibitory process. Surprisingly, whereas successful directed
   forgetting of neutral words elicited stronger activations in right
   middle frontal gyrus compared with incidental forgetting, no such
   activation was observed for negative words. The lack of activation for
   negative words may be due to an attentional bias in processing negative
   words, which may briefly interfere with the deployment of inhibitory
   control. The present findings are consistent with the engagement of an
   active forgetting mechanism that contributes to the item-method directed
   forgetting. However, evidence of impeded inhibitory control suggests
   that forgetting negative words is harder. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Impaired neural processing of dynamic faces in left-onset Parkinson's
   disease}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{123-133}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) affects patients beyond the motor domain.
   According to previous evidence, one mechanism that may be impaired in
   the disease is face processing. However, few studies have investigated
   this process at the neural level in PD. Moreover, research using dynamic
   facial displays rather than static pictures is scarce, but highly
   warranted due to the higher ecological validity of dynamic stimuli. In
   the present study we aimed to investigate how PD patients process
   emotional and non emotional dynamic face stimuli at the neural level
   using event-related potentials. Since the literature has revealed a
   predominantly right-lateralized network for dynamic face processing, we
   divided the group into patients with left (LPD) and right (RPD) motor
   symptom onset (right versus left cerebral hemisphere predominantly
   affected, respectively). Participants watched short video clips of
   happy, angry, and neutral expressions and engaged in a shallow gender
   decision task in order to avoid confounds of task difficulty in the
   data. In line with our expectations, the LPD group showed significant
   face processing deficits compared to controls. While there were no group
   differences in early, sensory-driven processing (fronto-central N1 and
   posterior P1), the vertex positive potential, which is considered the
   fronto-central counterpart of the face-specific posterior N170
   component, had a reduced amplitude and delayed latency in the LPD group.
   This may indicate disturbances of structural face processing in LPD.
   Furthermore, the effect was independent of the emotional content of the
   videos. In contrast, static facial identity recognition performance in
   LPD was not significantly different from controls, and comprehensive
   testing of cognitive functions did not reveal any deficits in this
   group. We therefore conclude that PD, and more specifically the
   predominant right-hemispheric affection in left-onset PD, is associated
   with impaired processing of dynamic facial expressions, which could be
   one of the mechanisms behind the often reported problems of PD patients
   in their social lives. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated an overlap between the neural substrate
   of resting-state activity and self-related processing in the cortical
   midline structures (CMS). However, the neural and psychological
   mechanisms mediating this so-called ``rest-self overlap{''} remain
   unclear. To investigate the neural mechanisms, we estimated the temporal
   structure of spontaneous/resting-state activity, e.g. its long-range
   temporal correlations or self-affinity across time as indexed by the
   power-law exponent (PLE). The PLE was obtained in resting-state activity
   in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC) in 47 healthy subjects by functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). We performed correlation analyses of the PLE and Revised
   Self-Consciousness Scale (SCSR) scores, which enabled us to access
   different dimensions of self-consciousness and specified rest-self
   overlap in a psychological regard. The PLE in the MPFC's resting-state
   activity correlated with private self-consciousness scores from the
   SCSR. Conversely, we found no correlation between the PLE and the other
   subscales of the SCSR (public, social) or between other resting-state
   measures, including functional connectivity, and the SCSR subscales.
   This is the first evidence for the association between the scale-free
   dynamics of resting-state activity in the CMS and the private dimension
   of self-consciousness. This finding implies the relationship of
   especially the private dimension of self with the temporal structure of
   resting-state activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often have difficulty
   recognizing and interpreting facial expressions of emotion, which may
   impair their ability to navigate and communicate successfully in their
   social, interpersonal environments. Characterizing specific differences
   between individuals with ASD and their typically developing (TD)
   counterparts in the neural activity subserving their experience of
   emotional faces may provide distinct targets for ASD interventions. Thus
   we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a parametric
   experimental design to identify brain regions in which neural activity
   correlated with ratings of arousal and valence for a broad range of
   emotional faces. Participants (51 ASD, 84 TD) were group-matched by age,
   sex, IQ, race, and socioeconomic status. Using task-related change in
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal as a measure, and
   covarying for age, sex, FSIQ, and ADOS scores, we detected significant
   differences across diagnostic groups in the neural activity subserving
   the dimension of arousal but not valence. BOLD-signal in TD participants
   correlated inversely with ratings of arousal in regions associated
   primarily with attentional functions, whereas BOLD-signal in ASD
   participants correlated positively with arousal ratings in regions
   commonly associated with impulse control and default-mode activity. Only
   minor differences were detected between groups in the BOLD signal
   correlates of valence ratings. Our findings provide unique insight into
   the emotional experiences of individuals with ASD. Although behavioral
   responses to face-stimuli were comparable across diagnostic groups, the
   corresponding neural activity for our ASD and TD groups differed
   dramatically. The near absence of group differences for valence
   correlates and the presence of strong group differences for arousal
   correlates suggest that individuals with ASD are not atypical in all
   aspects of emotion-processing. Studying these similarities and
   differences may help us to understand the origins of divergent
   interpersonal emotional experience in persons with ASD. (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{A substantial proportion of schizophrenia liability can be explained by
   additive genetic factors. Risk profile scores (RPS) directly index risk
   using a summated total of common risk variants weighted by their effect.
   Previous studies suggest that schizophrenia RPS predict alterations to
   neural networks that support working memory and verbal fluency. In this
   study, we apply schizophrenia RPS to fMRI data to elucidate the effects
   of polygenic risk on functional brain networks during a
   probabilistic-learning neuroimaging paradigm. The neural networks
   recruited during this paradigm have previously been shown to be altered
   to unmedicated schizophrenia patients and relatives of schizophrenia
   patients, which may reflect genetic susceptibility. We created
   schizophrenia RPS using summary data from the Psychiatric Genetic
   Consortium (Schizophrenia Working Group) for 83 healthy individuals and
   explore associations between schizophrenia RPS and blood oxygen level
   dependency (BOLD) during periods of choice behavior (switch-stay) and
   reflection upon choice outcome (reward-punishment). We show that
   schizophrenia RPS is associated with alterations in the frontal pole
   (PWHOLE-BRAIN-CORRECTED = 0.048) and the ventral striatum
   (PROI-CORRECTED = 0.036), during choice behavior, but not choice
   outcome. We suggest that the common risk variants that increase
   susceptibility to schizophrenia can be associated with alterations in
   the neural circuitry that support the processing of changing reward
   contingencies. (C) 2015 The Authors Human Brain Mapping Published by

Abstract = {{Humans altruistically punish violators of social norms to enforce
   cooperation and pro-social behaviors. However, such altruistic behaviors
   diminish when others are present, due to a diffusion of responsibility.
   We investigated the neural signatures underlying the modulations of
   diffusion of responsibility on altruistic punishment, conjoining a
   third-party punishment task with event-related functional magnetic
   resonance imaging and multivariate Granger causality mapping. In our
   study, participants acted as impartial third-party decision-makers and
   decided how to punish norm violations under two different social
   contexts: alone (i.e., full responsibility) or in the presence of
   putative other third-party decision makers (i.e., diffused
   responsibility). Our behavioral results demonstrated that the diffusion
   of responsibility served as a mediator of context-dependent punishment.
   In the presence of putative others, participants who felt less
   responsible also punished less severely in response to norm violations.
   Our neural results revealed that underlying this behavioral effect was a
   network of interconnected brain regions. For unfair relative to fair
   splits, the presence of others led to attenuated responses in brain
   regions implicated in signaling norm violations (e.g., AI) and to
   increased responses in brain regions implicated in calculating values of
   norm violations (e.g., vmPFC, precuneus) and mentalizing about others
   (dmPFC). The dmPFC acted as the driver of the punishment network,
   modulating target regions, such as AI, vmPFC, and precuneus, to adjust
   altruistic punishment behavior. Our results uncovered the neural basis
   of the influence of diffusion of responsibility on altruistic punishment
   and highlighted the role of the mentalizing network in this important
   phenomenon. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Justice research examining gender differences has yielded contrasting
   findings. This study enlists advanced techniques in cognitive
   neuroscience (fMRI) to examine gender differences in brain activation
   patterns in response to procedural and distributive justice
   manipulations. We integrate social role, information processing,
   justice, and neuroscience literature to posit and test for gender
   differences in 2 neural subsystems known to be involved in the appraisal
   of self-relevant events. Results indicate that the relationship between
   justice information processing and neural activity in areas representing
   these subsystems is significantly influenced by gender, with greater
   activation for females than males during consideration of both
   procedural and distributive justice information. In addition, we find
   evidence that gender and distributive injustice interact to influence
   bargaining behavior, with females rejecting ultimatum game offers more
   frequently than males. Results also demonstrate activation in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and ventral striatum brain
   regions during procedural justice evaluation is associated with offer
   rejection in females, but not in males. Managerial implications based on
   the study's support for gender differences in justice perceptions are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We utilize qualitative audience research and functional brain imaging
   (fMRI) to examine the aesthetic experience of watching dance both with
   and without music. This transdisciplinary approach was motivated by the
   recognition that the aesthetic experience of dance revealed through
   conscious interpretation could have neural correlates in brain activity.
   When audiences were engaged in watching dance accompanied by music, the
   fMRI data revealed evidence of greater intersubject correlation in a
   left anterior region of the superior temporal gyrus known to be involved
   in complex audio processing. Moreover, the qualitative data revealed how
   spectators derived pleasure from finding convergences between 2 complex
   stimuli (dance and music). Without music, greater intersubject
   correlation was found bilaterally in a posterior region of the superior
   temporal gyrus, showing that bodily sounds such as breath provide a more
   salient auditory signal than music in primary auditory regions. Watching
   dance without music also resulted in increased intersubject correlation
   among spectators in the parietal and occipitotemporal cortices,
   suggesting a greater influence of the body than when interpreting the
   dance stimuli with music. Similarly, the audience research found
   evidence of corporeally focused experience, but suggests that while
   embodied responses were common across spectators, they were accompanied
   by different evaluative judgments.}},

Abstract = {{Functional localizer tasks allow researchers to identify brain regions
   in each individual's brain, using a combination of anatomical and
   functional constraints. In this study, we compare three social cognitive
   localizer tasks, designed to efficiently identify regions in the ``Pain
   Matrix,{''} recruited in response to a person's physical pain, and the
   `` Theory of Mind network,{''} recruited in response to a person's
   mental states (i.e. beliefs and emotions). Participants performed three
   tasks: first, the verbal false-belief stories task; second, a verbal
   task including stories describing physical pain versus emotional
   suffering; and third, passively viewing a non-verbal animated movie,
   which included segments depicting physical pain and beliefs and
   emotions. All three localizers were efficient in identifying replicable,
   stable networks in individual subjects. The consistency across tasks
   makes all three tasks viable localizers. Nevertheless, there were small
   reliable differences in the location of the regions and the pattern of
   activity within regions, hinting at more specific representations. The
   new localizers go beyond those currently available: first, they
   simultaneously identify two functional networks with no additional scan
   time, and second, the non-verbal task extends the populations in whom
   functional localizers can be applied. These localizers will be made
   publicly available. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   auditory and somatosensory information have been shown to play a key
   role. Recent clinical research demonstrates that individuals with severe
   speech production deficits can show a dramatic improvement in fluency
   during on-line mimicking of an audiovisual speech signal suggesting the
   existence of a visuomotor pathway for speech motor control. Here we used
   fMRI in healthy individuals to identify this new visuomotor circuit for
   speech production. Participants were asked to perceive and covertly
   rehearse nonsense syllable sequences presented auditorily, visually, or
   audiovisually. The motor act of rehearsal, which is prima facie the same
   whether or not it is cued with a visible talker, produced different
   patterns of sensorimotor activation when cued by visual or audiovisual
   speech (relative to auditory speech). In particular, a network of brain
   regions including the left posterior middle temporal gyrus and several
   frontoparietal sensorimotor areas activated more strongly during
   rehearsal cued by a visible talker versus rehearsal cued by auditory
   speech alone. Some of these brain regions responded exclusively to
   rehearsal cued by visual or audiovisual speech. This result has
   significant implications for models of speech motor control, for the
   treatment of speech output disorders, and for models of the role of
   speech gesture imitation in development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been shown to be
   involved in emotional distress induced by social exclusion and the
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in the regulation or inhibition
   of the distress. Here, we examined modulation of effective connectivity
   between the regions in response to emotional feedback in children with
   experiences of ostracism in their everyday life.
   MethodsIn functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, 10
   ostracized children and 11 control children were provided emotional
   feedback inducing negative or positive affective states. We employed
   effective connectivity analysis to explore connectivity models
   comprising the VLPFC and ACC, and to estimate connectivity parameters
   over the models.
   ResultsIn spite of psychological impacts on the ostracized children,
   behavioral data showed that their emotional responses did not deviate
   from the control children in response to the emotional feedback. The
   VLPFC to ACC connectivity was modulated only in the ostracized children,
   such that the modulation may help them regulate their emotional
   responses.
   ConclusionsThe findings suggest that the effects of ostracism
   experiences on affective processing can be revealed in terms of
   modulation of prefrontal-cingulate connectivity.}},

Title = {{Under-reactive but easily distracted: An fMRI investigation of
   attentional capture in autism spectrum disorder}},
Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Pages = {{46-56}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{For individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), salient
   behaviorally-relevant information often fails to capture attention,
   while subtle behaviorally-irrelevant details commonly induce a state of
   distraction. The present study used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neurocognitive networks underlying
   attentional capture in sixteen high-functioning children and adolescents
   with ASD and twenty-one typically developing (TD) individuals.
   Participants completed a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm
   designed to investigate activation of attentional networks to
   behaviorally-relevant targets and contingent attention capture by
   task-irrelevant distractors. In individuals with ASD, target stimuli
   failed to trigger bottom-up activation of the ventral attentional
   network and the cerebellum. Additionally, the ASD group showed no
   differences in behavior or occipital activation associated with
   contingent attentional capture. Rather, results suggest that
   to-be-ignored distractors that shared either task-relevant or irrelevant
   features captured attention in ASD. Results indicate that individuals
   with ASD may be under-reactive to behaviorally-relevant stimuli, unable
   to filter irrelevant information, and that both top-down and bottom-up
   attention networks function atypically in ASD. Lastly, deficits in
   target-related processing were associated with autism symptomatology,
   providing further support for the hypothesis that non-social attentional
   processes and their neurofunctional underpinnings may play a significant
   role in the development of sociocommunicative impairments in ASD. (C)

   Certain media artworks critically engaged with neuroscience productively

Abstract = {{Social and affective research in humans is increasingly using functional
   and structural neuroimaging techniques to aid the understanding of how
   hormones, such as testosterone, modulate a wide range of psychological
   processes. We conducted a meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) studies of testosterone administration, and of fMRI
   studies that measured endogenous levels of the hormone, in relation to
   social and affective stimuli. Furthermore, we conducted a review of
   structural MRI i.e. voxel based morphometry (VBM) studies which
   considered brain volume in relation to testosterone levels in adults and
   in children. In the included testosterone administration fMRI studies,
   which consisted of female samples only, bilateral
   amygdala/parahippocampal regions as well as the right caudate were
   significantly activated by social-affective stimuli in the testosterone
   condition. In the studies considering endogenous levels of testosterone,
   stimuli-invoked activations relating to testosterone levels were noted
   in the bilateral amygdala/parahippocampal regions and the brainstem.
   When the endogenous testosterone studies were split by sex, the
   significant activation of the brain stem was seen in the female samples
   only. Significant stimuli-invoked deactivations relating to endogenous
   testosterone levels were also seen in the right and left
   amygdala/parahippocampal regions studies. The findings of the VBM
   studies were less consistent. In adults larger volumes in the limbic and
   temporal regions were associated with higher endogenous testosterone. In
   children, boys showed a positive correlation between testosterone and
   brain volume in many regions, including the amygdala, as well as global
   grey matter volume, while girls showed a neutral or negative association
   between testosterone levels and many brain volumes. In conclusion,
   amygdalar and parahippocampal regions appear to be key target regions
   for the acute actions of testosterone in response to social and
   affective stimuli, while neurodevelopmentally the volumes of a broader
   network of brain structures are associated with testosterone levels in a
   sexually dimorphic manner.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been discussed to be
   involved in plasticity processes in the human brain, in particular
   during aging. Recently, aging and its (neurodegenerative) diseases have
   increasingly been conceptualized as disconnection syndromes. Here,
   connectivity changes in neural networks (the connectome) are suggested
   to be the most relevant and characteristic features for such processes
   or diseases. To further elucidate the impact of aging on neural
   networks, we investigated the interaction between plasticity processes,
   brain connectivity, and healthy aging by measuring levels of serum BDNF
   and resting-state fMRI data in 25 young (mean age 24.8 +/- 2.7 (SD)
   years) and 23 old healthy participants (mean age, 68.6 +/- 4.1 years).
   To identify neural hubs most essentially related to serum BDNF, we
   applied graph theory approaches, namely the new data-driven and
   parameter-free approach eigenvector centrality (EC) mapping. The
   analysis revealed a positive correlation between serum BDNF and EC in
   the premotor and motor cortex in older participants in contrast to young
   volunteers, where we did not detect any association. This positive
   relationship between serum BDNF and EC appears to be specific for older
   adults. Our results might indicate that the amount of physical activity
   and learning capacities, leading to higher BDNF levels, increases brain
   connectivity in (pre) motor areas in healthy aging in agreement with
   rodent animal studies. Pilot results have to be replicated in a larger
   sample including behavioral data to disentangle the cause for the
   relationship between BDNF levels and connectivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The purpose of this fMRI study is to examine the neural substrata of
   verb and noun processing within a grammatical context in Persian, a
   language with a complex morphosyntactic structure. The main aim was to
   assess the possible impact of the morphosyntactic properties of Persian
   on the neural representations of different grammatical categories. To
   this end, 14 healthy native speakers of Persian were required to
   covertly complete sentences by generating verbs or nouns within a
   grammatical context, in response to each relevant drawing. Common
   regions were activated by both verbs and nouns in occipital cortex,
   temporal cortex, and cerebellum. In the direct comparisons, only verb
   processing revealed larger activation in middle temporal gyrus
   (bilaterally) and left fusiform gyrus. This study, as the first report
   on Persian, demonstrates that verbs and nouns are processed and
   represented to a great extent via common cortical regions with few
   activation differences, possibly reflecting the verb-specific
   morphosyntactic properties of the Persian language. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Objective selection of epilepsy-related independent components from EEG
   data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{258}},
Pages = {{67-78}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is commonly used for
   the identification of sources of interest in electroencephalographic
   (EEG) data, but the selection of the relevant components remains an open
   issue depending on the specific application.
   New Method: We propose a novel approach for the objective selection of
   epilepsy-related independent components (ICs) from EEG data collected
   during functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) acquisitions, called
   PROJection onto Independent Components (PROJIC). Inter-ictal
   epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are identified on a reference EEG dataset
   collected outside the MRI scanner by an expert neurophysiologist, and
   the resulting average IED is projected onto the IC space of the EEG data
   collected simultaneously with fMRI. The power of the IED projection is
   then used to inform a k-means clustering algorithm of the ICs, allowing
   for the classification of epilepsy-related ICs.
   Comparison with existing methods: The performance of PROJIC was compared
   with two methods previously proposed for the objective selection of EEG
   ICs of interest, which are based on the explicit similarity of the ICs
   with spatio-temporal templates of the events of interest, instead of the
   projection power.
   Results: The proposed PROJIC method outperformed the others for both
   artificial and real data (19 datasets collected from 6 patients with
   drug-refractory focal epilepsy), with an average accuracy of 98.6\%.
   Conclusions: The ability of our method to accurately and objectively
   select epilepsy-related ICs makes it an important contribution for
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI epilepsy studies, with potential applications in
   the analysis of event-related EEG activity more generally, and also in
   EEG artefact correction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Acute depression is associated with impaired self-referential
   processing. Antidepressant effects on the neural bases of
   self-referential processing in depression are unknown. This study aimed
   to assess short- and long-term effects of agomelatine on these neural
   bases in depressed patients and the association between pre-treatment
   brain activation and remission of depression 6 months later. We
   conducted a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study during an emotional
   self-referential task, including three scanning sessions (baseline,
   after 1 week, and after 7 weeks). Twenty-five depressed outpatients were
   included, all treated with agomelatine or placebo for 1 week. Then, all
   patients received agomelatine for 24 weeks. Fourteen matched healthy
   volunteers (HV) who received placebo for 1 week were also included.
   After 7 days, only depressed patients receiving agomelatine
   significantly deactivated the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during
   self-referential processing, as observed in HV at baseline. After 7
   weeks, depressed patients significantly increased the activation of the
   ventral anterior cingulate cortex. Finally dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   and precuneus activations at baseline significantly separated remitters
   from non-remitters at 24 weeks. In depressed patients, agomelatine had
   short- and long-term effects on brain structures involved in anhedonia
   and emotional regulation during self-referential processing. Activation
   of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and precuneus could be informative
   in the development of biomarker-based treatment of major depression. (C)
