Abstract = {{Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is commonly used for studying human
   brain function. However, several studies have shown that superficial
   hemodynamic changes such as skin blood flow can affect the prefrontal
   NIRS hemoglobin (Hb) signals. To examine the criterion-related validity
   of prefrontal NIRS-Hb signals, we focused on the functional signals
   during a working memory (WM) task and investigated their similarity with
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals simultaneously measured by
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We also measured the skin
   blood flow with a laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF) at the same time to
   examine the effect of superficial hemodynamic changes on the NIRS-Hb
   signals. Correlation analysis demonstrated that temporal changes in the
   prefrontal NIRS-Hb signals in the activation area were significantly
   correlated with the BOLD signals in the gray matter rather than those in
   the soft tissue or the LDF signals. While care must be taken when
   comparing the NIRS-Hb signal with the extracranial BOLD or LDF signals,
   these results suggest that the NIRS-Hb signal mainly reflects
   hemodynamic changes in the gray matter. Moreover, the amplitudes of the
   task-related responses of the NIRS-Hb signals were significantly
   correlated with the BOLD signals in the gray matter across participants,
   which means participants with a stronger NIRS-Hb response showed a
   stronger BOLD response. These results thus provide supportive evidence
   that NIRS can be used to measure hemodynamic signals originating from
   prefrontal cortex activation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{493-504}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Humans have an automatic tendency to imitate others. Although several
   regions commonly observed in social tasks have been shown to be involved
   in imitation control, there is little work exploring how these regions
   interact with one another. We used tMRI and dynamic causal modeling to
   identify imitation-specific control mechanisms and examine functional
   interactions between regions. Participants performed a pre-specified
   action (lifting their index or middle finger) in response to videos
   depicting the same two actions (biological cues) or dots moving with
   similar trajectories (non-biological cues). On congruent trials, the
   stimulus and response were similar (e.g. index finger response to index
   finger or left side dot stimulus), while on incongruent trials the
   stimulus and response were dissimilar (e.g. index finger response to
   middle finger or right side dot stimulus). Reaction times were slower on
   incongruent compared to congruent trials for both biological and
   non-biological stimuli, replicating previous findings that suggest the
   automatic imitative or spatially compatible (congruent) response must be
   controlled on incongruent trials. Neural correlates of the congruency
   effects were different depending on the cue type. The medial prefrontal
   cortex, anterior cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis
   (IFGpo) and the left anterior insula were involved specifically in
   controlling imitation. In addition, the IFGpo was also more active for
   biological compared to non-biological stimuli, suggesting that the
   region represents the frontal node of the human mirror neuron system
   (MNS). Effective connectivity analysis exploring the interactions
   between these regions, suggests a role for the mPFC and ACC in imitative
   conflict detection and the anterior insula in conflict resolution
   processes, which may occur through interactions with the frontal node of
   the MNS. We suggest an extension of the previous models of imitation
   control involving interactions between imitation-specific and general
   cognitive control mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Outcome dependency alters the neural substrates of impression formation}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{599-608}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{How do people maintain consistent impressions of other people when other
   people are often inconsistent? The present research addresses this
   question by combining recent neuroscientific insights with ecologically
   meaningful behavioral methods. Participants formed impressions of real
   people whom they met in a personally involving situation. fMRI and
   supporting behavioral data revealed that outcome dependency (i.e.,
   depending on another person for a desired outcome) alters previously
   identified neural dynamics of impression formation. Consistent with past
   research, a functional localizer identified a region of dorsomedial PFC
   previously linked to social impression formation. In the main task, this
   ROI revealed the predicted patterns of activity across outcome
   dependency conditions: greater BOLD response when information confirmed
   (vs. violated) social expectations if participants were
   outcome-independent and the reverse pattern if participants were
   outcome-dependent. We suggest that, although social perceivers often
   discount expectancy-disconfirming information as noise, being dependent
   on another person for a desired outcome focuses impression-formation
   processing on the most diagnostic information, rather than on the most
   tractable information. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   or child emotional face stimuli}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{679-689}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Effective navigation of the social world relies on the correct
   interpretation of facial emotions. This may be particularly important in
   formative years. Critically, literature examining the emergence of face
   processing in youth (children and adolescents) has focused on the neural
   and behavioral correlates of processing adult faces, which are
   relationally different from youth participants, and whose facial
   expressions may convey different meaning than faces of their peers.
   During a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan, we compared
   concurrent neural and behavioral responses as youth (N = 25) viewed
   validated, emotionally varied (i.e., anger, fear, happy, and neutral)
   adult and child face stimuli. We observed that participants made fewer
   errors when matching adult, compared to child, face stimuli, and that
   while similar brain regions were involved in processing both adult and
   child faces, activation in the face processing neural network was
   greater for adult than child faces. This was true across emotions, and
   also when comparing neutral adult versus neutral child faces.
   Additionally, a valence by stimuli-type effect was observed within the
   amygdala. That is, within adult face stimuli, negative and neutral face
   stimuli elicited the largest effects, whereas within child face stimuli,
   happy face stimuli elicited the largest amygdala effects. Thus,
   heightened engagement of the amygdala was observed for happy child and
   angry adult faces, which may reflect age-specific salience of select
   emotions in early life. This study provides evidence that the relational
   age of the perceived face influences neural processing in youth. (C)

Abstract = {{Disorders related to social functioning including autism and
   schizophrenia differ drastically in incidence and severity between males
   and females. Little is known about the neural systems underlying these
   sex-linked differences in risk and resiliency. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging and a task involving the visual perception of
   point-light displays of coherent and scrambled biological motion, we
   discovered sex differences in the development of neural systems for
   basic social perception. In adults, we identified enhanced activity
   during coherent biological motion perception in females relative to
   males in a network of brain regions previously implicated in social
   perception including amygdala, medial temporal gyrus, and temporal pole.
   These sex differences were less pronounced in our sample of school-age
   youth. We hypothesize that the robust neural circuitry supporting social
   perception in females, which diverges from males beginning in childhood,
   may underlie sex differences in disorders related to social processing.

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{817-825}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The dopaminergic system is involved in reward encoding and reinforcement
   learning. Dopaminergic neurons from this system in the substantia
   nigra/ventral tegmental area complex (SN/VTA) fire in response to
   unexpected reinforcing cues. The goal of this study was to investigate
   whether individuals can gain voluntary control of SN/VTA activity,
   thereby potentially enhancing dopamine release to target brain regions.
   Neurofeedback and mental imagery were used to self-regulate the SN/VTA.
   Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) provided
   abstract visual feedback of the SN/VTA activity while the subject
   imagined rewarding scenes. Skin conductance response (SCR) was recorded
   as a measure of emotional arousal. To examine the effect of
   neurofeedback, subjects were assigned to either receiving feedback
   directly proportional (n = 15, veridical feedback) or inversely
   proportional (n = 17, inverted feedback) to SN/VTA activity. Both groups
   of subjects were able to up-regulate SN/VTA activity initially without
   feedback. Veridical feedback improved the ability to up-regulate SN/VTA
   compared to baseline while inverted feedback did not. Additional
   dopaminergic regions were activated in both groups. The ability to
   self-regulate SN/VTA was differentially correlated with SCR depending on
   the group, suggesting an association between emotional arousal and
   neurofeedback performance. These findings indicate that SN/VTA can be
   voluntarily activated by imagery and voluntary activation is further
   enhanced by neurofeedback. The findings may lead the way towards a
   non-invasive strategy for endogenous control of dopamine. (C) 2013

Title = {{Functional brain hubs and their test-retest reliability: A multiband
   resting-state functional MRI study}},

Abstract = {{Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) has emerged as a promising
   neuroimaging technique used to identify global hubs of the human brain
   functional connectome. However, most R-fMRI studies on functional hubs
   mainly utilize traditional R-fMRI data with relatively low sampling
   rates (e.g., repetition time {[}TR] = 2 s). R-fMRI data scanned with
   higher sampling rates are important for the characterization of reliable
   functional connectomes because they can provide temporally complementary
   information about functional integration among brain regions and
   simultaneously reduce the effects of high frequency physiological noise.
   Here, we employed a publicly available multiband R-fMRI dataset with a
   sub-second sampling rate (TR = 645 ms) to identify global hubs in the
   human voxel-wise functional networks, and further examined their
   test-retest (TRT) reliability over scanning time. We showed that the
   functional hubs of human brain networks were mainly located at the
   default-mode regions (e.g., medial prefrontal and parietal cortex as
   well as the lateral parietal and temporal cortex) and the sensorimotor
   and visual cortex. These hub regions were highly anatomically
   distance-dependent, where short-range and long-range hubs were primarily
   located at the primary cortex and the multimodal association cortex,
   respectively. We found that most functional hubs exhibited fair to good
   TRT reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients.
   Interestingly, our analysis suggested that a 6-minute scan duration was
   able to reliably detect these functional hubs. Further comparison
   analysis revealed that these results were approximately consistent with
   those obtained using traditional R-fMRI scans of the same subjects with
   TR = 2500 ms, but several regions (e.g., lateral frontal cortex,
   paracentral lobule and anterior temporal lobe) exhibited different TRT
   reliability. Finally, we showed that several regions (including the
   medial/lateral prefrontal cortex and lateral temporal cortex) were
   identified as brain hubs in a high frequency band (02-03 Hz), which is
   beyond the frequency scope of traditional R-fMRI scans. Our results
   demonstrated the validity of multiband R4MRI data to reliably detect
   functional hubs in the voxel-wise whole-brain networks, which motivated
   the acquisition of high temporal resolution R-fMRI data for the studies
   of human brain functional connectomes in healthy and diseased
   conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the neural systems underpinning social cognition is a
   primary focus of contemporary social neuroscience. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study asked if brain
   activity reflecting socio-cognitive processes differs between
   individuals according to their social behavior; namely, between a group
   of drivers with frequent traffic offenses and a group with none.
   Socio-cognitive processing was elicited by employing videos from a
   traffic awareness campaign, consisting of reckless and anti-social
   driving behavior ending in tragic consequences, and control videos with
   analogous driving themes but without such catastrophic endings. We
   investigated whether relative increases in brain function during the
   observation of these campaign stimuli compared with control videos
   differed between these two groups. To develop the results of our
   previous study we focused our analyses on superior temporal sulcus/gyrus
   (STS/STG). This revealed a bigger increase in brain activity within this
   region during the campaign stimuli in safe compared with dangerous
   drivers. Furthermore, by thematically coding drivers' verbal
   descriptions of the stimuli, we also demonstrate differences in STS
   reactivity according to drivers' scores on two indices of
   socio-cognitive processing: subjects' perceived consequences of actors'
   actions, and their affective evaluation of the clips. Our results
   demonstrate the influence of social behavior and socio-cognitive
   processing on STS reactivity to social stimuli, developing considerably
   our understanding of the role of this region in social cognition. (C)

Title = {{Functional and structural brain differences associated with mirror-touch
   synaesthesia}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{1041-1050}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Observing touch is known to activate regions of the somatosensory cortex
   but the interpretation of this finding is controversial (e.g. does it
   reflect the simulated action of touching or the simulated reception of
   touch?). For most people, observing touch is not linked to reported
   experiences of feeling touch but in some people it is (mirrortouch
   synaesthetes). We conducted an fMRI study in which participants
   (mirror-touch synaesthetes, controls) watched movies of stimuli (face,
   dummy, object) being touched or approached. In addition we examined
   whether mirror touch synaesthesia is associated with local changes of
   grey and white matter volume in the brain using VBM (voxel-based
   morphometry). Both synaesthetes and controls activated the somatosensory
   system (primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, SI and SII) when
   viewing touch, and the same regions were activated (by a separate
   localiser) when feeling touch i.e. there is a mirror system for touch.
   However, when comparing the two groups, we found evidence that SII seems
   to play a particular important role in mirror-touch synaesthesia: in
   synaesthetes, but not in controls, posterior Sit was active for watching
   touch to a face (in addition to SI and posterior temporal lobe);
   activity in SR correlated with subjective intensity measures of
   mirror-touch synaesthesia (taken outside the scanner), and we observed
   an increase in grey matter volume within the SII of the synaesthetes'
   brains. In addition, the synaesthetes showed hypo-activity when watching
   touch to a dummy in posterior SII. We conclude that the secondary
   somatosensory cortex has a key role in this form of synaesthesia. (C)

Title = {{Effects of acute alcohol intoxication on saccadic conflict and error
   processing}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{230}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{487-497}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rationale Flexible behavior optimization relies on cognitive control
   which includes the ability to suppress automatic responses interfering
   with relevant goals. Extensive evidence suggests that the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) is the central node in a predominantly frontal
   cortical network subserving executive tasks. Neuroimaging studies
   indicate that the ACC is sensitive to acute intoxication during
   conflict, but such evidence is limited to tasks using manual responses
   with arbitrary response contingencies.
   The present study was designed to examine whether alcohol's effects on
   top-down cognitive control would generalize to the oculomotor system
   during inhibition of hardwired saccadic responses.
   Healthy social drinkers (N = 22) underwent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) scanning and eye movement tracking during alcohol (0.6
   g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg for women) and placebo conditions in a
   counterbalanced design. They performed visually guided prosaccades (PS)
   towards a target and volitional antisaccades (AS) away from it. To
   mitigate possible vasoactive effects of alcohol on the BOLD (blood
   oxygenation level-dependent) signal, resting perfusion was quantified
   with arterial spin labeling (ASL) and used as a covariate in the BOLD
   analysis.
   Saccadic conflict was subserved by a distributed frontoparietal network.
   However, alcohol intoxication selectively attenuated activity only in
   the ACC to volitional AS and erroneous responses.
   This study provides converging evidence for the selective ACC
   vulnerability to alcohol intoxication during conflict across different
   response modalities and executive tasks, confirming its supramodal,
   high-level role in cognitive control. Alcohol intoxication may impair
   top-down regulative functions by attenuating the ACC activity, resulting
   in behavioral disinhibition and decreased self-control.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in social neuroscience research have unveiled the
   neurophysiological correlates of race and intergroup processing.
   However, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying
   intergroup empathy. Combining event-related fMRI with measurements of
   pupil dilation as an index of autonomic reactivity, we explored how race
   and group membership affect empathy-related responses. White and Black
   subjects were presented with video clips depicting white, black, and
   unfamiliar violet-skinned hands being either painfully penetrated by a
   syringe or being touched by a Q-tip. Both hemodynamic activity within
   areas known to be involved in the processing of first and third-person
   emotional experiences of pain, i.e., bilateral anterior insula, and
   autonomic reactivity were greater for the pain experienced by own-race
   compared to that of other-race and violet models. Interestingly, greater
   implicit racial bias predicted increased activity within the left
   anterior insula during the observation of own-race pain relative to
   other-race pain. Our findings highlight the close link between
   group-based segregation and empathic processing. Moreover, they
   demonstrate the relative influence of culturally acquired implicit
   attitudes and perceived similarity/familiarity with the target in
   shaping emotional responses to others' physical pain. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{It has been shown in adults that individual differences in intelligence
   are related to the integrity of the interaction between parietal and
   frontal brain regions. Since connectivity between distant brain regions
   strengthens during childhood, it is unclear when in the course of
   development this relationship emerges. Thus, the goal of this study was
   to determine whether parietal-frontal functional connectivity is
   associated with intelligence in young children. We performed independent
   component analyses on resting-state fMRI data of 115 children (6-8 years
   old) to select seed and target regions for a seed/target region
   correlation analysis. We found that higher nonverbal intelligence was
   associated with increased functional connectivity between right parietal
   and right frontal regions, and between right parietal and dorsal
   anterior cingulate regions. The association between intelligence and
   functional connectivity between certain brain regions was stronger in
   girls than boys. In conclusion, we found that connectivity between the
   parietal and frontal lobes is critically involved in intelligence in
   young children. Hum Brain Mapp 34:3299-3307, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{It is unknown how experience with different types of orthographies
   influences the neural basis of oral language processing. In order to
   determine the effects of alphabetic and nonalphabetic writing systems,
   the current study examined the influence of learning to read on oral
   language in English and Chinese speakers. Children (8-12 years olds) and
   adults made rhyming judgments to pairs of spoken words during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Developmental increases were seen
   only for English speakers in the left hemisphere phonological network
   (superior temporal gyrus (STG), inferior parietal lobule, and inferior
   frontal gyrus). The increase in the STG was more pronounced for words
   with conflicting orthography (e.g. pint-mint; jazz-has) even though
   access to orthography was irrelevant to the task. Moreover, higher
   reading skill was correlated with greater activation in the STG only for
   English speaking children. The effects suggest that learning to read
   reorganizes the phonological awareness network only for alphabetic and
   not logographic writing systems because of differences in the principles
   for mapping between orthographic and phonological representations. The
   reorganization of the auditory cortex may result in better phonological
   awareness skills in alphabetic readers. Hum Brain Mapp 34:3354-3368,

Title = {{Sensory motor mechanisms unify psychology: the embodiment of culture}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Sensorimotor mechanisms can unify explanations at cognitive, social, and
   cultural levels. As an example, we review how anticipated motor effort
   is used by individuals and groups to judge distance: the greater the
   anticipated effort the greater the perceived distance. Anticipated motor
   effort can also be used to understand cultural differences. People with
   interdependent self-construals interact almost exclusively with in-group
   members, and hence there is little opportunity to tune their
   sensorimotor systems for interaction with out-group members. The result
   is that interactions with out-group members are expected to be difficult
   and out-group members are perceived as literally more distant. In two
   experiments we show (a) interdependent Americans, compared to
   independent Americans, see American confederates (in-group) as closer;
   (b) interdependent Arabs, compared to independent Arabs, perceive Arab
   confederates (in-group) as closer, whereas interdependent Americans
   perceive Arab confederates (out-group) as farther. These results
   demonstrate how the same embodied mechanism can seamlessly contribute to
   explanations at the cognitive, social, and cultural levels.}},

   autism}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing the nature of developmental change is critical to
   understanding the mechanisms that are impaired in complex
   neurodevelopment disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and,
   pragmatically, may allow us to pinpoint periods of plasticity when
   interventions are particularly useful. Although aberrant brain
   development has long been theorized as a characteristic feature of ASD,
   the neural substrates have been difficult to characterize, in part due
   to a lack of developmental data and to performance confounds. To address
   these issues, we examined the development of intrinsic functional
   connectivity, with resting state fMRI from late childhood to early
   adulthood (8-36 years), using a seed based functional connectivity
   method with the striatal regions. Overall, we found that both groups
   show decreases in cortico-striatal circuits over age. However, when
   controlling for age, ASD participants showed increased connectivity with
   parietal cortex and decreased connectivity with prefrontal cortex
   relative to typically developed (TD) participants. In addition, ASD
   participants showed aberrant age-related connectivity with anterior
   aspects of cerebellum, and posterior temporal regions (e. g., fusiform
   gyrus, inferior and superior temporal gyri). In sum, we found prominent
   differences in the development of striatal connectivity in ASD, most
   notably, a typical development of connectivity in striatal networks that
   may underlie cognitive and social reward processing. Our findings
   highlight the need to identify the biological mechanisms of
   perturbations in brain reorganization over development, which may also
   help clarify discrepant findings in the literature.}},

Title = {{Polymorphisms of the OXTR gene explain why sales professionals love to
   help customers}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Polymorphisms of the OXTR gene affect people's social interaction styles
   in various social encounters: carriers of the OXTR GG, compared to the
   OXTR AA/AG in general, are more motivated to interact socially and
   detect social salience. We focus on sales professionals operating in
   knowledge intensive organizations. Study 1, with a sample of 141 sales
   people, shows that carriers of the OXTR GG allele, compared to the OXTR
   AA/AG allele, are more motivated to help customers than to
   manipulatively impose goods/services on them. Study 2, using genomic
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on a sample of 21 sales
   professionals processing facial pictures with different emotional
   valences, investigates key nuclei of social brain regions (SBRs).
   Compared to OXTR AA/AG carriers, OXTR GG carriers experience greater
   effective connectivity between SBRs of interest measured by Granger
   causality tests using univariate Haugh tests. In addition, the
   multivariate El-Himdi and Roy tests demonstrate that the amygdala,
   perfrontal cortex, and pars opercularis (inferior frontal gyrus) play
   key roles when processing emotional expressions. The bilateral amygdala
   and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) show significantly greater
   clout-influence on other brain regions-for GG allele carriers than
   non-carriers; likewise, the bilateral pars opercularis, left amygdala,
   and left mPFC are more receptive to activity in other brain regions
   among GG allele carriers than AG/AA allele carriers are. Thus, carriers
   of the OXTR GG allele are more sensitive to changes in emotional cues,
   enhancing social salience. To our knowledge, this is the first study on
   how insights from imaging genetics help understanding of the social
   motivation of people operating in a professional setting.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal decision-making often requires exercising self-control. A
   growing fMRI literature has implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (dlPFC) in successful self-control, but due to the limitations
   inherent in BOLD measures of brain activity, the neurocomputational role
   of this region has not been resolved. Here we exploit the high temporal
   resolution and whole-brain coverage of event-related potentials (ERPs)
   to test the hypothesis that dlPFC affects dietary self-control through
   two different mechanisms: attentional filtering and value modulation.
   Whereas attentional filtering of sensory input should occur early in the
   decision process, value modulation should occur later on, after the
   computation of stimulus values begins. Hungry human subjects were asked
   to make food choices while we measured neural activity using ERP in a
   natural condition, in which they responded freely and did not exhibit a
   tendency to regulate their diet, and in a self-control condition, in
   which they were given a financial incentive to lose weight. We then
   measured various neural markers associated with the attentional
   filtering and value modulation mechanisms across the decision period to
   test for changes in neural activity during the exercise of self-control.
   Consistent with the hypothesis, we found evidence for top-down
   attentional filtering early on in the decision period (150-200 ms
   poststimulus onset) as well as evidence for value modulation later in
   the process (450-650 ms poststimulus onset). We also found evidence that
   dlPFC plays a role in the deployment of both mechanisms.}},

   with this pathology. The patient and a group of healthy controls
   underwent a comprehensive assessment that included multiple
   neuropsychological and social cognition (emotion recognition, theory of
   mind, and empathy) tasks. In addition, we compared the pattern of
   atrophy in the patient to controls and to its concordance with ERCC8
   gene expression in a healthy brain. The results showed memory, language,
   and executive deficits that contrast with the relative preservation of
   social cognition skills. The cognitive profile of the patient was
   consistent with his pattern of global cerebral and cerebellar loss of
   gray matter volume (frontal structures, bilateral cerebellum, basal
   ganglia, temporal lobe, and occipito-temporal/occipito-parietal
   regions), which in turn was anatomically consistent with the ERCC8 gene
   expression level in a healthy donor's brain. The study of exceptional
   cases, such as the one described here, is fundamental to elucidating the
   processes that affect the brain in premature aging diseases, and such
   studies provide an important source of information for understanding the
   problems associated with normal and pathological aging.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{The ability to accurately estimate another person's preferences is
   crucial for a successful social life. In daily interactions, we often do
   this on the basis of minimal information. The aims of the present study
   were (a) to examine whether people can accurately judge other based only
   on a brief exposure to their appearances, and (b) to reveal the
   underlying neural mechanisms with functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Participants were asked to make guesses about unfamiliar target
   individuals' preferences for various items after looking at their faces
   for 3s. The behavioral results showed that participants estimated
   others' preferences above chance level. The fMRI data revealed that
   higher accuracy in preference estimation was associated with greater
   activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) when participants
   were guessing the targets' preferences relative to thinking about their
   own preferences. These findings suggest that accurate estimations of
   others' preferences may require increased activity in the DMPFC. A
   functional connectivity analysis revealed that higher accuracy in
   preference estimation was related to increased functional connectivity
   between the DMPFC and the brain regions that are known to be involved in
   theory of mind processing, such as the temporoparietal junction (TPJ)
   and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus, during correct vs.
   incorrect guessing trials. On the contrary, the tendency to refer to
   self-preferences when estimating others' preference was related to
   greater activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These findings
   imply that the DMPFC may be core region in estimating the preferences of
   others and that higher accuracy may require stronger communication
   between the DMPFC and the TPJ and PCC/precuneus, part of a neural
   network known to be engaged in mentalizing.}},

Title = {{Does that look heavy to you? Perceived weight judgment in lifting
   actions in younger and older adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{When interpreting other people's movements or actions, observers may not
   only rely on the visual cues available in the observed movement, but
   they may also be able to ``put themselves in the other person's
   shoes{''} by engaging brain systems involved in both ``mentalizing{''}
   and motor simulation. The ageing process brings changes in both
   perceptual and motor abilities, yet little is known about how these
   changes may affect the ability to accurately interpret other people's
   actions. Here we investigated the effect of ageing on the ability to
   discriminate the weight of objects based on the movements of actors
   lifting these objects. Stimuli consisted of videos of an actor lifting a
   small box weighing 0.05-0.9 kg or a large box weighting 3-18 kg. In a
   four-alternative forced-choice task, younger and older participants
   reported the perceived weight of the box in each video. Overall, older
   participants were less sensitive than younger participants in
   discriminating the perceived weight of lifted boxes, an effect that was
   especially pronounced in the small box condition. Weight discrimination
   performance was better for the large box compared to the small box in
   both groups, due to greater saliency of the visual cues in this
   condition. These results suggest that older adults may require more
   salient visual cues to interpret the actions of others accurately. We
   discuss the potential contribution of age-related changes in visual and
   motor function on the observed effects and suggest that older adults'
   decline in the sensitivity to subtle visual cues may lead to greater
   reliance on visual analysis of the observed scene and its semantic
   context.}},

Title = {{fMRI evidence for the interaction between orthography and phonology in
   reading Chinese compound words}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Compound words make up a major part of modern Chinese vocabulary.
   Behavioral studies have demonstrated that access to lexical semantics of
   compound words is driven by the interaction between orthographic and
   phonological information. However, little is known about the neural
   underpinnings of compound word processing. In this functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study, we asked participants to perform lexical
   decisions to pseudohomophones, which were constructed by replacing one
   or both constituents of two-character compound words with
   orthographically dissimilar homophonic characters. Mixed
   pseudohomophones, which shared the first constituent with the base
   words, were more difficult to reject than non-pseudohomophone non-words.
   This effect was accompanied by the increased activation of bilateral
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and
   left angular gyrus. The pure pseudohomophones, which shared no
   constituent with their base words, were rejected as quickly as non-word
   controls and did not elicit any significant neural activation. The
   effective connectivity of a phonological pathway from left IPL to left
   IFG was enhanced for the mixed pseudohomophones but not for pure
   pseudohomophones. These findings demonstrated that phonological
   activation alone, as in the case of the pure pseudohomophones, is not
   sufficient to drive access to lexical representations of compound words,
   and that orthographic information interacts with phonology, playing a
   gating role in the recognition of Chinese compound words.}},

Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Social relationships are tightly linked to health and well-being. Recent
   work suggests that social relationships can even serve vital emotion
   regulation functions by minimizing threat-related neural activity. But
   relationship distress remains a significant public health problem in
   North America and elsewhere. A promising approach to helping couples
   both resolve relationship distress and nurture effective interpersonal
   functioning is Emotionally Focused Therapy for couples (EFT), a
   manualized, empirically supported therapy that is strongly focused on
   repairing adult attachment bonds. We sought to examine a neural index of
   social emotion regulation as a potential mediator of the effects of EFT.
   Specifically, we examined the effectiveness of EFT for modifying the
   social regulation of neural threat responding using an fMRI-based
   handholding procedure. Results suggest that EFT altered the brain's
   representation of threat cues in the presence of a romantic partner.
   EFT-related changes during stranger handholding were also observed, but
   stranger effects were dependent upon self-reported relationship quality.
   EFT also appeared to increase threat-related brain activity in regions
   associated with self-regulation during the no-handholding condition.
   These findings provide a critical window into the regulatory mechanisms
   of close relationships in general and EFT in particular.}},

Abstract = {{Training can induce significant changes in brain functioning and
   behavioral performance. One consequence of training is changing the
   pattern of brain activation. Abacus training is of interest because
   abacus experts gain the ability to handle digits with unusual speed and
   accuracy. However, the neural correlates of numerical memory in
   abacus-trained children remain unknown. In the current study, we aimed
   to detect a training effect of abacus-based mental calculations on
   numerical working memory in children. We measured brain functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation patterns in 17
   abacus-trained children and 17 control children as they performed two
   numerical working memory tasks (digits and beads). Functional MRI
   results revealed higher activation in abacus-trained children than in
   the controls in the right posterior superior parietal lobule/superior
   occipital gyrus (PSPL/SOG) and the right supplementary motor area (SMA)
   in both tasks. When these regions were used as seeds in a functional
   connectivity analysis of the resting brain, the abacus-trained children
   showed significantly enhanced integration between the right SMA and the
   right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The IFG is considered to be the key
   region for the control of attention. These findings demonstrate that
   extensive engagement of the fronto-parietal network occurs during
   numerical memory tasks in the abacus-trained group. Furthermore, abacus
   training may increase the functional integration of
   visuospatial-attention circuitry, which and thus enhances high-level
   cognitive process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   represented entities within a single category. Semantic clustering and
   semantic distances between 24 animate entities were derived from a
   concept-feature matrix based on feature generation by >1000 subjects. In
   the main fMRI study, 19 human subjects performed a property verification
   task with written words and pictures and a low-level control task. The
   univariate contrast between the semantic and the control task yielded
   extensive bilateral occipitotemporal activation from posterior cingulate
   to anteromedial temporal cortex. Entities belonging to a same semantic
   cluster elicited more similar fMRI activity patterns in left
   occipitotemporal cortex. When words and pictures were analyzed
   separately, the effect reached significance only for words. The semantic
   similarity effect for words was localized to left perirhinal cortex.
   According to a representational similarity analysis of left perirhinal
   responses, semantic distances between entities correlated inversely with
   cosine similarities between fMRI response patterns to written words. An
   independent replication study in 16 novel subjects confirmed these novel
   findings. Semantic similarity is reflected by similarity of functional
   topography at a fine-grained level in left perirhinal cortex. The word
   specificity excludes perceptually driven confounds as an explanation and
   is likely to be task dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Research into the neural correlates of bulimia nervosa (BN)
   psychopathology remains limited.
   Methods: In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 21 BN
   patients and 23 healthy controls (HCs) completed two paradigms: 1)
   processing of visual food stimuli and 2) comparing their own appearance
   with that of slim women. Participants also rated food craving and
   anxiety levels.
   Results: Brain activation patterns in response to food cues did not
   differ between women with and without BN. However, when evaluating
   themselves against images of slim women, BN patients engaged the insula
   more and the fusiform gyrus less, compared to HCs, suggesting increased
   self-focus among women with BN whilst comparing themselves to a `slim
   ideal'. In these BN patients, exposure to food and body image stimuli
   increased self-reported levels of anxiety, but not craving.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that women with BN differ from HCs in
   the way they process body image, but not in the way they process food
   stimuli.}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Social exclusion and risk-taking are both common experiences of concern
   in adolescence, yet little is known about how the two may be related at
   behavioral or neural levels. In this fMRI study, adolescents (N = 27, 14
   male, 14-17 years-old) completed a series of tasks in the scanner
   assessing risky decision-making before and after an episode of social
   exclusion. In this particular context, exclusion was associated with
   greater behavioral risk-taking among adolescents with low self-reported
   resistance to peer influence (RN). When making risky decisions after
   social exclusion, adolescents who had lower RPI exhibited higher levels
   of activity in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), and this
   response in rTPJ was a significant mediator of the relationship between
   RPI and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. Lower RPI was also
   associated with lower levels of activity in IPFC during crashes
   following social exclusion, but unlike rTPJ this response in IPFC was
   not a significant mediator of the relationship between RPI and greater
   risk-taking after social exclusion. The results suggest that mentalizing
   and/or attentional mechanisms have a unique direct effect on
   adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence on risk-taking. (c) 2013

Title = {{Comparing neural response to painful electrical stimulation with

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{336-343}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Progressing from 3 T to 7 T functional MRI enables marked improvements
   of human brain imaging in vivo. Although direct comparisons demonstrated
   advantages concerning blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal
   response and spatial specificity, these mostly focused on single brain
   regions with rather simple tasks. Considering that physiological noise
   also increases with higher field strength, it is not entirely clear
   whether the advantages of 7 T translate equally to the entire brain
   during tasks which elicit more complex neuronal processing. Therefore,
   we investigated the difference between 3 T and 7 Tin response to
   transcutaneous electrical painful and non-painful stimulation in 22
   healthy subjects. For painful stimuli vs. baseline, stronger activations
   were observed at 7 Tin several brain regions including the insula and
   supplementary motor area, but not the secondary somatosensory cortex (p
   < 0.05 FWE-corrected). Contrasting painful vs. non-painful stimulation
   limited the differences between the field strengths to the
   periaqueductal gray (PAG, p < 0.001 uncorrected) due to a similar signal
   increase at 7 T for both the target and specific control condition in
   most brain regions. This regional specificity obtained for the PAG at
   higher field strengths was confirmed by an additional spatial
   normalization strategy optimized for the brainstem. Here, robust BOLD
   responses were obtained in the dorsal PAG at 7 T (p < 0.05
   FWE-corrected), whereas at 3 T activation was completely missing for the
   contrast against non-painful stimuli. To summarize, our findings support
   previously reported benefits obtained at ultra-high field strengths also
   for complex activation patterns elicited by painful electrical
   stimulation. However, this advantage depends on the region and even more
   on the contrast of interest The greatest gain at 7 T was observed within
   the small brainstem region of the PAG, where the increased field
   strength offered marked improvement for the localization of activation
   foci with high spatial specificity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{This study examined the reproducibility of prefrontal-hippocampal
   connectivity estimates obtained by stochastic dynamic causal modeling
   (sDCM). 180 healthy subjects were measured by functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) during a standard working memory N-Back task at
   three different sites (Mannheim, Bonn, Berlin; each with 60
   participants). The reproducibility of regional activations in key
   regions for working memory (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC;
   hippocampal formation, HF) was evaluated using conjunction analyses
   across locations. These analyses showed consistent activation of right
   DLPFC and deactivation of left HF across all three different sites. The
   effective connectivity between DLPFC and HF was analyzed using a simple
   two-region sDCM. For each subject, we evaluated sixty-seven alternative
   sDCMs and compared their relative plausibility using Bayesian model
   selection (BMS). Across all locations, BMS consistently revealed the
   same winning model, with the 2-Back working memory condition as driving
   input to both DLPFC and HF and with a connection from DLPFC to HF.
   Statistical tests on the sDCM parameter estimates did not show any
   significant differences across the three sites. The consistency of both
   the BMS results and model parameter estimates indicates the reliability
   of sDCM in our paradigm. This provides a basis for future genetic and
   clinical studies using this approach., (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Automatic amygdala response to facial expression in schizophrenia:
   initial hyperresponsivity followed by hyporesponsivity}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is well established that the amygdala is crucially
   involved in the processing of facial emotions. In schizophrenia
   patients, a number of neuroimaging findings suggest hypoactivation of
   the amygdala in response to facial emotion, while others indicate normal
   or enhanced recruitment of this region. Some of this variability may be
   related to the baseline condition used and the length of the experiment.
   There is evidence that schizophrenia patients display increased
   activation of the amygdala to neutral faces and that this is
   predominantly observed during early parts of the experiment. Recent
   research examining the automatic processing of facial emotion has also
   reported amygdala hyperactivation in schizophrenia. In the present
   study, we focused on the time-course of amygdala activation during the
   automatic processing of emotional facial expression. We hypothesized
   that in comparison to healthy subjects, patients would initially show
   hyperresponsivity of the amygdala to masked emotional and neutral faces.
   In addition, we expected amygdala deactivation in response to masked
   facial emotions from the first to the second phase to be more pronounced
   in patients than in controls.
   Results: Amygdala activation in response to angry, happy, neutral, and
   no facial expression (presented for 33 ms) was measured by functional
   magnetic resonance imaging in 30 schizophrenia patients and 35 healthy
   controls. Across all subjects, the bilateral amygdala response to faces
   (relative to the no facial expression condition) was larger in the
   initial phase (first half of trials) than in the second phase (second
   half of trials). During the initial phase, schizophrenia patients
   exhibited an increased right amygdala response to all faces and an
   increased left amygdala response to neutral faces compared with
   controls. During the second phase, controls manifested a higher right
   amygdala response for all faces and a higher left amygdala response to
   angry faces than patients.
   Conclusions: Schizophrenia patients are characterized by high initial
   amygdala responsivity to facial expressions at an automatic processing
   level, which substantially decreases with time. Amygdala deactivation
   over time might reflect an automatic mechanism by which schizophrenia
   patients suppress the processing of facial stimuli. This blocking
   mechanism could help patients avoid overstimulation during social
   interactions.}},

Title = {{The default modes of reading: modulation of posterior cingulate and

Abstract = {{Reading is a fundamental human capacity and yet it can easily be
   derailed by the simple act of mind-wandering. A large-scale brain
   network, referred to as the default mode network (DMN), has been shown
   to be involved in both mind-wandering and reading, raising the question
   as to how the same neural system could be implicated in processes with
   both costs and benefits to narrative comprehension. Resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to explore
   whether the intrinsic functional connectivity of the two key midline
   hubs of the DMN-the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and anterior medial
   prefrontal cortex (a MPFC)-was predictive of individual differences in
   reading comprehension and task focus recorded outside of the scanner.
   Worse comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity
   between the PCC and a region of the ventral striatum. Better
   comprehension was associated with greater functional connectivity with a
   region of the right insula. By contrast reports of increasing task focus
   were associated with functional connectivity from the a MPFC to clusters
   in the PCC, the left parietal and temporal cortex, and the cerebellum.
   Our results suggest that the DMN has both costs (such as poor
   comprehension) and benefits to reading (such as a non-task focus)
   because its midline core can couple its activity with other regions to
   form distinct functional communities that allow seemingly opposing
   mental states to occur. This flexible coupling allows the DMN to
   participate in cognitive states that complement the act of reading as
   well as others that do not.}},

Title = {{Connecting multimodality in human communication}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{A successful reciprocal evaluation of social signals serves as a
   prerequisite for social coherence and empathy. In a previous fMRI study
   we studied naturalistic communication situations by presenting video
   clips to our participants and recording their behavioral responses
   regarding empathy and its components. In two conditions, all three
   channels transported congruent emotional or neutral information,
   respectively. Three conditions selectively presented two emotional
   channels and one neutral channel and were thus bimodally emotional. We
   reported channel-specific emotional contributions in modality-related
   areas, elicited by dynamic video clips with varying combinations of
   emotionality in facial expressions, prosody, and speech content.
   However, to better understand the underlying mechanisms accompanying a
   naturalistically displayed human social interaction in some key regions
   that presumably serve as specific processing hubs for facial
   expressions, prosody, and speech content, we pursued a reanalysis of the
   data. Here, we focused on two different descriptions of temporal
   characteristics within these three modality-related regions {[}right
   fusiform gyrus (FFG), left auditory cortex (AC), left angular gyrus (AG)
   and left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)]. By means of a finite
   impulse response (FIR) analysis within each of the three regions we
   examined the post-stimulus time-courses as a description of the temporal
   characteristics of the BOLD response during the video clips. Second,
   effective connectivity between these areas and the left dmPFC was
   analyzed using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) in order to describe
   condition-related modulatory influences on the coupling between these
   regions. The FIR analysis showed initially diminished activation in
   bimodally emotional conditions but stronger activation than that
   observed in neutral videos toward the end of the stimuli, possibly by
   bottom-up processes in order to compensate for a lack of emotional
   information. The DCM analysis instead showed a pronounced top-down
   control. Remarkably, all connections from the dmPFC to the three other
   regions were modulated by the experimental conditions. This observation
   is in line with the presumed role of the dmPFC in the allocation of
   attention. In contrary, all incoming connections to the AG were
   modulated, indicating its key role in integrating multimodal information
   and supporting comprehension. Notably, the input from the FFG to the AG
   was enhanced when facial expressions conveyed emotional information.
   These findings serve as preliminary results in understanding network
   dynamics in human emotional communication and empathy.}},

Title = {{The balanced mind: the variability of task-unrelated thoughts predicts
   error monitoring}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Self-generated thoughts unrelated to ongoing activities, also known as
   ``mind-wandering,{''} make up a substantial portion of our daily lives.
   Reports of such task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs) predict both poor
   performance on demanding cognitive tasks and
   blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity in the default mode network
   (DMN). However, recent findings suggest that TUTs and the DMN can also
   facilitate metacognitive abilities and related behaviors. To further
   understand these relationships, we examined the influence of subjective
   intensity, ruminative quality, and variability of mind-wandering on
   response inhibition and monitoring, using the Error Awareness Task
   (EAT). We expected to replicate links between TUT and reduced
   inhibition, and explored whether variance in TUT would predict improved
   error monitoring, reflecting a capacity to balance between internal and
   external cognition. By analyzing BOLD responses to subjective probes and
   the EAT, we dissociated contributions of the DMN, executive, and
   salience networks to task performance. While both response inhibition
   and online TUT ratings modulated BOLD activity in the medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC) of the DMN, the former recruited a more dorsal area
   implying functional segregation. We further found that individual
   differences in mean TUTs strongly predicted EAT stop accuracy, while TUT
   variability specifically predicted levels of error awareness.
   Interestingly, we also observed co-activation of salience and default
   mode regions during error awareness, supporting a link between
   monitoring and TUTs. Altogether our results suggest that although TUT is
   detrimental to task performance, fluctuations in attention between
   self-generated and external task-related thought is a characteristic of
   individuals with greater metacognitive monitoring capacity. Achieving a
   balance between internally and externally oriented thought may thus aid
   individuals in optimizing their task performance.}},

Abstract = {{Previous experience affects our behavior in terms of adjustments. It has
   been suggested that the conflict monitor-controller system implemented
   in the prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in such adjustments.
   Previous studies suggested that there exists multiple conflict
   monitor-controller systems associated with the level of information
   (i.e., stimulus and response levels). In this study, we sought to test
   whether different types of conflicts occur at the same information
   processing level (i.e., response level) are independently processed. For
   this purpose, we designed a task paradigm to measure two different types
   of response conflicts using color-based and location-based conflict
   stimuli and measured the conflict adaptation effects associated with the
   two types of conflicts either independently (i.e., single conflict
   conditions) or simultaneously (i.e., a double-conflict condition). The
   behavioral results demonstrated that performance on current incongruent
   trials was faster only when the preceding trial was the same type of
   response conflict regardless of whether they included a single- or
   double-conflict. Imaging data also showed that anterior cingulate and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortices operate in a task-specific manner.
   These findings suggest that there may be multiple monitor-controller
   loops for color-based and location-based conflicts even at the same
   response level. Importantly, our results suggest that double-conflict
   processing is qualitatively different from single-conflict processing
   although double-conflict shares the same sources of conflict with two
   single-conflict conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social responsibility links personal behavior with societal expectations
   and plays a key role in affecting an agent's emotional state following a
   decision. However, the neural basis of responsibility attribution
   remains unclear. In two previous event-related brain potential (ERP)
   studies we found that personal responsibility modulated outcome
   evaluation in gambling tasks. Here we conducted a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) study to identify particular brain regions that
   mediate responsibility attribution. In a context involving team
   cooperation, participants completed a task with their teammates and on
   each trial received feedback about team success and individual success
   sequentially. We found that brain activity differed between conditions
   involving team success vs. team failure. Further, different brain
   regions were associated with reinforcement of behavior by social praise
   vs. monetary reward. Specifically, right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ)
   was associated with social pride whereas dorsal striatum and dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were related to reinforcement of
   behaviors leading to personal gain. The present study provides evidence
   that the RTPJ is an important region for determining whether
   self-generated behaviors are deserving of praise in a social context.}},

Abstract = {{In the current study, we evaluated the test-retest reliability of
   amygdala response using an emotional face-matching task that has been
   widely used to examine pathophysiology and treatment mechanisms in

   of the face-matching paradigm developed by Hariri et al. (2000) at two

   reliability of amygdala response to fearful faces were moderate, whereas
   angry and happy faces showed poor reliability. Test-retest reliability
   of the FFA was moderate to strong, regardless of facial affect.
   Collectively, these findings indicate that the reliability of the BOLD

Abstract = {{Historically, the study of human identity perception has focused on
   faces, but the voice is also central to our expressions and experiences
   of identity {[}Belin, P., Fecteau, S., \& Bedard, C. Thinking the voice:
   Neural correlates of voice perception. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8,
   129-135, 2004]. Our voices are highly flexible and dynamic; talkers
   speak differently, depending on their health, emotional state, and the
   social setting, as well as extrinsic factors such as background noise.
   However, to date, there have been no studies of the neural correlates of
   identity modulation in speech production. In the current fMRI
   experiment, we measured the neural activity supporting controlled voice
   change in adult participants performing spoken impressions. We reveal
   that deliberate modulation of vocal identity recruits the left anterior
   insula and inferior frontal gyrus, supporting the planning of novel
   articulations. Bilateral sites in posterior superior temporal/inferior
   parietal cortex and a region in right middle/anterior STS showed greater
   responses during the emulation of specific vocal identities than for
   impressions of generic accents. Using functional connectivity analyses,
   we describe roles for these three sites in their interactions with the
   brain regions supporting speech planning and production. Our findings
   mark a significant step toward understanding the neural control of vocal
   identity, with wider implications for the cognitive control of voluntary
   motor acts.}},

Abstract = {{As a social species, humans are acutely aware of cues that signal
   inclusionary status. This study characterizes behavioral and neural
   responses when individuals anticipate social feedback. Across two fMRI
   studies, participants (n = 42) made social judgments about supposed
   peers and then received feedback from those individuals. Of particular
   interest was the neural activity occurring when participants were
   awaiting social feedback. During this anticipatory period, increased
   neural activity was observed in the ventral striatum, a central
   component of the brain's reward circuitry, and dorsomedial pFC, a brain
   region implicated in mentalizing about others. Individuals high in
   rejection sensitivity exhibited greater responses in both the ventral
   striatum and dorsomedial pFC when anticipating positive feedback. These
   findings provide initial insight into the neural mechanisms involved in
   anticipating social evaluations as well as the cognitive processes that
   underlie rejection sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Children in foster care have often encountered a range of adverse
   experiences, including neglectful and/or abusive care and multiple
   caregiver transitions. Prior research findings suggest that such
   experiences negatively affect inhibitory control and the underlying
   neural circuitry. In the current study, event-related functional
   magnetic resonance imaging was employed during a go/no go task that
   assesses inhibitory control to compare the behavioral performance and
   brain activation of foster children and nonmaltreated children. The
   sample included two groups of 9- to 12-year-old children: 11 maltreated
   foster children and 11 nonmaltreated children living with their
   biological parents. There were no significant group differences on
   behavioral performance on the task. In contrast, patterns of brain
   activation differed by group. The nonmaltreated children demonstrated
   stronger activation than did the foster children across several regions,
   including the right anterior cingulate cortex, the middle frontal gyrus,
   and the right lingual gyrus, during correct no go trials, whereas the
   foster children displayed stronger activation than the nonmaltreated
   children in the left inferior parietal lobule and the right superior
   occipital cortex, including the lingual gyrus and cuneus, during
   incorrect no go trials. These results provide preliminary evidence that
   the early adversity experienced by foster children impacts the neural
   substrates of inhibitory control.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the subjective experience of others in terms of mental states,
   a brain function referred to as mentalizing, is achieved in the brain
   through a set of low-level perceptual and high-level inference-based
   processes. Because of its recurrent implication in fMRI studies, the
   right frontal cortex, especially in its inferolateral and dorsomesial
   parts, is posited to be a ``core system{''} in the sustenance of these
   neurocognitive mechanisms. In this context, we reasoned that if the
   right frontal cortex is really crucial for mentalizing, its surgical
   resection, following diffuse low-grade glioma invasion, should induce
   irreversible impairments. To test this hypothesis, we designed a
   longitudinal experimental setup in which ten patients harboring a
   low-grade glioma in right frontal areas were assessed just before,
   immediately after and three months after a brain surgery. Two
   well-validated behavioral tasks, thought to evaluate both aspects of
   mentalizing, were administered. The results obtained provide evidence
   that widespread surgical excisions of the right prefrontal cortex do not
   induce a long-term worsening of both aspects of mentalizing, although
   some transitory effects are observed immediately after the surgery. They
   suggest also for the first time in the same sample of patients a
   possible double functional dissociation between low-level perceptual
   (posterior inferolateral prefrontal) and high-level inference-based
   (dorsomesial prefrontal) mentalizing processes. This overall finding
   challenges the traditional view according to which the right frontal
   cortex is an ``essential cortical node{''} in the mentalizing network
   since it might be expected that massive surgical excisions of this brain
   area would have induced more definitive impairments. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Understanding cause and effect is a fundamental aspect of human
   cognition. When shown videos of simple two-dimensional shapes colliding,
   humans experience one object causing the other to move, e.g., one
   billiard-like ball seeming to hit and move the other. The impression of
   causality can also occur when people attribute social interactions to
   moving objects. Whether the judgment of social and physical causality
   engages distinct or shared neural networks is not known. In a functional
   magnetic imaging (fMRI) study, participants were presented with two
   types of dynamic videos: a blue ball colliding with a red ball (P;
   physical condition) and a blue ball ({''}Mr. Blue{''}) passing a red
   ball ({''}Mrs. Red{''}) without making contact (S; social condition).
   Participants judged causal relationships (C) or movement direction (D;
   control task) in both video types, resulting in four conditions (PC; SC;
   PD; SD). We found common neural activations for physical and social
   causality judgments (SC > SD)boolean AND(PC > PD) in the right
   middle/inferior frontal gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, the right
   supplementary motor area, and bilateral insulae. For social causal
   judgments (SC > PC), we found distinct neural activity in the right
   temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ). These results provide evidence for a
   common neural network underlying judgments of causality that apply to
   both physical and social situations. The results also indicate that
   social causality judgments recruit additional neural resources in an
   area critical for determining animacy and intentionality. (C) 2013

Title = {{Humor processing in children: Influence of temperament, age and IQ}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2799-2811}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Emerging evidence from fMRI studies suggests that humor processing is a
   specific social cognitiveaffective human function that comprises two
   stages. The first stage (cognitive humor component) involves the
   detection and resolution of incongruity, and is associated with activity
   in temporo-occipitoparietal brain areas. The second stage (emotional
   humor component) comprises positive feelings related to mirth/reward,
   and is linked with reward-related activity in mesocorticolimbic
   circuits.
   In healthy adults, humor processing was shown to be moderated by
   temperament traits like intro-/extraversion, neuroticism, or social
   anxiety, representing risk factors for psychopathology. However,
   comparable data from early developmental stages is crucially lacking.
   Here, we report for the first time data from 22 children (ages 6 to 13)
   revealing an influence of temperament on humor processing. Specifically,
   we assessed the effects of Emotionality, Shyness, and Sociability, which
   are analogous to neuroticism, behavioral inhibition/fear and
   extraversion in adults. We found Emotionality to be positively, but
   Shyness negatively associated with brain activity linked with both
   cognitive and emotional humor components. In addition, Shyness and
   Sociability were positively related to activity in the periaqueductal
   gray region during humor processing. These findings are of potential
   clinical relevance regarding the early detection of childhood
   psychopathology.
   Previous data on humor processing in both adults and children
   furthermore suggest that intelligence (IQ) supports incongruity
   detection and resolution, whereas mirth and associated brain activity
   diminishes with increasing age. Here, we found that increasing age and
   IQ were linked with stronger activity to humor in brain areas implicated
   in the cognitive component of humor. Such data suggest that humor
   processing undergoes developmental changes and is moderated by higher IQ
   scores, both factors likely improving incongruity detection and
   resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Expertise in processing faces is a cornerstone of human social
   interaction. However, the developmental course of many key brain regions
   supporting face preferential processing in the human brain remains
   undefined. Here, we present findings from an FMRI study using a simple
   viewing paradigm of faces and objects in a continuous age sample
   covering the age range from 6 years through adulthood. These findings
   are the first to use such a sample paired with whole-brain FMRI analyses
   to investigate development within the core and extended face networks
   across the developmental spectrum from middle childhood to adulthood. We
   found evidence, albeit modest, for a developmental trend in the volume
   of the right fusiform face area (rFFA) but no developmental change in
   the intensity of activation. From a spatial perspective, the middle
   portion of the right fusiform gyrus most commonly found in adult studies
   of face processing was increasingly likely to be included in the FFA as
   age increased to adulthood. Outside of the FFA, the most striking
   finding was that children hyperactivated nearly every aspect of the
   extended face system relative to adults, including the amygdala,
   anterior temporal pole, insula, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior
   cingulate gyrus, and parietal cortex. Overall, the findings suggest that
   development is best characterized by increasing modulation of
   face-sensitive regions throughout the brain to engage only those systems
   necessary for task requirements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Premenstrual disorder (PMDD) affects around 5\% of women in childbearing
   ages. An increased sensitivity in emotion processing areas of the brain
   to variations in ovarian steroid levels has been suggested as part of
   the pathophysiology in PMDD, but prior neuroimaging studies of emotion
   processing are yet inconclusive. Previous behavioral studies of women
   with PMDD have, however, reported enhanced luteal phase startle
   responsivity during emotional anticipation. Here we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate central neural
   circuitry activity during anticipation of, and exposure to, emotional
   stimuli across the menstrual cycle in women with and without PMDD. As
   compared to healthy controls, women with PMDD displayed significantly
   enhanced reactivity in the prefrontal cortex during anticipation of, but
   not exposure to, negative emotional stimuli during the luteal phase. In
   PMDD patients, BOLD reactivity during anticipation or viewing of
   negative emotional stimuli was not dependent on absolute levels of
   estradiol or progesterone. However, progesterone levels were positively
   correlated with emotion-induced reactivity in the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex to positive emotional stimuli. These findings suggest
   that cortical emotional circuitry reactivity during anticipation is
   altered in PMDD during the luteal phase, which might be part of the
   pathophysiology behind the emotional symptoms or lack of emotional
   control reported by women with PMDD. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2493-2501}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether altered baseline brain
   activity exists in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients using
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and
   whether abnormal neural activity in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) is
   correlated with cognitive function.
   Methods: T2DM patients (n = 28) were compared with nondiabetic age-,
   sex-, and education-matched control subjects (n = 29) using rs-fMRI. We
   computed the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of fMRI
   signals to measure spontaneous neuronal activity and detect the
   relationship between rs-fMRI information and clinical data.
   Results: Compared with healthy controls, T2DM patients had significantly
   decreased ALFF values in the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left
   fusiform gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, right inferior occipital
   gyrus; and increased ALFF values in both the bilateral cerebellum
   posterior lobe and right cerebellum culmen. Moreover, we found an
   inverse correlation between the ALFF values in the MTG and both the
   HbA1c (r = -0.451, p = 0.016) and the score of Trail Making Test-B (r =
   -0.420, p = 0.026) in the patient group. On the other hand, C-peptide
   level and pancreatic beta-cell function had a positive correlation (r =
   0.429, p = 0.023; r = 0.453, p = 0.016, respectively) with the ALFF
   value in the middle temporal gyrus.
   Conclusion: The present study confirms that T2DM patients have altered
   ALFF in many brain regions, which is associated with poor neurocognitive
   performances, severity of consistent hyperglycemic state and impaired
   beta-cell function. ALFF disturbance in MTG may play a central role in
   cognitive decline associated with T2DM and serve as reference for future
   clinical diagnosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Stress and fear conditioning processes are both important vulnerability
   factors in the development of psychiatric disorders. In behavioral
   studies considerable sex differences in fear learning have been observed
   after increases of the stress hormone cortisol. But neuroimaging
   experiments, which give insights into the neurobiological correlates of
   stress x sex interactions in fear conditioning, are lacking so far. In
   the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we
   tested whether a psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test)
   compared to a control condition influenced subsequent fear conditioning
   in 48 men and 48 women taking oral contraceptives (005). One of two
   pictures of a geometrical figure was always paired (conditioned
   stimulus, CS+) or never paired (CS-) with an electrical stimulation
   (unconditioned stimulus). BOLD responses as well as skin conductance
   responses were assessed. Sex-independently, stress enhanced the CS+/CS-
   differentiation in the hippocampus in early acquisition but attenuated
   conditioned responses in the medial frontal cortex in late acquisition.
   In early acquisition, stress reduced the CS+/CS- differentiation in the
   nucleus accumbens in men, but enhanced it in OC women. In late
   acquisition, the same pattern (reduction in men, enhancement in OC
   women) was found in the amygdala as well as in the anterior cingulate.
   Thus, psychosocial stress impaired the neuronal correlates of fear
   learning and expression in men, but facilitated them in OC women. A
   sex-specific modulation of fear conditioning after stress might
   contribute to the divergent prevalence of men and women in developing
   psychiatric disorders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Face recognition is a key component of successful social behaviour.
   However, the computational processes that underpin perceptual learning
   and recognition as faces transition from unfamiliar to familiar are
   poorly understood. In predictive coding, learning occurs through
   prediction errors that update stimulus familiarity, but recognition is a
   function of both stimulus and contextual familiarity. Here we show that
   behavioural responses on a two-option face recognition task can be
   predicted by the level of contextual and facial familiarity in a
   computational model derived from predictive-coding principles. Using
   fMRI, we show that activity in the superior temporal sulcus varies with
   the contextual familiarity in the model, whereas activity in the
   fusiform face area covaries with the prediction error parameter that
   updated facial familiarity. Our results characterize the key
   computations underpinning the perceptual learning of faces, highlighting
   that the functional properties of face-processing areas conform to the
   principles of predictive coding.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Excessive weight gain and obesity are currently among the
   world's major threats to health. Women show significantly higher rates
   of obesity and eating disorders relative to men, but the factors
   contributing to these gender differences remain uncertain. We examined
   the correlations between regional brain responses to images of
   high-calorie versus low-calorie foods and self-reported motivational
   status, including ratings of general appetite, overeating propensity,
   state hunger and desire for specific foods.
   SUBJECTS: Thirty-eight healthy right-handed adults (22 male; 16 female)
   ages 18-45 participated. There were no differences between males and
   females with regard to age or body mass index (BMI).
   RESULTS: Overall, motivational status correlated significantly with
   activation within the amygdala, insula and orbitofrontal cortex.
   Regional activation was then used to predict BMI, an indicator of
   long-term food consumption and energy expenditure. The combined model
   was significant, accounting for 76\% of the variance in BMI for women,
   whereas the same regions were not predictive of weight status among men.
   CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that long-term weight status is related to
   visual responsiveness to calorie-dense food imagery among women.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Abnormalities of cognitive control functions, such as
   conflict and error monitoring, have been theorized to underlie
   obsessive-compulsive symptoms but only recently have been considered a
   potentially relevant psychological construct for understanding other
   forms of anxiety. The authors sought to determine whether these
   cognitive control processes elicit the same abnormalities of brain
   function in patients with pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
   as in those with non-OCD anxiety disorders. Method: Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging of the Multisource Interference Task was used to
   measure conflict- and error-related activations in youth (8-18 years)
   with OCD (n = 21) and non-OCD anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety
   disorder, social phobia, separation anxiety disorder; n = 23) compared
   with age-matched healthy controls (n = 25). Results: There were no
   differences in performance (accuracy, response times) among groups.
   However, a significant effect of group was observed in the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during error processing, driven by decreased
   activation in patients with OCD and those with non-OCD anxiety compared
   with healthy youth. Between patient groups, there was no difference in
   error-related dlPFC activation. Conclusions: Hypoactive dlPFC response
   to errors occurs in pediatric patients with OCD and those with non-OCD
   anxiety. These findings suggest that insufficient error-related
   engagement of the dlPFC associates with anxiety across traditional
   diagnostic boundaries and appears during the early stages of illness.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveThe neural correlates of body checking perceptions in eating
   disorders have not yet been identified. This functional Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging study examined the neuroanatomy involved in altered
   perception and identification with body checking in female with anorexia
   nervosa (AN).
   MethodBrain activation while viewing images depicting normal weight
   individuals involved in either body checking behavior or a neutral
   (noneating disorder) body action, was compared between 20 females with
   AN and 15 matched healthy controls (HC).
   ResultsFemales with AN reported higher anxiety compared to HC during the
   body checking task. The level of anxiety positively correlated with body
   shape concern scores. People with AN had less activation in the medial
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right fusiform gyrus compared to HC in
   response to body checking compared to neutral action images. Body shape
   concern scores correlated negatively with medial PFC activation in AN
   group.
   DiscussionThis preliminary study with modest power suggests that AN
   patients have reduced activation in cortical areas associated with
   self-reference, body action perception, and social cognition in females
   with AN. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2013;

Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging studies have shown similarities and differences in
   prefrontal abnormalities between patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and
   major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the differential
   spatiotemporal characteristics of these abnormalities and their
   association with functional impairment remain unclear. To elucidate
   differential brain pathophysiology in these disorders, we used
   multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure the
   spatiotemporal characteristics of prefrontal activation and investigated
   their association with global functioning levels. The study included 96
   individuals: 32 patients with SZ, 32 patients with MDD, and 32
   demographically matched healthy subjects. During a verbal fluency task,
   the changes in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin ({[}oxy-Hb] and
   {[}deoxy-Hb]) signals over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were measured
   using 52-channel NIRS and compared among the 3 groups. Patients with SZ
   and MDD showed lesser-than-normal {[}oxy-Hb] activation during the task,
   whereas the initial slope of {[}oxy-Hb] activation was steeper for
   patients with MDD than for patients with SZ. The reduced hemodynamic
   response was associated with lower global functioning, and the
   correlative regions were different between the 2 disorders (frontopolar
   PFC in SZ; dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC in MDD). The
   hypofrontality observed in patients with SZ and MDD is consistent with
   the findings of previous neuroimaging studies. Moreover, the
   spatiotemporal characteristics and the functional significance of the
   prefrontal hemodynamic response could differentiate the 2 psychiatric
   disorders. These results suggest a differential brain pathophysiology
   between SZ and MDD. Future large-scale studies are needed to determine
   the practical applicability of these findings for clinical diagnosis and
   evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is characterized by marked impairments in a broad and
   diverse array of social-cognitive domains. Fundamental deficits in the
   ability to visualize and shift to the perspectives of others and the
   neural networks that support this ability may contribute to many of
   these impairments. This study sought to investigate deficits in
   prefrontal brain function and connectivity in patients with
   schizophrenia during visual perspective-taking, and the degree to which
   such deficits contribute to higher-order impairments in social
   cognition. A total of 20 outpatients with schizophrenia and 20 age-and
   gender-matched healthy volunteers completed a basic, visual
   perspective-taking task during functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   along with a behavioral assessment of theory of mind after neuroimaging.
   Results revealed hypoactivity in the medial prefrontal (anterior
   cingulate) and orbitofrontal cortices during perspective-taking trials
   compared to control trials in schizophrenia patients relative to healthy
   controls. In addition, patients demonstrated significant deficits in
   negative connectivity between medial prefrontal and medial-temporal
   regions during perspective-taking, which fully mediated behavioral
   impairments observed in theory of mind. These findings suggest that
   disruptions are present in the most fundamental aspects of
   perspective-taking in schizophrenia, and that these disruptions impact
   higher-order social information processing. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All

Abstract = {{We performed a quantitative meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging
   studies to identify brain areas which are commonly engaged in social and
   visuo-spatial perspective taking. Specifically, we compared brain
   activation for visual-perspective taking to activation for false belief
   reasoning, which requires awareness of perspective to understand
   someone's mistaken belief about the world which contrasts with reality.
   In support of a previous account by Perner and Leekam (2008), our
   meta-analytic conjunction analysis found common activation for false
   belief reasoning and visual perspective taking in the left but not the
   right dorsal temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). This fits with the idea
   that the left dorsal TPJ is responsible for representing different
   perspectives in a domain-general fashion. Moreover, our conjunction
   analysis found activation in the precuneus and the left middle occipital
   gyrus close to the putative Extrastriate Body Area (EBA). The precuneus
   is linked to mental-imagery which may aid in the construction of a
   different perspective. The EBA may be engaged due to imagined
   body-transformations when another's viewpoint is adopted.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Males have been suggested to have advantages over females in reactions
   to child facial resemblance, which reflects the evolutionary pressure on
   males to solve the adaptive paternal uncertainty problem and to identify
   biological offspring. However, previous studies showed inconsistent
   results and the male advantage in child facial resemblance perception,
   as a kin detection mechanism, is still unclear. Here, we investigated
   the behavioral and brain mechanisms underlying the self-resembling faces
   processing and how it interacts with sex and age using event-related
   potential (ERP) technique. The results showed a stable male advantage in
   self-resembling child faces processing, such that males have higher
   detectability to self-resembling child faces than females. For ERP
   results, males showed smaller N2 and larger late positive component
   (LPC) amplitudes for self-resembling child faces, which may reflect
   face-matching and self-referential processing in kin detection,
   respectively. Further source analysis showed that the N2 component and
   LPC were originated from the anterior cingulate cortex and medial
   frontal gyrus, respectively. Our results support the male advantage in
   self-resembling child detection and further indicate that such
   distinctions can be found in both early and late processing stages in
   the brain at different regions.}},

Abstract = {{The misfortunes of enviable individuals are met by observers with
   pleasure whereas those of average, non-enviable individuals elicit pain.
   These responses are mirrored in deservingness judgments, as enviable
   individuals' misfortunes are perceived as deserved and those of
   non-enviable individuals perceived as undeserved. However, the neural
   underpinnings of these deservingness disparities remain unknown. To
   explore this phenomenon, we utilized fMRI to test the hypotheses that
   (A) non-enviable targets' misfortunes would be associated with
   activation of brain regions that mediate empathic responding (pain
   matrix, mentalizing network) and not for enviable targets and (B) that
   activation of those regions would predict decreases in deservingness
   judgments. Supporting our first hypothesis, the misfortunes of
   non-enviable targets (as opposed to good fortunes) were associated with
   activation of the mentalizing network: medial prefrontal cortex,
   posterior cingulate cortex, temporal-parietal junction, and anterior
   temporal lobes. Supporting our second hypothesis, dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex activation from this contrast was negatively correlated with
   subsequent reports of how much the non-enviable target deserved his/her
   misfortune. These findings suggest that non-enviable individuals'
   misfortunes are perceived as unjust due, in part, to the recruitment of
   the mentalizing network.}},

Abstract = {{Rotation of a visual image in mind is associated with a slow posterior
   negative deflection of the event-related potential (ERP), termed
   rotation-related negativity (RRN). Retention of a visual image in
   short-term memory is also associated with a slow posterior negative ERP,
   termed negative slow wave (NSW). We tested whether short-term memory
   retention, indexed by the NSW, contributes to the RRN. ERPs were
   recorded in the same subjects in two tasks, a mental rotation task,
   eliciting the RRN, and a visual short-term memory task, eliciting the
   NSW. Over both right and left parietal scalp, no association was found
   between the NSW and the RRN amplitudes. Furthermore, adjusting for the
   effect of the NSW had no influence on a significant association between
   the RRN amplitude and response time, an index of mental rotation
   performance. Our data indicate that the RRN reflects manipulation of a
   visual image but not its retention in short-term memory. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Background: Little is known about the regions involved in recovery from
   global aphasia in patients with malignant infarction after decompressive
   hemicraniectomy. This study reports a case of brain activation during
   speech perception in a right-handed patient with a massive left
   hemispheric infarction.
   Methods: Decompressive hemicraniectomy was performed in a 20-year old
   woman with space-occupying infarction of the speech dominant hemisphere.
   Complete anterior, middle and part of the posterior cerebral artery
   territories of the left hemisphere, as well as posterior regions of the
   right middle cerebral artery territory, were affected.
   Neuropsychological testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) during speech perception were performed 10 months after stroke.
   Results: The patient was able to walk, go up and down stairs
   independently and perform simple tasks at home. She was also well able
   to match visually and orally presented words with their corresponding
   pictures, despite large bilateral lesions in the posterior regions. fMRI
   revealed strong activation of the left temporo-occipital and
   parieto-occipital areas. In the right hemisphere was observed a small
   area of activation in the posterior part of the superior and middle
   temporal gyrus.
   Conclusions: In aphasic patients, the activation of posterior bilateral
   associative areas might be used to support language perception.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperation is intrinsic to the human ability to work together toward
   common goals, and depends on sensing and reacting to dynamically
   changing relationships between coacting partners. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a paradigm in which an adaptive
   pacing signal simulates a virtual partner, we examined the neural
   substrates underlying dynamic joint action. A single parameter
   controlled the degree to which the virtual partner adapted its behavior
   in relation to participant taps, thus simulating varying degrees of
   cooperativity. Analyses of fMRI data using objective and subjective
   measures of synchronization quality found the relative balance of
   activity in two distinct neural networks to depend on the degree of the
   virtual partners adaptivity. At lower degrees of adaptivity, when the
   virtual partner was easier to synchronize with, cortical midline
   structures were activated in conjunction with premotor areas, suggesting
   a link between the action and socio-affective components of cooperation.
   By contrast, right lateral prefrontal areas associated with central
   executive control processes were recruited during more cognitively
   challenging interactions while synchronizing with an overly adaptive
   virtual partner. Together, the reduced adaptive sensorimotor
   synchronization paradigm and pattern of results illuminate neural
   mechanisms that may underlie the socio-emotional consequences of
   different degrees of entrainment success.}},

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin plays an important role in social cognition.
   One valuable tool to study social cognition in healthy and autistic
   humans in a neuroscientific context is the investigation of gaze toward
   another person. Of importance, it has been demonstrated that pronounced
   amygdala activation could be observed, when participants are confronted
   with direct gaze pictures in an fMRI setting, an effect that can be
   particularly observed in autistic individuals. In the present study, a
   combined pharmacological imaging genetics study has been conducted to
   further investigate the biological basis of direct gaze processing. N =
   55 healthy males were invited to an oxytocin challenge study
   administered while watching direct vs. averted gaze pictures in an fMRI
   setting. In addition, the promoter region of the oxytocin receptor
   (OXTR) gene of the participants was investigated to search for
   individual differences in the recorded BOLD signal. The main result
   revealed that a genetic variation of the OXTR gene (rs401015) modulated
   the right amygdala activity for the fMRI contrast ``direct < averted
   gaze{''} under the influence of the neuropeptide oxytocin. Here,
   carriers of the heterozygous CT variant showed higher activity compared
   to the TT group. The present study highlights the role of individual
   differences in a genetic variant of the OXTR gene for amygdala
   activation during processing of direct gaze pictures after intranasal
   oxytocin administration. In sum, the study shows the importance of
   combining a pharmacological challenge with genetic imaging to better
   understand the biological basis of social cognition.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{49-60}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates neural correlates of music-evoked fear and joy
   with fMRI. Studies on neural correlates of music-evoked fear are scant,
   and there are only a few studies on neural correlates of joy in general.
   Eighteen individuals listened to excerpts of fear-evoking, joy-evoking,
   as well as neutral music and rated their own emotional state in terms of
   valence, arousal, fear, and joy. Results show that BOLD signal intensity
   increased during joy, and decreased during fear (compared to the neutral
   condition) in bilateral auditory cortex (AC) and bilateral superficial
   amygdala (SF). In the right primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b) BOLD
   signals increased during exposure to fear-evoking music. While
   emotion-specific activity in AC increased with increasing duration of
   each trial, SF responded phasically in the beginning of the stimulus,
   and then SF activity declined. Psychophysiological Interaction (PPI)
   analysis revealed extensive emotion-specific functional connectivity of
   AC with insula, cingulate cortex, as well as with visual, and parietal
   attentional structures. These findings show that the auditory cortex
   functions as a central hub of an affective-attentional network that is
   more extensive than previously believed. PPI analyses also showed
   functional connectivity of SF with AC during the joy condition, taken to
   reflect that SF is sensitive to social signals with positive valence.
   During fear music, SF showed functional connectivity with visual cortex
   and area 7 of the superior parietal lobule, taken to reflect increased
   visual alertness and an involuntary shift of attention during the
   perception of auditory signals of danger. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Everyday conversation requires cognitive inference: Neural bases of
   comprehending implicated meanings in conversations}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{61-72}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In ordinary conversations, literal meanings of an utterance are often
   quite different from implicated meanings and the inference about
   implicated meanings is essentially required for successful comprehension
   of the speaker's utterances. Inference of finding implicated meanings is
   based on the listener's assumption that the conversational partner says
   only relevant matters according to the maxim of relevance in Grice's
   theory of conversational implicature. To investigate the neural
   correlates of comprehending implicated meanings under the maxim of
   relevance, a total of 23 participants underwent an fMRI task with a
   series of conversational pairs, each consisting of a question and an
   answer. The experimental paradigm was composed of three conditions:
   explicit answers, moderately implicit answers, and highly implicit
   answers. Participants were asked to decide whether the answer to the
   Yes/No question meant `Yes' or `No'. Longer reaction time was required
   for the highly implicit answers than for the moderately implicit answers
   without affecting the accuracy. The fMRI results show that the left
   anterior temporal lobe, left angular gyrus, and left posterior middle
   temporal gyrus had stronger activation in both moderately and highly
   implicit conditions than in the explicit condition. Comprehension of
   highly implicit answers had increased activations in additional regions
   including the left inferior frontal gyrus, left medial prefrontal
   cortex, left posterior cingulate cortex and right anterior temporal
   lobe. The activation results indicate involvement of these regions in
   the inference process to build coherence between literally irrelevant
   but pragmatically associated utterances under the maxim of relevance.
   Especially, the left anterior temporal lobe showed high sensitivity to
   the level of implicitness and showed increased activation for highly
   versus moderately implicit conditions, which imply its central role in
   inference such as semantic integration. The right hemisphere activation,
   uniquely found in the anterior temporal lobe for highly implicit
   utterances, suggests its competence for integrating distant concepts in
   implied utterances under the relevance principle. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Differential role of the Mentalizing and the Mirror Neuron system in the
   imitation of communicative gestures}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{294-305}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Successful social interaction requires recognising the intention of
   another person's communicative gestures. At a neural level, this process
   may involve neural activity in different systems, such as the
   mentalizing system (MS) and the mirror neuron system (MNS). The aim of
   the present study was to explore the neural correlates of communicative
   gestures during observation and execution of these gestures. Twenty
   participants watched video clips of an actor executing social gestures
   (S), non-social gestures (NS) and meaningless gestures (ML). During fMRI
   data acquisition, participants were asked to observe (0) and
   subsequently to execute (E) one of two tasks: imitate the gesture
   presented (IMI) or perform a motor control task (CT). For the contrast
   IMI > CT we found activations in the core areas of the MNS {[}inferior
   parietal lobule (IPL) and inferior frontal cortex, the posterior part of
   pars opercularis], as well as in areas related to the MS {[}superior
   temporal sulcus (STS) and middle cingulate cortex]. For S > NS, we found
   activations in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), right
   superior frontal cortex and middle cingulate cortex. The interaction of
   stimulus condition (S vs NS) and task (IMI vs CT) revealed activation in
   the right IPL. For the interaction between observation vs execution (O
   vs E), task (IMI vs CT) and stimulus condition (S vs NS) we found
   activation in the right mOFC. Our data suggest that imitation is
   differentially processed in the MNS as well as in the MS. The activation
   in IPL is enhanced during the processing of social gestures most likely
   due to their communicative intention. The activation of IPL together
   with medial frontal areas may contribute to mentalizing processes. The
   interaction in the mOFC suggests an involvement of self-referential
   processes in the processing of social gesture. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The visual cortex is sensitive to emotional stimuli. This sensitivity is
   typically assumed to arise when amygdala modulates visual cortex via
   backwards connections. Using human fMRI, we compared dynamic causal
   connectivity models of sensitivity with fearful faces. This model
   comparison tested whether amygdala modulates distinct cortical areas,
   depending on dynamic or static face presentation. The ventral temporal
   fusiform face area showed sensitivity to fearful expressions in static
   faces. However, for dynamic faces, we found fear sensitivity in dorsal
   motion-sensitive areas within hMT+/V5 and superior temporal sulcus. The
   model with the greatest evidence included connections modulated by
   dynamic and static fear from amygdala to dorsal and ventral temporal
   areas, respectively. According to this functional architecture, amygdala
   could enhance encoding of fearful expression movements from video and
   the form of fearful expressions from static images. The amygdala may
   therefore optimize visual encoding of socially charged and salient
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggested that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
   might be associated with dysfunctional reward processing. At present,
   little is known about the neural mechanisms of reward-related processing
   during a charitable donation task in trauma survivors who do not go on
   to develop PTSD. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   investigate the neural basis of charitable donation in non-PTSD
   survivors of the Sichuan earthquake. Results showed that activations in
   the striatum of trauma survivors were reduced in both the low donation
   (donated a small amount to the Red Cross) and the high donation
   conditions (donated a large amount to the Red Cross) compared with the
   healthy controls. Furthermore, the trauma survivors also exhibited less
   activity in the insula than the healthy controls in the high donation
   condition. These findings suggest that abnormal reward-related
   activations might be associated with dysfunctions in the reward pathway
   of trauma survivors. Also, we discuss the possibility that traumatic
   experiences attenuate the reactivity of reward-related brain areas to
   positive emotions (as induced by advantageous donations). (C) 2013

Abstract = {{How does witnessing a hateful person in pain compare to witnessing a
   likable person in pain? The current study compared the brain bases for
   how we perceive likable people in pain with those of viewing hateful
   people in pain. While social bonds are built through sharing the plight
   and pain of others in the name of empathy, viewing a hateful person in
   pain also has many potential ramifications. In this functional Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, Caucasian Jewish male participants
   viewed videos of (1) disliked, hateful, anti-Semitic individuals, and
   (2) liked, non-hateful, tolerant individuals in pain. The results showed
   that, compared with viewing liked people, viewing hateful people in pain
   elicited increased responses in regions associated with observation of
   physical pain (the insular cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
   and the somatosensory cortex), reward processing (the striatum), and
   frontal regions associated with emotion regulation. Functional
   connectivity analyses revealed connections between seed regions in the
   left ACC and right insular cortex with reward regions, the amygdala, and
   frontal regions associated with emotion regulation. These data indicate
   that regions of the brain active while viewing someone in pain may be
   more active in response to the danger or threat posed by witnessing the
   pain of a hateful individual more so than the desire to empathize with a
   likable person's pain.}},

Abstract = {{The feeling of voluntary control and awareness of movement is
   fundamental to our notions of selfhood and responsibility for actions,
   yet can be lost in neuropsychiatric syndromes (e. g. delusions of
   control, non-epileptic seizures) and culturally influenced dissociative
   states (e. g. attributions of spirit possession). The brain processes
   involved remain poorly understood. We used suggestion and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate loss of control and
   awareness of right hand movements in 15 highly hypnotically suggestible
   subjects. Loss of perceived control of movements was associated with
   reduced connectivity between supplementary motor area (SMA) and motor
   regions. Reduced awareness of involuntary movements was associated with
   less activation in parietal cortices (BA 7, BA 40) and insula.
   Collectively these results suggest that the sense of voluntary control
   of movement may critically depend on the functional coupling of SMA with
   motor systems, and provide a potential neural basis for the narrowing of
   awareness reported in pathological and culturally influenced
   dissociative phenomena.}},

   Trait Aggression}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Antisocial behavior and aggression are prominent symptoms in several
   psychiatric disorders including antisocial personality disorder. An
   established precursor to aggression is a frustrating event, which can
   elicit anger or exasperation, thereby prompting aggressive responses.
   While some studies have investigated the neural correlates of
   frustration and aggression, examination of their relation to trait
   aggression in healthy populations are rare. Based on a screening of 550
   males, we formed two extreme groups, one including individuals reporting
   high (n=21) and one reporting low (n=18) trait aggression. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3T, all participants
   were put through a frustration task comprising unsolvable anagrams of
   German nouns. Despite similar behavioral performance, males with high
   trait aggression reported higher ratings of negative affect and anger
   after the frustration task. Moreover, they showed relatively decreased
   activation in the frontal brain regions and the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) as well as relatively less amygdala activation
   in response to frustration. Our findings indicate distinct frontal and
   limbic processing mechanisms following frustration modulated by trait
   aggression. In response to a frustrating event, HA individuals show some
   of the personality characteristics and neural processing patterns
   observed in abnormally aggressive populations. Highlighting the impact
   of aggressive traits on the behavioral and neural responses to
   frustration in non-psychiatric extreme groups can facilitate further
   characterization of neural dysfunctions underlying psychiatric disorders
   that involve abnormal frustration processing and aggression.}},

Title = {{Identification of neural connectivity signatures of autism using machine
   learning}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{Alterations in interregional neural connectivity have been suggested as
   a signature of the pathobiology of autism. There have been many reports
   of functional and anatomical connectivity being altered while
   individuals with autism are engaged in complex cognitive and social
   tasks. Although disrupted instantaneous correlation between cortical
   regions observed from functional MRI is considered to be an explanatory
   model for autism, the causal influence of a brain area on another
   (effective connectivity) is a vital link missing in these studies. The
   current study focuses on addressing this in an fMRI study of
   Theory-of-Mind (ToM) in 15 high-functioning adolescents and adults with
   autism and 15 typically developing control participants. Participants
   viewed a series of comic strip vignettes in the MRI scanner and were
   asked to choose the most logical end to the story from three
   alternatives, separately for trials involving physical and intentional
   causality. The mean time series, extracted from 18 activated regions of
   interest, were processed using a multivariate autoregressive model
   (MVAR) to obtain the causality matrices for each of the 30 participants.
   These causal connectivity weights, along with assessment scores,
   functional connectivity values, and fractional anisotropy obtained from
   DTI data for each participant, were submitted to a recursive cluster
   elimination based support vector machine classifier to determine the
   accuracy with which the classifier can predict a novel participant's
   group membership (autism or control). We found a maximum classification
   accuracy of 95.9\% with 19 features which had the highest discriminative
   ability between the groups. All of the 19 features were effective
   connectivity paths, indicating that causal information may be critical
   in discriminating between autism and control groups. These effective
   connectivity paths were also found to be significantly greater in
   controls as compared to ASD participants and consisted predominantly of
   outputs from the fusiform face area and middle temporal gyrus indicating
   impaired connectivity in ASD participants, particularly in the social
   brain areas. These findings collectively point toward the fact that
   alterations in causal connectivity in the brain in ASD could serve as a
   potential non-invasive neuroimaging signature for autism.}},

Title = {{Non-verbal emotion communication training induces specific changes in
   brain function and structure}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 17}},
Abstract = {{The perception of emotional cues from voice and face is essential for
   social interaction. However, this process is altered in various
   psychiatric conditions along with impaired social functioning. Emotion
   communication trainings have been demonstrated to improve social
   interaction in healthy individuals and to reduce emotional communication
   deficits in psychiatric patients. Here, we investigated the impact of a
   non-verbal emotion communication training (NECT) on cerebral activation
   and brain structure in a controlled and combined functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and voxel-based morphometry study.
   NECT-specific reductions in brain activity occurred in a distributed set
   of brain regions including face and voice processing regions as well as
   emotion processing- and motor-related regions presumably reflecting
   training-induced familiarization with the evaluation of face/voice
   stimuli. Training-induced changes in non-verbal emotion sensitivity at
   the behavioral level and the respective cerebral activation patterns
   were correlated in the face-selective cortical areas in the posterior
   superior temporal sulcus and fusiform gyrus for valence ratings and in
   the temporal pole, lateral prefrontal cortex and midbrain/thalamus for
   the response times. A NECT-induced increase in gray matter (GM) volume
   was observed in the fusiform face area. Thus, NECT induces both
   functional and structural plasticity in the face processing system as
   well as functional plasticity in the emotion perception and evaluation
   system. We propose that functional alterations are presumably related to
   changes in sensory tuning in the decoding of emotional expressions.
   Taken together, these findings highlight that the present experimental
   design may serve as a valuable tool to investigate the altered
   behavioral and neuronal processing of emotional cues in psychiatric
   disorders as well as the impact of therapeutic interventions on brain
   function and structure.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR) mice display prominent behavioural deficits analogous
   to the defining symptoms of autism, a feature that has prompted a
   widespread use of the model in preclinical autism research. Because
   neuro-behavioural traits are described with respect to reference
   populations, multiple investigators have examined and described the
   behaviour of BTBR mice against that exhibited by C57BL/6J (B6), a mouse
   line characterised by high sociability and low self-grooming. In an
   attempt to probe the translational relevance of this comparison for
   autism research, we used Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to map in both
   strain multiple morpho-anatomical and functional neuroimaging readouts
   that have been extensively used in patient populations. Diffusion tensor
   tractography confirmed previous reports of callosal agenesis and lack of
   hippocampal commissure in BTBR mice, and revealed a concomitant
   rostro-caudal reorganisation of major cortical white matter bundles.
   Intact inter-hemispheric tracts were found in the anterior commissure,
   ventro-medial thalamus, and in a strain-specific white matter formation
   located above the third ventricle. BTBR also exhibited decreased
   fronto-cortical, occipital and thalamic gray matter volume and
   widespread reductions in cortical thickness with respect to control B6
   mice. Foci of increased gray matter volume and thickness were observed
   in the medial prefrontal and insular cortex. Mapping of resting-state
   brain activity using cerebral blood volume weighted fMRI revealed
   reduced cortico-thalamic function together with foci of increased
   activity in the hypothalamus and dorsal hippocampus of BTBR mice.
   Collectively, our results show pronounced functional and structural
   abnormalities in the brain of BTBR mice with respect to control B6 mice.
   The large and widespread white and gray matter abnormalities observed do
   not appear to be representative of the neuroanatomical alterations
   typically observed in autistic patients. The presence of reduced
   fronto-cortical metabolism is of potential translational relevance, as
   this feature recapitulates previously-reported clinical observations.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Women often complain that their partners are not romantic enough. This
   raises the question: how romance is recognized and evaluated in a love
   relationship? However, there has been essentially no empirical research
   bearing on this issue. The present set of studies examined possible
   gender differences in perceptions of romance and the associated neural
   mechanisms in Chinese college students. In Study 1, 303 participants
   (198 women, 105 men) were administrated a questionnaire consisting of 60
   sentences and required to rate the romance level of each sentence.
   Results showed higher rating scores in males than females for low
   romance items, but not for high or medium romance items. In Study 2, 69
   participants (37 women, 32 men) were recruited to judge the degree of
   romance in sentences presented on a computer screen one by one. Compared
   with females, males again showed higher scores and responded more slowly
   only to low romance items. In Study 3, 36 participants (18 women, 18
   men) currently in love with someone were scanned with functional MRI
   while they did the romance judgment task from Study 2. Compared with
   females, greater brain activation was found for males in the frontal
   lobe, precentral gyrus, precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus for low
   romance items. The results provide the first piece of evidence for
   gender differences in romance perception, suggesting enhanced cognitive
   processing in males when evaluating the degree of romance in romantic

Abstract = {{In Bayesian brain theories, hierarchically related prediction errors
   (PEs) play a central role for predicting sensory inputs and inferring
   their underlying causes, e.g., the probabilistic structure of the
   environment and its volatility. Notably, PEs at different hierarchical
   levels may be encoded by different neuromodulatory transmitters. Here,
   we tested this possibility in computational fMRI studies of audio-visual
   learning. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we found that low-level
   PEs about visual stimulus outcome were reflected by widespread activity
   in visual and supra-modal areas but also in the midbrain. In contrast,
   high-level PEs about stimulus probabilities were encoded by the basal
   forebrain. These findings were replicated in two groups of healthy
   volunteers. While our fMRI measures do not reveal the exact neuron types
   activated in midbrain and basal forebrain, they suggest a dichotomy
   between neuromodulatory systems, linking dopamine to low-level PEs about
   stimulus outcome and acetylcholine to more abstract PEs about stimulus
   probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{A core goal of human connectomics is to characterise the neural pathways
   that underlie brain function. This can be largely achieved noninvasively
   by inferring white matter connectivity using diffusion MRI data.
   However, there are challenges. First, diffusion tractography is blind to
   directed connections, or whether a connection is expressed functionally.
   Second, we need to be able to go beyond the characterization of
   anatomical pathways, to understand distributed brain function that
   results from them. In particular, we need to characterise effective
   connectivity using functional imaging modalities, such as FMRI and
   M/EEG, to understand its context-sensitivity (e.g., modulation by task),
   and how it changes with synaptic plasticity. Here, we consider the
   critical role that biophysical network models have to play in meeting
   these challenges, by providing a principled way to conciliate
   information from anatomical and functional data. They also provide
   biophysically meaningful parameters, through which we can better
   understand brain function. In a translational setting, well-validated
   models may shed light on the mechanisms of individual disease processes.

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{553}},
Pages = {{159-164}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Despite ample study of conceptual and emotional information processing
   in language, it remains unclear whether these two types of processing
   rely on different neural mechanisms. In the present study, the
   processing of semantic and emotional information was directly compared
   in 24 participants undergoing electroencephalograms (EEGs). Participants
   read 120 scenarios ending in three ways (affectively and semantically
   congruent, affectively incongruent, and semantically incongruent) and
   were asked to judge the appropriateness of the last word within the
   context. The data were analyzed using both event-related potentials
   (ERPs) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) analysis. In
   addition to the similar N400 effects evoked by both emotional and
   conceptual incongruity, conceptual incongruity elicited a larger theta
   power increase, while emotional incongruity induced a gamma band power
   increase, compared with the congruent condition. The different
   oscillatory patterns suggest that emotional and conceptual information
   in language processing may rely on different neural mechanisms, even
   though both types of processing produced a similar N400 effect. (C) 2013

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1534}},

Abstract = {{Background: Empathy relates to the ability to share the emotions and
   understand the intentions and emotions of the other. Although it has
   been suggested that women have superior empathic abilities as compared
   to men, it is unknown whether it is the gender or the sexual preference
   of the individual that affects empathy. Given that sexual attraction has
   been reported to affect social behavior, the present study explored the
   possibility that sexual orientation affects behavioral measures of
   empathy as well as empathy related activations.
   Methods: Fifty two heterosexual and homosexual women and men were
   scanned while performing an emotional judgment task involving emotional
   understanding of a protagonist.
   Results: The behavioral and neuroimaging results indicate that empathy
   is related to the gender as well as the sexual preference of the
   participant. Individuals sexually attracted to men (heterosexual women
   and homosexual men) showed greater empathy than subjects attracted to
   women (heterosexual men and homosexual women). Furthermore, brain
   imaging data reveal that regions within the temporo-parietal junction
   (TPJ), showed sensitivity to the sexual orientation of the individual,
   such that it was activated more in subjects attracted to men than in
   subjects attracted to women while evaluating the emotional state of the
   other. Moreover, the activation in the TPJ was found to be correlated
   with the degree to which subjects were empathizing.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that individual differences in
   empathy are related to the gender as well as the sexual orientation of
   the subject. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Although several studies have investigated the neural mechanism of
   social comparison, it remains unclear whether and how cultural
   membership, particularly independent versus interdependent cultures, may
   differentially shape the neural processes underlying social comparison.
   In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we
   examined the behaviors and neural response patterns of Korean (i.e.,
   interdependent culture) and American (i.e., independent culture)
   participants while performing a financial gambling task simultaneously
   and independently with a partner. Upon seeing the partner's income,
   greater modulation of the activity in the ventral striatum (VS) and the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) by relative gain was observed in
   Korean than American participants, suggesting greater sensitivity of
   Koreans toward social comparison. The strength of functional
   connectivity between the VS and the vmPFC predicted individual
   variability in the degree to which participants' decisions were affected
   by relative incomes. Additional model-based fMRI analysis further
   confirmed the primary role of the vmPFC in biasing decisions based on
   relative incomes. In summary, the present study provides the first
   neural evidence for decision biases due to social comparison and their
   individual and cultural variations.}},

Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Much of everyday mental life involves information that we cannot
   currently perceive directly, from contemplating the strengths of
   friendships to reasoning about the contents of other minds. Despite
   their primacy to everyday human functioning, and in particular, to human
   sociality, the mechanisms that support abstract thought are poorly
   understood. An explanatory framework that has gained traction recently
   in cognitive neuroscience is exaptation, or the re-purposing of
   evolutionarily old circuitry to carryout new functions. We argue for the
   utility of applying this concept to social cognition. Convergent
   behavioral and neuroscientific evidence suggests that humans co-opt
   mechanisms originally devoted to spatial perception for more abstract
   domains of cognition (e.g., temporal reasoning). Preliminary evidence
   suggests that some aspects of social cognitional so involve the
   exaptation of substrates originally evolved for processing physical
   space. We discuss the potential for future work to test more directly if
   cortical substrates for spatial processing were exapted for social
   cognition, and in so doing, to improve our understanding of how humans
   evolved mechanisms for navigating an exceptionally complex social world.}},

Abstract = {{Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can demonstrate difficulties
   with inhibiting inappropriate social responses. Presently, little
   research has utilized socially relevant stimuli to explore the
   modulatory effects of emotion on cognitive control in this population.
   To assess neural mechanisms of inhibiting social stimuli, we presented
   images of happy or sad facial expressions in a Go/NoGo task to
   unrnedicated adults with ASD and to controls during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Groups did not differ on behavioral measures.
   Brain activation in response to NoGo vs. Go trials revealed differing
   regional patterns of activation within groups. Controls recruited brain
   regions involved in inhibition (dorsal- {[}DLPFC] and ventro-lateral
   prefrontal cortices {[}VLPFC], anterior cingulate cortex {[}ACC]),
   response suppression (parietal lobe), interoceptive awareness (insula),
   and also the fusiform and middle temporal gyri. Adults with ASD only
   recruited the VLPFC and right fusiform gyrus, and weakly activated the
   ACC and insula. Between-group comparisons indicated that controls
   activated the DLPFC, while adults with ASD relied on the VLPFC and the
   fusiform gyrus to inhibit responses. Adults with ASD may have relied
   more on visual association cortex, possibly as a means of recruiting
   additional neural processes that could act as a compensatory mechanism.

   situations remain poorly understood, and their neural counterparts have
   not been explored so far. A dominant idea is that the motivation
   provided by the social context is reducible to the personal utility of
   effort production, which decreases in collaboration and increases in
   competition. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned
   human participants while they produced a physical effort in a
   collaborative or competitive context. We found that motivation was
   indeed primarily driven by personal utility, which was reflected in
   brain regions devoted to reward processing (the ventral basal ganglia).
   However, subjects who departed from utility maximization, working more
   in collaborative situations, showed greater functional activation and
   anatomical volume in a brain region implicated previously in social
   cognition (the temporoparietal junction). Therefore, this region might
   mediate a purely pro-social motivation to produce greater effort in the
   context of collaboration. More generally, our findings suggest that the
   individual propensity to invest energy in collaborative work might have
   an identifiable counterpart in the brain functional architecture.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the role of the prefrontal areas in recognizing hand
   actions performed in social contexts. We used video clips depicting the
   interaction between two individuals: one person (requester) requested
   the other person to pass one of two objects. The other person
   (responder) then passed the object that was congruent to the request in
   the congruent condition or incongruent in the incongruent condition.
   Both requester and responder appeared on screen in the two-person
   condition and only the responder appeared in the one-person condition.
   Participants were required to observe the clips and to judge whether the
   responder's actions were congruent or incongruent. Functional MRI showed
   the incongruency effect in the prefrontal cortex. In particular, the
   brain areas including the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   showed the interaction effect; the magnitude of activation in the
   incongruent condition was significantly higher than that in the
   congruent condition, but this difference was found only in the
   two-person condition. These results suggest that the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex play an important role in the detection of
   incongruency between the requester's request and the responder's action
   depending on social contexts. (C) 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical

Abstract = {{Typical adolescent behaviour such as increased risk-taking and
   novelty-seeking is probably related to developmental changes in the
   brain reward system. This functional MRI study investigated how brain
   activation related to two components of reward processing (Reward
   Anticipation and Reward Outcome) changes with age in a sample of 39
   children, adolescents and young adults aged 10-25. Our data revealed
   age-related changes in brain activity during both components of reward
   processing. Activation related to Reward Anticipation increased with
   age, while activation related to Reward Outcome decreased in various
   regions of the reward network. This shift from outcome to anticipation
   was confirmed by subsequent analyses showing positive correlations
   between age and the difference in activation between Reward Anticipation
   and Reward Outcome. The shift was predominantly present in striatal
   regions and was accompanied by a significant effect of age on behaviour,
   with older participants showing more response speeding on potentially
   rewarding trials than younger participants. This study provides evidence
   for functional changes in the reward system which may underlie typical
   adolescent behaviour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Economic games are now routinely used to characterize human cognition
   across multiple dimensions. These games allow for effective
   computational modeling of mental function because they typically come
   equipped with notions of optimal play, which provide quantitatively
   prescribed target functions that can be tracked throughout an
   experiment. The combination of these games, computational models, and
   neuroimaging tools open up the possibility for new ways to characterize
   normal cognition and associated brain function. We propose that these
   tools may also be used to characterize mental dysfunction, such as that
   found in a range of psychiatric illnesses. We describe early efforts
   using a multi-round trust game to probe brain responses associated with
   healthy social exchange and review how this game has provided a novel
   and useful characterization of autism spectrum disorder. Lastly, we use
   the multi-round trust game as an example to discuss how these kinds of
   games could produce novel bases for representing healthy behavior and
   brain function and thus provide objectively identifiable subtypes within
   a broad spectrum of mental function. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

   social anxiety disorder}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD) has been associated with hyper-reactivity
   in limbic brain regions like the amygdala, both during symptom
   provocation and emotional face processing tasks. In this functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study we sought to examine brain regions
   implicated in emotional face processing, and the connectivity between
   them, in patients with SAD (n = 14) compared with healthy controls (n =
   12). We furthermore aimed to relate brain reactivity and connectivity to
   self-reported social anxiety symptom severity. SAD patients exhibited
   hyper-reactivity in the bilateral fusiform gyrus in response to fearful
   faces, as well as greater connectivity between the fusiform gyrus and
   amygdala, and decreased connectivity between the fusiform gyrus and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Within the SAD group, social anxiety
   severity correlated positively with amygdala reactivity to emotional
   faces, amygdala-fusiform connectivity and connectivity between the
   amygdala and superior temporal sulcus (STS). These findings point to a
   pivotal role for the fusiform gyrus in SAD neuropathology, and further
   suggest that altered amygdala-fusiform and amygdala-STS connectivity
   could underlie previous findings of aberrant socio-emotional information
   processing in this anxiety disorder.}},

Title = {{Understanding Consumer Tradeoffs Between Form and Function Through
   Metaconjoint and Cognitive Neuroscience Analyses}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This work investigates how consumers make preference judgments when
   taking into account both product form and function. In prior work, where
   aesthetic preference is quantified using visual conjoint methods,
   aesthetic preference and functional preference were handled separately.
   Here, we introduce a new methodology, metaconjoint analysis, for testing
   the hypothesis that when consumers make decisions taking into account
   both a product's form and its function they employ a more complex
   decision-making strategy than when basing their decisions on form or
   function alone. We anticipate that this strategy will involve both
   analytical and emotional processes. When compared with participant
   ratings of form and function combinations across 28 subjects, the
   metaconjoint model is shown to have a correlation that was not
   statistically different from an additive model of form and function.
   However, unlike the additive model, the metaconjoint model gave
   additional information about how participants make tradeoffs between
   form and function. Next, we developed a novel paradigm using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine what parts of the brain
   are primarily involved with a given tradeoff between form and function.
   While in the scanner, study participants were asked to make decisions in
   trials where only form varied, where only function varied, and where
   both form and function varied. Results from 14 participants suggest that
   choices based on products that vary in both form and function involve
   some unique and some common brain networks as compared to choices based
   on form or function alone; notably, emotion-related regions are
   activated during these complex decisions where form and function are in
   conflict. These results are consistent with the inclusion of emotion in
   decision-making with regards to product choice and demonstrate the
   feasibility of using fMRI to address questions about the mental
   processes underlying consumer decisions. Studying preference decisions
   together with their accompanying neurological activity will give
   engineers and designers greater insight into the consumer
   decision-making process.}},

Abstract = {{Joint attention behaviors include initiating one's own and responding to
   another's bid for joint attention to an object, person, or topic. Joint
   attention abilities in autism are pervasively atypical, correlate with
   development of language and social abilities, and discriminate children
   with autism from other developmental disorders. Despite the importance
   of these behaviors, the neural correlates of joint attention in
   individuals with autism remain unclear. This paucity of data is likely
   due to the inherent challenge of acquiring data during a real-time
   social interaction. We used a novel experimental set-up in which
   participants engaged with an experimenter in an interactive face-to-face
   joint attention game during fMRI data acquisition. Both initiating and
   responding to joint attention behaviors were examined as well as a solo
   attention (SA) control condition. Participants included adults with
   autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (n = 13), a mean age- and sex-matched
   neurotypical group (n = 14), and a separate group of neurotypical adults
   (n = 22). Significant differences were found between groups within
   social-cognitive brain regions, including dorsal medial prefrontal
   cortex (dMPFC) and right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS),
   during the RJA as compared to SA conditions. Region-of-interest analyses
   revealed a lack of signal differentiation between joint attention and
   control conditions within left pSTS and dMPFC in individuals with ASD.
   Within the pSTS, this lack of differentiation was characterized by
   reduced activation during joint attention and relative hyper-activation
   during SA. These findings suggest a possible failure of developmental
   neural specialization within the STS and dMPFC to joint attention in
   ASD. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2511-2523, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   control faces during a perceptual task reflect their learned social
   valence. Support vector classification scores revealed a
   learning-related increase in neural discrimination of social status in
   anterior insula and anterior cingulate regions, which was mainly driven
   by includer faces becoming distinguishable from excluder and control
   faces. Thus, face-evoked responses in anterior insula and anterior
   cing-ulate cortex contain fine-grained information shaped by prior
   social interactions that allow for categorisation of faces according to
   their learned social status. These lasting traces of social experience
   in cortical areas important for emotional and social processing could
   provide a substrate of how social inclusion shapes future behaviour and
   promotes cooperative interactions between individuals. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Humans are more efficient when performing actions towards objects
   presented in the lower visual field (VF) than in the upper VF. The
   present study used slow event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to examine whether human brain areas implicated in action
   would show such VF preferences. Participants were asked to fixate one of
   four different positions allowing objects to be presented in the upper
   left, upper right, lower left or lower right VF. In some trials they
   reached to grasp the object with the right hand while in others they
   passively viewed the object. Crucially, by manipulating the fixation
   position, rather than the position of the objects, the biomechanics of
   the movements did not differ across conditions. The superior
   parieto-occipital cortex (SPOC) and the left precuneus, brain areas
   implicated in the control of reaching, were significantly more activated
   when participants grasped objects presented in the lower VF relative to
   the upper VF. Importantly, no such VF preferences were observed in these
   regions during passive viewing. This finding fits well with evidence
   from the macaque neurophysiology that neurons within visuomotor regions
   over-represent the lower VF relative to the upper VF and indicate that
   the neural responses within these regions may reflect a functional lower
   VF advantage during visually-guided actions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An attentional bias to threat has been causally related to anxiety.
   Recent research has linked nonconscious attentional bias to threat with
   variability in the integrity of the amygdala anterior cingulate pathway,
   which sheds light on the neuroanatomical basis for a behavioral
   precursor to anxiety. However, the extent to which structural
   variability in amygdala anterior cing-ulate integrity relates to the
   functional connectivity within this pathway and how such functional
   connectivity may relate to attention bias behavior, remain critical
   missing pieces of the puzzle. In 15 individuals we measured the
   structural integrity of the amygdala prefrontal pathway with diffusion
   tensor-weighted MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), amygdala-seeded
   intrinsic functional connectivity to the anterior cingulate, and
   attentional bias toward backward masked fearful faces with a dotprobe
   task. We found that greater biases in attention to threat predicted
   greater levels of uncinate fasciculus integrity, greater positive
   amygdala anterior cingulate functional connectivity, and greater
   amygdala coupling with a broader social perception network including the
   superior temporal sulcus, tempoparietal junction (TPJ), and
   somatosensory cortex. Additionally, greater levels of uncinate
   fasciculus integrity correlated with greater levels of amygdala anterior
   cing-ulate intrinsic functional connectivity. Thus, high bias
   individuals displayed a heightened degree of amygdala anterior cingulate
   connectivity during basal conditions, which we believe predisposes these
   individuals to focus their attention on signals of threat within their
   environment. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Several theories suggest that people do not represent race when it does
   not signify group boundaries. However, race is often associated with
   visually salient differences in skin tone and facial features. In this
   study, we investigated whether race could be decoded from distributed
   patterns of neural activity in the fusiform gyri and early visual cortex
   when visual features that often covary with race were orthogonal to
   group membership. To this end, we used multivariate pattern analysis to
   examine an fMRI dataset that was collected while participants assigned
   to mixed-race groups categorized own-race and other-race faces as
   belonging to their newly assigned group. Whereas conventional univariate
   analyses provided no evidence of race-based responses in the fusiform
   gyri or early visual cortex, multivariate pattern analysis suggested
   that race was represented within these regions. Moreover, race was
   represented in the fusiform gyri to a greater extent than early visual
   cortex, suggesting that the fusiform gyri results do not merely reflect
   low-level perceptual information (e.g. color, contrast) from early
   visual cortex. These findings indicate that patterns of activation
   within specific regions of the visual cortex may represent race even
   when overall activation in these regions is not driven by racial
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Complex social emotions involve both abstract cognitions and bodily
   sensations, and individuals may differ on their relative reliance on
   these. We hypothesized that individuals' descriptions of their feelings
   during a semi-structured emotion induction interview would reveal two
   distinct psychological styles-a more abstract, cognitive style and a
   more body-based, affective style-and that these would be associated with
   somatosensory neural activity. We examined 28 participants' open-ended
   verbal responses to admiration- and compassion-provoking narratives in
   an interview and BOLD activity to the same narratives during subsequent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Consistent with
   hypotheses, individuals' affective and cognitive word use were stable
   across emotion conditions, negatively correlated and unrelated to
   reported emotion strength in the scanner. Greater use of affective
   relative to cognitive words predicted more activation in SI, SII, middle
   anterior cingulate cortex and insula during emotion trials. The results
   suggest that individuals' verbal descriptions of their feelings reflect
   differential recruitment of neural regions supporting physical body
   awareness. Although somatosensation has long been recognized as an
   important component of emotion processing, these results offer `proof of
   concept' that individual differences in open-ended speech reflect
   different processing styles at the neurobiological level. This study
   also demonstrates SI involvement during social emotional experience.}},

Abstract = {{Hemispheric lateralization of hedonic evaluation ('liking') and

   brain damage restricted to the BG-I of the right (n = 5) or left (n = 5)
   hemisphere, and 26 healthy participants matched on age, sex and
   intelligence quotient were tested on positively and negatively valenced
   pictures drawn from varied stimulus categories (Vijayaraghavan et al.,
   2008). Liking was assessed with explicit ratings of pleasantness using a
   nine-point Likert scale. Wanting was quantified as the amount of work
   (via repeated keypresses) that participants expended to increase
   (approach) or decrease (withdraw) viewing time. Right-lesion patients
   showed abnormally low viewing times and liking ratings for positive
   images. For a subset of positive images depicting sexual content,
   right-lesion patients exhibited active withdrawal, while the other two
   groups approached such stimuli. These results suggest that the right
   basal ganglia-insula complex plays a greater role than the left in
   supporting hedonic evaluation and motivational approach to positively
   valenced stimuli. The finding that active avoidance of stimuli that were

Abstract = {{Rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) plays a central role in the
   pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). As we reported in
   our previous study (Wagner et al., 2006), patients with MDD were
   characterized by an inability to deactivate this region during cognitive
   processing leading to a compensatory prefrontal hyperactivation. This
   hyperactivation in rACC may be related to a deficient inhibitory control
   of negative self-referential processes, which in turn may interfere with
   cognitive control task execution and the underlying fronto-cingulate
   network activation. To test this assumption, a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study was conducted in 34 healthy subjects. Univariate
   and functional connectivity analyses in statistical parametric mapping
   software 8 were used. Self-referential stimuli and the Stroop task were
   presented in an event-related design. As hypothesized, rACC was
   specifically engaged during negative self-referential processing (SRP)
   and was significantly related to the degree of depressive symptoms in
   participants. BOLD signal in rACC showed increased valence-dependent
   (negative vs neutral SRP) interaction with BOLD signal in prefrontal and
   dorsal anterior cingulate regions during Stroop task performance. This
   result provides strong support for the notion that enhanced rACC
   interacts with brain regions involved in cognitive control processes and
   substantiates our previous interpretation of increased rACC and
   prefrontal activation in patients during Stroop task.}},

Abstract = {{The monitoring and regulation of one's own physiological reactions and
   cardioregulatory abnormalities are central to the aetiology and
   maintenance of social anxiety disorder (SAD). We therefore explored the
   neural correspondences of these heart rate alterations.
   21 patients with SAD and 21 matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent 3
   T-fMRI scanning. Simultaneously, high-frequency heart rate variability
   (HF-HRV) was acquired during a short-term resting period and an implicit
   emotional face-matching task.
   Compared to HCs, patients with SAD reported increased self-focused
   attention while being less accurate in estimating their heartbeats.
   Physiologically, they showed less HF-HRV at rest and during task. Across
   groups, HF-HRV at rest correlated positively with activation in visual
   face-processing areas. The right caudate nucleus showed an interaction
   of group and cardioregulation: Activation in this region was positively
   correlated in patients with SAD but negatively in HCs. We conclude that
   cardioregulation is altered in SAD on the subjective, physiological, and
   brain level. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit exaggerated
   brain responses to emotionally negative stimuli. Identifying the neural
   correlates of emotion regulation in these subjects is important for
   elucidating the neural circuitry involved in emotional dysfunction. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the functional connectivity between
   the areas activated during emotional processing of negative stimuli in a
   sample of individuals affected by PTSD compared to a group of healthy
   subjects. Ten subjects with PTSD (who survived the L'Aquila 2009
   earthquake) and ten healthy controls underwent fMRI during which the
   participants observed 80 images: 40 pictures with negative emotional
   valence and 40 neutral (scrambled) stimuli. A higher activation was
   found in the left posterior (LP) insula for PTSD group and in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) for the healthy group. Two sets
   of Granger causality modeling analyses were performed to examine the
   directed influence from LP-insula and vmPFC to other brain regions.
   Activity in the vmPFC in the healthy group while observing negative
   stimuli predicted activity in several subcortical regions and insula,
   while in the PTSD group the LP-insula exerted a positive directed
   influence on several cortical regions. The hyperactivation in PTSD
   subjects of subcortical areas such as the insula would underlie the
   emotional, social, and relational difficulties of PTSD patients.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for social anxiety
   disorder (SAD) is thought to enhance cognitive reappraisal in patients
   with SAD. Such improvements should be evident in cognitive
   reappraisal-related prefrontal cortex responses.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether CBT for SAD modifies cognitive
   reappraisal-related prefrontal cortex neural signal magnitude and timing
   when implementing cognitive reappraisal with negative self-beliefs.
   DESIGN Randomized clinical trial of CBT for SAD vs wait-list control
   group during a study that enrolled patients from 2007 to 2010.
   SETTING University psychology department.
   PARTICIPANTS Seventy-five patients with generalized SAD randomly
   assigned to CBT or wait list.
   INTERVENTION Sixteen sessions of individual CBT for SAD.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Negative emotion ratings and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging blood oxygen-level dependent signal when reacting to
   and cognitively reappraising negative self-beliefs embedded in
   autobiographical social anxiety situations.
   RESULTS During reactivity trials, compared with wait list, CBT produced
   (1) greater reduction in negative emotion ratings and (2) greater blood
   oxygen-level dependent signal magnitude in the medial prefrontal cortex.
   During cognitive reappraisal trials, compared with wait list, CBT
   produced (3) greater reduction in negative emotion ratings, (4) greater
   blood oxygen level-dependent signal magnitude in the dorsolateral and
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, (5) earlier temporal onset of dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex activity, and (6) greater dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex-amygdala inverse functional connectivity.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Modulation of cognitive reappraisal-related
   brain responses, timing, and functional connectivity may be important
   brain changes that contribute to the effectiveness of CBT for social
   anxiety. This study demonstrates that clinically applied neuroscience
   investigations can elucidate neurobiological mechanisms of change in
   psychiatric conditions.

Abstract = {{Seeing Suzie bite an apple or reading the sentence `Suzie munched the
   apple' both convey a similar idea. But is there a common neural basis
   for action comprehension when generated through video or text? The
   current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to address this
   question. Participants observed videos or read sentences that described
   two categories of actions: eating and cleaning. A conjunction analysis
   of video and sentence stimuli revealed that cleaning actions (compared
   to eating actions) showed a greater response in dorsal frontoparietal
   regions, as well as within the medial fusiform gyrus. These findings
   reveal supramodal representations of perceived actions in the human
   brain, which are specific to action categories and independent of input
   modality (video or written words). In addition, some brain regions
   associated with cleaning and eating actions showed an interaction with
   modality, which was manifested as a greater sensitivity for video
   compared with sentence stimuli. Together, this pattern of results
   demonstrates both supramodal and modality-sensitive representations of
   action categories in the human brain, a finding with implications for
   how we understand other people's actions from video and written sources.}},

Abstract = {{Dysfunctional emotion processing in patients suffering from
   schizophrenia is a prominent clinical feature of great importance for
   social functioning and subjective well-being. The neurobiological
   underpinnings are still poorly understood. Here we investigated a large
   sample of schizophrenia patients and matched healthy controls with an
   event-related fMRI task during emotion processing using emotional
   pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS).
   Schizophrenia patients revealed stronger right amygdala activation
   during negative and attenuated response during positive affective
   picture processing compared to healthy controls. Further analysis
   indicated that medication status influences activation of the ventral
   anterior cingulate cortex during negative affective stimuli processing.
   These results might represent a correlate of altered emotional
   experience in schizophrenia patients who are known to report less
   positive and more negative affective states in daily life situations.

Title = {{Neuropsychiatric deep brain stimulation for translational neuroimaging}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{30-41}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{From a neuroimaging point of view, deep brain stimulation (DBS) in
   psychiatric disorders represents a unique source of information to probe
   results gained in functional, structural and molecular neuroimaging
   studies in vivo. However, the implementation has, up to now, been
   restricted by the heterogeneity of the data reported in DBS studies. The
   aim of the present study was therefore to provide a comprehensive and
   standardized database of currently used DBS targets in selected
   psychiatric disorders (obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),
   treatment-resistant depression (TRD), Gilles de la Tourette syndrome
   (GTS)) to enable topological comparisons between neuroimaging results
   and stimulation areas. A systematic literature research was performed
   and all peer-reviewed publications until the year 2012 were included.
   Literature research yielded a total of 84 peer-reviewed studies
   including about 296 psychiatric patients. The individual stimulation
   data of 37 of these studies meeting the inclusion criteria which
   included a total of 202 patients (63 OCD, 89 TRD, 50 GTS) was translated
   into MNI stereotactic space with respect to AC origin in order to
   identify key targets.
   The created database can be used to compare DBS target areas in MNI
   stereotactic coordinates with: 1) activation patterns in functional
   brain imaging (fMRI, phfMRI, PET, MET, EEG); 2) brain connectivity data
   (e.g., MR-based DTI/tractography, functional and effective
   connectivity); 3) quantitative molecular distribution data (e.g.,
   neuroreceptor PET, post-mortem neuroreceptor mapping); 4) structural
   data (e.g., VBM for neuroplastic changes). Vice versa, the structural,
   functional and molecular data may provide a rationale to define new DBS
   targets and adjust/fine-tune currently used targets in DBS based on this
   overview in stereotactic coordinates. Furthermore, the availability of
   DBS data in stereotactic space may facilitate the investigation and
   interpretation of treatment effects and side effect of DBS by comparing
   these to neuroimaging results. The present study thus improves
   comparability between functional, structural and molecular data in
   standard stereotactic space gained in neuroimaging studies with surgical
   targets for DBS, which is among other possible implications of crucial
   importance for the definition of new targets for effective DBS. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{The process of dehumanization, or thinking of others as less than human,
   is a phenomenon with significant societal implications. According to
   Haslam's (2006) model, two concepts of humanness derive from comparing
   humans with either animals or machines: individuals may be dehumanized
   by likening them to either animals or machines, or humanized by
   emphasizing differences from animals or machines. Recent work in
   cognitive neuroscience emphasizes understanding cognitive processes in
   terms of interactions between distributed cortical networks. It has been
   found that reasoning about internal mental states is associated with
   activation of the default mode network (DMN) and deactivation of the
   task positive network (TPN); whereas reasoning about mechanical
   processes produces the opposite pattern. We conducted two neuroimaging
   studies. The first examined the neural bases of dehumanization and its
   relation to these two brain networks, using images and voice-over social
   narratives which either implicitly contrasted or implicitly likened
   humans to either animals or machines. The second study addressed a
   discrepancy between findings from the first study and prior work on the
   neural correlates of dehumanization: using a design similar to prior
   work we examined neural responses to pictures of humans, animals and
   machines, presented without any social context. In both studies, human
   and humanizing conditions were associated with relatively high activity
   in the DMN and relatively low activity in the TPN. However, the
   non-human and dehumanizing conditions deviated in different ways: they
   demonstrated more marked changes either in the DMN or in the TPN.
   Notably, differences between the animal dehumanizing and humanizing
   conditions were most evident in regions associated with mechanistic
   reasoning, not in the mentalizing network. Conjunction analysis of
   contrasts from both paradigms revealed that only one region was
   consistently more active when participants saw human, a medial parietal
   region regarded as the central hub of the DMN. These findings provide a
   neural basis for Haslam's distinction between two types of
   dehumanization, and suggest that the DMN and TPN play opposing roles in
   creating a sense of moral concern. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Mean-based neural coding of voices}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{351-360}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{The social significance of recognizing the person who talks to us is
   obvious, but the neural mechanisms that mediate talker identification
   are unclear. Regions along the bilateral superior temporal sulcus (STS)
   and the inferior frontal cortex (IFC) of the human brain are selective
   for voices, and they are sensitive to rapid voice changes. Although it
   has been proposed that voice recognition is supported by
   prototype-centered voice representations, the involvement of these
   category-selective cortical regions in the neural coding of such ``mean
   voices{''} has not previously been demonstrated. Using fMRI in
   combination with a voice identity learning paradigm, we show that
   voice-selective regions are involved in the mean-based coding of voice
   identities. Voice typicality is encoded on a supra-individual level in
   the right STS along a stimulus-dependent, identity-independent (i.e.,
   voice-acoustic) dimension, and on an intra-individual level in the right
   IFC along a stimulus-independent, identity-dependent (i.e., voice
   identity) dimension. Voice recognition therefore entails at least two
   anatomically separable stages, each characterized by neural mechanisms
   that reference the central tendencies of voice categories. (c) 2013

Title = {{Prediction of Rat Behavior Outcomes in Memory Tasks Using Functional
   Connections among Neurons}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Analyzing the neuronal organizational structures and
   studying the changes in the behavior of the organism is key to
   understanding cognitive functions of the brain. Although some studies
   have indicated that spatiotemporal firing patterns of neuronal
   populations have a certain relationship with the behavioral responses,
   the issues of whether there are any relationships between the functional
   networks comprised of these cortical neurons and behavioral tasks and
   whether it is possible to take advantage of these networks to predict
   correct and incorrect outcomes of single trials of animals are still
   unresolved.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper presents a new method of
   analyzing the structures of whole-recorded neuronal functional networks
   (WNFNs) and local neuronal circuit groups (LNCGs). The activity of these
   neurons was recorded in several rats. The rats performed two different
   behavioral tasks, the Y-maze task and the U-maze task. Using the results
   of the assessment of the WNFNs and LNCGs, this paper describes a
   realization procedure for predicting the behavioral outcomes of single
   trials. The methodology consists of four main parts: construction of
   WNFNs from recorded neuronal spike trains, partitioning the WNFNs into
   the optimal LNCGs using social community analysis, unsupervised
   clustering of all trials from each dataset into two different clusters,
   and predicting the behavioral outcomes of single trials. The results
   show that WNFNs and LNCGs correlate with the behavior of the animal. The
   U-maze datasets show higher accuracy for unsupervised clustering results
   than those from the Y-maze task, and these datasets can be used to
   predict behavioral responses effectively.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results of the present study suggest that
   a methodology proposed in this paper is suitable for analysis of the
   characteristics of neuronal functional networks and the prediction of
   rat behavior. These types of structures in cortical ensemble activity
   may be critical to information representation during the execution of
   behavior.}},

Title = {{Environmental influences on neural systems of relational complexity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Constructivist learning theory contends that we construct knowledge by
   experience and that environmental context influences learning. To
   explore this principle, we examined the cognitive process relational
   complexity (RC), defined as the number of visual dimensions considered
   during problem solving on a matrix reasoning task and a well-documented
   measure of mature reasoning capacity. We sought to determine how the
   visual environment influences RC by examining the influence of color and
   visual contrast on RC in a neuroimaging task. To specify the
   contributions of sensory demand and relational integration to reasoning,
   our participants performed a non-verbal matrix task comprised of color,
   no-color line, or black-white visual contrast conditions parametrically
   varied by complexity (relations 0, 1, 2). The use of matrix reasoning is
   ecologically valid for its psychometric relevance and for its potential
   to link the processing of psychophysically specific visual properties
   with various levels of RC during reasoning. The role of these elements
   is important because matrix tests assess intellectual aptitude based on
   these seemingly context-less exercises. This experiment is a first step
   toward examining the psychophysical underpinnings of performance on
   these types of problems. The importance of this is increased in light of
   recent evidence that intelligence can be linked to visual
   discrimination. We submit three main findings. First, color and
   black-white visual contrast (BWVC) add demand at a basic sensory level,
   but contributions from color and from BWVC are dissociable in cortex
   such that color engages a ``reasoning heuristic{''} and BWVC engages a
   ``sensory heuristic.{''} Second, color supports contextual sense-making
   by boosting salience resulting in faster problem solving. Lastly, when
   visual complexity reaches 2-relations, color and visual contrast
   relinquish salience to other dimensions of problem solving.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{If language comprehension requires a sensorimotor simulation, how can
   abstract language be comprehended? We show that preparation to respond
   in an upward or downward direction affects comprehension of the abstract
   quantifiers ``more and more{''} and ``less and less{''} as indexed by an
   N400-like component. Conversely, the semantic content of the sentence
   affects the motor potential measured immediately before the upward or
   downward action is initiated. We propose that this bidirectional link
   between motor system and language arises because the motor system
   implements forward models that predict the sensory consequences of
   actions. Because the same movement (e. g., raising the arm) can have
   multiple forward models for different contexts, the models can make
   different predictions depending on whether the arm is raised, for
   example, to place an object or raised as a threat. Thus, different
   linguistic contexts invoke different forward models, and the predictions
   constitute different understandings of the language.}},

   during Action Observation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Several studies investigated the neural and functional mechanisms
   underlying action observation in contexts with objects. However, actions
   seen in everyday life are often embedded in emotional contexts. The
   neural systems integrating emotion cues in action observation are still
   poorly understood. Previous findings suggest that the processing of both
   action and emotion information recruits motor control areas within the
   cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways. It is therefore hard to determine
   whether social emotional contexts influence action processing via a
   direct modulation of motor representations coding for the observed
   action or via the affective state and implicit motor preparedness
   elicited in observers in response to emotional contexts. Here we
   designed a novel fMRI task to identify neural networks engaged by the
   affective appraisal of a grasping action seen in two different emotional
   contexts, while keeping the action kinematics constant. Results
   confirmed that observing the same acts of grasping but in different
   emotional contexts modulated activity in supplementary motor area,
   ventrolateral thalamus, anterior cerebellum. Moreover, changes in
   functional connectivity between left supplementary motor area and
   parahippocampus in different emotional contexts suggested a direct
   neural pathway through which emotional contexts may drive the neural
   motor system. Taken together, these findings shed new light on the
   malleability of motor system as a function of emotional contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Alcohol impairs inhibitory control, including the ability to terminate
   an initiated action. While there is increasing knowledge about neural
   mechanisms involved in response inhibition, the level at which alcohol
   impairs such mechanisms remains poorly understood. Thirty-nine healthy
   social drinkers received either 0.4g/kg or 0.8g/kg of alcohol, or
   placebo, and performed two variants of a Visual Stop-signal task during
   acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The
   two task variants differed only in their instructions: in the classic
   variant (VSST), participants inhibited their response to a
   ``Go-stimulus{''} when it was followed by a ``Stop-stimulus{''}. In the
   control variant (VSST\_C), participants responded to the
   ``Go-stimulus{''} even if it was followed by a ``Stop-stimulus{''}.
   Comparison of successful Stop-trials (Sstop)>Go, and unsuccessful
   Stop-trials (Ustop)>Sstop between the three beverage groups enabled the
   identification of alcohol effects on functional neural circuits
   supporting inhibitory behaviour and error processing. Alcohol impaired
   inhibitory control as measured by the Stop-signal reaction time, but did
   not affect other aspects of VSST performance, nor performance on the
   VSST\_C. The low alcohol dose evoked changes in neural activity within
   prefrontal, temporal, occipital and motor cortices. The high alcohol
   dose evoked changes in activity in areas affected by the low dose but
   importantly induced changes in activity within subcortical centres
   including the globus pallidus and thalamus. Alcohol did not affect
   neural correlates of perceptual processing of infrequent cues, as
   revealed by conjunction analyses of VSST and VSST\_C tasks. Alcohol
   ingestion compromises the inhibitory control of action by modulating
   cortical regions supporting attentional, sensorimotor and
   action-planning processes. At higher doses the impact of alcohol also
   extends to affect subcortical nodes of fronto-basal
   ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor circuits. In contrast, alcohol appears to
   have little impact on the early visual processing of infrequent
   perceptual cues. These observations clarify clinically-important effects
   of alcohol on behaviour.}},

Title = {{Multisite functional connectivity MRI classification of autism: ABIDE
   results}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Systematic differences in functional connectivity MRI
   metrics have been consistently observed in autism, with predominantly
   decreased cortico-cortical connectivity. Previous attempts at single
   subject classification in high-functioning autism using whole brain
   point-to-point functional connectivity have yielded about 80\% accurate
   classification of autism vs. control subjects across a wide age range.
   We attempted to replicate the method and results using the Autism Brain
   Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) including resting state fMRI data obtained
   from 964 subjects and 16 separate international sites.
   Methods: For each of 964 subjects, we obtained pairwise functional
   connectivity measurements from a lattice of 7266 regions of interest
   covering the gray matter (26.4 million connections) after preprocessing
   that included motion and slice timing correction, coregistration to an
   anatomic image, normalization to standard space, and voxelwise removal
   by regression of motion parameters, soft tissue, CSF, and white matter
   signals. Connections were grouped into multiple bins, and a
   leave-one-out classifier was evaluated on connections comprising each
   set of bins. Age, age-squared, gender, handedness, and site were
   included as covariates for the classifier.
   Results: Classification accuracy significantly outperformed chance but
   was much lower for multisite prediction than for previous single site
   results. As high as 60\% accuracy was obtained for whole brain
   classification, with the best accuracy from connections involving
   regions of the default mode network, parahippocampaland fusiform gyri,
   insula, Wernicke Area, and intraparietal sulcus. The classifier score
   was related to symptom severity, social function, daily living skills,
   and verbal IQ. Classification accuracy was significantly higher for
   sites with longer BOLD imaging times.
   Conclusions: Multisite functional connectivity classification of autism
   outperformed chance using a simple leave-one-out classifier, but
   exhibited poorer accuracy than for single site results. Attempts to use
   multisite classifiers will likely require improved classification
   algorithms, longer BOLD imaging times, and standardized acquisition
   parameters for possible future clinical utility.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Abnormalities in amygdala function have been implicated in
   major depression. However, results are inconsistent, and little is known
   about how the depressed brain encodes conflicting social signals. We
   sought to determine how the task relevance of socio-emotional cues
   impacts neural encoding of emotion in depression.
   Methods: Eighteen medication free depressed patients and 18 matched
   controls participated in an FMRI experiment. Whole brain analyses and a
   region-of-interest approach was used to measure amygdala activity during
   the presentation of fearful, happy, or neutral target faces with
   congruent, incongruent, or neutral distracters.
   Results: Greater amygdala activity to target fearful faces was
   associated with depression, as was attenuated amygdala activity to
   target and peripheral happy faces. Although no group differences emerged
   in the amygdala to unattended fearful faces, we observed reduced
   ventrolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal activity in depressed
   individuals during this condition.
   Limitations: Nine patients had a history of anti-depressant use, though
   they were unmedicated for at least three months at testing.
   Conclusions: Depression was associated with reduced amygdala reactivity
   to positive social stimuli. However, enhanced amygdala responsiveness to
   negative emotional cues was only observed to target (attended)
   expressions. The results highlight the need to further determine factors
   that affect emotional reactivity in depression. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have reported that patients with bipolar
   disorder (BPD) exhibit altered emotional processing and regulation.
   However, results remain largely inconsistent across studies. The aim of
   the current study was to further examine affective processing in
   patients with bipolar disorder.
   Methods: Twenty-three patients diagnosed with BPD (Type I) and 18
   healthy matched controls completed a backward-masked affect paradigm
   while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants
   also completed a computerized, overt task of facial emotional
   discrimination after scanning.
   Results: Results demonstrated altered affective processing of happy and
   fearful stimuli in bipolar participants in the amygdala, anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
   relative to controls. BPD participants also displayed significant
   deficits in identifying fearful facial affect.
   Limitations: This study has a moderate sample size, and the patients
   with BPD were significantly older than the healthy control participants;
   this did not appear to impact results, and although statistically
   significant, it is not likely biologically significant.
   Conclusions: These findings may have implications for patients with BPD,
   as altered affective processing could result in deficits in reading
   social cues. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In human lateral temporal cortex, some regions show specific sensitivity
   to human motion. Here we examine whether such effects reflect a general
   biological-nonbiological organizational principle or a process specific
   to human-agent processing by comparing processing of human, animal, and
   tool motion in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment
   with healthy participants and a voxelbased lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM)
   study of patients with brain damage (77 stroke patients). The fMRI
   experiment revealed that in the lateral temporal cortex, the posterior
   superior temporal sulcus shows a preference for human and animal motion,
   whereas the middle part of the right superior temporal sulcus/gyrus
   (mSTS/STG) shows a preference for human and functional tool motion. VLSM
   analyses also revealed that damage to this right mSTS/STG region led to
   more severe impairment in the recognition of human and functional tool
   motion relative to animal motion, indicating the causal role of this
   brain area in human-agent motion processing. The findings for the right
   mSTS/STG cannot be reduced to a preference for articulated motion or
   processing of social variables since neither factor is involved in
   functional tool motion recognition. We conclude that a unidimensional
   biological-nonbiological distinction cannot fully explain the visual
   motion effects in lateral temporal cortex. Instead, the results suggest
   the existence of distinct components in right posterior temporal cortex
   and mSTS/STG that are associated, respectively, with biological motion
   and human-agent motion processing.}},

Abstract = {{Humans tend to use the self as a reference point to perceive the world
   and gain information about other people's mental states. However,
   applying such a self-referential projection mechanism in situations
   where it is inappropriate can result in egocentrically biased judgments.
   To assess egocentricity bias in the emotional domain (EEB), we developed
   a novel visuo-tactile paradigm assessing the degree to which empathic
   judgments are biased by one's own emotions if they are incongruent to
   those of the person we empathize with. A first behavioral experiment
   confirmed the existence of such EEB, and two independent fMRI
   experiments revealed that overcoming biased empathic judgments is
   associated with increased activation in the right supramarginal gyrus
   (rSMG), in a location distinct from activations in right temporoparietal
   junction reported in previous social cognition studies. Using temporary
   disruption of rSMG with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
   resulted in a substantial increase of EEB, and so did reducing
   visuo-tactile stimulation time as shown in an additional behavioral
   experiment. Our findings provide converging evidence from multiple
   methods and experiments that rSMG is crucial for overcoming emotional
   egocentricity. Effective connectivity analyses suggest that this may be
   achieved by early perceptual regulation processes disambiguating
   proprioceptive first-person information (touch) from exteroceptive
   third-person information (vision) during incongruency between self-and
   other-related affective states. Our study extends previous models of
   social cognition. It shows that although shared neural networks may
   underlie emotional understanding in some situations, an additional
   mechanism subserved by rSMG is needed to avoid biased social judgments
   in other situations.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the relationship between environmental enrichment
   (EE) and hippocampal atrophy in the chronic stages of moderate to severe
   traumatic brain injury (TBI).
   Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data;
   obervational, within-subjects.
   Participants: Patients (N = 25) with moderate to severe TBI.
   Measures: Primary predictors: (1) An aggregate of self-report rating of
   EE (comprising hours of cognitive, physical, and social activities) at 5
   months post-injury years of education as a proxy for pre-morbid EE (or
   cognitive reserve). Primary outcome: bilateral hippocampal volume change
   from 5 to 28 months post-injury.
   Results: As predicted, self-reported EE was significantly negatively
   correlated with bilateral hippocampal atrophy (p < 0.05), with greater
   EE associated with less atrophy from 5 to 28 months. Contrary to
   prediction, years of education (a proxy for cognitive reserve) was not
   significantly associated with atrophy.
   Conclusion: Post-injury EE may serve as a buffer against hippocampal
   atrophy in the chronic stages of moderate-severe TBI. Clinical
   application of EE should be considered for optimal maintenance of
   neurological functioning in the chronic stages of moderate-severe TBI.}},

Abstract = {{Under typical conditions, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) connections
   with the amygdala are immature during childhood and become adult-like
   during adolescence. Rodent models show that maternal deprivation
   accelerates this development, prompting examination of human
   amygdala-mPFC phenotypes following maternal deprivation. Previously
   institutionalized youths, who experienced early maternal deprivation,
   exhibited atypical amygdala-mPFC connectivity. Specifically, unlike the
   immature connectivity (positive amygdala-mPFC coupling) of comparison
   children, children with a history of early adversity evidenced mature
   connectivity (negative amygdala-mPFC coupling) and thus, resembled the
   adolescent phenotype. This connectivity pattern was mediated by the
   hormone cortisol, suggesting that stress-induced modifications of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis shape amygdala-mPFC circuitry.
   Despite being age-atypical, negative amygdala-mPFC coupling conferred
   some degree of reduced anxiety, although anxiety was still significantly
   higher in the previously institutionalized group. These findings suggest
   that accelerated amygdala-mPFC development is an ontogenetic adaptation
   in response to early adversity.}},

Abstract = {{The reputation of others influences partner selection in human
   cooperative behaviors through verbal reputation representation. Although
   the way in which humans represent the verbal reputations of others is a
   pivotal issue for social neuroscience, the neural correlates underlying
   the representation of verbal reputations of others are unclear. Humans
   primarily depend on self-evaluation when assessing reputation of self.
   Likewise, humans might primarily depend on self-evaluation of others
   when representing their reputation. As interaction promotes the
   formation of more nuanced, individualized impressions of an interaction
   partner, humans tend to form self-evaluations of persons with whom they
   are intimate in their daily life. Thus, we hypothesized that the
   representation of reputation of others is modulated by intimacy due to
   one's own evaluation formation of that person. To test this hypothesis,
   we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment with 11
   pairs of romantic partners while they viewed an evaluation of a target
   person (self, partner {[}intimate other], or stranger {[}non-intimate
   other]), made by other evaluators. When compared with strangers, viewing
   evaluations of self and partner activated overlapping regions in the
   medial prefrontal cortex. Verbal reputation of self-specific activation
   was found in the precuneus, which represents self-related processing.
   The data suggest that midline structures represent reputation of self.
   In addition, intimacy-modulated activation in the medial prefrontal
   cortex suggests that the verbal reputation of intimate others is
   represented similarly to reputation of self. These results suggest that
   the reputation representation in the medial prefrontal cortex is engaged
   by verbal reputation of self and intimate others stemming from both own
   and other evaluators' judgments.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between people require shared high-level cognitive
   representations of action goals, intentions {[}1], and mental states
   {[}2], but do people also share their representation of space? The human
   ventral premotor (MUM and parietal cortices contain neuronal populations
   coding for the execution and observation of actions {[}1, 3-5],
   analogous to the mirror neurons identified in monkeys {[}1, 5]. This
   neuronal system is tuned to the location of the acting person relative
   to the observer and the target of the action {[}4, 5]. Therefore, it can
   be theorized that the observer's brain constructs a low-level,
   body-centered representation of the space around others similar to one's
   own peripersonal space representation {[}6-11]. Single-cell recordings
   have reported that parietal visuotactile neurons discharge for objects
   near specific parts of a monkey's own body and near the corresponding
   body parts of another individual {[}9]. In humans, no neuroimaging study
   has investigated this issue. Here, we identified neuronal populations in
   the human PMv that encode the space near both one's own hand and another
   person's hand. The shared peripersonal space representation could
   support social interactions by coding sensory events, actions, and
   cognitive processes in a common spatial reference frame.}},

Abstract = {{Reading about another person's beliefs engages `Theory of Mind'

   individuals with autism spectrum disorders (N = 31), using both

   between neurotypical participants and those diagnosed with autism

   impairments typical of autism spectrum disorder can occur without

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{The Abstractness and modality of interpersonal communication have a
   considerable impact on comprehension. They are relevant for determining
   thoughts and constituting internal models of the environment. Whereas
   concrete object-related information can be represented in mind
   irrespective of language, abstract concepts require a representation in
   speech. Consequently, modality-independent processing of abstract
   information can be expected. Here we investigated the neural correlates
   of abstractness (abstract vs. concrete) and modality (speech vs.
   gestures), to identify an abstractness-specific supramodal neural
   network. During fMRI data acquisition 20 participants were presented
   with videos of an actor either speaking sentences with an
   abstract-social {[}AS] or concrete-object-related content {[}CS], or
   performing meaningful abstract-social emblematic {[}AG] or
   concrete-object-related tool-use gestures {[}CG]. Gestures were
   accompanied by a foreign language to increase the comparability between
   conditions and to frame the communication context of the gesture videos.
   Participants performed a content judgment task referring to the person
   vs. object-relatedness of the utterances. The behavioral data suggest a
   comparable comprehension of contents communicated by speech or gesture.
   Furthermore, we found common neural processing for abstract information
   independent of modality (AS > CS boolean AND AG > CG) in a left
   hemispheric network including the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG),
   temporal pole, and medial frontal cortex. Modality specific activations
   were found in bilateral occipital, parietal, and temporal as well as
   right in ferior frontal brain regions for gesture (G > S) and in left
   anterior temporal regions and the left angular gyrus for the processing
   of speech semantics (S > G). These data support the idea that abstract
   concepts are represented in a supramodal manner. Consequently, gestures
   referring to abstract concepts are processed in a predominantly left
   hemispheric language related neural network.}},

Title = {{Both novelty and expertise increase action observation network activity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Our experiences with others affect how we perceive their actions. In
   particular, activity in bilateral premotor and parietal cortices during
   action observation, collectively known as the action observation network
   (AON), is modulated by one's expertise with the observed actions or
   individuals. However, conflicting reports suggest that AON activity is
   greatest both for familiar and unfamiliar actions. The current study
   examines the effects of different types and amounts of experience (e.g.,
   visual, interpersonal, personal) on AON activation. fMRI was used to
   scan 16 healthy participants without prior experience with individuals
   with amputations (novices), 11 experienced occupational therapists (OTs)
   who had varying amounts of experience with individuals with amputations,
   and one individual born with below-elbow residual limbs (participant
   CJ), as they viewed video clips of goal-matched actions performed by an
   individual with residual limbs and by an individual with hands.
   Participants were given increased visual exposure to actions performed
   by both effectors midway through the scanning procedure. Novices
   demonstrated a large AON response to the initial viewing of an
   individual with residual limbs compared to one with hands, but this
   signal was attenuated after they received visual exposure to both
   effectors. In contrast, OTs, who had moderate familiarity with residual
   limbs, demonstrated a lower AON response upon initial viewing similar to
   novices after they received visual exposure. At the other extreme, CJ,
   who has extreme familiarity with residual limbs both visually and
   motorically, shows a largely increased left-lateralized AON response,
   exceeding that of novices and experienced OTs, when viewing the residual
   limb compared to hand actions. These results suggest that a nuanced
   model of AON engagement is needed to explain how cases of both extreme
   experience (CJ) and extreme novelty (novices) can result in the greatest
   AON activity.}},

Title = {{MEG Evidence for Dynamic Amygdala Modulations by Gaze and Facial
   Emotions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Amygdala is a key brain region for face perception. While
   the role of amygdala in the perception of facial emotion and gaze has
   been extensively highlighted with fMRI, the unfolding in time of
   amydgala responses to emotional versus neutral faces with different gaze
   directions is scarcely known.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we addressed this question in
   healthy subjects using MEG combined with an original source imaging
   method based on individual amygdala volume segmentation and the
   localization of sources in the amygdala volume. We found an early peak
   of amygdala activity that was enhanced for fearful relative to neutral
   faces between 130 and 170 ms. The effect of emotion was again
   significant in a later time range (310-350 ms). Moreover, the amygdala
   response was greater for direct relative averted gaze between 190 and
   350 ms, and this effect was selective of fearful faces in the right
   amygdala.
   Conclusion: Altogether, our results show that the amygdala is involved
   in the processing and integration of emotion and gaze cues from faces in
   different time ranges, thus underlining its role in multiple stages of
   face perception.}},

Title = {{Isn't it ironic? Neural Correlates of Irony Comprehension in
   Schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Ironic remarks are frequent in everyday language and represent an
   important form of social cognition. Increasing evidence indicates a
   deficit in comprehension in schizophrenia. Several models for defective
   comprehension have been proposed, including possible roles of the medial
   prefrontal lobe, default mode network, inferior frontal gyri, mirror
   neurons, right cerebral hemisphere and a possible mediating role of
   schizotypal personality traits. We investigated the neural correlates of
   irony comprehension in schizophrenia by using event-related functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In a prosody-free reading paradigm,
   15 female patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy female controls
   silently read ironic and literal text vignettes during fMRI. Each text
   vignette ended in either an ironic (n = 22) or literal (n = 22)
   statement. Ironic and literal text vignettes were matched for word
   frequency, length, grammatical complexity, and syntax. After fMRI, the
   subjects performed an off-line test to detect error rate. In this test,
   the subjects indicated by button press whether the target sentence has
   ironic, literal, or meaningless content. Schizotypal personality traits
   were assessed using the German version of the schizotypal personality
   questionnaire (SPQ). Patients with schizophrenia made significantly more
   errors than did the controls (correct answers, 85.3\% vs. 96.3\%) on a
   behavioural level. Patients showed attenuated blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) response during irony comprehension mainly in
   right hemisphere temporal regions (ironic. literal contrast) and in
   posterior medial prefrontal and left anterior insula regions (for
   ironic. visual baseline, but not for literal. visual baseline). In
   patients with schizophrenia, the parahippocampal gyrus showed increased
   activation. Across all subjects, BOLD response in the medial prefrontal
   area was negatively correlated with the SPQ score. These results
   highlight the role of the posterior medial prefrontal and right temporal
   regions in defective irony comprehension in schizophrenia and the
   mediating role of schizotypal personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{In the clinical area, some symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity
   disorder (ADHD) also present in patients with autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD). Research has shown that there are alterations in brain circuits
   that have an impact upon specific cognitive and behavioural failures in
   each of these disorders. Yet, little research has been conducted on the
   brain correlates underlying both the similarities and the differences in
   the symptoms. In this review, the structural and functional
   meta-analytical studies that have been carried out to date on ADHD and
   ASD have been analysed. On the one hand, there are convergences in the
   attentional dorsal, executive functions, visual, somatomotor circuits
   and the default activation circuit. These similarities can account for
   the comorbid manifestations between the disorders, such as failure in
   the integration of information, fine motor control and specific
   attention processes. On the other hand, specifically in ADHD, there is a
   deficit in the reward circuit and in the attentional ventral, which are
   systems involved in the measurement of the effects of reinforcement and
   monitoring of attention. In ASD, the circuits that are most strongly
   affected are those involved in social cognition and language processes.
   In conclusion, there are neuronal correlates in both disorders that
   explain both the convergent and divergent clinical and behavioural
   manifestations.}},

Title = {{Age differences in neural response to stereotype threat and resiliency
   for self-referenced information}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the contribution of cortical midline regions to
   stereotype threat and resiliency, we compared age groups in an
   event-related functional MRI study. During scanning, 17 younger and 16
   older adults judged whether words stereotypical of aging and control
   words described them. Judging stereotype words versus control words
   revealed higher activations in posterior midline regions associated with
   self-referencing, including the precuneus, for older adults compared to
   younger adults. While heightening salience of stereotypes can evoke a
   threat response, detrimentally affecting performance, invoking
   stereotypes canal so lead to a phenomenon called resilience, where older
   adults use those stereotypes to create downward social comparisons to
   ``other{''} older adults and elevate their own self-perception. In an
   exploration of brain regions underlying stereotype threat responses as
   well as resilience responses, we found significant activation in older
   adults for threat over resilient responses in posterior midline regions
   including the precuneus, associated with self-reflective thought, and
   parahippocampal gyrus, implicated in autobiographical memory. These
   findings have implications for understanding how aging stereotypes may
   affect the engagement of regions associated with contextual and social
   processing of self-relevant information, indicating ways in which
   stereotype threat can affect the engagement of neural resources with
   age.}},

Title = {{Reappraising social emotions: the role of inferior frontal gyrus,
   temporo- parietal junction and insula in interpersonal emotion
   regulation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have reported the effect of emotion regulation (ER)
   strategies on both individual and social decision-making, however, the
   effect of regulation on socially driven emotions independent of
   decisions is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the
   neural effects of using reappraisal to both up- and down-regulate
   socially driven emotions. Participants played the Dictator Game (DG) in
   the role of recipient while undergoing fMRI, and concurrently applied
   the strategies of either up-regulation (reappraising the proposer's
   intentions as more negative), down-regulation (reappraising the
   proposer's intentions as less negative), as well as a baseline
   ``look{''} condition. Results showed that regions responding to the
   implementation of reappraisal (effect of strategy, that is, ``regulating
   regions{''}) were the inferior and middle frontal gyrus, temporo
   parietal junction and insula bilaterally. Importantly, the middle
   frontal gyrus activation correlated with the frequency of regulatory
   strategies in daily life, with the insula activation correlating with
   the perceived ability to reappraise the emotions elicited by the social
   situation. Regions regulated by reappraisal (effect of regulation, that
   is, ``regulated regions{''}) were the striatum, the posterior cingulate
   and the insula, showing increased activation for the up-regulation and
   reduced activation for down-regulation, both compared to the baseline
   condition. When analyzing the separate effects of partners' behavior,
   selfish behavior produced an activation of the insula, not observed when
   subjects were treated altruistically. Here we show for the first time
   that interpersonal ER strategies can strongly affect neural responses
   when experiencing socially driven emotions. Clinical implications of
   these findings are also discussed to understand how the way we interpret
   others' intentions may affect the way we emotionally react.}},

Title = {{The impact of sensorimotor experience on affective evaluation of dance}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{Past research demonstrates that we are more likely to positively
   evaluate a stimulus if we have had previous experience with that
   stimulus. This has been shown for judgement of faces, architecture,
   artworks and body movements. In contrast, other evidence suggests that
   this relationship can also work in the inverse direction, at least in
   the domain of watching dance. Specifically, it has been shown that in
   certain contexts, people derive greater pleasure from watching
   unfamiliar movements they would not be able to physically reproduce
   compared to simpler, familiar actions they could physically reproduce.
   It remains unknown, however, how different kinds of experience with
   complex actions, such as dance, might change observers' affective
   judgements of these movements. Our aim was to clarify the relationship
   between experience and affective evaluation of whole body movements. In
   a between-subjects design, participants received either physical dance
   training with a video game system, visual and auditory experience or
   auditory experience only. Participants' aesthetic preferences for dance
   stimuli were measured before and after the training sessions. Results
   show that participants from the physical training group not only
   improved their physical performance of the dance sequences, but also
   reported higher enjoyment and interest in the stimuli after training.
   This suggests that physically learning particular movements leads to
   greater enjoyment while observing them. These effects are not simply due
   to increased familiarity with audio or visual elements of the stimuli,

Title = {{The neural correlates of in-group and self-face perception: is there

Abstract = {{Social identity, the part of the self-concept derived from group
   membership, is a key explanatory construct for a wide variety of
   behaviors, ranging from organizational commitment to discrimination
   toward out-groups. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   we examined the neural basis of social identity through a comparison
   with the neural correlates of self-face perception. Participants viewed
   a series of pictures, one at a time, of themselves, a familiar other,
   in-group members, and out-group members. We created a contrast for
   self-face perception by subtracting brain activation in response to the
   familiar other from brain activation in response to the self face, and a
   contrast for social identity by subtracting brain activation in response
   to out-group faces from brain activation in response to in-group faces.
   In line with previous research, for the self-familiar other contrast we
   found activation in several right-hemisphere regions (inferior frontal
   gyrus, inferior and superior parietal lobules). In addition, we found
   activation in closely-adjacent brain areas for the social identity
   contrast. Importantly, significant clusters of activation in this
   in-group-out-group contrast only emerged to the extent that participants
   reported high identification with the in-group. These results suggest
   that self-perception and social identity depend on partly similar neural
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{An individual has a mind; a group does not. Yet humans routinely endow
   groups with mental states irreducible to any of their members (e.g.,
   ``scientists hope to understand every aspect of nature{''}). But are
   these mental states categorically similar to those we attribute to
   individuals? In two fMRI experiments, we tested this question against a
   set of brain regions that are consistently associated with social
   cognition-medial pFC, anterior temporal lobe, TPJ, and medial parietal
   cortex. Participants alternately answered questions about the mental
   states and physical attributes of individual people and groups. Regions
   previously associated with mentalizing about individuals were also
   robustly responsive to judgments of groups, suggesting that perceivers
   deploy the same social-cognitive processes when thinking about the mind
   of an individual and the ``mind{''} of a group. However, multivariate
   searchlight analysis revealed that several of these regions showed
   distinct multivoxel patterns of response to groups and individual
   people, suggesting that perceivers maintain distinct representations of
   groups and individuals during mental state inferences. These findings
   suggest that perceivers mentalize about groups in a manner qualitatively
   similar to mentalizing about individual people, but that the brain
   nevertheless maintains important distinctions between the
   representations of such entities.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive behavior involves interactions between systems regulating
   Pavlovian and instrumental control of actions. Here, we present the
   first investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying aversive
   Pavlovian-instrumental transfer using fMRI in humans. Recent evidence
   indicates that these Pavlovian influences on instrumental actions are
   action-specific: Instrumental approach is invigorated by appetitive
   Pavlovian cues but inhibited by aversive Pavlovian cues. Conversely,
   instrumental withdrawal is inhibited by appetitive Pavlovian cues but
   invigorated by aversive Pavlovian cues. We show that BOLD responses in
   the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens were associated with behavioral
   inhibition by aversive Pavlovian cues, irrespective of action context.
   Furthermore, BOLD responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   differed between approach and withdrawal actions. Aversive Pavlovian
   conditioned stimuli modulated connectivity between the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and the caudate nucleus. These results show that
   actionspecific aversive control of instrumental behavior involves the
   modulation of fronto-striatal interactions by Pavlovian conditioned
   stimuli.}},

   focus on face-selective areas in the ventral stream, such as the

Abstract = {{Human social motivation is characterized by the pursuit of social reward
   and the avoidance of social punishment. The ventral striatum/nucleus
   accumbens (VS/Nacc), in particular, has been implicated in the reward
   component of social motivation, i.e., the `wanting' of social incentives
   like approval. However, it is unclear to what extent the VS/Nacc is
   involved in avoiding social punishment like disapproval, an
   intrinsically pleasant outcome. Thus, we conducted an event-related
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using a social
   incentive delay task with dynamic video stimuli instead of static
   pictures as social incentives in order to examine participants'
   motivation for social reward gain and social punishment avoidance. As
   predicted, the anticipation of avoidable social punishment (i.e.,
   disapproval) recruited the VS/Nacc in a manner that was similar to
   VS/Nacc activation observed during the anticipation of social reward
   gain (i.e., approval). Stronger VS/Nacc activity was accompanied by
   faster reaction times of the participants to obtain those desired
   outcomes. This data support the assumption that dynamic social
   incentives elicit robust VS/Nacc activity, which likely reflects
   motivation to obtain social reward and to avoid social punishment.
   Clinical implications regarding the involvement of the VS/Nacc in social
   motivation dysfunction in autism and social phobia are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{The fusiform gyms responds more strongly to faces than to other
   categories of objects. This response could reflect either categorical
   detection of faces or recognition of particular facial identities.
   Recent fMRI studies have attempted to address the question of what
   information is encoded in these regions, but have reported mixed
   results. We tested whether the creation of richer identity
   representations via training on visual and social information, and the
   use of an adaptation design, would reveal more robust representations of
   these identities in ventral temporal cortex. Examining the patterns of
   activation across voxels in bilateral fusiform gyri, we identified
   unique patterns for particular identities. Attaching distinctive
   biographical information to identities did not increase the strength of
   these representations, but did produce a grouping effect: faces
   associated with the same amount of biographical information were
   represented more similarly to each other. These results are consistent
   with the possibility that identity exemplars are represented in
   posterior visual areas best known for their role in representing
   categorical information, and suggest that these areas may be sensitive
   to some forms of non-visual information, including from the social
   domain. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifiers such as frequency adverbs (e.g., ``always{''}, ``never{''})
   and quantity pronouns (e.g., ``many{''}, ``none{''}) convey quantity
   information. Whether quantifiers are processed as numbers or as general
   semantics has been a matter of much debate. Some neuropsychological and
   fMRI studies have found that the processing of quantifiers depends on
   the numerical magnitude comprehension system, but others have found that
   quantifier processing is associated with semantic representation. The
   selective impairment of language in semantic dementia patients provides
   a way to examine the above controversy. We administered a series of
   neuropsychological tests (i.e., language processing, numerical
   processing and semantic distance judgment) to two patients with
   different levels of severity in semantic dementia (mild vs. severe). The
   results showed that the two patients had intact numerical knowledge, but
   impairments in semantic processing. Moreover, the patient with
   severe/late semantic dementia showed more impairment in quantifier and
   semantic processing than the patient with mild/early semantic dementia.
   We concluded that quantifier processing is associated with general
   semantic processing, not with numerical processing. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The ``default mode{''}, or baseline of brain function is a topic of
   great interest in schizophrenia research. Recent neuroimaging studies
   report that the symptoms of chronic schizophrenia subjects are
   associated with temporal frequency alterations as well as with the
   disruption of local spatial patterns in the default mode network (DMN).
   Previous studies both on chronic and medicated subjects with psychosis
   suffered from limitations; on this basis, it was hypothesized that the
   default mode network showed abnormal activation and connectivity in
   young and neuroleptic-na < ve patients with first-episode psychosis.
   This study investigated emotional responses to pleasant and
   unpleasant/disgusting visual stimuli by a resting-state analysis of
   fMRI-data from 12 untreated first-episode psychosis patients with
   prevalently negative symptomatology versus 12 healthy subjects. We chose
   this experimental task to explore the functional link between default
   mode network and hedonic processing which has been proposed as a marker
   of cerebral dysfunction in psychotic disorder and implicated in its
   pathophysiology. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was used to
   identify the default mode component. Both healthy and first-episode
   subjects showed significant spatial differences in the default mode
   network. In first-episode subjects, medial frontal hypoactivity and
   cerebellar hyperactivity were correlated with the severity of negative
   symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of differentiating between social concepts when
   appraising actions (e.g., understanding behavior as critical vs.
   fault-finding) and its contribution to vulnerability to major depressive
   disorder (MDD) is unknown. We predicted poor integration of
   differentiated conceptual knowledge when people with MDD appraise their
   social actions, contributing to their tendency to grossly overgeneralize
   self-blame (e.g., I am unlikable rather than critical). To test this
   hypothesis, we used a neuropsychological test measuring social
   conceptual differentiation and its relationship with emotional biases in
   a remitted MDD and a control group. During fMRI, guilt- and
   indignation-evoking sentences were presented. As predicted, conceptual
   overgeneralization was associated with increased emotional intensity
   when appraising social actions. Interdependence of conceptual
   overgeneralization and negative emotional biases was stronger in MDD
   (reproducible in the subgroup without medication) and was associated
   with overgeneralized self-blame. This high conceptual-emotional
   interdependence was associated with functional disconnection between the
   right superior anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and right dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as a septal region across groups when
   experiencing guilt (SPM8). Strong coupling of conceptual information
   (ATL) with information about the context of actions and emotions
   (frontal-subcortical regions) is thus associated with appraisal being
   less dependent on conceptual overgeneralization, thereby protecting
   against excessive self-blame.}},

Abstract = {{The recognition of emotional facial expressions is an important means to
   adjust behavior in social interactions. As facial expressions widely
   differ in their duration and degree of expressiveness, they often
   manifest with short and transient expressions below the level of
   awareness. In this combined behavioral and fMRI study, we aimed at
   examining whether or not consciously accessible (subliminal) emotional
   facial expressions influence empathic judgments and which brain
   activations are related to it. We hypothesized that subliminal facial
   expressions of emotions masked with neutral expressions of the same
   faces induce an empathic processing similar to consciously accessible
   (supraliminal) facial expressions. Our behavioral data in 23 healthy
   subjects showed that subliminal emotional facial expressions of 40 ms
   duration affect the judgments of the subsequent neutral facial
   expressions. In the fMRI study in 12 healthy subjects it was found that
   both, supra- and subliminal emotional facial expressions shared a
   widespread network of brain areas including the fusiform gyrus, the
   temporo-parietal junction, and the inferior, dorsolateral, and medial
   frontal cortex. Compared with subliminal facial expressions,
   supraliminal facial expressions led to a greater activation of left
   occipital and fusiform face areas. We conclude that masked subliminal
   emotional information is suited to trigger processing in brain areas
   which have been implicated in empathy and, thereby in social encounters}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{462-473}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Reports of age-related changes to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
   activity during socio-cognitive tasks have shown both age-equivalence
   and under recruitment. Emotion work illustrates selective mPFC response
   dependent on valence, such that negative emotional images evoke
   increased ventral mPFC activity for younger adults, while older adults
   recruit vmPFC more for positive material. By testing whether this
   differential age-related response toward valenced material is also
   present for the social task of forming impressions, we may begin to
   understand inconsistencies regarding when age differences are present
   vs. absent in the literature. Using fMRI, participants intentionally
   formed impressions of positive and negative face-behavior pairs in
   anticipation of a memory task. Extending previous findings to a social
   task, valence-based reversals were present in dorsal and ventral mPFC,
   and posterior cingulate cortex. Younger adults elicited increased
   activity when forming negative impressions, while older adults had more
   recruitment when forming positive impressions. This suggests an
   age-related shift toward emphasizing positive social information may be
   reflected in the recruitment of regions supporting forming impressions.
   Overall, the results indicate an age-related shift in neural response to
   socio-cognitive stimuli that is valence dependent rather than a general
   age-related reduction in activity, in part informing prior
   inconsistencies within the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Emotions elicited by interpersonal versus non-interpersonal experiences
   have different effects on neurobiological functioning in both animals
   and humans. However, the extent to which the brain circuits underlying
   interpersonal and non-interpersonal emotions are distinct still remains
   unclear. The goal of our study was to assess whether different neural
   circuits are implicated in the processing of arousal and valence of
   interpersonal versus non-interpersonal emotions. During functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, participants imagined themselves in
   emotion-eliciting interpersonal or non-interpersonal situations and then
   rated the arousal and valence of emotions they experienced. We
   identified (1) separate neural circuits that are implicated in the
   arousal and valence dimensions of interpersonal versus non-interpersonal
   emotions, (2) circuits that are implicated in arousal and valence for
   both types of emotion, and (3) circuits that are responsive to the type
   of emotion, regardless of the valence or arousal level of the emotion.
   We found extensive recruitment of limbic (for arousal) and
   temporal-parietal (for valence) systems associated with processing of
   specifically interpersonal emotions compared to non-interpersonal ones.
   The neural bases of interpersonal and non-interpersonal emotions may,
   therefore, be largely distinct.}},

   effect (Cohen's d=1.88), which persisted for 2 months post-treatment.
   ERPs remained unchanged post- vs. pre-treatment, while low resolution
   brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) revealed activation decreases
   in left-hemispheric parietal-temporal-occipital regions at 172 msec and
   activation increases in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and
   anterior cingulate at 250 msec.Possibly, violent offenders with
   schizophrenia are particularly amenable to TAR because of a high level
   of dysfunction at baseline. Post- vs. pre-treatment changes of neural
   activity (LORETA) may mirror a gain of efficiency in structural face
   decoding and a shift towards a more reflective mode of emotional face
   decoding, relying on increased frontal brain activity. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) -data from another study further
   supports this notion. TAR treatment might enable subjects with
   schizophrenia and a disposition to violence to reach a higher degree of
   deliberation of their reactive behavior to facial affect stimuli.}},

Title = {{From gene to brain to behavior: schizophrenia-associated variation in

Abstract = {{Recently, genome-wide association between schizophrenia and an intronic
   variant in AMBRA1 (rs11819869) was reported. Additionally, in a reverse
   genetic approach in adult healthy subjects, risk allele carriers showed
   a higher medial prefrontal cortex blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   response during a flanker task examining motor inhibition as an aspect
   of impulsivity. To test whether this finding can be expanded to further
   aspects of impulsivity, we analysed the effects of the rs11819869
   genotype on impulsivity-related traits on a behavioral, temperament and
   neural level in a large sample of healthy adolescents. We consider this
   reverse genetic approach specifically suited for use in a healthy
   adolescent sample, as these individuals comprise those who will
   eventually develop mental disorders in which impulsivity is implicated.
   Healthy adolescents from the IMAGEN study were included in the
   neuropsychological analysis (n=848) and a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) task (n=512). Various aspects of impulsivity were
   assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised, the
   Substance Use Risk Profile Scale, the Cambridge Cognition
   Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, and the Stop Signal Task
   (SST) in the fMRI paradigm. On a behavioral level, increased delay
   aversion was observed in risk allele carriers. Furthermore, risk allele
   carriers showed a higher BOLD response in an orbito-frontal target
   region during the SST, which declined to trend status after Family Wise
   Error correction. Our findings support the hypothesis that the
   schizophrenia-related risk variant of rs11819869 is involved in various
   aspects of impulsivity, and that this involvement occurs on a behavioral
   as well as an imaging genetics level.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Brain imaging studies have identified robust changes in brain
   structure and function during the development of psychosis, but the
   contribution of abnormal brain connectivity to the onset of psychosis is
   unclear. Furthermore, antipsychotic treatment can modulate brain
   activity and functional connectivity during cognitive tasks.
   OBJECTIVES To investigate whether dysfunctional brain connectivity
   during working memory (WM) predates the onset of psychosis and whether
   connectivity parameters are related to antipsychotic treatment.
   DESIGN Dynamic causal modeling study of functional magnetic resonance
   imaging data.
   SETTING Participants were recruited from the specialized clinic for the
   early detection of psychosis at the Department of Psychiatry, University
   of Basel, Basel, Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS Seventeen participants with
   an at-risk mental state (mean {[}SD] age, 25.24 {[}6.3] years), 21
   individuals with first-episode psychosis (mean {[}SD] age, 28.57 {[}7.2]
   years), and 20 healthy controls (mean {[}SD] age, 26.5 {[}4] years).
   MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were
   recorded while participants performed an N-back WM task. Functional
   interactions among brain regions involved in WM, in particular between
   frontal and parietal brain regions, were characterized using dynamic
   causal modeling. Bayesian model selection was performed to evaluate the
   likelihood of alternative WM network architectures across groups,
   whereas bayesian model averaging was used to examine group differences
   in connection strengths.
   RESULTS We observed a progressive reduction in WM-induced modulation of
   connectivity from the middle frontal gyrus to the superior parietal
   lobule in the right hemisphere in healthy controls, at-risk mental state
   participants, and first-episode psychosis patients. Notably, the
   abnormal modulation of connectivity in first-episode psychosis patients
   was normalized by treatment with antipsychotics.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our findings suggest that the vulnerability to
   psychosis is associated with a progressive failure of functional
   integration of brain regions involved in WM processes, including visual
   encoding and rule updating, and that treatment with antipsychotics may
   have the potential to counteract this.}},

Abstract = {{As a person learns a new skill, distinct synapses, brain regions, and
   circuits are engaged and change over time. In this paper, we develop
   methods to examine patterns of correlated activity across a large set of
   brain regions. Our goal is to identify properties that enable robust
   learning of a motor skill. We measure brain activity during motor
   sequencing and characterize network properties based on coherent
   activity between brain regions. Using recently developed algorithms to
   detect time-evolving communities, we find that the complex
   reconfiguration patterns of the brain's putative functional modules that
   control learning can be described parsimoniously by the combined
   presence of a relatively stiff temporal core that is composed primarily
   of sensorimotor and visual regions whose connectivity changes little in
   time and a flexible temporal periphery that is composed primarily of
   multimodal association regions whose connectivity changes frequently.
   The separation between temporal core and periphery changes over the
   course of training and, importantly, is a good predictor of individual
   differences in learning success. The core of dynamically stiff regions
   exhibits dense connectivity, which is consistent with notions of
   core-periphery organization established previously in social networks.
   Our results demonstrate that core-periphery organization provides an
   insightful way to understand how putative functional modules are linked.
   This, in turn, enables the prediction of fundamental human capacities,
   including the production of complex goal-directed behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In a social context, the direction of the body of surrounding agents
   indicates whether one is the potential target of an impending action or
   simply an observer, and thus influences the way one processes and reacts
   to their emotional expressions. The present functional magnetic
   resonance imaging experiment investigated how self-relevance influences
   anger processing in the brain by independently manipulating target
   (oriented to self or to other) and emotion (neutral and anger). The
   perception of body expression of anger elicits activity in a previously
   identified network that includes the amygdala, the fusiform gyrus, the
   superior temporal sulcus and the premotor cortex. Activity within this
   network is independent of body direction and is parametrically modulated
   by the intensity of the bodily emotional expression. Moreover, the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex and somatosensory cortices responded
   preferentially to anger expressions oriented to self. We suggest that
   these brain areas may participate in the selection of specific
   behavioural strategies when one is the potential target of someone's
   anger. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Brain structural and psychometric alterations in chronic low back pain}},

Abstract = {{Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is one of the most important pain disorders
   with increasing social and economic implications. Given that CLBP is a
   multidimensional process associated with comorbidities such as anxiety
   and depression, treatment of chronic low back pain is still a challenge.
   Advancement of in vivo brain imaging technologies has revealed
   increasing insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of chronic pain;
   however, the exact mechanisms of chronification of LBP remain still
   unclear. The purpose of the present study was to analyse the
   neurostructural alterations in CLBP and to evaluate the role of
   comorbidities and their neurostructural underpinnings.
   In the present study we investigated a well-characterized group of 14
   patients with CLBP and 14 healthy controls applying structural MRI and
   psychometric measures. Using an improved algorithm for brain
   normalization (DARTEL) we performed a voxel-based morphometry (VBM)
   approach. Correlation analyses were performed to evaluate the role of
   anxiety and depression in neurostructural alterations observed in CLBP.
   The psychometric measures revealed significantly higher scores on
   depression and anxiety in the patient population. VBM analysis showed
   significant decreases in grey matter density in areas associated with
   pain processing and modulation, i.e. the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
   the thalamus and the middle cingulate cortex. With respect to anxiety
   and depression scores, we did not observe any correlations to the
   structural data.
   In the present study we found compelling evidence for alterations of
   grey matter architecture in CLBP in brain regions playing a major role
   in pain modulation and control. Our results fit the hypothesis of a
   ``brain signature{''} in chronic pain conditions. The results of the
   psychometric assessment underline the importance of an interdisciplinary
   therapeutic approach including orthopedic, neurological and
   psychological evaluation and treatment.}},

Title = {{Functional similarity of facial emotion processing between people with a
   first episode of psychosis and healthy subjects}},
Journal = {{SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{149}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{35-41}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neurofunctional and behavioral abnormalities in facial
   emotion processing (FEmoP) have been consistently found in schizophrenia
   patients, but studies assessing brain functioning in early phases are
   scarce and the variety of experimental paradigms in current literature
   make comparisons difficult. The present work focuses on assessing FEmoP
   in people experiencing a psychotic episode for the first time with
   different experimental paradigm approaches.
   Methods: Twenty-two patients with a first psychotic episode (FPe)
   (13males) took part in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study
   (1.5 T) examining neural responses to explicit and implicit processing
   of fearful and happy facial expressions presented at two different
   intensities: 50\% and 100\%. Their brain activation was compared to that
   of 31 healthy subjects (15 males).
   Results: Control subjects show differential patterns of brain activation
   regarding the task demands (implicit or explicit processing), the
   emotional content (happy or fear) and the intensities of the emotion
   (50\% or 100\%); such differences are not found in participants with a
   first psychotic episode (FPe). No interaction or group effects are seen
   between control and FPe participants with any of the emotional tasks
   assessed, although FPe subjects show worse behavioral performance.
   Conclusions: No brain areas recruited for FEmoP emerge as significantly
   different between people with a FPe and healthy subjects, independently
   on the demands of the task, the emotion processed, or the intensity of
   the emotion; but FPe participants show a limited recruitment of
   differential brain regions that could be associated with poor emotional
   processing in the short term. Our results outline the need of
   investigating the underlying processes that lead FPe participants to
   worse FEmoP performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to investigate the modulating effects of emotional
   context on pain perception in 16 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome
   (FMS) and 16 healthy control (HC) subjects. An infrared laser was used
   to apply individually adapted painful stimuli to the dorsum of the left
   hand. The emotional background of the painful stimuli was modulated by
   concurrent presentations of negative, neutral, and positive picture
   stimuli selected from the International Affective Picture System. As
   control conditions, painful stimuli and the pictures were also presented
   by themselves. During each of the 5 laser-picture trials, subjects
   received 10 painful stimuli and were asked to rate the average intensity
   and unpleasantness of the experienced pain. Functional magnetic
   resonance images were obtained, using a T2{*} sensitive echo planar
   sequence. HC subjects showed a linear increase in pain intensity and
   unpleasantness ratings when painful stimuli were presented during
   positive, neutral, and negative pictures. In contrast, FMS patients
   showed a quadratic trend for pain intensity ratings indicating a lack of
   pain reduction by the positive pictures. In addition, the FMS patients
   showed less activation in secondary somatosensory cortex, insula,
   orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex during the positive
   picture pain trials. Our results suggest that fibromyalgia patients are
   less efficient in modulating pain by positive affect and may benefit
   less from appetitive events than healthy control subjects. (c) 2013

Abstract = {{An array of brain regions in the fronto-parietal and temporal lobes
   cooperates to process observation and execution of actions performed by
   other individuals. Using functional MRI, we hypothesized that
   vegetarians and vegans might show brain responses to mouth actions
   performed by humans, monkeys, and pigs different from omnivores. We
   scanned 20 omnivores, 19 vegetarians, and 21 vegans while watching a
   series of silent videos, which presented a single mouth action performed
   by a human, a monkey, and a pig. Compared to omnivores, vegetarians and
   vegans have increased functional connectivity between regions of the
   fronto-parietal and temporal lobes versus the cerebellum during
   observation of mouth actions performed by humans and, to the same
   degree, animals. Vegans also had increased connectivity with the
   supplementary motor area. During human mouth actions, increased amygdala
   activity in vegetarians and vegans was found. More critically,
   vegetarians recruited the right middle frontal gyrus and insula, which
   are involved in social mirroring, whereas vegans activated the left
   inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, which are part of the
   mirror neuron system. Monkey mouth actions triggered language network
   activity in both groups, which might be due to the attempt to decode
   monkey mouth gesture, with an additional recruitment of associative
   temporo-occipital areas in vegans, whereas pig mouth actions activated
   empathy-related regions, including the anterior cingulum. These results
   support the role of the action observation-execution matching system in
   social cognition, which enables us to interact not only with our
   conspecifics but also with species in phylogenetic proximity to humans.}},

Abstract = {{The question of how we can voluntarily control our behaviour dates back
   to the beginnings of scientific psychology. Currently, there are two
   empirical research disciplines tackling human volition: cognitive
   neuroscience and social psychology. To date, there is little interaction

   volition. The aim of the current article is to highlight recent brain
   imaging work on human volition and to relate social psychological
   concepts of volition to the functional neuroanatomy of intentional
   action. A host of studies indicate that the medial prefrontal cortex
   plays a crucial role in voluntary action. Accordingly, we postulate that
   social psychological concepts of volition can be investigated using
   neuroimaging techniques, and propose that by developing a social
   cognitive neuroscience of human volition, we may gain a deeper
   understanding of this fascinating and complex aspect of the human mind.}},

Abstract = {{Group identification can lead to a biased view of the world in favor of
   in-group members. Studying the brain processes that underlie such
   in-group biases is important for a wider understanding of the potential
   influence of social factors on basic perceptual processes. In this
   study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   investigate how people perceive the actions of in-group and out-group
   members, and how their biased view in favor of own team members
   manifests itself in the brain. We divided participants into two teams
   and had them judge the relative speeds of hand actions performed by an
   in-group and an out-group member in a competitive situation.
   Participants judged hand actions performed by in-group members as being
   faster than those of out-group members, even when the two actions were
   performed at physically identical speeds. In an additional fMRI
   experiment, we showed that, contrary to common belief, such skewed
   impressions arise from a subtle bias in perception and associated brain
   activity rather than decision-making processes, and that this bias
   develops rapidly and involuntarily as a consequence of group
   affiliation. Our findings suggest that the neural mechanisms that
   underlie human perception are shaped by social context. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Convergent evidence shows that alcohol exerts its effects on social
   behavior via modulation of amygdala reactivity to affective stimuli.
   Given that affective processing involves dynamic interactions between
   the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), alcohol's effects are
   likely to extend beyond regional changes in brain activity to changes
   that manifest on a broader functional circuit level.
   The current study examines alcohol's effects on functional connectivity
   (i.e., ``coupling{''}) between the amygdala and the PFC during the
   processing of socio-emotional stimuli using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI).
   In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects
   cross-over design, 12 heavy, social drinkers performed an fMRI task
   designed to probe amygdala response to socio-emotional stimuli (angry,
   fearful, and happy faces) following acute ingestion of alcohol or
   placebo. Functional connectivity between the amygdala and PFC was
   examined and compared between alcohol and placebo sessions using a
   conventional generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI)
   analysis.
   Relative to placebo, alcohol reduced functional coupling between the
   amygdala and the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during processing of
   both angry and fearful faces. Alcohol also reduced functional coupling
   between the amygdala and left OFC during processing of happy faces.
   These preliminary findings suggest that alcohol's effects on social
   behavior may be mediated by alternations in functional connectivity
   between the amygdala and OFC during processing of emotional faces.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Habituation of the fear response, critical for the treatment
   of anxiety, is inconsistently observed during exposure to threatening
   stimuli. One potential explanation for this inconsistency is
   differential attentional engagement with negatively valenced stimuli as
   a function of anxiety type. Methods: The present study tested this
   hypothesis by examining patterns of neural habituation associated with
   anxious arousal, characterized by panic symptoms and immediate
   engagement with negatively valenced stimuli, versus anxious
   apprehension, characterized by engagement in worry to distract from
   negatively valenced stimuli. Results: As predicted, the two anxiety
   types evidenced distinct patterns of attentional engagement. Anxious
   arousal was associated with immediate activation in attention-related
   brain regions that habituated over time, whereas anxious apprehension
   was associated with delayed activation in attention-related brain
   regions that occurred only after habituation in a worry-related brain
   region. Conclusions: Results further elucidate mechanisms involved in
   attention to negatively valenced stimuli and indicate that anxiety is a
   heterogeneous construct with regard to attention to such stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain is thought to process auditory objects along a
   hierarchical temporal what stream that progressively abstracts object
   information from the low-level structure (e.g., loudness) as processing
   proceeds along the middle-to-anterior direction. Empirical
   demonstrations of abstract object encoding, independent of low-level
   structure, have relied on speech stimuli, and non-speech studies of
   object-category encoding (e.g., human vocalizations) often lack a
   systematic assessment of low-level information (e.g., vocalizations are
   highly harmonic). It is currently unknown whether abstract encoding
   constitutes a general functional principle that operates for auditory
   objects other than speech. We combined multivariate analyses of
   functional imaging data with an accurate analysis of the low-level
   acoustical information to examine the abstract encoding of non-speech
   categories. We observed abstract encoding of the living and human-action
   sound categories in the fine-grained spatial distribution of activity in
   the middle-to-posterior temporal cortex (e.g., planum temporale).
   Abstract encoding of auditory objects appears to extend to non-speech
   biological sounds and to operate in regions other than the anterior
   temporal lobe. Neural processes for the abstract encoding of auditory
   objects might have facilitated the emergence of speech categories in our
   ancestors.}},

Title = {{Reduced but broader prefrontal activity in patients with schizophrenia
   during n-back working memory tasks: A multi-channel near-infrared
   spectroscopy study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Caudal regions of the prefrontal cortex, including the
   dorsolateral (DLPFC) and ventrolateral (VLPFC) prefrontal cortex, are
   involved in essential cognitive functions such as working memory. In
   contrast, more rostral regions, such as the frontopolar cortex (FpC),
   have integrative functions among cognitive functions and thereby
   contribute crucially to real-world social activity. Previous functional
   magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown patients with
   schizophrenia had different DLPFC activity pattern in response to
   cognitive load changes compared to healthy controls; however, the
   spatial relationship between the caudal and rostral prefrontal
   activation has not been evaluated under less-constrained conditions.
   Method: Twenty-six patients with schizophrenia and 26 age-, sex-, and
   premorbid-intelligence-matched healthy controls participated in this
   study. Hemodynamic changes during n-back working memory tasks with
   different cognitive loads were measured using multi-channel
   near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
   Results: Healthy controls showed significant task-related activity in
   the bilateral VLPFC and significant task-related decreased activity in
   the DLPFC, with greater signal changes when the task required more
   cognitive load. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia showed
   activation in the more rostral regions, including bilateral DLPFC and
   FpC. Neither decreased activity nor greater activation in proportion to
   elevated cognitive load occurred.
   Conclusions: This multi-channel NIRS study demonstrated that activation
   intensity did not increase in patients with schizophrenia associated
   with cognitive load changes, suggesting hypo-frontality as cognitive
   impairment in schizophrenia. On the other hand, patients had broader
   prefrontal activity in areas such as the bilateral DLPFC and FpC
   regions, thus suggesting a hyper-frontality compensatory response. (C)

Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{83-93}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the present fMRI study we investigated the responses of the anterior
   supramarginal gyrus (aSMG) to the observation of tool and hand actions.
   Three experiments were carried out. In the first, we studied the
   specificity of the aSMG region for tool action observation, relative to
   the observation of hand action, and compared it with that of neighboring
   parietal regions. This experiment showed that there is a clear
   difference between aSMG and other posterior parietal regions, i.e. the
   putative homologue of anterior intraparietal (phAIP) area, and the
   dorsal intraparietal anterior (DIPSA) area. These regions are also
   activated by tool action observation, but in a way not significantly
   different from that due to hand action observation. The second
   experiment revealed that aSMG is equally activated by observing a tool
   action and a hand action carried out without the typical finger
   movements, but in a rigid way, imitating a tool. This indicates that
   aSMG uses, as visual cues, specific tool-related kinematics parameters.
   The third experiment showed that aSMG is strongly influenced by a
   concomitant attention-demanding acuity task. Taken together, the three
   experiments clearly show that human anterior IPL includes a specific,
   high-level aSMG region devoted to tool-action observation, distinct from
   the biological hand-action observation circuit. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Age constitutes a salient feature of a face and signals group
   membership. There is evidence of greater attention to and better memory
   for own-age than other-age faces. However, little is known about the
   neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying processing differences for
   own-age vs. other-age faces. Even less is known about the impact of
   emotion expressed in faces on such own-age effects. Using fMRI, the
   present study examined brain activity while young and older adult
   participants identified expressions of neutral, happy, and angry young
   and older faces. Across facial expressions, medial prefrontal cortex,
   insula, and (for older participants) amygdala showed greater activity to
   own-age than other-age faces. These own-age effects in ventral medial
   prefrontal cortex and insula held for neutral and happy faces, but not
   for angry faces. This novel and intriguing finding suggests that
   processing of negative facial emotions under some conditions overrides
   age-of-face effects. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Scholars in the disciplines of human resource management (HRM) and
   organizational behavior (OB) have primarily focused on explicit
   processes and measures in their research, but much of human feeling and
   behavior is triggered through implicit processing outside of conscious

   processes interact to shape work emotions, attitudes, and behaviors, and
   we suggest that scholars should incorporate biological measures for
   assessing implicit as well as explicit processes into their research
   designs. We provide guidance for such endeavors by describing how
   several biological implicit measures can be used in HRM and OB research.
   These measures include cortisol measurement, skin conductance, event

Title = {{The social regulation of threat-related attentional disengagement in
   highly anxious individuals}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Social support may normalize stress reactivity among highly anxious
   individuals, yet little research has examined anxious reactions in
   social contexts. We examined the role of both state and trait anxiety in
   the link between social support and the neural response to threat. We
   employed an fMRI paradigm in which participants faced the threat of
   electric shock under three conditions: alone, holding a stranger's hand,
   and holding a friend's hand. We found significant interactions between
   trait anxiety and threat condition in regions including the
   hypothalamus, putamen, precentral gyrus, and precuneus. Analyses
   revealed that highly trait anxious individuals were less active in each
   of these brain regions while alone in the scanner-a pattern that
   suggests the attentional disengagement associated with the perception of
   high intensity threats. These findings support past research suggesting
   that individuals high in anxiety tend to have elevated neural responses
   to mild or moderate threats but paradoxically lower responses to high
   intensity threats, suggesting a curvilinear relationship between anxiety
   and threat responding. We hypothesized that for highly anxious
   individuals, shock cues would be perceived as highly threatening while
   alone in the scanner, possibly due to attentional disengagement, but
   this perception would be mitigated if they were holding someone's hand.
   The disengagement seen in highly anxious people under conditions of high
   perceived threat may thus be alleviated by social proximity. These
   results suggest a role for social support in regulating emotional
   responses in anxious individuals, which may aid in treatment outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Both cognitive and social-cognitive deficits impact functional outcome
   in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation studies indicate that targeted
   cognitive and/or social-cognitive training improves behavioral
   performance on trained skills. However, the neural effects of training
   in schizophrenia and their relation to behavioral gains are largely
   unknown. This study tested whether a 50-h intervention which included
   both cognitive and social-cognitive training would influence neural
   mechanisms that support social ccognition. Schizophrenia participants
   completed a computer-based intervention of either auditory-based
   cognitive training (AT) plus social-cognition training (SCT) (N=11) or
   non-specific computer games (CG) (N=11). Assessments included a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task of facial emotion
   recognition, and behavioral measures of cognition, social cognition, and
   functional outcome. The fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time
   interaction. Results were strongest for emotion recognition of happy,
   surprise and fear: relative to CG participants, AT+SCT participants
   showed a neural activity increase in bilateral amygdala, right putamen
   and right medial prefrontal cortex. Across all participants, pre-to-post
   intervention neural activity increase in these regions predicted
   behavioral improvement on an independent emotion perception measure
   (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Among AT+SCT participants alone, neural
   activity increase in right amygdala predicted behavioral improvement in
   emotion perception. The findings indicate that combined cognition and
   social-cognition training improves neural systems that support
   social-cognition skills. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Nucleus accumbens response to gains in reputation for the self relative
   to gains for others predicts social media use}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Our reputation is important to us; we've experienced natural selection
   to care about our reputation. Recently, the neural processing of gains
   in reputation (positive social feedback concerning one's character) has
   been shown to occur in the human ventral striatum. It is still unclear,
   however, how individual differences in the processing of gains in
   reputation may lead to individual differences in real-world behavior.
   For example, in the real-world, one way that people currently maintain
   their reputation is by using social media websites, like Facebook.
   Furthermore, Facebook use consists of a social comparison component,
   where users observe others' behavior and can compare it to their own.
   Therefore, we hypothesized a relationship between the way the brain
   processes specifically self-relevant gains in reputation and one's
   degree of Facebook use. We recorded functional neuroimaging data while
   participants received gains in reputation, observed the gains in
   reputation of another person, or received monetary reward. We
   demonstrate that across participants, when responding to gains in
   reputation for the self, relative to observing gains for others,
   reward-related activity in the left nucleus accumbens predicts Facebook
   use. However, nucleus accumbens activity in response to monetary reward
   did not predict Facebook use. Finally, a control step-wise regression
   analysis showed that Facebook use primarily explains our results in the
   nucleus accumbens. Overall, our results demonstrate how individual
   sensitivity of the nucleus accumbens to the receipt of self-relevant
   social information leads to differences in real-world behavior.}},

Abstract = {{A series of low molecular weight lanthanide complexes were developed
   that have high H-1 longitudinal relaxivities (r(1)) and the potential to
   be used as dual frequency H-1 and (FMR)-F-19 probes. Their behavior was
   investigated in more detail through relaxometry, pH-potentiometry,
   luminescence, and multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Fitting of the
   (HNMRD)-H-1 and (ONMR)-O-17 profiles demonstrated a very short water
   residence lifetime (<10ns) and an appreciable second sphere effect. At
   lower field strengths (20MHz), two of the complexes displayed a peak in
   r(1) (21.7 and 16.3 mM(-1)s(-1)) caused by an agglomeration, that can be
   disrupted through the addition of phosphate anions. NMR spectroscopy
   revealed that at least two species are present in solution
   interconverting through an intramolecular binding process. Two complexes
   provided a suitable signal in (FNMR)-F-19 spectroscopy and through the
   selection of optimized imaging parameters, phantom images were obtained
   in a MRI scanner at concentrations as low as 1mM. The developed probes
   could be visualized through both H-1 and (FMRI)-F-19, showing their
   capability to function as dual frequency MRI contrast agents.}},

Title = {{Self-related processing and deactivation of cortical midline regions in
   disorders of consciousness}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{Self-related stimuli activate anterior parts of cortical midline
   regions, which normally show task-induced deactivation. Deactivation in
   medial posterior and frontal regions is associated with the ability to
   focus attention on the demands of the task, and therefore, with
   consciousness. Studies investigating patients with impaired
   consciousness, that is, patients in minimally conscious state and
   patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (formerly vegetative
   state), demonstrate that these patients show responses to self-related
   content in the anterior cingulate cortex. However, it remains unclear if
   these responses are an indication for conscious processing of stimuli or
   are due to automatic processing. To shed further light on this issue, we
   investigated responses of cortical midline regions to the own and
   another name in 27 patients with a disorder of consciousness and
   compared them to task-induced deactivation. While almost all of the
   control subjects responding to the own name demonstrated higher
   activation due to the self-related content in anterior midline regions
   and additional deactivation, none of the responding patients did so.
   Differences between groups showed a similar pattern of findings. Despite
   the relation between behavioral responsiveness in patients and
   activation in response to the own name, the findings of this study do
   not provide evidence for a direct association of activation in anterior
   midline regions and conscious processing. The deficits in processing of
   self-referential content in anterior midline regions may rather be due
   to general impairments in cognitive processing and not particularly
   linked to impaired consciousness.}},

Title = {{Comparison of activation patterns between masking and inattention task:
   a coordinate-based meta-analysis of implicit emotional face processing}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies of implicit emotional processing are important for
   understanding the neural mechanisms and its social and evolutionary
   significance. Two major experimental tasks are used to explore the
   mechanisms of implicit emotional processing: masking tasks and
   inattention tasks, both using emotional faces as stimuli. However, it is
   unclear whether they have identical or distinct neural substrates since
   few studies have compared the two tasks. The purpose of the present
   study was to explore the mechanisms of implicit processing of emotional
   faces, and compare the activation patterns between different tasks.
   Through a literature search, 41 studies exploring implicit processing of
   emotional faces were collected. A total of 830 healthy subjects and 513
   foci were obtained. Separate activation likelihood estimation (ALE)
   meta-analyses were conducted for the entire group of studies and for
   different tasks for comparison purposes. The results showed that there
   were differences, as well as overlap, in activation patterns between
   masking and inattention tasks. Bilateral amygdala, middle occipital
   gyrus and fusiform gyrus were activated across both tasks. While masking
   tasks were more associated with inferior temporal gyrus, parahippocampal
   gyrus and amygdala, inattention tasks were more associated with right
   fusiform gyrus. The differences in activation patterns between masking
   and inattention tasks may be indicative of separate mechanisms
   underlying early and late stages of implicit emotional face processing.}},

Title = {{Altered Pattern of Spontaneous Brain Activity in the Patients with
   End-Stage Renal Disease: A Resting-State Functional MRI Study with
   Regional Homogeneity Analysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the pattern of spontaneous neural activity in
   patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with and without
   neurocognitive dysfunction using resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with a regional homogeneity (ReHo)
   algorithm.
   Materials and Methods: rs-fMRI data were acquired in 36 ESRD patients
   (minimal nephro-encephalopathy {[}MNE], n = 19, 13 male, 37+/-12.07
   years; non-nephro-encephalopathy {[}non-NE], n = 17, 11 male, 38+/-12.13
   years) and 20 healthy controls (13 male, 7 female, 36+/-10.27 years).
   Neuropsychological (number connection test type A {[}NCT-A], digit
   symbol test {[}DST]) and laboratory tests were performed in all
   patients. The Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) was used to
   measure the regional homogeneity for each subject. The regional
   homogeneity maps were compared using ANOVA tests among MNE, non-NE, and
   healthy control groups and post hoc t-tests between each pair in a
   voxel-wise way. A multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate
   the relationships between ReHo index and NCT-A, DST scores, serum
   creatinine and urea levels, disease and dialysis duration.
   Results: Compared with healthy controls, both MNE and non-NE patients
   showed decreased ReHo in the multiple areas of bilateral frontal,
   parietal and temporal lobes. Compared with the non-NE, MNE patients
   showed decreased ReHo in the right inferior parietal lobe (IPL), medial
   frontal cortex (MFC) and left precuneus (PCu). The NCT-A scores and
   serum urea levels of ESRD patients negatively correlated with ReHo
   values in the frontal and parietal lobes, while DST scores positively
   correlated with ReHo values in the bilateral PCC/precuneus, MFC and
   inferior parietal lobe (IPL) (all P<0.05, AlphaSim corrected). No
   significant correlations were found between any regional ReHo values and
   disease duration, dialysis duration and serum creatinine values in ESRD
   patients (all P>0.05, AlphaSim corrected).
   Conclusion: Diffused decreased ReHo values were found in both MNE and
   non-NE patients. The progressively decreased ReHo in the default mode
   network (DMN), frontal and parietal lobes might be trait-related in MNE.
   The ReHo analysis may be potentially valuable for elucidating
   neurocognitive abnormalities of ESRD patients and detecting the
   development from non-NE to MNE.}},

Abstract = {{Face processing is a neural mechanism that allows understanding social
   information and cues conveyed by faces, whose dysfunction has been
   postulated to underlie some of the behavioral impairments characterizing
   Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). A special region of the cortex, the
   Fusiform Gyms (FG), is believed to be the specific area for processing
   face features and emotions. However, behavioral, fMRI and ERP studies
   addressed to investigate the role of FG dysfunction in ASD have led to
   conflicting results. Using a high-density EEG system, we recorded the
   face-sensitive ERP to neutral and emotional (happiness and fearful)
   faces, as a measure of early activity of the FG, in children with high
   functioning ASD. By controlling a number of experimental and clinical
   variables that could have biased previous research such as gaze
   direction, attention to tasks, stimulus appearance and clinical profiles
   - we aimed to assess the effective role of the FG in the face emotion
   processing deficit hypothesized in ASD. No significant differences in
   early face-sensitive ERP components were found between ASD and
   neurotypical children. However, a systematic latency delay and amplitude
   reduction of all early potentials were observed in the ASD group,
   regardless of the stimulus, although more evident for emotions.
   Therefore, we can assume a diffuse dysfunction of neural mechanisms and
   networks in driving and integrating social information conveyed by
   faces, in particular when emotions are involved, rather than a specific
   impairment of the FG-related face processing circuit. Nevertheless,
   there is need of further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Background: Polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR)
   modulate amygdala activity in healthy individuals. Increased responses
   to negative stimuli in carriers of low transcription alleles have been
   proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of depression. We sought to
   investigate the effects of genotype as well as diagnosis in patients
   with depression.
   Methods: Subjects with recurrent depression (n=67) and matched healthy
   controls (n=49) participated in a fMRI task of implicit processing of
   sad facial stimuli. Effects of biallelic (short (S) and long (L)
   alleles) and triallelic (including rs25531 A/G single nucleotide
   variation) models of 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on amygdala activity and
   connectivity were investigated.
   Results: Significant effects were observed of both genotype and
   diagnosis on amygdala activity. Increased amygdala activity was
   associated with 5-HTTLPR genotype in low transcription allele carriers
   as well as with a diagnosis of depression. The connectivity analysis
   revealed a main effect of genotype with reduced connectivity to the
   subgenual region of the anterior cingulate in carriers of the low
   transcription alleles. There was also a main effect of diagnosis with
   reduced connectivity to the dorsal region of the anterior cingulate and
   to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in depression. There were no
   interaction effects between genotype and diagnosis in amygdala activity
   or connectivity.
   Conclusions: Significant independent effects of genotype and diagnosis
   on amygdala responsivity were revealed. The effects of genotype and
   diagnosis on amygdala connectivity showed a regional segregation,
   suggesting that 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms bias frontal-limbic connectivity
   while the development of depression involves more extensive neural
   disturbances. These findings point to the potential of connectivity maps
   as a diagnostic biomarker for depression. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Unfairness plays an important role in economic decision making. This
   fMRI study sought to investigate how the loss and the gain contexts
   could modulate behavioral and brain responses to unfairness by focusing
   on participants' rejection behaviors during an Ultimatum Game paradigm.
   Participants were scanned while they were playing the Ultimatum Game as
   responders in both loss and gain contexts, i.e. receiving (sic)50 as
   gains and paying for (sic)50 as losses. At the behavioral level, lower
   fairness ratings and higher rejection rates were revealed for unfair
   losses than unfair gains. At the neural level, left dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate
   cortex/anterior middle cingulate cortex and bilateral dorsal striatum
   were associated with rejection (vs. acceptance) in the loss context, but
   not in the gain context. Together, our data indicated that participants
   may experience more unfairness in UG and stronger desire to sanction
   social norm violations in the loss context than in the gain context,
   inducing more fairness-related neutral activities when rejecting (vs.
   accepting) unfair losses than unfair gains. These findings shed light on
   the significance of context (i.e. loss or gain) in fairness-related

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{The appraisal of violent stimuli is dependent on the social context and
   the perceiver's individual characteristics. To identify the specific
   neural circuits involved in the perception of violent videos, forty-nine
   male participants were scanned with functional MRI while watching
   video-clips depicting Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and Capoeira as a
   baseline. Prior to scanning, a self-report measure of pleasure or
   displeasure when watching MMA was collected. Watching MMA was associated
   with activation of the anterior insula (AI), brainstem, ventral
   tegmental area (VTA), striatum, medial, and lateral prefrontal cortex,
   orbitofrontal cortex, somatosensory cortex, and supramarginal gyrus.
   While this pattern of brain activation was not related to participants'
   reported experience of pleasure or displeasure, pleasurable ratings of
   MMA predicted increased functional connectivity (FC) seeded in the
   nucleus accumbens (NAcc) (a structure known to be responsive to
   anticipating both positive and negative outcomes) with the subgenual
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insular cortex (AIC)
   (regions involved in positive feelings and visceral somatic
   representations). Displeasure ratings of MMA were related to increased
   FC with regions of the prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule,
   structures implicated in cognitive control and executive attention.
   These data suggest that functional connectivity is an effective approach
   to investigate the relationship between subjective feelings of pleasure
   and pain of neural structures known to respond to both the anticipation
   of positive and negative outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated disruption in structural and
   functional connectivity occurring in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD).
   However, it is not known how these disruptions alter brain network

   patterns between the AD group and the cognitively normal control (CN)

   the insula module) in the CN group was broken down to the pieces in the
   AD group. Specifically, it was discovered that the eight pairs of the
   bilateral regions (the opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus, area
   triangularis, insula, putamen, globus pallidus, transverse temporal
   gyri, superior temporal gyrus, and superior temporal pole) of the insula
   module had lost symmetric functional connection properties, and the
   corresponding gray matter concentration (GMC) was significant lower in
   AD group. We further quantified the functional connectivity changes with
   an index (index A) and structural changes with the GMC index in the
   insula module to demonstrate their great potential as AD biomarkers. We
   further validated these results with six additional independent datasets
   (271 subjects in six groups). Our results demonstrated specific
   underlying structural and functional reorganization from young to old,
   and for diseased subjects. Further, it is suggested that by combining
   the structural GMC analysis and functional modular analysis in the
   insula module, a new biomarker can be developed at the single-subject
   level.}},

Title = {{Functional and structural connectivity of frontostriatal circuitry in
   Autism Spectrum Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{Abnormalities in frontostriatal circuitry potentially underlie the two
   core deficits in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); social interaction and
   communication difficulties and restricted interests and repetitive
   behaviors. Whilst a few studies have examined connectivity within this
   circuitry in ASD, no previous study has examined both functional and
   structural connectivity within the same population. The present study
   provides the first exploration of both functional and structural
   frontostriatal connectivity in ASD. Twenty-eight right-handed Caucasian
   male ASD (17.28 +/- 3.57 years) and 27 right-handed male, age and IQ
   matched controls (17.15 +/- 3.64 years) took part in the study. Resting
   state functional connectivity was carried out on 21 ASD and control
   participants, and tractography was carried out on 22 ASD and 24 control
   participants, after excluding subjects for excessive motion and poor
   data quality. Functional connectivity analysis was carried out between
   the frontal cortex and striatum after which tractography was performed
   between regions that showed significant group differences in functional
   connectivity. The ASD group showed increased functional connectivity
   between regions in the frontal cortex {[}anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), paracingulate gyrus (Pcg) and
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)], and striatum {[}nucleus accumbens (NAcc)
   and caudate]. Increased functional connectivity between ACC and caudate
   was associated with deactivation to social rewards in the caudate, as
   previously reported in the same participants. Greater connectivity
   between the right MFG and caudate was associated with higher restricted
   interests and repetitive behaviors and connectivity between the
   bilateral Pcg and NAcc, and the right OFC and NAcc, was negatively
   associated with social and communicative deficits. Although tracts were
   reliably constructed for each subject, there were no group differences
   in structural connectivity. Results are in keeping with previously
   reported increased corticostriatal functional connectivity in ASD.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{244}},
Pages = {{90-98}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{Deceit is a core feature of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), and
   the study of deception in ASPD has important implications for
   identifying the underlying mechanism of ASPD. A great deal of functional
   neuroimaging literature has described the neural correlates of deception
   in healthy volunteers, but there have been few imaging studies examining
   people with ASPD. The neural correlates of lie-telling in ASPD, and
   which specific brain activities are related to the capacity to lie, are
   unclear. In this study, 32 offenders who satisfied the Personality
   Diagnostic Questionaire-4 and PDI-IV (Personality Disorder Interview)
   criteria for ASPD were divided into three groups based on their capacity
   for deception, which was evaluated based on the deceitfulness criterion
   of the PDI-IV ASPD. All offenders underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) while responding to questions in a truthful,
   inverse, or deceitful manner. We primarily created contrasts in the
   brain activities between truth-telling and lie-telling, and then
   computed the Pearson's correlation coefficients between activities
   contrasts of individual, i.e. BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent)
   strength during deception minus that during truth-telling, and the
   capacity for deception. Our results indicated that the bilateral
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex extending to the middle frontal gyrus,
   the left inferior parietal lobule, and the bilateral anterior cingulate
   gyrus/medial superior frontal gyrus were associated with deception among
   people with ASPD. As the capacity for deception increased, the
   contrasted brain activities of the above regions decreased. This study
   found that truthful and untruthful communications of ASPD subjects can
   be differentiated in terms of brain BOLD activities, and more
   importantly, this study is the first to use fMRI to discover that BOLD
   activities during deception are correlated with the capacity to lie. The
   latter finding might challenge the diagnostic accuracy, of lie detection
   and may also caution that greater attention should be given to detecting
   untruths in individuals who are skilled at lying. (c) 2013 IBRO.

Abstract = {{This article draws an analogy between physical nonverbal gesture and the
   textual conventions of new and social media to argue that the vital
   nonverbal functions of face-to-face communication are not absent from
   digital media, but that communicative functions typically enacted
   nonverbally are transposed into new spaces of interaction afforded by
   synchronous and near-synchronous textual media. Digital and social media
   text is conversational text that fulfills the phatic needs of typical
   social interaction: `keeping in touch' does not in any way constitute a
   cultural regression but represents the fundamental ground of human
   cognition, which is inescapably both social and technologically
   dependent. An analysis of examples from the popular microblogging
   service Twitter serves to illustrate the gestural functions of digital
   media text, including the enactment of mediated social `spaces'. The
   closing section explores the theoretical implications for identity and
   agency of connecting embodied nonverbal communication to digital media
   communication that is all too often erroneously understood to be or
   implicitly approached as `disembodied'.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is ``gold standard{''} psychotherapy
   for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Cognitive models posit that
   preferential processing of threat mediates excessive forms of anxiety,
   which is supported by exaggerated amygdala, insula, and cortical
   reactivity to threatening socio-emotional signals in SAD. However,
   little is known about neural predictors of CBT success or the mechanisms
   by which CBT exerts its therapeutic effects. Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted during responses to social
   signals of threat (fearful/angry faces) against positive signals (happy
   faces) in 14 patients with SAD before and after 12 weeks of CBT. For
   comparison, 14 healthy control (HC) participants also underwent two fMRI
   scans, 12 weeks apart. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses showed
   therapeutic success was predicted by enhanced pre-treatment activation
   to threatening faces in higher-order visual (superior and middle
   temporal gyrus), cognitive, and emotion processing areas (dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex). Moreover, a
   group by time interaction was revealed in prefrontal regions
   (dorsomedial, medial gyrus) and insula. The interaction was driven by
   relatively greater activity during threat processing in SAD, which
   significantly reduced after CBT but did not significantly predict
   response to CBT. Therefore, pre-treatment cortical hyperactivity to
   social threat signals may serve as a prognostic indicator of CBT success
   in SAD. Collectively, CBT-related brain changes involved a reduction in
   activity in insula, prefrontal, and extrastriate regions. Results are
   consistent with cognitive models, which associate decreases in threat
   processing bias with recovery. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Human neuroimaging offers a powerful way to connect animal and human
   research on emotion, with profound implications for psychological
   science. However, the gulf between animal and human studies remains a
   formidable obstacle: human studies typically focus on the cortex and a
   few subcortical regions such as the amygdala, whereas deeper structures
   such as the brainstem periaqueductal gray (PAG) play a key role in
   animal models. Here, we directly assessed the role of PAG in human
   affect by interleaving in a single fMRI session two conditions known to
   elicit strong emotional responses-physical pain and negative image
   viewing. Negative affect and PAG activity increased in both conditions.
   We next examined eight independent data sets, half featuring pain
   stimulation and half negative image viewing. In sum, these data sets
   comprised 198 additional participants. We found increased activity in
   PAG in all eight studies. Taken together, these findings suggest PAG is
   a key component of human affective responses.}},

Abstract = {{Person perception is a dynamic, evolving process. Because other people
   are an endless source of social information, people need to update their
   impressions of others based upon new information. We devised an fMRI
   study to identify brain regions involved in updating impressions.
   Participants saw faces paired with valenced behavioral information and
   were asked to form impressions of these individuals. Each face was seen
   five times in a row, each time with a different behavioral description.
   Critically, for half of the faces the behaviors were evaluatively
   consistent, while for the other half they were inconsistent. In line
   with prior work, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was associated
   with forming impressions of individuals based on behavioral information.
   More importantly, a whole-brain analysis revealed a network of other
   regions associated with updating impressions of individuals who
   exhibited evaluatively inconsistent behaviors, including rostrolateral
   PFC, superior temporal sulcus, right inferior parietal lobule and
   posterior cingulate cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Neurobiological investigations of empathy often support an embodied
   simulation account. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   we monitored statistical associations between brain activations
   indicating self-focused threat to those indicating threats to a familiar
   friend or an unfamiliar stranger. Results in regions such as the
   anterior insula, putamen and supramarginal gyrus indicate that
   self-focused threat activations are robustly correlated with
   friend-focused threat activations but not stranger-focused threat
   activations. These results suggest that one of the defining features of
   human social bonding may be increasing levels of overlap between neural
   representations of self and other. This article presents a novel and
   important methodological approach to fMRI empathy studies, which informs
   how differences in brain activation can be detected in such studies and
   how covariate approaches can provide novel and important information
   regarding the brain and empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the philosophical notion that language embodies thought we
   investigated whether a habitual tendency for intrusive thought that
   younger and older participants report over a period of 100 sessions,
   spread out over about 6 months, is associated with brain regions related
   to language production. In favour of this hypothesis, we found that
   individual differences in habitual intrusive thoughts are correlated
   with activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, Broca's area) as
   well as the cingulate cortex (CC) during a two-choice reaction-time task
   in fMRI. Participants who habitually tended to experience intrusive
   thoughts showed greater activity during task-free (baseline) compared to
   task periods in brain regions involved in language production. Task
   performance was unrelated to individual differences in intrusive
   thoughts. We conclude that intrusive thoughts may be represented in a
   language-like format and that individuals reporting a habitually higher
   tendency for intrusive thoughts may have stronger and more habitual
   inner speech processes.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) have difficulties in
   social interaction and communication, which is reflected in
   hypoactivation of brain regions engaged in social processing, such as
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala and insula. Resting state
   studies in ASC have identified reduced connectivity of the default mode
   network (DMN), which includes mPFC, suggesting that other resting state
   networks incorporating `social' brain regions may also be abnormal.
   Using Seed-based Connectivity and Group Independent Component Analysis
   (ICA) approaches, we looked at resting functional connectivity in ASC
   between specific `social' brain regions, as well as within and between
   whole networks incorporating these regions. We found reduced functional
   connectivity within the DMN in individuals with ASC, using both ICA and
   seed-based approaches. Two further networks identified by ICA, the
   salience network, incorporating the insula and a medial temporal lobe
   network, incorporating the amygdala, showed reduced inter-network
   connectivity. This was underlined by reduced seed-based connectivity
   between the insula and amygdala. The results demonstrate significantly
   reduced functional connectivity within and between resting state
   networks incorporating `social' brain regions. This reduced connectivity
   may result in difficulties in communication and integration of
   information across these networks, which could contribute to the
   impaired processing of social signals in ASC.}},

Abstract = {{In our study, we tried to clarify whether patients with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) reveal different moral decision patterns as compared to
   healthy subjects and whether common social interaction difficulties in
   ASD are reflected in altered brain activation during different aspects
   of moral reasoning. 28 patients with high-functioning ASD and 28 healthy
   subjects matched for gender, age and education took part in an
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Participants
   were confronted with textual dilemma situations followed by proposed
   solutions to which they could agree or disagree. On a neural level,
   moral decision making was associated with activation in anterior medial
   prefrontal regions, the temporo-parietal junction and the precuneus for
   both groups. However, while patients and healthy controls did not
   exhibit significant behavioral differences, ASD patients showed
   decreased activation in limbic regions, particularly the amygdala, as
   well as increased activation in the anterior and the posterior cingulate
   gyrus during moral reasoning. Alterations of brain activation in
   patients might thus indicate specific impairments in empathy. However,
   activation increases in brain regions associated with the `default mode
   network' and self-referential cognition also provide evidence for an
   altered way of patients' cerebral processing with regard to decision
   making based on social information.}},

Abstract = {{The monetary incentive delay (MID) task (Knutson, 2000) is an imaging
   paradigm used to measure neural activity of incentive receipt
   anticipation. The task reliably elicits striatal activation and is
   commonly used with both adult and adolescent populations, but is not
   designed for use with children. In the current article, we present data
   on the newly designed `pinata task' a child-friendly analog of the MID
   task. We demonstrate the task can be used successfully in children to
   study the neural correlates of anticipatory incentive processing.
   Results from a behavioral study and a neuroimaging study are reported.
   In Study \#1, a sample of 8- to 14-year-old children demonstrates
   expected behavioral effects: subjects responded most quickly and most
   accurately on trials with greater potential rewards; older children
   displayed faster reaction times than younger. In Study \#2, 8- to
   12-year-old children showed neural activation patterns consistent with
   those seen in adults in the MID task: activation was modulated by cue
   incentive value in reward-processing regions, including the striatum,
   thalamus, mesial prefrontal cortex and insula. Study results suggest
   that the pinata task is a valid analog of the MID task, and can be used
   to assess neural correlates of reward processing in children as young as
   8-9 years of age.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we examined the relationship between developmental
   modulation of socioaffective brain systems and adolescents'
   preoccupation with social evaluation. Child, adolescent, and adult
   participants viewed cues indicating that a camera was alternately off,
   warming up, or projecting their image to a peer during the acquisition
   of behavioral-, autonomic-, and neural-response (functional MRI) data.
   Believing that a peer was actively watching them was sufficient to
   induce self-conscious emotion that rose in magnitude from childhood to
   adolescence and partially subsided into adulthood. Autonomic arousal was
   uniquely heightened in adolescents. These behavioral patterns were
   paralleled by emergent engagement of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
   and striatum-MPFC connectivity during adolescence, which are thought to
   promote motivated social behavior in adolescence. These findings
   demonstrate that adolescents' self-consciousness is related to
   age-dependent sensitivity of brain systems critical to socioaffective
   processes. Further, unique interactions between the MPFC and striatum
   may provide a mechanism by which social-evaluation contexts influence
   adolescent behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathy is a personality disorder associated with a profound lack of
   empathy. Neuroscientists have associated empathy and its interindividual
   variation with how strongly participants activate brain regions involved
   in their own actions, emotions and sensations while viewing those of
   others. Here we compared brain activity of 18 psychopathic offenders
   with 26 control subjects while viewing video clips of emotional hand
   interactions and while experiencing similar interactions. Brain regions
   involved in experiencing these interactions were not spontaneously
   activated as strongly in the patient group while viewing the video
   clips. However, this group difference was markedly reduced when we
   specifically instructed participants to feel with the actors in the
   videos. Our results suggest that psychopathy is not a simple incapacity
   for vicarious activations but rather reduced spontaneous vicarious
   activations co-existing with relatively normal deliberate counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{The role of language in exact calculation is the subject of debate. Some
   behavioral and functional neuroimaging investigations of healthy
   participants suggest that calculation requires language resources.
   However, there are also reports of individuals with severe aphasic
   language impairment who retain calculation ability. One possibility in
   resolving these discordant findings is that the neural basis of
   calculation has undergone significant reorganization in aphasic
   calculators. Using fMRI, we examined brain activations associated with
   exact addition and subtraction in two patients with severe agrammatic
   aphasia and retained calculation ability. Behavior and brain activations
   during two-digit addition and subtraction were compared to those of a
   group of 11 healthy, age-matched controls. Behavioral results confirmed
   that both patients retained calculation ability. Imaging findings
   revealed individual differences in processing, but also a similar
   activation pattern across patients and controls in bilateral parietal
   cortices. Patients differed from controls in small areas of increased
   activation in peri-lesional regions, a shift from left fronto-temporal
   activation to the contralateral region, and increased activations in
   bilateral superior parietal regions. Our results suggest that bilateral
   parietal cortex represents the core of the calculation network and,
   while healthy controls may recruit language resources to support
   calculation, these mechanisms are not mandatory in adult cognition. (C)

Title = {{Sex Differences in Verbal Fluency during Adolescence: A Functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study in Gender Dysphoric and Control Boys
   and Girls}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. In the literature, verbal fluency (VF) is generally
   described as a female-favoring task. Although it is conceivable that
   this sex difference only evolves during adolescence or adulthood under
   influence of sex steroids, this has never been investigated in young
   adolescents.
   Aim. First, to assess sex differences in VF performance and regional
   brain activation in adolescents. Second, to determine if untreated
   transsexual adolescents differ from their sex of birth with regard to VF
   performance and regional brain activation.
   Method. Twenty-five boys, 26 girls, 8 Male-to-Female transsexual
   adolescents (MtFs), and 14 Female-to-Male transsexual adolescents (FtMs)
   were tested in a cross-sectional study, while performing a phonetic and
   semantic VF task within an MRI scanner.
   Main Outcome Measures. Functional MRI response during VF task.
   Results. Boys and girls produced similar amounts of words, but the group
   MtFs produced significantly more words in the phonetic condition
   compared to control boys, girls, and FtMs. During the semantic
   condition, no differences were found. With regard to brain activity,
   control boys showed more activation in the right Rolandic operculum, a
   small area adjacent to Broca's area, compared to girls. No significant
   differences in brain activity were found comparing transsexual
   adolescents, although sub-threshold activation was found in the right
   Rolandic operculum indicating a trendwise increase in activation from
   control girls to FtMs to MtFs to control boys.
   Conclusions. The better performance of MtFs is consistent with our
   expectation that MtFs perform better on female-favoring tasks. Moreover,
   they produced more words than girls and FtMs. Even though a trendwise
   linear increase in brain activity between the four groups only
   approached significance, it may indicate differences in individuals with
   gender identity disorder compared to their birth sex. Although our
   findings should thus be interpreted with caution, they suggest a
   biological basis for both transgender groups performing in-between the
   two sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Although neutral faces do not initially convey an explicit emotional
   message, it has been found that individuals tend to assign them an
   affective content. Moreover, previous research has shown that affective
   judgments are mediated by the task they have to perform. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging in 21 healthy participants, we
   focus this study on the cerebral activity patterns triggered by neutral
   and emotional faces in two different tasks (social or gender judgments).
   Results obtained, using conjunction analyses, indicated that viewing
   both emotional and neutral faces evokes activity in several similar
   brain areas indicating a common neural substrate. Moreover, neutral
   faces specifically elicit activation of cerebellum, frontal and temporal
   areas, while emotional faces involve the cuneus, anterior cingulated
   gyrus, medial orbitofrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal gyrus,
   precentral/postcentral gyrus and insula. The task selected was also
   found to influence brain activity, in that the social task recruited
   frontal areas while the gender task involved the posterior cingulated,
   inferior parietal lobule and middle temporal gyrus to a greater extent.
   Specifically, in the social task viewing neutral faces was associated
   with longer reaction times and increased activity of left dorsolateral
   frontal cortex compared with viewing facial expressions of emotions. In
   contrast, in the same task emotional expressions distinctively activated
   the left amygdale. The results are discussed taking into consideration
   the fact that, like other facial expressions, neutral expressions are
   usually assigned some emotional significance. However, neutral faces
   evoke a greater activation of circuits probably involved in more
   elaborate cognitive processing.}},

Abstract = {{Scholars have documented similarities in the way voice and music convey
   emotions. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we
   explored whether these similarities imply overlapping processing
   substrates. We asked participants to trace changes in either the emotion
   or pitch of vocalizations and music using a joystick. Compared to music,
   vocalizations more strongly activated superior and middle temporal
   cortex, cuneus, and precuneus. However, despite these differences,
   overlapping rather than differing regions emerged when comparing emotion
   with pitch tracing for music and vocalizations, respectively. Relative
   to pitch tracing, emotion tracing activated medial superior frontal and
   anterior cingulate cortex regardless of stimulus type. Additionally, we
   observed emotion specific effects in primary and secondary auditory
   cortex as well as in medial frontal cortex that were comparable for
   voice and music. Together these results indicate that similar mechanisms
   support emotional inferences from vocalizations and music and that these
   mechanisms tap on a general system involved in social cognition. Hum

Abstract = {{Social phobia (SP) and panic disorder (PD) have been associated with
   aberrant amygdala responses to threat-related stimuli. The aim of the
   present study was to examine amygdala function and its connectivity with
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during emotional face perception in PD
   and SP, and the role of illness severity. Blood oxygen level dependent
   responses while perceiving emotional facial expressions were compared in
   14 patients with PD, 17 patients with SP, 8 patients with comorbid PD
   and SP, and 16 healthy controls. We found that PD, but not SP, was
   associated with amygdala and lingual gyrus hypoactivation during
   perception of angry, fearful, happy and neutral faces, compared to
   healthy participants. No significant effect of PD and SP diagnoses was
   found on amygdala-mPFC connectivity. A positive correlation of anxiety
   symptom severity was found on amygdala-dorsal anterior cingulate and
   dorsal mPFC connectivity during perception of fearful faces. Amygdala
   hypoactivation suggests reduced responsiveness to positive and negative
   emotional faces in PD. Symptom severity, but not the presence of PD and
   SP diagnosis per se, explains most of the abnormalities in amygdala-mPFC
   connectivity during perception of fearful faces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with altered
   face processing and decreased activity in brain regions involved in face
   processing. The neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to promote face
   processing and modulate brain activity in healthy adults. The present
   study examined the effects of oxytocin on the neural basis of face
   processing in adults with Asperger syndrome (AS).
   Methods: A group of 14 individuals with AS and a group of 14
   neurotypical control participants performed a face-matching and a
   house-matching task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. The
   effects of a single dose of 24 IU intranasally administered oxytocin
   were tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject,
   cross-over design.
   Results: Under placebo, the AS group showed decreased activity in the
   right amygdala, fusiform gyrus, and inferior occipital gyrus compared
   with the control group during face processing. After oxytocin treatment,
   right amygdala activity to facial stimuli increased in the AS group.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that oxytocin increases the
   saliency of social stimuli and in ASD and suggest that oxytocin might
   promote face processing and eye contact in individuals with ASD as
   prerequisites for neurotypical social interaction.}},

Title = {{Default Mode Network in Childhood Autism: Posteromedial Cortex
   Heterogeneity and Relationship with Social Deficits}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{212-219}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: The default mode network (DMN), a brain system anchored in
   the posteromedial cortex, has been identified as underconnected in
   adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, to date there have
   been no attempts to characterize this network and its involvement in
   mediating social deficits in children with ASD. Furthermore, the
   functionally heterogeneous profile of the posteromedial cortex raises
   questions regarding how altered connectivity manifests in specific
   functional modules within this brain region in children with ASD.
   Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and an
   anatomically informed approach were used to investigate the functional
   connectivity of the DMN in 20 children with ASD and 19 age-, gender-,
   and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children. Multivariate
   regression analyses were used to test whether altered patterns of
   connectivity are predictive of social impairment severity.
   Results: Compared with TD children, children with ASD demonstrated
   hyperconnectivity of the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices
   with predominately medial and anterolateral temporal cortex. In
   contrast, the precuneus in ASD children demonstrated hypoconnectivity
   with visual cortex, basal ganglia, and locally within the posteromedial
   cortex. Aberrant posterior cingulate cortex hyperconnectivity was linked
   with severity of social impairments in ASD, whereas precuneus
   hypoconnectivity was unrelated to social deficits. Consistent with
   previous work in healthy adults, a functionally heterogeneous profile of
   connectivity within the posteromedial cortex in both TD and ASD children
   was observed.
   Conclusions: This work links hyperconnectivity of DMN-related circuits
   to the core social deficits in young children with ASD and highlights
   fundamental aspects of posteromedial cortex heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{It was the aim of this study to delineate the areas along the right
   superior temporal sulcus (STS) for processing of faces, voices, and
   face-voice integration using established functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) localizers and to assess their structural connectivity
   profile with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We combined this approach
   with an fMRI adaptation design during which the participants judged
   emotions in facial expressions and prosody and demonstrated response
   habituation in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) which occurred
   irrespective of the sensory modality. These functional data were in line
   with DTI findings showing separable fiber projections of the three
   different STS modules converging in the OFC which run through the
   external capsule for the voice area, through the dorsal superior
   longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) for the face area and through the ventral
   SLF for the audiovisual integration area. The OFC was structurally
   connected with the supplementary motor area (SMA) and activation in
   these two areas was correlated with faster stimulus evaluation during
   repetition priming. Based on these structural and functional properties,
   we propose that the OFC is part of the extended system for perception of
   emotional information in faces and voices and constitutes a neural
   interface linking sensory areas with brain regions implicated in
   generation of behavioral responses. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that taking into account another person's
   perspective to guide decisions is more difficult when their perspective
   is incongruent from one's own compared to when it is congruent. Here we
   used dynamic causal modelling (DCM) for functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to investigate effective connectivity between prefrontal
   and posterior brain regions in a task that requires participants to take
   into account another person's perspective in order to guide the
   selection of an action. Using a new procedure to score model evidence
   without computationally costly estimation, we conducted an exhaustive
   search for the best of all possible models. The results elucidate how
   the activity in the areas from our previously reported analysis
   (Dumontheil et al., 2010) are causally linked and how the connections
   are modulated by both the social as well as executive task demands of
   the task. We find that the social demands modulate the backward
   connections from the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) more strongly than
   the forward connections from the superior occipital gyrus (SOG) and the
   medial temporal gyrus (MTG) to the MPFC. This was also the case for the
   backward connection from the MTG to the SOG. Conversely, the executive
   task demands modulated the forward connections of the SOG and the MTG to
   the MPFC more strongly than the backward connections. We interpret the
   results in terms of hierarchical predictive coding. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the physical attributes of objects is commonly assumed to
   be distributed near their respective modality-specific brain regions.
   The exact neural correlates for such knowledge, especially how it is
   maintained in the resting state, are largely unknown. In the current
   study, we explored the intrinsic neural basis related to a specific type
   of object knowledge color by investigating the relationship between
   spontaneous brain activity and color knowledge behavioral performance.
   We correlated the regional amplitude of spontaneous low-frequency
   fluctuations (ALFF, a resting-state fMRI parameter) with healthy
   participants' performance on two object color knowledge tasks (object
   color verification and color attribute judgment). We found that ALFF in
   bilateral lingual and fusiform gyri and right inferior occipital gyrus
   reliably predicted participants' color knowledge performance
   (correlation coefficients = 055-0.70), and that calcarine cortex showed
   a similar trend, although less stable. Furthermore, the ALFF-behavior
   correlations for other types of object knowledge (i.e. form, motion and
   sound) in these regions were minimal and significantly lower than those
   for color knowledge, suggesting that the effects in the observed regions
   were not merely due to general object processing. Furthermore, we showed
   that functional connectivity strengths of the lingual/fusiform and
   inferior occipital regions are significantly associated with color
   knowledge performance, indicating that they work as a network to support
   color knowledge processing or the acquisition of such knowledge. Our
   findings show the critical role of ventral medial occipito-temporal
   regions in processing or acquiring color knowledge and highlight the
   behavioral significance of spontaneous brain activity in the resting
   state. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate classification algorithms are powerful tools for predicting
   cognitive or pathophysiological states from neuroimaging data. Assessing
   the utility of a classifier in application domains such as cognitive
   neuroscience, brain-computer interfaces, or clinical diagnostics
   necessitates inference on classification performance at more than one
   level, i.e., both in individual subjects and in the population from
   which these subjects were sampled. Such inference requires models that
   explicitly account for both fixed-effects (within-subjects) and
   random-effects (between-subjects) variance components. While models of
   this sort are standard in mass-univariate analyses of fMRI data, they
   have not yet received much attention in multivariate classification
   studies of neuroimaging data, presumably because of the high
   computational costs they entail. This paper extends a recently developed
   hierarchical model for mixed-effects inference in multivariate
   classification studies and introduces an efficient variational Bayes
   approach to inference. Using both synthetic and empirical fMRI data, we
   show that this approach is equally simple to use as, yet more powerful
   than, a conventional t-test on subject-specific sample accuracies, and
   computationally much more efficient than previous sampling algorithms
   and permutation tests. Our approach is independent of the type of
   underlying classifier and thus widely applicable. The present framework
   may help establish mixed-effects inference as a future standard for
   classification group analyses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Although prior research suggests that fusiform gyrus represents the sex
   and race of faces, it remains unclear whether fusiform face area
   (FFA)-the portion of fusiform gyrus that is functionally-defined by its
   preferential response to faces-contains such representations. Here, we
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate whether FFA
   represents faces by sex and race. Participants were scanned while they
   categorized the sex and race of unfamiliar Black men, Black women, White
   men, and White women. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that
   multivoxel patterns in FFA-but not other face-selective brain regions,
   other category-selective brain regions, or early visual
   cortex-differentiated faces by sex and race. Specifically, patterns of
   voxel-based responses were more similar between individuals of the same
   sex than between men and women, and between individuals of the same race
   than between Black and White individuals. By showing that FFA represents
   the sex and race of faces, this research contributes to our emerging
   understanding of how the human brain perceives individuals from two
   fundamental social categories.}},

Title = {{Dreaming as mind wandering: evidence from functional neuroimaging and
   first-person content reports}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Isolated reports have long suggested a similarity in content and thought
   processes across mind wandering (MW) during waking, and dream mentation
   during sleep. This overlap has encouraged speculation that both
   ``daydreaming{''} and dreaming may engage similar brain mechanisms. To
   explore this possibility, we systematically examined published
   first-person experiential reports of MW and dreaming and found many
   similarities: in both sates, content is largely audiovisual and
   emotional, follows loose narratives tinged with fantasy, is strongly
   related to current concerns, draws on long-term memory, and simulates
   social interactions. Both states are also characterized by a relative
   lack of meta-awareness. To relate first-person reports to neural
   evidence, we compared meta-analytic data from numerous functional
   neuroimaging (PET, fMRI) studies of the default mode network (DMN, with
   high chances of MW) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (with high
   chances of dreaming). Our findings show large overlaps in activation
   patterns of cortical regions: similar to MW/DMN activity, dreaming and
   REM sleep activate regions implicated in self-referential thought and
   memory, including medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), medial temporal lobe
   structures, and posterior cingulate. Conversely, in REM sleep numerous
   PFC executive regions are deactivated, even beyond levels seen during
   waking MW. We argue that dreaming can be understood as an
   ``intensified{''} version of waking MW: though the two share many
   similarities, dreams tend to be longer, more visual and immersive, and
   to more strongly recruit numerous key hubs of the DMN. Further, where as
   MW recruits fewer PFC regions than goal-directed thought, dreaming
   appears to be characterized by an even deeper quiescence of PFC regions
   involved in cognitive control and metacognition, with a corresponding
   lack of insight and meta-awareness. We suggest, then, that dreaming
   amplifies the same features that distinguish MW from goal-directed
   waking thought.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies suggest that there may be a distinct relationship
   between spontaneous neural activity and subsequent or concurrent
   self-specific stimulus-induced activity. This study aims to test the
   impact of spontaneous activity as recorded in an eyes-open (EO) resting
   state as opposed to eyes-closed (EC) on self-specific versus
   non-self-specific auditory stimulus-induced activity in fMRI. In our
   first experiment we used self-specific stimuli comprised of the subjects
   own name and non-self-specific stimuli comprised of a friends name and
   an unknown name, presented during EO versus EC baselines in a 3 name
   condition x 2 baseline design. In Experiment 2 we directly measured
   spontaneous activity in the absence of stimuli during EO versus EC to
   confirm a modulatory effect of the two baseline conditions in the
   regions found to show an interaction effect in Experiment 1. Spontaneous
   activity during EO was significantly higher than during EC in bilateral
   auditory cortex and non-self-specific names yielded stronger signal
   changes relative to EO baseline than to EC. In contrast, there was no
   difference in response to self-specific names relative to EO baseline
   than to EC despite the difference between spontaneous activity levels.
   These results support an impact of spontaneous activity on
   stimulus-induced activity, moreover an impact that depends on the
   high-level stimulus characteristic of self-specificity.}},

   memory consolidation of fear conditioning}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1523}},
Pages = {{59-67}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Investigations of fear conditioning in rodents and humans have
   illuminated the neural mechanisms of fear acquisition and extinction.
   However, the neural mechanism of automatic memory consolidation of fear
   conditioning is still unclear. To address this question, we measured
   brain activity following fear acquisition using resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). In the current study, we used a
   marker of fMRI, amplitude of low-frequency (0.01-0.08 Hz) fluctuation
   (ALFF) to quantify the spontaneous brain activity. Brain activity
   correlated to fear memory consolidation was observed in parahippocampus,
   insula, and thalamus in resting-state. Furthermore, after acquired fear
   conditioning, compared with control group some brain areas showed ALFF
   increased in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) in the experimental group, whereas some brain
   areas showed decreased ALFF in striatal regions (caudate, putamen).
   Moreover, the change of ALFF in vmPFC was positively correlated with the
   subjective fear ratings. These findings suggest that the
   parahippocampus, insula, and thalamus are the neural substrates of fear
   memory consolidation. The difference in activity could be attributed to
   a homeostatic process in which the vmPFC and ACC were involved in the
   fear recovery process, and change of ALFF in vmPFC predicts subjective
   fear ratings. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with gender identity disorder (GID), who are commonly
   referred to as transsexuals (TXs), are afflicted by negative
   psychosocial stressors. Central to the psychological complex of TXs is
   the conviction of belonging to the opposite sex. Neuroanatomical and
   functional brain imaging studies have demonstrated that the GID is
   associated with brain alterations. In this study, we found that TXs
   identify, when viewing male-female couples in erotic or non-erotic
   ({''}neutral{''}) interactions, with the couple member of the desired
   gender in both situations. By means of functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we found that the TXs, as opposed to controls (CONs), displayed
   an increased functional connectivity between the ventral tegmental area,
   which is associated with dimorphic genital representation, and anterior
   cingulate cortex subregions, which play a key role in social exclusion,
   conflict monitoring and punishment adjustment. The neural connectivity
   pattern suggests a brain signature of the psychosocial distress for the
   gender-sex incongruity of TXs.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have
   reported multiple activation foci associated with a variety of
   conditions, stimuli or tasks. However, most of these studies used fewer
   than 40 participants.
   Methodology: After extracting data (number of subjects, condition
   studied, number of foci identified and threshold) from 94 brain fMRI
   meta-analyses (k = 1,788 unique datasets) published through December of
   2011, we analyzed the correlation between individual study sample sizes
   and number of significant foci reported. We also performed an analysis
   where we evaluated each meta-analysis to test whether there was a
   correlation between the sample size of the meta-analysis and the number
   of foci that it had identified. Correlation coefficients were then
   combined across all meta-analyses to obtain a summary correlation
   coefficient with a fixed effects model and we combine correlation
   coefficients, using a Fisher's z transformation.
   Principal Findings: There was no correlation between sample size and the
   number of foci reported in single studies (r = 0.0050) but there was a
   strong correlation between sample size and number of foci in
   meta-analyses (r = 0.62, p<0.001). Only studies with sample sizes <45
   identified larger (>40) numbers of foci and claimed as many discovered
   foci as studies with sample sizes >= 45, whereas meta-analyses yielded a
   limited number of foci relative to the yield that would be anticipated
   from smaller single studies.
   Conclusions: These results are consistent with possible reporting biases
   affecting small fMRI studies and suggest the need to promote
   standardized large-scale evidence in this field. It may also be that
   small studies may be analyzed and reported in ways that may generate a
   larger number of claimed foci or that small fMRI studies with
   inconclusive, null, or not very promising results may not be published
   at all.}},

Abstract = {{Humans can resist temptations by exerting willpower, the effortful
   inhibition of impulses. But willpower can be disrupted by emotions and
   depleted over time. Luckily, humans can deploy alternative self-control
   strategies like precommitment, the voluntary restriction of access to
   temptations. Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of willpower and
   precommitment using fMRI. Behaviorally, precommitment facilitated
   choices for large delayed rewards, relative to willpower, especially in
   more impulsive individuals. While willpower was associated with
   activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior parietal
   cortex (PPC), and inferior frontal gyrus, precommitment engaged lateral
   frontopolar cortex (LFPC). During precommitment, LFPC showed increased
   functional connectivity with DLPFC and PPC, especially in more impulsive
   individuals, and the relationship between impulsivity and LFPC
   connectivity was mediated by value-related activation in ventromedial
   PFC. Our findings support a hierarchical model of self-control in which
   LFPC orchestrates precommitment by controlling action plans in more
   caudal prefrontal regions as a function of expected value.}},

Abstract = {{The human dorsal frontal cortex has been associated with the most
   sophisticated aspects of cognition, including those that are thought to
   be especially refined in humans. Here we used diffusion-weighted
   magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) in humans
   and macaques to infer and compare the organization of dorsal frontal
   cortex in the two species. Using DW-MRI tractography-based parcellation,
   we identified 10 dorsal frontal regions lying between the human inferior
   frontal sulcus and cingulate cortex. Patterns of functional coupling
   between each area and the rest of the brain were then estimated with
   fMRI and compared with functional coupling patterns in macaques. Areas
   in human medial frontal cortex, including areas associated with
   high-level social cognitive processes such as theory of mind, showed a
   surprising degree of similarity in their functional coupling patterns
   with the frontal pole, medial prefrontal, and dorsal prefrontal
   convexity in the macaque. We failed to find evidence for ``new{''}
   regions in human medial frontal cortex. On the lateral surface,
   comparison of functional coupling patterns suggested correspondences in
   anatomical organization distinct from those that are widely assumed. A
   human region sometimes referred to as lateral frontal pole more closely
   resembled area 46, rather than the frontal pole, of the macaque. Overall
   the pattern of results suggest important similarities in frontal cortex
   organization in humans and other primates, even in the case of regions
   thought to carry out uniquely human functions. The patterns of
   interspecies correspondences are not, however, always those that are
   widely assumed.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible action selection requires knowledge about how alternative
   actions impact the environment: a ``cognitive map{''} of instrumental
   contingencies. Reinforcement learning theories formalize this map as a
   set of stochastic relationships between actions and states, such that
   for any given action considered in a current state, a probability
   distribution is specified over possible outcome states. Here, we show
   that activity in the human inferior parietal lobule correlates with the
   divergence of such outcome distributions-a measure that reflects whether
   discrimination between alternative actions increases the controllability
   of the future-and, further, that this effect is dissociable from those
   of other information theoretic and motivational variables, such as
   outcome entropy, action values, and outcome utilities. Our results
   suggest that, although ultimately combined with reward estimates to
   generate action values, outcome probability distributions associated
   with alternative actions may be contrasted independently of valence
   computations, to narrow the scope of the action selection problem.}},

   about self-knowledge?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 17}},
Abstract = {{Understanding ourselves has been a fundamental topic for psychologists
   and philosophers alike. In this paper we review the evidence linking
   specific brain structures to self-reflection. The brain regions most
   associated with self-reflection are the posterior cingulate and medial
   prefrontal (mPFC) cortices, together known as the cortical midline
   structures (CMSs). We review evidence arguing that self-reflection is
   special in memory, while noting that these brain regions are often
   engaged when we think about others in our social worlds. Based on the
   CMSs' patterns of connectivity and activity, we speculate about three
   possible interpretations of their role in supporting self-reflection
   that are somewhat overlapping, and not intended to be mutually
   exclusive. First, self may be a powerful, but ordinary case for a
   cognitive system specialized for thinking about people. Second, mPFC may
   serve as a processing ``hub,{''} binding together information from all
   sensory modalities with internally generated information. Third, mPFC
   may serve as a cortical director of thought, helping to guide
   moment-by-moment conscious processing. Suggestions are made for future
   research avenues aimed at testing such possibilities.}},

Title = {{The NTSR1 gene modulates the association between hippocampal structure
   and working memory performance}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{79-86}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The genetic and neural basis of working memory (WM) has been extensively
   studied. Many dopamine (DA) related genes, including the NTSR1 gene (a
   DA modulator gene), have been reported to be associated with WM
   performance. The NTSR1 protein is predominantly expressed in the
   cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, the latter of which is closely
   involved in WM processing based on both lesion and fMRI studies. Thus
   far, however, no study has examined the joint effects of NTSR1 gene
   polymorphism and hippocampal morphology on WM performance.
   Participants of the current study were 330 healthy Chinese college
   students. WM performance was measured with a 2-back WM paradigm.
   Structural MRI data were acquired and then analyzed using an automated
   procedure with atlas-based FreeSurfer segmentation software (v 4.5.0)
   package. Linear regression analyses were conducted with a NTSR1 C/T
   polymorphism which was previously reported to be associated with WM
   (rs4334545), hippocampal volume, and their interaction as predictors of
   WM performance, with gender and intracranial volume (ICV) as covariates.
   Results showed a significant interaction between NTSR1 genotype and
   hippocampal volume (p<.05 for both the left and right hippocampi).
   Further analysis showed that the correlation between hippocampal volume
   and WM scores was significant for carriers of the NTSR1 T-allele (p<.05
   for both hippocampi), but not for CC homozygotes. These results indicate
   that the association between hippocampal structure and WM performance
   was modulated by variation in the NTSR1 gene, and suggest that further
   studies of brain-behavior associations should take genetic background
   information into account. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{On the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in self-processing:
   the valuation hypothesis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{With the development of functional neuroimaging, important progress has
   been made in identifying the brain regions involved in self-related
   processing. One of the most consistent findings has been that the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) is activated when people
   contemplate various aspects of themselves and their life, such their
   traits, experiences, preferences, abilities, and goals. Recent evidence
   suggests that this region may not support the act of self-reflection per
   se, but its precise function in self-processing remains unclear. In this
   article, I examine the hypothesis that the vMPFC may contribute to
   assign personal value or significance to self-related contents: stimuli
   and mental representations that refer or relate to the self tend to be
   assigned unique value or significance, and the function of the vMPFC may
   precisely be to evaluate or represent such significance. Although
   relatively few studies to date have directly tested this hypothesis,
   several lines of evidence converge to suggest that vMPFC activity during
   self-processing depends on the personal significance of self-related
   contents. First, increasing psychological distance from
   self-representations leads to decreased activation in the vMPFC. Second,
   the magnitude of vMPFC activation increases linearly with the personal
   importance attributed to self-representations. Third, the activity of
   the vMPFC is modulated by individual differences in the interest placed
   on self-reflection. Finally, the evidence shows that the vMPFC responds
   to outer aspects of self that have high personal value, such as
   possessions and close others. By assigning personal value to
   self-related contents, the vMPFC may play an important role in the
   construction, stabilization, and modification of self-representations,
   and ultimately in guiding our choices and decisions.}},

Title = {{Rethinking the role of the rTPJ in attention and social cognition in
   light of the opposing domains hypothesis: findings from an ALE-based
   meta-analysis and resting-state functional connectivity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{The right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) has been associated with two
   apparently disparate functional roles: in attention and in social
   cognition. According to one account, the rTPJ initiates a
   ``circuit-breaking{''} signal that interrupts ongoing attentional
   processes, effectively reorienting attention. It is argued this primary
   function of the rTPJ has been extended beyond attention, through a
   process of evolutionarily cooption, to play a role in social cognition.
   We propose an alternative account, according to which the capacity for
   social cognition depends on a network which is both distinct from and in
   tension with brain areas involved in focused attention and target
   detection: the default mode network (DMN). Theory characterizing the
   rTPJ based on the area's purported role in reorienting may be falsely
   guided by the co-occurrence of two distinct effects in contiguous
   regions: activation of the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), associated with
   its functional role in target detection; and the transient release,
   during spatial reorienting, of suppression of the angular gyrus (AG)
   associated with focused attention. Findings based on meta-analysis and
   resting functional connectivity are presented which support this
   alternative account. We find distinct regions, possessing
   anti-correlated patterns of resting connectivity, associated with social
   reasoning (AG) and target detection (SMG) at the rTPJ. The locus for
   reorienting was spatially intermediate between the AG and SMG and showed
   a pattern of connectivity with similarities to social reasoning and
   target detection seeds. These findings highlight a general
   methodological concern for brain imaging. Given evidence that certain
   tasks not only activate some areas but also suppress activity in other
   areas, it is suggested that researchers need to distinguish two distinct
   putative mechanisms, either of which may produce an increase in activity
   in a brain area: functional engagement in the task vs. release of
   suppression.}},

Abstract = {{Information enters the cortex via modality-specific sensory regions,
   whereas actions are produced by modality-specific motor regions.
   Intervening central stages of information processing map sensation to
   behavior. Humans perform this central processing in a flexible, abstract
   manner such that sensory information in any modality can lead to
   response via any motor system. Cognitive theories account for such
   flexible behavior by positing amodal central information processing (e.
   g., ``central executive,{''} Baddeley and Hitch, 1974; ``supervisory
   attentional system,{''} Norman and Shallice, 1986; ``response selection
   bottleneck,{''} Pashler, 1994). However, the extent to which brain
   regions embodying central mechanisms of information processing are
   amodal remains unclear. Here we apply multivariate pattern analysis to
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to compare response
   selection, a cognitive process widely believed to recruit an amodal
   central resource across sensory and motor modalities. We show that most
   frontal and parietal cortical areas known to activate across a wide
   variety of tasks code modality, casting doubt on the notion that these
   regions embody a central processor devoid of modality representation.
   Importantly, regions of anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex consistently failed to code modality across four experiments.
   However, these areas code at least one other task dimension, process
   (instantiated as response selection vs response execution), ensuring
   that failure to find coding of modality is not driven by insensitivity
   of multivariate pattern analysis in these regions. We conclude that
   abstract encoding of information modality is primarily a property of
   subregions of the prefrontal cortex.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{It has now become widely accepted that economic decisions are influenced
   by cognitive and emotional processes. In the present study, we aimed at
   disentangling the neural mechanisms associated with the way in which the
   information is formulated, i.e., framing effect, in terms of gain or
   loss, which influences people's decisions. Participants played a fMRI
   version of the Ultimatum Game (UG) where we manipulated bids through two
   different frames: the expression ``I give you{''} (gain) focusing on
   money the respondent would receive if she/he agreed with the proponent,
   and the expression ``I take{''} (loss) focusing on the money that would
   be removed from the respondent in the event that she/he accepted the
   offer. Neuroimaging data revealed a frame by response interaction,
   showing an increase of neural activity in the right rolandic
   operculum/insular cortex, the anterior cingulate, among other regions,
   for accepting the frame ``I take{''} vs. rejecting, as compared to
   accepting the frame ``I give you{''} vs. rejecting. In addition, the
   left occipito-temporal junction was activated for ``I take{''} vs. ``I
   give you{''} for offer 5, corresponding to the equal offer made
   unpleasant by the presence of the frame ``I take{''}, where is the
   proposer that takes the money. Our data extend the current understanding
   of the neural substrates of social decision making, by disentangling the
   structures sensitive to the way in which the information is formulated
   (i.e., framing effect), in terms of gain or loss.}},

Title = {{Neural traces of stress: cortisol related sustained enhancement of
   amygdala-hippocampal functional connectivity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Stressful experiences modulate neuro-circuitry function, and the
   temporal trajectory of these alterations, elapsing from early
   disturbances to late recovery, heavily influences resilience and
   vulnerability to stress. Such effects of stress may depend on processes
   that are engaged during resting-state, through active recollection of
   past experiences and anticipation of future events, all known to involve
   the default mode network (DMN). By inducing social stress and acquiring
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before
   stress, immediately following it, and 2 h later, we expanded the
   time-window for examining the trajectory of the stress response.
   Throughout the study repeated cortisol samplings and self-reports of
   stress levels were obtained from 51 healthy young males. Post-stress
   alterations were investigated by whole brain resting-state functional
   connectivity (rsFC) of two central hubs of the DMN: the posterior
   cingulate cortex (PCC) and hippocampus. Results indicate a `recovery'
   pattern of DMN connectivity, in which all alterations, ascribed to the
   intervening stress, returned to pre-stress levels. The only exception to
   this pattern was a stress-induced rise in amygdala-hippocampal
   connectivity, which was sustained for as long as 2 h following stress
   induction. Furthermore, this sustained enhancement of limbic
   connectivity was inversely correlated to individual stress-induced
   cortisol responsiveness (AUCi) and characterized only the group lacking
   such increased cortisol (i.e., non-responders). Our observations provide
   evidence of a prolonged post-stress response profile, characterized by
   both the comprehensive balance of most DMN functional connections and
   the distinct time and cortisol dependent ascent of intra-limbic
   connectivity. These novel insights into neuro-endocrine relations are
   another milestone in the ongoing search for individual markers in
   stress-related psychopathologies.}},

Title = {{Action simulation in hallucination-prone adolescents}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical and empirical accounts suggest that impairments in
   self-other discrimination processes are likely to promote the expression
   of hallucinations. Studies using a variety of paradigms involving
   self-performed actions argue in favor of perspective taking confusion in
   hallucination-prone subjects. However, our understanding of such
   processes during adolescence is still at an early stage. The present
   study thus aims (1) to delineate the neural correlates sustaining mental
   simulation of actions involving self-performed actions (first-person
   perspective; 1PP) and other-performed actions (third-person perspective;
   3PP) during adolescence (2) to identify atypical activation patterns
   during 1PP/3PP mental simulation of actions in hallucination-prone
   adolescents (3) to examine whether differential risk for schizophrenia
   (clinical vs. genetic) is also associated with differential impairments
   in the 1PP/3PP mental simulation of actions during adolescence.
   Twenty-two typically developing controls (Control group; 6 females), 12
   hallucination-prone adolescents {[}auditory hallucination (AH) group; 7
   females] and 13 adolescents with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS
   group; 4 females) were included in the study. During the fMRI task,
   subjects were presented with a cue (self-other priming cues) indicating
   to perform the task using either a first person perspective
   ({''}you{''}-1PP) or a third person perspective (best friend-3PP) and
   then they were asked to mentally simulate actions based on the type of
   cue. Hallucination-proneness was assessed using a self-report
   questionnaire {[}Cardiff Anomalous Perception Scale (CAPS)]. Our results
   indicated that atypical patterns of cerebral activation, particularly in
   the key areas of self-other distinction, were found in both groups at
   risk for auditory hallucinations (AHs and 22q11.2DS). More precisely,
   adolescents in the AH group presented decreased activations in the right
   middle occipital gyrus BA19, left cingulate gyrus BA31, and right
   precuneus BA31 for the 3PP > 1PP contrast. Adolescents in the 22q11.2DS
   group presented decreased activations in the right superior occipital
   gyrus BA19, left caudate tail and left precuneus BA7 for the 3PP > 1PP
   contrast. In comparison to the Control group, only the 22q11.2DS
   adolescents showed a decreased activation for other-related cues (prime
   other > prime self contrast) in areas of visual imagery, episodic memory
   and social cognition. This study characterizes the neural correlates of
   mental imagery for actions during adolescence, and suggests that a
   differential risk for hallucination-proneness (clinical vs. genetic) is
   associated to similar patterns of atypical activations in key areas
   sustaining self-other discrimination processes. These observations may
   provide relevant information for future research and prevention
   strategies with regards to hallucination-proneness during adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) plays a critical role in
   processing appetitive stimuli. Recent investigations have shown that
   reward value signals in the vmPFC can be altered by emotion regulation
   processes; however, to what extent the processing of positive emotion
   relies on neural regions implicated in reward processing is unclear.
   Here, we investigated the effects of emotion regulation on the valuation
   of emotionally evocative images. Two independent experimental samples of
   human participants performed a cognitive reappraisal task while
   undergoing fMRI. The experience of positive emotions activated the
   vmPFC, whereas the regulation of positive emotions led to relative
   decreases in vmPFC activation. During the experience of positive
   emotions, vmPFC activation tracked participants' own subjective ratings
   of the valence of stimuli. Furthermore, vmPFC activation also tracked
   normative valence ratings of the stimuli when participants were asked to
   experience their emotions, but not when asked to regulate them. A
   separate analysis of the predictive power of vmPFC on behavior indicated
   that even after accounting for normative stimulus ratings and condition,
   increased signal in the vmPFC was associated with more positive valence
   ratings. These results suggest that the vmPFC encodes a domain-general
   value signal that tracks the value of not only external rewards, but
   also emotional stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{This article is part of a Special Issue ``Puberty and Adolescence{''}.
   There is increasing evidence that puberty plays an important role in the
   structural and functional brain development seen in adolescence, but
   little is known of the pubertal influence on changes in functional
   connectivity. We explored how pubertal indicators (salivary
   concentrations of testosterone, oestradiol and DHEA; pubertal stage;
   menarcheal status) relate to functional connectivity between components
   of a mentalising network identified to be engaged in social emotion
   processing by our prior work, using psychophysiological interaction
   (PPI) analysis. Female adolescents aged 11 to 13 years were scanned
   whilst silently reading scenarios designed to evoke either social
   emotions (guilt and embarrassment) or basic emotions (disgust and fear),
   of which only social compared to basic emotions require the
   representation of another person's mental states. Pubertal stage and
   menarcheal status were used to assign participants to pre/early or
   mid/late puberty groups. We found increased functional connectivity
   between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and the right
   posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and right temporo-parietal
   junction (TPJ) during social relative to basic emotion processing.
   Moreover, increasing oestradiol concentrations were associated with
   increased functional connectivity between the DMPFC and the right TPJ
   during social relative to basic emotion processing, independent of age.
   Our analysis of the PPI data by phenotypic pubertal status showed that
   more advanced puberty stage was associated with enhanced functional
   connectivity between the DMPFC and the left anterior temporal cortex
   (ATC) during social relative to basic emotion processing, also
   independent of age. Our results suggest increased functional maturation
   of the social brain network with the advancement of puberty in girls.

Abstract = {{The development of social emotions such as compassion is crucial for
   successful social interactions as well as for the maintenance of mental
   and physical health, especially when confronted with distressing life
   events. Yet, the neural mechanisms supporting the training of these
   emotions are poorly understood. To study affective plasticity in healthy
   adults, we measured functional neural and subjective responses to
   witnessing the distress of others in a newly developed task
   (Socio-affective Video Task). Participants' initial empathic responses
   to the task were accompanied by negative affect and activations in the
   anterior insula and anterior medial cingulate cortex-a core neural
   network underlying empathy for pain. Whereas participants reacted with
   negative affect before training, compassion training increased positive
   affective experiences, even in response to witnessing others in
   distress. On the neural level, we observed that, compared with a memory
   control group, compassion training elicited activity in a neural network
   including the medial orbitofrontal cortex, putamen, pallidum, and
   ventral tegmental area-brain regions previously associated with positive
   affect and affiliation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the
   deliberate cultivation of compassion offers a new coping strategy that
   fosters positive affect even when confronted with the distress of
   others.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Degraded social function, disinhibition, and stereotypy
   are defining characteristics of frontotemporal dementia (FTD),
   manifesting in both the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia
   (bvFTD) and semantic dementia (SD) subtypes. Recent neuroimaging
   research also associates FTD with alterations in the brain's intrinsic
   connectivity networks. The present study explored the relationship
   between neural network connectivity and specific behavioral symptoms in
   FTD.
   Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was
   employed to investigate neural network changes in bvFTD and SD. We used
   independent components analysis (ICA) to examine changes in frontolimbic
   network connectivity, as well as several metrics of local network
   strength, such as the fractional amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and seed-based functional
   connectivity. For each analysis, we compared each FTD subgroup to
   healthy controls, characterizing general and subtype-unique network
   changes. The relationship between abnormal connectivity in FTD and
   behavior disturbances was explored.
   Results: Across multiple analytic approaches, both bvFTD and SD were
   associated with disrupted frontolimbic connectivity and elevated local
   connectivity within the prefrontal cortex. Even after controlling for
   structural atrophy, prefrontal hyperconnectivity was robustly associated
   with apathy scores. Frontolimbic disconnection was associated with lower
   disinhibition scores, suggesting that abnormal frontolimbic connectivity
   contributes to positive symptoms in dementia. Unique to bvFTD,
   stereotypy was associated with elevated default network connectivity in
   the right angular gyrus. The behavioral variant was also associated with
   marginally higher apathy scores and a more diffuse pattern of prefrontal
   hyperconnectivity than SD.
   Conclusions: The present findings support a theory of FTD as a disorder
   of frontolimbic disconnection leading to unconstrained prefrontal
   connectivity. Prefrontal hyperconnectivity may represent a compensatory
   response to the absence of affective feedback during the planning and
   execution of behavior. Increased reliance upon prefrontal processes in
   isolation from subcortical structures appears to be maladaptive and may
   drive behavioral withdrawal that is commonly observed in later phases of
   neurodegeneration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Konggap, sung melodic motifs that last only a few seconds embody the
   acoustic representation of a person among the Yupno people of Papua New
   Guinea and are a unique phenomenon in the Pacific. The konggap forms a
   very complex system of personal identification and expression of social
   relationships; at the same time it connects the singer to the ancestral
   world. Every person in Yupno society possesses his or her own konggap,
   and Yupno people are able to identify a large number of konggap, some
   men even up to three hundred. Nobody would sing his or her own konggap
   during the day. When crossing Yupno land, a person has to sing the
   konggap of the respective landowner to identify himself as an insider, a
   local person - unlike strangers (and possible enemies) who remain
   silent. But at nightly dances each dancer sings his own konggap and
   during mourning at funerals groups of women simultaneously sing the
   konggap of the deceased person. An interdisciplinary
   ethnographic-musicological-cognitive fieldwork study was conducted in
   order to find out how it is possible that the Yupno are able to identify

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies of tinnitus suggest the involvement of wide-spread
   neural networks for perceptual, attentional, memory, and emotional
   processes encompassing auditory, frontal, parietal, and limbic areas.

   characteristics with grey matter volume in two large samples of tinnitus
   patients. High-resolution brain images were obtained using a 1.5 T
   magnetic resonance imaging scanner and analysed by means of voxel-based
   morphometry. In sample one (n = 257), tinnitus distress correlated
   negatively with grey matter volume in bilateral auditory areas including
   the Heschl's gyrus and insula, that is, the higher the tinnitus distress
   the lower the grey matter volume. The effects of this correlation were
   small, but stable after correction for potential confounders such as
   age, gender, and audiometric parameters. This negative correlation was
   replicated in a second independent sample (n = 78). Our results support
   the notion that the role of the auditory cortex in tinnitus is not
   restricted to perceptual aspects. The distress observed was dependent on
   grey matter alterations in the auditory cortex, which could reflect
   reverberations between perceptual and distress networks.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Anhedonia has long been recognized as a key feature of major
   depressive disorders, but little is known about the association between
   hedonic symptoms and neurobiological processes in depressed patients. We
   investigated whether amygdala mood-congruent responses to emotional
   stimuli in depressed patients are correlated with anhedonic symptoms at
   automatic levels of processing. Methods: We measured amygdala
   responsiveness to subliminally presented sad and happy facial
   expressions in depressed patients and matched healthy controls using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Amygdala responsiveness was
   compared between patients and healthy controls within a 2 (group) x 2
   (emotion) design. In addition, we correlated patients' amygdala
   responsiveness to sad and happy facial stimuli with self-report
   questionnaire measures of anhedonia. Results: We included 35 patients
   and 35 controls in our study. As in previous studies, we observed a
   strong emotion x group interaction in the bilateral amygdala: depressed
   patients showed greater amygdala responses to sad than happy faces,
   whereas healthy controls responded more strongly to happy than sad
   faces. The lack of automatic right amygdala responsiveness to happy
   faces in depressed patients was associated with higher physical
   anhedonia scores. Limitations: Almost all depressed patients were taking
   antidepressant medications. Conclusion: We replicated our previous
   finding of depressed patients showing automatic amygdala mood-congruent
   biases in terms of enhanced reactivity to negative emotional stimuli and
   reduced activity to positive emotional stimuli. The altered amygdala
   processing of positive stimuli in patients was associated with anhedonia
   scores. The results indicate that reduced amygdala responsiveness to
   positive stimuli may contribute to anhedonic symptoms due to
   reduced/inappropriate salience attribution to positive information at
   very early processing levels.}},

Abstract = {{Compassion is a key motivator of altruistic behavior, but little is
   known about individuals' capacity to cultivate compassion through
   training. We examined whether compassion may be systematically trained
   by testing whether (a) short-term compassion training increases
   altruistic behavior and (b) individual differences in altruism are
   associated with training-induced changes in neural responses to
   suffering. In healthy adults, we found that compassion training
   increased altruistic redistribution of funds to a victim encountered
   outside of the training context. Furthermore, increased altruistic
   behavior after compassion training was associated with altered
   activation in brain regions implicated in social cognition and emotion
   regulation, including the inferior parietal cortex and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and in DLPFC connectivity with the nucleus
   accumbens. These results suggest that compassion can be cultivated with
   training and that greater altruistic behavior may emerge from increased
   engagement of neural systems implicated in understanding the suffering
   of other people, executive and emotional control, and reward processing.}},

Abstract = {{Children with Asperger's syndrome show deficits in social functioning
   while their intellectual and language development is intact suggesting a
   specific dysfunction in mechanisms mediating social cognition. An action
   observation/execution matching system might be one such mechanism.
   Recent studies indeed showed that electrophysiological modulation of the
   ``Mu-rhythm{''} in the 10-12 Hz range is weaker when individuals with
   Asperger's syndrome observe actions performed by others compared to
   controls. However, electrophysiological studies typically fall short in
   revealing the neural generators of this activity. To fill this gap we
   assessed magnetoencephalographic Mu-modulations in Asperger's and
   typically developed children, while observing grasping movements.
   Mu-power increased at frontal and central sensors during movement
   observation. This modulation was stronger in typical than in Asperger
   children. Source localization revealed stronger sources in premotor
   cortex, the intraparietal lobule (IPL) and the mid-occipito-temporal
   gyrus (MOTG) and weaker sources in prefrontal cortex in typical
   participants compared to Asperger. Activity in premotor regions, IPL and
   MOTG correlated positively with social competence, whereas prefrontal
   Mu-sources correlated negatively with social competence. No correlation
   with intellectual ability was found at any of these sites. These
   findings localize abnormal Mu-activity in the brain of Asperger children
   providing evidence which associates motor-system abnormalities with
   social-function deficits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   effectively swapping pairs of objects. These swap errors were the
   primary error type in amnesia, almost never occurred in healthy

   more traditional metrics (such as distance between studied and

Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{The developmental origin of sex differences in adult brain function is
   poorly understood. Elucidating neural mechanisms underlying comparable
   cognitive functionality in both children and adults is required to
   address this gap. Humor appreciation represents a particularly relevant
   target for such developmental research because explanatory theories
   apply across the life span, and underlying neurocircuitry shows sex
   differences in adults. As a positive mood state, humor is also of
   interest due to sex differences in rates of depression, a disorder
   afflicting twice as many women as men. In this study, we employed
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate brain
   responses to funny versus positive (and neutral) video clips in 22
   children, ages 6-13 years, including eight sibling-pairs. Our data
   revealed increased activity to funny clips in bilateral
   temporo-occipital cortex, midbrain, and amygdala in girls. Conversely,
   we found heightened activation to positive clips in bilateral inferior
   parietal lobule, fusiform gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, amygdala, and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex in boys. Many of these effects persisted
   when looking at sibling-pairs only. We interpret such findings as
   reflecting the presence of early sex divergence in reward saliency or
   expectation and stimulus relevance attribution. These findings are
   discussed in the context of evolutionary and developmental theories of
   humor function.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to test whether the eyes of an intact
   face produced a specific brain response compared to the mouth, nose, or
   hair and whether their specificity was also maintained in a scrambled
   face. Fifteen subjects were asked to focus visual attention on global
   and single elements in intact faces and in their scrambled image. EEG
   data were recorded from 256-Hydrocel Geodesic Sensor-Net200.
   Event-related potentials (ERPs) analyses showed a difference between the
   intact face and the scrambled face from N170 component until 600 ms on
   the occipito-temporal montage and at 400-600 ms on the frontal montage.
   Only the eyes showed a difference between conditions (intact/scrambled
   face) at 500 ms. The most activated source detected by sLORETA was the
   right middle temporal gyrus (BA21) for both conditions and for all
   elements. Left BA21 resulted in significantly more activation in
   response to eyes in the intact face compared to the eyes in the
   scrambled face at 500 ms. The left BA21 has a central role in high-level
   visual processing and in understanding others' intentions. These
   findings suggest a specificity of the eyes and indicate that the eyes
   play the social and communicative role of comprehending the nonverbal
   intentions of others only when inserted in an intact face.}},

Abstract = {{Effective coaching and mentoring is crucial to the success of
   individuals and organizations, yet relatively little is known about its
   neural underpinnings. Coaching and mentoring to the Positive Emotional
   Attractor (PEA) emphasizes compassion for the individual's hopes and
   dreams and has been shown to enhance a behavioral change. In contrast,
   coaching to the Negative Emotional Attractor (NEA), by focusing on
   externally defined criteria for success and the individual's weaknesses
   in relation to them, does not show sustained change. We used fMRI to
   measure BOLD responses associated with these two coaching styles. We
   hypothesized that PEA coaching would be associated with increased global
   visual processing and with engagement of the parasympathetic nervous
   system (PNS), while the NEA coaching would involve greater engagement of
   the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Regions showing more activity in
   PEA conditions included the lateral occipital cortex, superior temporal
   cortex, medial parietal, subgenual cingulate, nucleus accumbens, and
   left lateral prefrontal cortex. We relate these activations to
   visioning, PNS activity, and positive affect. Regions showing more
   activity in NEA conditions included medial prefrontal regions and right
   lateral prefrontal cortex. We relate these activations to SNS activity,
   self-trait attribution and negative affect.}},

   combined oral contraceptive}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Most women on combined oral contraceptives (COC) report high
   levels of satisfaction, but 4-10\% complain of adverse mood effects. The
   aim of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was to
   investigate if COC use would induce more pronounced mood symptoms than
   placebo in women with previous history of COC-induced adverse mood. A
   second aim was to determine if COC use is associated with changes in
   brain reactivity in regions previously associated with emotion
   processing.
   Methods: Thirty-four women with previous experience of mood
   deterioration during COC use were randomized to one treatment cycle with
   a levonorgestrel-containing COC or placebo. An emotional face matching
   task (vs. geometrical shapes) was administered during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) prior to and during the COC treatment
   cycle. Throughout the trial, women recorded daily symptom ratings on the
   Cyclicity Diagnoser (CD) scale.
   Results: During the last week of the treatment cycle COC users had
   higher scores of depressed mood, mood swings, and fatigue than placebo
   users. COC users also had lower emotion-induced reactivity in the left
   insula, left middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral inferior frontal gyri
   as compared to placebo users. In comparison with their pretreatment
   cycle, the COC group had decreased emotion-induced reactivity in the
   bilateral inferior frontal gyri, whereas placebo users had decreased
   reactivity in the right amygdala.
   Conclusion: COC use in women who previously had experienced emotional
   side effects resulted in mood deterioration, and COC use was also
   accompanied by changes in emotional brain reactivity. These findings are
   of relevance for the understanding of how combined oral contraceptives
   may influence mood. Placebo-controlled fMRI studies in COC sensitive
   women could be of relevance for future testing of adverse mood effects
   in new oral contraceptives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is a multicomponent function that includes sensorimotor,
   affective, and cognitive components. Although especially the affective
   component may implicate interoception and interoceptive awareness, the
   impact of interoception on empathy has never been evaluated behaviorally
   or neurophysiologically. Here, we tested how a preceding period of
   interoceptive awareness impacts and modulates neural activity during
   subsequent empathy. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   and measured the sequential interaction between interoception and
   empathy using fMRI in 18 healthy subjects. We found that the preceding
   interoceptive awareness period significantly enhanced neural activity
   during empathy in bilateral anterior insula and various cortical midline
   regions. The enhancement of neural activity during empathy in both
   interoceptive and empathy networks by preceding interoceptive awareness
   suggests a close relationship between interoception and empathy;
   thereby, interoception seems to be implicated to yielding empathy. Hum

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{We examined the hypothesis that learning to write Chinese characters
   influences the brain's reading network for characters. Students from a
   college Chinese class learned 30 characters in a character-writing
   condition and 30 characters in a pinyin-writing condition. After
   learning, functional magnetic resonance imaging collected during passive
   viewing showed different networks for reading Chinese characters and
   English words, suggesting accommodation to the demands of the new
   writing system through short-term learning. Beyond these expected
   differences, we found specific effects of character writing in greater
   activation (relative to pinyin writing) in bilateral superior parietal
   lobules and bilateral lingual gyri in both a lexical decision and an
   implicit writing task. These findings suggest that character writing
   establishes a higher quality representation of the visual-spatial
   structure of the character and its orthography. We found a greater
   involvement of bilateral sensori-motor cortex (SMC) for
   character-writing trained characters than pinyin-writing trained
   characters in the lexical decision task, suggesting that learning by
   doing invokes greater interaction with sensori-motor information during
   character recognition. Furthermore, we found a correlation of
   recognition accuracy with activation in right superior parietal lobule,
   right lingual gyrus, and left SMC, suggesting that these areas support
   the facilitative effect character writing has on reading. Finally,
   consistent with previous behavioral studies, we found character-writing
   training facilitates connections with semantics by producing greater
   activation in bilateral middle temporal gyri, whereas pinyin-writing
   training facilitates connections with phonology by producing greater
   activation in right inferior frontal gyrus. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. (c)

Abstract = {{In daily life facial expressions change rapidly and the direction of
   change provides important clues about social interaction. The aim of
   conducting this study was to elucidate the dynamic happy facial
   expression processing with different social interaction cues in
   individuals with (n= 14) and without (n= 14) schizotypal personality
   disorder (SPD) traits. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI), dynamic happy facial expression processing was examined by
   presenting video clips depicting happiness appearing and disappearing
   under happiness inducing ('praise') or reducing ('blame') interaction
   cues. The happiness appearing condition consistently elicited more brain
   activations than the happiness disappearing condition in the posterior
   cingulate bilaterally in all participants. Further analyses showed that
   the SPD group was less deactivated than the non-SPD group in the right
   anterior cingulate cortex in the happiness appearing-disappearing
   contrast. The SPD group deactivated more than the non-SPD group in the
   left posterior cingulate and right superior temporal gyrus in the
   praise-blame contrast. Moreover, the incongruence of cues and facial
   expression activated the frontal-thalamus-caudate-parietal network,
   which is involved in emotion recognition and conflict resolution. These
   results shed light on the neural basis of social interaction deficits in
   individuals with schizotypal personality traits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Can Cognitive Models Explain Brain Activation During Word and Pseudoword
   Reading? A Meta-Analysis of 36 Neuroimaging Studies}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Reading in many alphabetic writing systems depends on both item-specific
   knowledge used to read irregular words (sew, yacht) and generative
   spelling sound knowledge used to read pseudowords (tew, yash). Research
   into the neural basis of these abilities has been directed largely by
   cognitive accounts proposed by the dual-route cascaded and triangle
   models of reading. We develop a framework that enables predictions for
   neural activity to be derived from cognitive models of reading using 2
   principles: (a) the extent to which a model component or brain region is
   engaged by a stimulus and (b) how much effort is exerted in processing
   that stimulus. To evaluate the derived predictions, we conducted a
   meta-analysis of 36 neuroimaging studies of reading using the
   quantitative activation likelihood estimation technique. Reliable
   clusters of activity are localized during word versus pseudoword and
   irregular versus regular word reading and demonstrate a great deal of
   convergence between the functional organization of the reading system
   put forward by cognitive models and the neural systems activated during
   reading tasks. Specifically, left-hemisphere activation clusters are
   revealed reflecting orthographic analysis (occipitotemporal cortex),
   lexical and/or semantic processing (anterior fusiform, middle temporal
   gyrus), spelling-sound conversion (inferior parietal cortex), and
   phonological output resolution (inferior frontal gyrus). Our framework
   and results establish that cognitive models of reading are relevant for
   interpreting neuroimaging studies and that neuroscientific studies can
   provide data relevant for advancing cognitive models. This article thus
   provides a firm empirical foundation from which to improve integration
   between cognitive and neural accounts of the reading process.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Facial emotion perception (FEP) is a critical human skill
   for successful social interaction, and a substantial body of literature
   suggests that explicit FEP is disrupted in major depressive disorder
   (MDD). Prior research suggests that weakness in FEP may be an important
   phenomenon underlying patterns of emotionprocessing challenges in MDD
   and the disproportionate frequency of MDD in women.
   Method. Women with (n=24) and without (n=22) MDD, equivalent in age and
   education, completed a FEP task during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging.
   Results. The MDD group exhibited greater extents of frontal, parietal
   and subcortical activation compared with the control group during FEP.
   Activation in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) appeared shifted from a
   left >right pattern observed in healthy women to a bilateral pattern in
   MDD women. The ratio of left to right suprathreshold IFG voxels in
   healthy controls was nearly 3 : 1, whereas in the MDD group, there was a
   greater percentage of suprathreshold IFG voxels bilaterally, with no
   leftward bias. In MDD, relatively greater activation in right IFG
   compared with left IFG (ratio score) was present and predicted FEP
   accuracy (r=0.56, p<0.004), with an inverse relationship observed
   between FEP and subgenual cingulate activation (r=-0.46, p=0.02).
   Conclusions. This study links, for the first time, disrupted IFG
   activation laterality and increased subgenual cingulate activation with
   deficient FEP in women with MDD, providing an avenue for
   imaging-to-assessment translational applications in MDD.}},

Abstract = {{Jax and Buxbaum {[}Jax and Buxbaum (2010). Response interference between
   functional and structural actions linked to the same familiar object.
   Cognition, 115, 350-355] demonstrated that grasp-to-transport actions
   (handing an object to someone, i.e., a receiver) are initiated more
   quickly than grasp-to-use actions. A possible interpretation of these
   findings is that grasp-to-transport actions do not require activation of
   long-term representations. In Jax and Buxbaum's study, participants
   positioned their hand on the object as they would to transport/use it in
   a conventional way. So, movement planning was based only on egocentric
   relationships (individual-object) and not on allocentric relationships
   (object-object or object-{''}receiver{''}). It is likely that
   participants may not have activated long-term social representations
   about how to hand an object to someone in the transport task. In
   Experiment 1, we replicated J\&B's results by asking participants to
   position their hand on familiar tools as they would to hand them to
   someone (grasp-to-transport)/use them in a non-conventional way (i.e.,
   to hit a ball, grasp-to-use). In Experiment 2, participants had to
   actually perform the actions. We found the opposite pattern in that
   grasp-to-use actions were initiated more quickly than grasp-to-transport
   actions. These findings indicate that the modulation of allocentric
   constraints might induce activation of long-term representations in
   transport actions. This suggests that, under certain circumstances,
   long-term representations might be necessary not only for use actions
   but also for transport actions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{228}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral studies revealed that people were less likely to endorse
   negative information as self-descriptive. Neuroimaging studies have
   tapped on the neural mechanism underlying intentional self-processing of
   negative information using self-reflection tasks. Given that human
   self-processing occurring in our daily life is more likely to be
   captured by tasks involving incidental self-processing (automatic
   associations between the self- and external stimuli), rather than tasks
   involving intentional self-processing, it could be presumed that the
   relationship between self- and negative emotion might be better
   reflected during incidental self-processing. The present functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study aimed to explore incidental
   self-processing of negative information. To induce participants'
   incidental self-processing, we adopted negative and neutral words
   written by themselves or others as materials. They were scanned during
   judging whether the handwritten words were negative or neutral
   (additional non-self-task). Results revealed that incidental
   self-processing of negative information relied on the activation of left
   anterior insula, whereas medial prefrontal cortex activity was
   associated with incidental self-processing of neutral information.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with schizophrenia evidence deficits in social functioning
   such as difficulties in communication, maintaining employment, and
   functioning as a member of the community. Impairment in such functions
   has been linked with higher order social cognitive deficits, which, in
   turn, have been associated with abnormal brain function. However, it is
   unclear whether brain abnormalities are found specifically for higher
   order social cognitive functioning, or whether ``lower order{''} social
   processing, such as perceiving social stimuli, might demonstrate
   abnormalities at the neural level. The current study used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to explore the neural correlates of social
   perception in schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia (n=14) and
   healthy comparison participants (n=14) viewed social (i.e., faces,
   people) and nonsocial (i.e., scenes, objects) images that varied in
   affective content (emotional, neutral). Schizophrenia patients showed
   decreased brain activation, compared to controls, in occipital and
   temporal regions associated with early visual processing, as well as
   increased cingulate activity, in response to emotional social relative
   to nonsocial images. Results indicate aberrant neural response during
   early stages of visual processing of social information, which may
   contribute to higher order social cognitive deficits characteristic of
   this population. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study EEG was recorded simultaneously while two
   participants were playing the three-person ultimatum game (UG). Both
   participants received different offers from changing proposers about how
   to split up a certain amount of money between the three players. One of
   the participants had no say, whereas the other, the responder, was able
   to harm the payoff of all other players. The aim of the study was to
   investigate how the outcomes of the respective other are evaluated by
   participants who were treated fairly or unfairly themselves and to what
   extent agency influences concerns for fairness. Analyses were focused on
   the medial frontal negativity (MFN) as an early index for subjective
   value assignment. Recipients with veto-power exhibited enhanced, more
   negative-going, MFN amplitudes following proposals that comprised a low
   share for both recipients, suggesting that responders favored offers
   with a fair amount to at least one of the two players. Though, the
   powerless players cared about the amount assigned to the responder, MFN
   amplitudes were larger following fair compared to unfair offers assigned
   to the responder. Similarly, concerns for fairness which determined the
   amplitude of the MFN, suggested that the powerless players exhibited
   negative and conversely the responders, positive social preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Anticipation is an adaptive process, aiding preparatory responses to
   potentially threatening events. However, excessive anticipatory
   responding and associated hyper-reactivity in the amygdala and insula
   are integral to anxiety disorders. Despite the co-occurrence of sleep
   disruption and anxiety disorders, the impact of sleep loss on affective
   anticipatory brain mechanisms, and the interaction with anxiety, remains
   unknown. Here, we demonstrate that sleep loss amplifies preemptive
   responding in the amygdala and anterior insula during affective
   anticipation in humans, especially for cues with high predictive
   certainty. Furthermore, trait anxiety significantly determined the
   degree of such neural vulnerability to sleep loss: individuals with
   highest trait anxiety showed the greatest increase in anticipatory
   insula activity when sleep deprived. Together, these data support a
   neuropathological model in which sleep disruption may contribute to the
   maintenance and/or exacerbation of anxiety through its impact on
   anticipatory brain function. They further raise the therapeutic
   possibility that targeted sleep restoration in anxiety may ameliorate
   excessive anticipatory responding and associated clinical
   symptomatology.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1519}},
Pages = {{63-70}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Sunk cost effect (also called escalation of commitment, etc) is a
   pervasive, interesting and famous decision bias, which has been
   intensively discussed in psychology, economics, management, political
   science, zoology, etc. To date, little has been known about the neural
   basis of this phenomenon. We investigated it by using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor healthy subjects' brain
   activities when they made decisions in a task wherein sunk cost and
   incremental cost were systematically manipulated. Higher sunk cost only
   increased activity of some brain areas (mainly lateral frontal and
   parietal cortices, which are involved in risk-taking), whereas lower
   incremental cost mainly increased activity of some brain areas
   (including striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, which are sensitive to
   rewards). No overlapping brain areas were found to respond to both sunk
   cost and incremental cost. These results favor certainty effect over
   self-justification or diminishing sensitivity as account of sunk cost
   effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The Attention Modulation on Timing: An Event-Related Potential Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{The present study examined the neural mechanisms of attention modulation
   on timing using ERP and sLORETA measurements in a dual-task paradigm. We
   parametrically varied the attention to the durations of a 1000-Hz pure
   tone and further localized the cortical regions that were sensitive to
   the attention modulation on timing. Results demonstrated that the
   attention modulation might happen at early stage, approximately 200 ms
   after stimulus presentation. The P2 component at frontal area served as
   an early neural correlate of attention effects on timing. More
   importantly, the contingent negative variation (CNV) appeared at
   fronto-central area was sensitive to the attention effect. In addition,
   the supplementary motor area (SMA) was assumed to be one of the key
   regions for selectively attending to and estimating time. These findings
   provide temporal and spatial correlates of attention-modulated time
   processing and potentially help to investigate the neural mechanisms of
   patients with time perception deficits.}},

Title = {{Dissociable Somatotopic Representations of Chinese Action Verbs in the
   Motor and Premotor Cortex}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{The embodied view of language processing holds that language
   comprehension involves the recruitment of sensorimotor information, as
   evidenced by the somatotopic representation of action verbs in the motor
   system. However, this review has not yet been examined in logographic
   scripts such as Chinese, in which action verbs can provide explicit
   linguistic cues to the effectors (arm, leg, mouth) that conduct the
   action (hit, jump, drink). We compared the somatotopic representation of
   Chinese verbs that contain such effector cues and those that do not. The
   results showed that uncued verbs elicited similar somatotopic
   representation in the motor and premotor cortex as found in alphabetic
   scripts. However, effector-cued verbs demonstrated an inverse
   somatotopic pattern by showing reduced activation in corresponding motor
   areas, despite that effector-cued verbs actually are rated higher in
   imageability than uncued verbs. Our results support the universality of
   somatotopic representation of action verbs in the motor system.}},

Title = {{The Caudate Signals Bad Reputation during Trust Decisions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{The ability to initiate and sustain trust is critical to health and
   well-being. Willingness to trust is in part determined by the reputation
   of the putative trustee, gained via direct interactions or indirectly
   through word of mouth. Few studies have examined how the reputation of
   others is instantiated in the brain during trust decisions. Here we use
   an event-related functional MRI (fMRI) design to examine what neural
   signals correspond to experimentally manipulated reputations acquired in
   direct interactions during trust decisions. We hypothesized that the
   caudate (dorsal striatum) and putamen (ventral striatum) and amygdala
   would signal differential reputations during decision-making.
   Twenty-nine healthy adults underwent fMRI scanning while completing an
   iterated Trust Game as trusters with three fictive trustee partners who
   had different tendencies to reciprocate (i.e., likelihood of rewarding
   the truster), which were learned over multiple exchanges with real-time
   feedback. We show that the caudate (both left and right) signals
   reputation during trust decisions, such that caudate is more active to
   partners with two types of ``bad{''} reputations, either indifferent
   partners (who reciprocate 50\% of the time) or unfair partners (who
   reciprocate 25\% of the time), than to those with ``good{''} reputations
   (who reciprocate 75\% of the time). Further, individual differences in
   caudate activity related to biases in trusting behavior in the most
   uncertain situation, i.e. when facing an indifferent partner. We also
   report on other areas that were activated by reputation at p < 0.05
   whole brain corrected. Our findings suggest that the caudate is involved
   in signaling and integrating reputations gained through experience into
   trust decisions, demonstrating a neural basis for this key social
   process.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{We attempt to determine the discriminability and organization of neural
   activation corresponding to the experience of specific emotions. Method
   actors were asked to self-induce nine emotional states (anger, disgust,
   envy, fear, happiness, lust, pride, sadness, and shame) while in an fMRI
   scanner. Using a Gaussian Naive Bayes pooled variance classifier, we
   demonstrate the ability to identify specific emotions experienced by an
   individual at well over chance accuracy on the basis of: 1) neural
   activation of the same individual in other trials, 2) neural activation
   of other individuals who experienced similar trials, and 3) neural
   activation of the same individual to a qualitatively different type of
   emotion induction. Factor analysis identified valence, arousal,
   sociality, and lust as dimensions underlying the activation patterns.
   These results suggest a structure for neural representations of emotion
   and inform theories of emotional processing.}},

Title = {{Stress Impact on Resting State Brain Networks}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{Resting state brain networks (RSNs) are spatially distributed
   large-scale networks, evidenced by resting state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Importantly, RSNs are implicated in
   several relevant brain functions and present abnormal functional
   patterns in many neuropsychiatric disorders, for which stress exposure
   is an established risk factor. Yet, so far, little is known about the
   effect of stress in the architecture of RSNs, both in resting state
   conditions or during shift to task performance. Herein we assessed the
   architecture of the RSNs using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) in a cohort of participants exposed to prolonged stress
   (participants that had just finished their long period of preparation
   for the medical residence selection exam), and respective gender-and
   age-matched controls (medical students under normal academic
   activities). Analysis focused on the pattern of activity in resting
   state conditions and after deactivation. A volumetric estimation of the
   RSNs was also performed. Data shows that stressed participants displayed
   greater activation of the default mode (DMN), dorsal attention (DAN),
   ventral attention (VAN), sensorimotor (SMN), and primary visual (VN)
   networks than controls. Importantly, stressed participants also
   evidenced impairments in the deactivation of resting state-networks when
   compared to controls. These functional changes are paralleled by a
   constriction of the DMN that is in line with the pattern of brain
   atrophy observed after stress exposure. These results reveal that stress
   impacts on activation-deactivation pattern of RSNs, a finding that may
   underlie stress-induced changes in several dimensions of brain activity.}},

Abstract = {{This study used event-related potentials to investigate the sensitivity
   of P1 and N170 components to human-like and animal-like makeup stimuli,
   which were derived from pictures of Peking opera characters. As
   predicted, human-like makeup stimuli elicited larger P1 and N170
   amplitudes than did animal-like makeup stimuli. Interestingly, a right
   hemisphere advantage was observed for human-like but not for animal-like
   makeup stimuli. Dipole source analyses of 130-200-ms window showed that
   the bilateral fusiform face area may contribute to the differential
   sensitivity of the N170 component in response to human-like and
   animal-like makeup stimuli. The present study suggests that the
   amplitudes of both the P1 and the N170 are sensitive for the mouth
   component of face-like stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Early neuroimaging studies using Cyberball suggested that social
   rejection activated the pain matrix, as identified in studies of
   physical pain. However, these early studies were characterized by small
   sample sizes. Our statistical multi-level kernel density analysis (MKDA)
   of Cyberball neuroimaging studies with 244 participants fails to support
   the claim that social rejection operates on the same pain matrix as
   nociceptive stimuli, questioning whether social pain is more figurative
   or literal. We also performed an MKDA of the neuroimaging studies of
   reliving a romantic rejection to test whether the pain matrix was
   activated if the rejection were more meaningful. Results again failed to
   support the notion that rejection activates the neural matrix identified
   in studies of physical pain. Reliving an unwanted rejection by a
   romantic partner was significantly characterized by activation within
   and beyond the ``Cyberball{''} brain network, suggesting that the neural
   correlates of social pain are more complex than previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Listeners exploit small interindividual variations around a generic
   acoustical structure to discriminate and identify individuals from their
   voice-a key requirement for social interactions. The human brain
   contains temporal voice areas (TVA) {[}1] involved in an acoustic-based
   representation of voice identity {[}2-6], but the underlying coding
   mechanisms remain unknown. Indirect evidence suggests that identity
   representation in these areas could rely on a norm-based coding
   mechanism {[}4, 7-11]. Here, we show by using fMRI that voice identity
   is coded in the TVA as a function of acoustical distance to two internal
   voice prototypes (one male, one female)-approximated here by averaging a
   large number of same-gender voices by using morphing {[}12]. Voices more
   distant from their prototype are perceived as more distinctive and
   elicit greater neuronal activity in voice-sensitive cortex than closer
   voices-a phenomenon not merely explained by neuronal adaptation {[}13,
   14]. Moreover, explicit manipulations of distance-to-mean by morphing
   voices toward (or away from) their prototype elicit reduced (or
   enhanced) neuronal activity. These results indicate that voice-sensitive
   cortex integrates relevant acoustical features into a complex
   representation referenced to idealized male and female voice prototypes.
   More generally, they shed light on remarkable similarities in cerebral
   representations of facial and vocal identity.}},

Title = {{Just watching the game ain't enough: striatal fMRI reward responses to
   successes and failures in a video game during active and vicarious
   playing}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Although the multimodal stimulation provided by modern audiovisual video
   games is pleasing by itself, the rewarding nature of video game playing
   depends critically also on the players' active engagement in the
   gameplay. The extent to which active engagement influences dopaminergic
   brain reward circuit responses remains unsettled. Here we show that
   striatal reward circuit responses elicited by successes (wins) and
   failures (losses) in a video game are stronger during active than
   vicarious gameplay. Eleven healthy males both played a competitive
   first-person tank shooter game (active playing) and watched a
   pre-recorded gameplay video (vicarious playing) while their hemodynamic
   brain activation was measured with 3-tesla functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). Wins and losses were paired with symmetrical monetary
   rewards and punishments during active and vicarious playing so that the
   external reward context remained identical during both conditions. Brain
   activation was stronger in the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex (omPFC)
   during winning than losing, both during active and vicarious playing. In
   contrast, both wins and losses suppressed activations in the midbrain
   and striatum during active playing; however, the striatal suppression,
   particularly in the anterior putamen, was more pronounced during loss
   than win events. Sensorimotor confounds related to joystick movements
   did not account for the results. Self-ratings indicated losing to be
   more unpleasant during active than vicarious playing. Our findings
   demonstrate striatum to be selectively sensitive to self-acquired
   rewards, in contrast to frontal components of the reward circuit that
   process both self-acquired and passively received rewards. We propose
   that the striatal responses to repeated acquisition of rewards that are
   contingent on game related successes contribute to the motivational pull
   of video-game playing.}},

Abstract = {{Interpersonal impression formation is highly consequential for social
   interactions in private and public domains. These perceptions of others
   rely on different sources of information and processing mechanisms, all
   of which have been investigated in independent research fields. In
   social psychology, inferences about states and traits of others as well
   as activations of semantic categories and corresponding stereotypes have
   attracted great interest. On the other hand, research on emotion and
   reward demonstrated affective and motivational influences of social cues
   on the observer, which in turn modulate attention, categorization,
   evaluation, and decision processes. While inferential and categorical
   social processes have been shown to recruit a network of cortical brain
   regions associated with mentalizing and evaluation, the affective
   influence of social cues has been linked to subcortical areas that play
   a central role in detection of salient sensory input and reward
   processing. In order to extend existing integrative approaches to person
   perception, both the inferential-categorical processing of information
   about others, and affective and motivational influences of this
   information on the beholder should be taken into account.}},

   Belief-Based Decision Making}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Many real-life decisions in complex and changing environments are guided
   by the decision maker's beliefs, such as her perceived control over
   decision outcomes (i.e., agency), leading to phenomena like the
   ``illusion of control{''}. However, the neural mechanisms underlying the
   ``agency{''} effect on belief-based decisions are not well understood.
   Using functional imaging and a card guessing game, we revealed that the
   agency manipulation (i.e., either asking the subjects (SG) or the
   computer (CG) to guess the location of the winning card) not only
   affected the size of subjects' bets, but also their ``world model{''}
   regarding the outcome dependency. Functional imaging results revealed
   that the decision-related activation in the lateral and medial
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) was significantly modulated by agency and
   previous outcome. Specifically, these PFC regions showed stronger
   activation when subjects made decisions after losses than after wins
   under the CG condition, but the pattern was reversed under the SG
   condition. Furthermore, subjects with high external attribution of
   negative events were more affected by agency at the behavioral and
   neural levels. These results suggest that the prefrontal decision-making
   system can be modulated by abstract beliefs, and are thus vulnerable to
   factors such as false agency and attribution.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this article is to discuss the conditions under which
   functional neuroimaging can contribute to the study of higher cognition.
   We begin by presenting two case studieson moral and economic decision
   makingwhich will help us identify and examine one of the main ways in
   which neuroimaging can help advance the study of higher cognition. We
   agree with critics that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   studies seldom refine or confirm particular psychological hypotheses, or
   even provide details of the neural implementation of cognitive
   functions. However, we suggest that neuroimaging can support psychology
   in a different waynamely, by selecting among competing hypotheses of the
   cognitive mechanisms underlying some mental function. One of the main
   ways in which neuroimaging can be used for hypothesis selection is via
   reverse inferences, which we here examine in detail. Despite frequent
   claims to the contrary, we argue that successful reverse inferences do
   not assume any strong or objectionable form of reductionism or
   functional locationism. Moreover, our discussion illustrates that
   reverse inferences can be successful at early stages of psychological
   theorizing, when models of the cognitive mechanisms are only partially
   developed.}},

Abstract = {{This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research explores how
   observers make causal beliefs about an event in terms of the person or
   situation. Thirty-four participants read various short descriptions of
   social events that implied either the person or the situation as the
   cause. Half of them were explicitly instructed to judge whether the
   event was caused by something about the person or the situation
   (intentional inferences), whereas the other half was instructed simply
   to read the material carefully (spontaneous inferences). The results
   showed common activation in areas related to mentalizing, across all
   types of causes or instructions (posterior superior temporal sulcus,
   temporo-parietal junction, precuneus). However, the medial prefrontal
   cortex was activated only under spontaneous instructions, but not under
   intentional instruction. This suggests a bias toward person attributions
   (e.g. fundamental attribution bias). Complementary to this, intentional
   situation attributions activated a stronger and more extended network
   compared to intentional person attributions, suggesting that situation
   attributions require more controlled, extended and broader processing of
   the information.}},

Abstract = {{Our impressions of other people are formed mainly from the two possible
   factors of facial attractiveness and trustworthiness. Previous studies
   have shown the importance of orbitofrontal-hippocampal interactions in
   the better remembering of attractive faces, and psychological data have
   indicated that faces giving an impression of untrustworthiness are
   remembered more accurately than those giving an impression of
   trustworthiness. However, the neural mechanisms of the latter effect are
   largely unknown. To investigate this issue, we investigated neural
   activities with event-related fMRI while the female participants rated
   their impressions of the personalities of men in terms of
   trustworthiness. After the rating, memory for faces was tested to
   identify successful encoding activity. As expected, faces that gave bad
   impressions were remembered better than those that gave neutral or good
   impressions. In fMRI data, right insular activity reflected an
   increasing function of bad impressions, and bilateral hippocampal
   activities predicted subsequent memory success. Additionally,
   correlation between these insular and hippocampal regions was
   significant only in the encoding of faces associated with a bad
   impression. Better memory for faces associated with an impression of bad
   personality could reflect greater interaction between the
   avoidance-related insular region and the encoding-related hippocampal
   region.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) have severe problems
   in social interactions that might be caused by deficits in social
   cognition. Since the findings about social-cognitive abilities in BPD
   are inhomogeneous, ranging from deficits to superior abilities, we aimed
   to investigate the neuronal basis of social cognition in BPD. We applied
   a paradigm with three social cognition tasks, differing in their
   complexity: basal processing of faces with a neutral expression,
   recognition of emotions, and attribution of emotional intentions
   (affective ToM). A total of 13 patients with BPD and 13 healthy matched
   controls (HCs) were included in a functional magnet resonance imaging
   study. BPD patients showed no deficits in social cognition on the
   behavioral level. However, while HCs showed increasing activation in
   areas of the mirror neuron system with increasing complexity in the
   social-cognitive task, BPD patients had hypoactivation in these areas
   and hyperactivation in the amygdala which were not modulated by task
   complexity. This activation pattern seems to reflect an enhanced
   emotional approach in the processing of social stimuli in BPD that
   allows good performance in standardized social-cognitive tasks, but
   might be the basis of social-cognitive deficits in real-life social
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroscientific studies on agency focus rather exclusively on the notion
   of who initiates and regulates actions, not on the notion of why the
   person does. The present study focused on the latter to investigate two
   different reasons underlying personal agency. Using event-related
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned 16 healthy human
   subjects while they imagined the enactment of volitional, agentic
   behavior on the same task but either for a self-determined and
   intrinsically motivated reason or for a non-self-determined and
   extrinsically motivated reason. Results showed that the anterior insular
   cortex (AIC), known to be related to the sense of agency, was more
   activated during self-determined behavior while the angular gyrus, known
   to be related to the sense of loss of agency, was more activated during
   non-self-determined behavior. Furthermore, AIC activities during
   self-determined behavior correlated highly with participants'
   self-reported intrinsic satisfactions. We conclude that self-determined
   behavior is more agentic than is non-self-determined behavior and that
   personal agency arises only during self-determined, intrinsically
   motivated action.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that a brain network mainly associated with
   episodic memory has a more general function in imagining oneself in
   another time, place or perspective (e.g. episodic future thought, theory
   of mind, default mode). If this is true, counterfactual thinking (e.g.
   `If I had left the office earlier, I wouldn't have missed my train.')
   should also activate this network. Present functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study explores the common and distinct neural activity of
   counterfactual and episodic thinking by directly comparing the imagining
   of upward counterfactuals (creating better outcomes for negative past
   events) with the re-experiencing of negative past events and the
   imagining of positive future events. Results confirm that episodic and
   counterfactual thinking share a common brain network, involving a core
   memory network (hippocampal area, temporal lobes, midline, and lateral
   parietal lobes) and prefrontal areas that might be related to
   mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex) and performance monitoring (right
   prefrontal cortex). In contrast to episodic past and future thinking,
   counterfactual thinking recruits some of these areas more strongly and
   extensively, and additionally activates the bilateral inferior parietal
   lobe and posterior medial frontal cortex. We discuss these findings in
   view of recent fMRI evidence on the working of episodic memory and

Abstract = {{Although it has been suggested that social deficits of autism spectrum
   disorders (ASDs) are related to reward circuitry dysfunction, very
   little is known about the neural reward mechanisms in ASD. In the
   current functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we investigated
   brain activations in response to both social and monetary reward in a
   group of children with ASD, relative to matched controls. Participants
   with ASD showed the expected hypoactivation in the mesocorticolimbic
   circuitry in response to both reward types. In particular, diminished
   activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed when money, but not
   when social reward, was at stake, whereas the amygdala and anterior
   cingulate cortex were hypoactivated within the ASD group in response to
   both rewards. These data indicate that the reward circuitry is
   compromised in ASD in social as well as in non-social, i.e. monetary
   conditions, which likely contributes to atypical motivated behaviour.
   Taken together, with incentives used in this study sample, there is
   evidence for a general reward dysfunction in ASD. However, more
   ecologically valid social reward paradigms are needed to fully
   understand, whether there is any domain specificity to the reward
   deficit that appears evident in ASD, which would be most consistent with
   the ASD social phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research showed that perception of death-related vs
   death-unrelated linguistic cues produced increased frontoparietal
   activity but decreased insular activity. This study investigated (i)
   whether the increased frontoparietal and decreased insular activities
   are, respectively, associated with transient trial-specific processes of
   death-related linguistic cues and sustained death-related thought during
   death-relevance judgments on linguistic cues and (ii) whether the neural
   activity underlying death-related thought can predict individuals'
   dispositional death anxiety. Participants were presented with
   death-related/unrelated words, life-related/unrelated words, and
   negative-valence/neutral words in separate sessions. Participants were
   scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing
   death-relevance, life-relevance, and valence judgments on the words,
   respectively. The contrast of death-related vs death-unrelated words
   during death-relevance judgments revealed transient increased activity
   in the left inferior parietal lobule, the right frontal eye field, and
   the right superior parietal lobule. The contrast of death-relevance
   judgments vs life-relevance/valence judgments showed decreased activity
   in the bilateral insula. The sustained insular activity was correlated
   with dispositional death anxiety, but only in those with weak transient
   frontoparietal responses to death-related words. Our results dissociate
   the transient and sustained neural responses to death-related linguistic
   cues and suggest that the combination of the transient and sustained
   neural activities can predict dispositional death anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{The manner in which disparate affective responses shape attitudes toward
   other individuals has received a great deal of attention in neuroscience
   research. However, the malleability of these affective responses remains
   largely unexplored. The perceived controllability of a stigma (whether
   or not the bearer of the stigma is perceived as being responsible for
   his or her condition) has been found to polarize behavioral affective
   responses to that stigma. The current study uses functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to identify the neural correlates underlying the
   evaluation of stigmatized individuals (people who are homeless) when
   perceptions of the controllability of their condition are altered.
   Results demonstrated that perceivers engaged neural networks implicated
   in inferring intentionality (e.g. the medial prefrontal cortex) when
   they evaluated a homeless individual who was described as being
   responsible for becoming homeless. Conversely, neural networks
   associated with resolving strong affective responses (e.g. insula) were
   engaged when evaluating a homeless individual who was described as not
   being responsible for becoming homeless.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{762-773}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{ObjectiveThe importance of the cholinergic system for cognitive function
   has been well documented in animal and human studies. The objective of
   this study was to elucidate the cognitive and functional connectivity
   changes associated with enhanced acetylcholine levels. We hypothesized
   that older adults with mild memory deficits would show behavioral and
   functional network enhancements with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
   treatment (donepezil) when compared to a placebo control group.
   MethodsWe conducted a 3-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on
   the effects of donepezil in 27 older adults with mild memory deficits.
   Participants completed a delayed recognition memory task. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were collected at baseline prior
   to treatment and at 3-month follow-up while subjects were on a 10mg
   daily dose of donepezil or placebo.
   ResultsDonepezil treatment significantly enhanced the response time for
   face and scene memory probes when compared to the placebo group. A
   group-by-visit interaction was identified for the functional network
   connectivity of the left fusiform face area (FFA) with the hippocampus
   and inferior frontal junction, such that the treatment group showed
   increased connectivity over time when compared to the placebo group.
   Additionally, the enhanced functional network connectivity of the FFA
   and hippocampus significantly predicted memory response time at 3-month
   follow-up in the treatment group.
   InterpretationThese findings suggest that increased cholinergic
   transmission improves goal-directed neural processing and cognitive
   ability and may serve to facilitate communication across
   functionally-connected attention and memory networks. Longitudinal fMRI
   is a useful method for elucidating the neural changes associated with
   pharmacological modulation and is a potential tool for monitoring
   intervention efficacy in clinical trials.}},

Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1722-1732}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Current models of prosodic emotion comprehension propose a
   three stage cognition mediated by temporal lobe auditory regions through
   to inferior and orbitofrontal regions. Cumulative evidence suggests that
   its mediation may be more flexible though, with a facility to respond in
   a graded manner based on the need for executive control. The location of
   this fine-tuning system is unclear, as is its similarity to the
   cognitive control system.
   Methods: In the current study, need for executive control was
   manipulated in a block-design functional MRI study by systematically
   altering the proportion of incongruent trials across time, i.e., trials
   for which participants identified prosodic emotions in the face of
   conflicting lexico-semantic emotion cues. Resultant Blood Oxygenation
   Level Dependent contrast data were analysed according to standard
   procedures using Statistical Parametric Mapping v8 (Ashbumer et al.,
   2009).
   Results: In the parametric analyses, superior (medial) frontal gyrus
   activity increased linearly with increased need for executive control.
   In the separate analyses of each level of incongruity, results suggested
   that the baseline prosodic emotion comprehension system was sufficient
   to deal with low proportions of incongruent trials, whereas a more
   widespread frontal lobe network was required for higher proportions.
   Conclusions: These results suggest an executive control system for
   prosodic emotion comprehension exists which has the capability to
   recruit superior (medial) frontal gyrus in a graded manner and other
   frontal regions once demand exceeds a certain threshold. The need to
   revise current models of prosodic emotion comprehension and add a fourth
   processing stage are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{For this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we assessed
   the impact of early social experiences on the social regulation of
   neural threat responding in a sample of 22 individuals that have been
   followed for over a decade. At 13 years old, a multidimensional measure
   of neighborhood quality was derived from parental reports. Three
   measures of neighborhood quality were used to estimate social
   capital-the level of trust, reciprocity, cooperation, and shared
   resources within a community. At 16 years old, an observational measure
   of maternal emotional support behavior was derived from a mother/child
   social interaction task. At 24 years old, participants were asked to
   visit our neuroimaging facility with an opposite-sex platonic friend.
   During their MRI visit, participants were subjected to the threat of
   electric shock while holding their friend's hand, the hand of an
   anonymous opposite-sex experimenter, or no hand at all. Higher
   adolescent maternal support corresponded with less threat-related
   activation during friend handholding, but not during the stranger or
   alone conditions, in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex, inferior
   frontal gyrus and left insula. Higher neighborhood social capital
   corresponded with less threat-related activation during friend
   hand-holding in the superior frontal gyrus, supplementary motor cortex,
   insula, putamen and thalamus; but low childhood capital corresponded
   with less threat-related activation during stranger handholding in the
   same regions. Exploratory analyses suggest that this latter result is
   due to the increased threat responsiveness during stranger handholding
   among low social capital individuals, even during safety cues. Overall,
   early maternal support behavior and high neighborhood quality may
   potentiate soothing by relational partners, and low neighborhood quality
   may decrease the overall regulatory impact of access to social resources
   in adulthood. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sense of attachment security has been linked with a host of
   beneficial outcomes related to personal and relational well-being.
   Moreover, research has demonstrated that the sense of attachment
   security can be enhanced via cognitive priming techniques. Studies using
   such techniques have shown that security priming results with similar
   outcomes as dispositional attachment security. The way security priming
   leads to these effects, however, is yet to be unveiled. Using fMRI we
   took one step in that direction and examined the neural mechanisms
   underlying enhanced attachment security. Participants were exposed to
   explicit and implicit security- and insecurity-related words. Security
   priming led to co-occurring activation in brain areas reflective of
   cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes (e.g., medial frontal
   cortex, parahippocampus, BA 6). There were activation differences based
   on attachment style. This research serves as an important step in
   mapping out the security process and supports a conceptualization of
   security as part of a behavioral system with multiple components. (c)

Abstract = {{It is known that the left hemisphere of the human brain is critical in
   understanding and producing spoken language, but it remains a topic of
   great interest determining the cerebral lateralization of multiple
   languages. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of similarity
   between languages on hemispheric asymmetry of bilingual brains.
   The involvement degree of left and right hemisphere was examined during
   the processing of the first (L1) and second (L2) language in two
   different groups of bilinguals with English as L2. The first group
   consisted of German native speakers and the second group of Italian
   native speakers. Subjects from the two groups acquired L2 later in life
   (after the age of six) and had a comparable level of proficiency in
   second language comprehension. The functional lateralization was tested
   by a classical dichotic test with words in L1 and L2.
   Dependent variables were number of responses associated to words
   presented at the left vs. right ear and reaction time. Results showed a
   significant right ear advantage (REA) for number of responses in both
   languages and in both groups. However, the REA for L2 (English)
   processing was stronger in the German group. Reaction times were
   significantly lower during L1 processing and showed a trend towards the
   results obtained with the number of response variable. This study
   provides neuropsychological evidence pointing to a different
   lateralization pattern in the elaboration of a same L2 if L1 comes from
   different linguistic roots. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale brain networks are integral to the coordination of human
   behaviour, and their anatomy provides insights into the clinical
   presentation and progression of neurodegenerative illnesses such as
   Alzheimer's disease, which targets the default mode network, and
   behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, which targets a more
   anterior salience network. Although the default mode network is
   recruited when healthy subjects deliberate about `personal' moral
   dilemmas, patients with Alzheimer's disease give normal responses to
   these dilemmas whereas patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal
   dementia give abnormal responses to these dilemmas. We hypothesized that
   this apparent discrepancy between activation- and patient-based studies
   of moral reasoning might reflect a modulatory role for the salience
   network in regulating default mode network activation. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to characterize network activity of patients
   with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and healthy control
   subjects, we present four converging lines of evidence supporting a
   causal influence from the salience network to the default mode network
   during moral reasoning. First, as previously reported, the default mode
   network is recruited when healthy subjects deliberate about `personal'
   moral dilemmas, but patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal
   dementia producing atrophy in the salience network give abnormally
   utilitarian responses to these dilemmas. Second, patients with
   behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia have reduced recruitment of
   the default mode network compared with healthy control subjects when
   deliberating about these dilemmas. Third, a Granger causality analysis
   of functional neuroimaging data from healthy control subjects
   demonstrates directed functional connectivity from nodes of the salience
   network to nodes of the default mode network during moral reasoning.
   Fourth, this Granger causal influence is diminished in patients with
   behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. These findings are
   consistent with a broader model in which the salience network modulates
   the activity of other large-scale networks, and suggest a revision to a
   previously proposed `dual-process' account of moral reasoning. These
   findings also characterize network interactions underlying abnormal
   moral reasoning in frontotemporal dementia, which may serve as a model
   for the aberrant judgement and interpersonal behaviour observed in this
   disease and in other disorders of social function. More broadly, these
   findings link recent work on the dynamic interrelationships between
   large-scale brain networks to observable impairments in dementia
   syndromes, which may shed light on how diseases that target one network
   also alter the function of interrelated networks.}},

Abstract = {{Psychosis is characterized by an elementary lack of trust in others.
   Trust is an inherently rewarding aspect of successful social
   interactions and can be examined using neuroeconomic paradigms. This
   study was aimed at investigating the underlying neural basis of
   diminished trust in psychosis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
   data were acquired from 20 patients with psychosis and 20 healthy
   control subjects during two multiple-round trust games; one with a
   cooperative and the other with a deceptive counterpart. An a priori
   region of interest analysis of the right caudate nucleus, right
   temporo-parietal junction and medial prefrontal cortex was performed
   focusing on the repayment phase of the games. For regions with group
   differences, correlations were calculated between the haemodynamic
   signal change, behavioural outcomes and patients' symptoms. Patients
   demonstrated reduced levels of baseline trust, indicated by smaller
   initial investments. For the caudate nucleus, there was a significant
   game x group interaction, with controls showing stronger activation for
   the cooperative game than patients, and no differences for the deceptive
   game. The temporo-parietal junction was significantly more activated in
   control subjects than in patients during cooperative and deceptive
   repayments. There were no significant group differences for the medial
   prefrontal cortex. Patients' reduced activation within the caudate
   nucleus correlated negatively with paranoia scores. The temporo-parietal
   junction signal was positively correlated with positive symptom scores
   during deceptive repayments. Reduced sensitivity to social reward may
   explain the basic loss of trust in psychosis, mediated by aberrant
   activation of the caudate nucleus and the temporo-parietal junction.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have identified an area in the left lateral fusiform
   cortex that is highly responsive to written words and has been named the
   visual word form area (VWFA). However, there is disagreement on the
   specific functional role of this area in word recognition. Chinese
   characters, which are dramatically different from Roman alphabets in the
   visual form and in the form to phonological mapping, provide a unique
   opportunity to investigate the properties of the VWFA. Specifically, to
   clarify the orthographic sensitivity in the mid-fusiform cortex, we
   compared fMRI response amplitudes (Exp. 1) as well as the spatial
   patterns of response across multiple voxels (Exp. 2) between Chinese
   characters and stimuli derived from Chinese characters with different
   orthographic properties. The fMRI response amplitude results suggest the
   existence of orthographic sensitivity in the VWFA. The results from
   multi-voxel pattern analysis indicate that spatial distribution of the
   responses across voxels in the occipitotemporal cortex contained
   discriminative information between the different types of
   character-related stimuli. These results together suggest that the
   orthographic rules are likely represented in a distributed neural
   network with the VWFA containing the most specific information regarding

   Agonist Action Mediating Sexual Rejection and Aggression in Female
   Marmoset Monkeys}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SEXUAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. In a marmoset model of hypoactive female sexual function,
   we have shown that repeated administration of the serotonin (5-HT)-1A
   agonist R-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT)
   inhibits sexual receptivity in female marmoset monkeys and increases
   aggression toward the male pairmate. Aim. The aims of this study are to
   investigate gene expression changes induced by 8-OH-DPAT in
   laser-microdissected brain areas that regulate female sexual function
   and to identify genes, functional gene classes, and pathways associated
   with 8-OH-DPAT-mediated inhibition of female sexual receptivity.
   Methods. Gene expression was measured in the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC), medial preoptic area (mPOA), cornu ammonis-1 (CA1) area of the
   hippocampus (CA1), and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of four
   8-OH-DPAT-treated (0.1mg/kg; daily administration for 16 weeks) and four
   vehicle-treated female marmosets using a marmoset-specific microarray
   (European Marmoset Microarray {[}EUMAMA]) and validated by real-time
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR). Enriched functional
   gene classes were determined. In a parallel candidate gene approach, the
   expression of serotonergic candidate genes, i.e., the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A,
   and 5-HT7 receptors and the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), was measured by
   RTqPCR. Main Outcome Measures. The main outcome is the differential
   expression of genes between 8-OH-DPAT- and vehicle-treated marmosets.
   Results. 8-OH-DPAT affected the gene classes important to neural
   development (mPFC, mPOA, and DRN), neurotransmission (mPOA), energy
   production (mPFC and mPOA), learning and memory (CA1), and intracellular
   signal transduction (DRN). Oxytocin (OXT) in the mPOA and 5-HTT in the
   DRN were strongly increased by 8-OH-DPAT. 5-HT1A tended to increase in
   the mPFC, while 5-HT7 was decreased in the CA1. Conclusions. Brain
   region-specific alterations of gene expression regulating neural
   circuitries, energy demands, and learning processes are associated with
   8-OH-DPAT-induced decrease in female sexual receptivity and increase in
   pairmate aggression. The role of OXT in the serotonergic regulation of
   female sexual behavior and partner interactions warrants attention in
   future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Data from both rodents and humans show that testosterone reduces fear.
   This effect is hypothesized to result from testosterone's down
   regulating effects on the amygdala, a key region in the detection of
   threat and instigator of fight-or-flight behavior. However, neuroimaging
   studies employing testosterone administration in humans have
   consistently shown increased amygdala responsivity. Yet, no study to
   date has investigated specifically how testosterone affects the amygdala
   response to fearful emotional expressions. Such stimuli signal the
   presence of environmental threat and elicit robust amygdala responses
   that have consistently been associated with anxious traits. In the
   present study, we therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   combined with a single administration of 0.5 mg testosterone in 12
   healthy women to assess testosterone's effects on amygdala responses to
   dynamic fearful (and happy control) faces. Our results show that both
   stimuli activate the amygdala. Notably, testosterone increased the
   amygdala response to both stimuli, and to an equal degree. Thus,
   testosterone appears not to reduce fear by attenuating the amygdala
   response toward signals of threat. Data further show that testosterone
   selectively increases activation of the superficial amygdala (SEA) and,
   to a lesser extent, the basolateral amygdala (BLA). No effect was found
   in the central nucleus, which is involved in the generation of autonomic
   fear responses. Both the SFA and BLA are considered input regions, and
   enhanced activation by testosterone might reflect the role of this
   hormone in adaptive responding to socially relevant stimuli.
   Furthermore, literature on the distinct roles of the SFA and BLA in fear
   processing show that increased activation of these subregions of the
   amygdala is consistent with a fear reducing effect of testosterone. (c)

Abstract = {{Cooperation is essential for the functioning of human societies. To
   better understand how cooperation both succeeds and fails, recent
   research in cognitive neuroscience has begun to explore novel paradigms
   to examine how cooperative mechanisms may be encoded in the brain. By
   combining functional neuroimaging techniques with simple but realistic
   tasks adapted from experimental economics, this approach allows for the
   discrimination and modeling of processes that are important in
   cooperative behavior. Here, we review evidence demonstrating that many
   of the processes underlying cooperation overlap with rather fundamental
   brain mechanisms, such as, for example, those involved in reward,
   punishment and learning. In addition, we review how social expectations
   induced by an interactive context and the experience of social emotions
   may influence cooperation and its associated underlying neural
   circuitry, and we describe factors that appear important for generating
   cooperation, such as the provision of incentives. These findings
   illustrate how cognitive neuroscience can contribute to the development
   of more accurate, brain-based, models of cooperative decision making.}},

   Associated with Enhanced Activation of Emotion Regulation Neurocircuits}},

Abstract = {{Background: The neurosteroid allopregnanolone is a potent allosteric
   modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor with anxiolytic
   properties. Exogenous administration of allopregnanolone reduces
   anxiety, and allopregnanolone blockade impairs social and affective
   functioning. However, the neural mechanism whereby allopregnanolone
   improves mood and reduces anxiety is unknown. In particular, brain
   imaging has not been used to link neurosteroid effects to emotion
   regulation neurocircuitry.
   Methods: To investigate the brain basis of allopregnanolone's impact on
   emotion regulation, participants were administered 400 mg of
   pregnenolone (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15) and underwent 3T functional
   magnetic resonance imaging while performing the shifted-attention
   emotion appraisal task, which probes emotional processing and
   regulation.
   Results: Compared with placebo, allopregnanolone was associated with
   reduced activity in the amygdala and insula across all conditions.
   During the appraisal condition, allopregnanolone increased activity in
   the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and enhanced connectivity between
   the amygdala and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, an effect that was
   associated with reduced self-reported anxiety.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that in response to emotional
   stimuli, allopregnanolone reduces activity in regions associated with
   generation of negative emotion. Furthermore, allopregnanolone may
   enhance activity in regions linked to regulatory processes. Aberrant
   activity in these regions has been linked to anxiety psychopathology.
   These results thus provide initial neuroimaging evidence that
   allopregnanolone may be a target for pharmacologic intervention in the
   treatment of anxiety disorders and suggest potential future directions
   for research into neurosteroid effects on emotion regulation
   neurocircuitry.}},

Abstract = {{The primary taste cortex is located in the insula. However, exactly
   where in the insula the human primary taste cortex is located remains a
   controversial issue. Human neuroimaging studies have shown prominent
   variation concerning the location of taste-responsive activation within
   the insula. A standard protocol for gustatory testing in neuroimaging
   studies has not been developed, which might underlie such variations. In
   order to localize the primary taste cortex in an fMRI experiment, we
   used a taste delivery system to suppress non-taste stimuli and
   psychological effects. Then, we compared brain response to taste
   solution during a passive tasting task condition and a taste quality
   identification task condition to verify whether this cognitive task
   affected the location of taste-responsive activation within the insula.
   To examine which part of insula is the primary taste area, we performed
   dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to verify the neural network of the taste
   coding-related region and random-effects Bayesian model selection (BMS)
   at the family level to reveal the optimal input region. Passive tasting
   resulted in activation of the right middle insula (MI), and the most
   favorable model selected by DCM analysis showed that taste effect
   directly influenced the MI. Additionally, BMS results at the family
   level suggested that the taste inputs entered into the MI. Taken
   together, our results suggest that the human primary taste cortex is
   located in the MI.}},

Abstract = {{The Val158Met polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)
   gene is an important regulator of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, an
   area critical to working memory. Working memory deficits are present in
   several psychiatric disorders, and there is wide variation in working
   memory capacity in the normal population. Association studies of COMT
   and working memory in healthy volunteers have yielded inconsistent
   results, possibly because of small sample sizes. Here we examine COMT in
   relation to N-Back working memory task performance in a large
   population-based cohort of young adults. We predicted individuals with
   one or two copies of the Met allele would perform better, and that this
   relationship would be more evident in males than females. Participants
   (N = 1857-2659) tested at 18 years of age, were enrolled in the Avon
   Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We used multiple
   regression to examine effects of sex and COMT genotype on N-Back hits,
   false positives, discriminability (d(J)), and reaction time while
   controlling for important covariates. COMT genotype did not predict hits
   or d'. There was a nominally significant interaction between COMT and
   sex on false positives, but this was not in the predicted direction, and
   was not significant after controlling for covariates. COMT genotype was
   not related to working memory in this large population-based cohort. It
   is possible COMT is not meaningfully associated with working memory in
   healthy young adults, or that COMT effects are detectable only in
   assessments reflecting neural processes underlying cognition, such as
   fMRI, rather than in behavioral performance.}},

Abstract = {{Acute alcohol ingestion increases attentional bias to alcohol-related
   stimuli; however, the underlying cognitive and brain mechanisms remain
   unknown. We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with
   performance of a dual task that probed attentional distraction by
   alcohol-related stimuli during `conflict' processing: the Concurrent
   Flanker/Alcohol-Attentional bias task (CFAAT). In this task, an Eriksen
   Flanker task is superimposed on task-unrelated background pictures with
   alcohol-associated or neutral content. Participants respond to the
   direction of a central `target' arrow and ignore adjacent congruent (low
   cognitive load) or incongruent (high cognitive load) `flanking' arrows.
   Using a between-subject design, 40 healthy moderate-to-heavy social
   drinkers received either no alcohol (placebo), 0.4 g/kg (low dose), or
   0.8 g/kg (high dose) of alcohol, and underwent fMRI while performing the
   CFAAT. The low alcohol dose, relative to placebo, increased response
   latencies on trials with alcohol-associated backgrounds and, under low
   cognitive load, increased the activity evoked by these pictures within a
   medial hypothalamic region. Under high cognitive load, the low alcohol
   dose, relative to placebo, elicited greater activity within a more
   lateral hypothalamic region, and reduced activity within frontal motor
   areas. The high alcohol dose, relative to placebo, did not reliably
   affect response latencies or neural responses to background images, but
   reduced overall accuracy under high cognitive load. This effect
   correlated with changes in reactivity within medial and dorsal
   prefrontal cortices. These data suggest that alcohol at a low dose
   primes attentional bias to alcohol-associated stimuli, an effect
   mediated by activation of subcortical hypothalamic areas implicated in
   arousal and salience attribution.}},

Abstract = {{Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant degenerative brain
   disorder that is characterized by motor, cognitive and affective
   symptoms. Previous research has shown that patients with HD, similar to
   patients with schizophrenia, are impaired in their ability to appreciate
   the mental states of others. Functional brain imaging studies have shown
   that patients with schizophrenia underactivate the neural network
   involved in mentalizing, and that deviant patterns of brain activation
   are also present in individuals at high risk of developing a psychotic
   disorder. Accordingly, the present study sought to examine the brain
   activation in premanifest mutation carriers for HD. Thirty premanifest
   mutation carriers (13 males) defined by a positive gene test and absence
   of unequivocal HD symptoms ({''}pre-HD{''}) performed a cartoon
   mentalizing task during functional brain imaging. For comparison, a
   group of 26 healthy controls took part in the study. BOLD responses
   revealed that pre-HD subjects activated the mentalizing network
   comprising prefrontal, temporoparietal and parietal brain regions during
   task performance. A comparison between pre-HD patients and healthy
   controls revealed no significant activation differences. Premanifest
   mutation carriers of HD activated the neural network involved in
   mentalizing similar to healthy control subjects. This suggests that
   impaired mentalizing emerges with the clinical manifestation of the
   disease, but is not necessarily part of the pre-manifest stage.}},

Abstract = {{Functional imaging has become a primary tool in the study of human
   psychology but is not without its detractors. Although cognitive
   neuroscientists have made great strides in understanding the neural
   instantiation of countless cognitive processes, commentators have
   sometimes argued that functional imaging provides little or no utility
   for psychologists. And indeed, myriad studies over the last quarter
   century have employed the technique of brain mapping-identifying the
   neural correlates of various psychological phenomena-in ways that bear
   minimally on psychological theory. How can brain mapping be made more
   relevant to behavioral scientists broadly? Here, we describe three
   trends that increase precisely this relevance: (i) the use of
   neuroimaging data to adjudicate between competing psychological theories
   through forward inference, (ii) isolating neural markers of information
   processing steps to better understand complex tasks and psychological
   phenomena through probabilistic reverse inference, and (iii) using brain
   activity to predict subsequent behavior. Critically, these new
   approaches build on the extensive tradition of brain mapping, suggesting
   that efforts in this area-although not initially maximally relevant to
   psychology-can indeed be used in ways that constrain and advance
   psychological theory.}},

Abstract = {{Concepts develop for many aspects of experience, including abstract
   internal states and abstract social activities that do not refer to
   concrete entities in the world. The current study assessed the
   hypothesis that, like concrete concepts, distributed neural patterns of
   relevant nonlinguistic semantic content represent the meanings of
   abstract concepts. In a novel neuroimaging paradigm, participants
   processed two abstract concepts (convince, arithmetic) and two concrete
   concepts (rolling, red) deeply and repeatedly during a concept-scene
   matching task that grounded each concept in typical contexts. Using a
   catch trial design, neural activity associated with each concept word
   was separated from neural activity associated with subsequent visual
   scenes to assess activations underlying the detailed semantics of each
   concept. We predicted that brain regions underlying mentalizing and
   social cognition (e. g., medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal
   sulcus) would become active to represent semantic content central to
   convince, whereas brain regions underlying numerical cognition (e. g.,
   bilateral intraparietal sulcus) would become active to represent
   semantic content central to arithmetic. The results supported these
   predictions, suggesting that the meanings of abstract concepts arise
   from distributed neural systems that represent concept-specific content.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to examine whether interindividual
   differences in the coupling or decoupling of prefrontal and posterior
   cortices during the exposure to social-emotional information may predict
   an individual's positive emotional responsiveness. Susceptibility to
   humor was assessed in a behavioral paradigm several weeks after the EEG
   recordings. State-dependent changes of prefrontal-posterior EEG beta
   coherence were recorded during stimulation with other people's auditory
   expressions of cheerfulness and sadness. Greater decreases of coherence
   during the stimulation with positive affect expressions prospectively
   predicted greater positive emotional responsiveness, indicated by higher
   amusement ratings in response to cartoons and higher scores in a
   questionnaire measure of exhilarability. Greater increases of coherence
   during the stimulation with negative affect expressions did not predict
   perceived funniness but were related to shorter response latencies to
   the amusement ratings. The results further support the notion that a
   more loose prefrontal-posterior coupling may be related to loosening of
   control of the prefrontal cortex over incoming emotional information
   and, thus, to a propensity to deeper emotional involvement and a greater
   impact of perceptual input, whereas increased prefrontal-posterior
   coupling may be related to strong control and the propensity to protect
   oneself from becoming emotionally affected.}},

Abstract = {{Context has been found to have a profound effect on the recognition of
   social stimuli and correlated brain activation. The present study was
   designed to determine whether knowledge about emotional authenticity
   influences emotion recognition expressed through speech intonation.
   Participants classified emotionally expressive speech in an fMRI
   experimental design as sad, happy, angry, or fearful. For some trials,
   stimuli were cued as either authentic or play-acted in order to
   manipulate participant top-down belief about authenticity, and these
   labels were presented both congruently and incongruently to the
   emotional authenticity of the stimulus. Contrasting authentic versus
   play-acted stimuli during uncued trials indicated that play-acted
   stimuli spontaneously up-regulate activity in the auditory cortex and
   regions associated with emotional speech processing. In addition, a
   clear interaction effect of cue and stimulus authenticity showed
   up-regulation in the posterior superior temporal sulcus and the anterior
   cingulate cortex, indicating that cueing had an impact on the perception
   of authenticity. In particular, when a cue indicating an authentic
   stimulus was followed by a play-acted stimulus, additional activation
   occurred in the temporoparietal junction, probably pointing to increased
   load on perspective taking in such trials. While actual authenticity has
   a significant impact on brain activation, individual belief about
   stimulus authenticity can additionally modulate the brain response to
   differences in emotionally expressive speech.}},

Abstract = {{Attributions are constantly assigned in everyday life. A well-known
   phenomenon is the self-serving bias: that is, people's tendency to
   attribute positive events to internal causes (themselves) and negative
   events to external causes (other persons/circumstances). Here, we
   investigated the neural correlates of the cognitive processes implicated
   in self-serving attributions using social situations that differed in
   their emotional saliences. We administered an attributional bias task
   during fMRI scanning in a large sample of healthy subjects (n = 71).
   Eighty sentences describing positive or negative social situations were
   presented, and subjects decided via buttonpress whether the situation
   had been caused by themselves or by the other person involved. Comparing
   positive with negative sentences revealed activations of the bilateral
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Self-attribution correlated with
   activation of the posterior portion of the precuneus. However,
   self-attributed positive versus negative sentences showed activation of
   the anterior portion of the precuneus, and self-attributed negative
   versus positive sentences demonstrated activation of the bilateral
   insular cortex. All significant activations were reported with a
   statistical threshold of p a parts per thousand currency sign .001,
   uncorrected. In addition, a comparison of our fMRI task with data from
   the Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire,
   Revised German Version, demonstrated convergent validity. Our findings
   suggest that the precuneus and the PCC are involved in the evaluation of
   social events with particular regional specificities: The PCC is
   activated during emotional evaluation, the posterior precuneus during
   attributional evaluation, and the anterior precuneus during self-serving
   processes. Furthermore, we assume that insula activation is a correlate
   of awareness of personal agency in negative situations.}},

Abstract = {{Moral decision-making involves complex social cognitive processes which
   are known to be altered in patients with schizophrenia and first-degree
   relatives. Traditional philosophical views on human moral behavior have
   distinguished between utilitarian views (which emphasize outcomes) and
   deontological approaches (defining what is right to do according to
   certain norms). Since emotions have been suggested to play a determining
   role in moral behavior, we hypothesized patients with schizophrenia and
   unaffected siblings would make more utilitarian choices and show faulty
   activation of brain areas concerned with emotion regulation during such
   tasks. Unexpectedly, all participants (n = 13 per group) made the same
   proportion of utilitarian and deontological decisions. Brain activation
   common to all groups induced by moral decisions included two
   circumscribed portions of right ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex, adding to previous evidence on a right prosencephalic cognitive
   network involved in ethical decisions. However, brain activation induced
   by moral decisions was different in healthy persons, schizophrenia
   patients, and nonpsychotic siblings in regards to areas directly
   concerned with emotion processing. These results seem to underscore the
   role of acquired norms in moral decisions, a frequently overlooked
   concept in the neurobiological characterization of human ethical
   behavior, and add to previous evidence of abnormal social cognitive
   processing in schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In schizophrenia there seems to be an inefficient activation of
   prefrontal and hippocampal regions. Patients tend to show worse
   cognitive performance in functions subserved by those regions as
   compared to healthy controls in spite of higher regional activation.
   However, the association between activation abnormalities and cognitive
   deficits remains without being understood. In the present study, we
   compared cerebral perfusion using single-photon emission tomography
   (SPECT) in patients and controls to study the association between
   activation patterns and cognitive performance in this disease. The SPECT
   studies were simultaneously obtained with an electrophysiological
   recording during a P300 paradigm to elicit P3a and P3b components. We
   included 23 stable patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 29 healthy
   controls that underwent clinical and cognitive assessments. Patients
   with schizophrenia showed an increased perfusion in the right
   hippocampus with respect to healthy controls, they also displayed a
   statistically significant inverse association between perfusion in the
   left hippocampus and verbal memory performance. Healthy controls showed
   an inverse association between perfusion in the left dorsolateral
   prefrontal (DLPFC) region and working memory performance. P3b but not
   P3a amplitude was significantly lower in patients. The limbic
   overactivation in the patients may contribute to their cognitive
   deficits in verbal memory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of having deficits in various areas of social cognition,
   especially in mindreading, Machiavellian individuals are typically very
   successful in different tasks, including solving social dilemmas. We
   assume that a profound examination of neural structures associated with
   decision-making processes is needed to learn more about Machiavellians'
   abilities in exploiting other people. More specifically, we predicted
   that high-Mach people would show elevated activity in the brain areas
   involved in reward-seeking, anticipation of risky situations, and
   inference making. To test this hypothesis, we used an fMRI technique to
   examine individuals as they played the Trust Game. In accordance with
   our predictions, we found consistent activation in high-Machs' thalamus
   and anterior cingulate cortex (player 1), and dorsal anterior
   insula/inferior frontal gyrus (player 2). We suggest that Machiavellians
   conduct specific neural operations in social dilemma situations that
   make them successful in exploiting others. Machiavellians may have
   cognitive heuristics that enable them to make predictions about the
   future reward in a basically risky and unpredictable situation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Anxiety disorders are characterized by deficient emotion regulation
   prior to and in anxiety-evoking situations. Patients with social anxiety
   disorder (SAD) have increased brain activation also during the
   anticipation and perception of non-specific emotional stimuli pointing
   to biased general emotion processing. In the current study we addressed
   the neural correlates of emotion regulation by cognitive control during
   the anticipation and perception of non-specific emotional stimuli in
   patients with SAD. Thirty-two patients with SAD underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging during the announced anticipation and
   perception of emotional stimuli. Half of them were trained and
   instructed to apply reality-checking as a control strategy, the others
   anticipated and perceived the stimuli. Reality checking significantly (p
   < 0.01) reduced activity in insular, amygdalar and medial thalamic areas
   during the anticipation and perception of negative emotional stimuli.
   The medial prefrontal cortex was comparably active in both groups (p >
   0.50). The results suggest that cognitive control in patients with SAD
   influences emotion processing structures, supporting the usefulness of
   emotion regulation training in the psychotherapy of SAD. In contrast to
   studies in healthy subjects, cognitive control was not associated with
   increased activation of prefrontal regions in SAD. This points to
   possibly disturbed general emotion regulating circuits in SAD. (c) 2012

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{The last years have shown a growing interest in research on the neural
   mechanisms for perceiving and understanding social interactions. Only
   very recently, a role for somatosensation in social perception has been
   suggested. Numerous studies reported vicarious responses in the primary
   somatosensory cortex (SI) and other areas merely when seeing others
   being touched. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that these vicarious
   somatosensory responses can be linked with inter-individual differences
   in empathy. However, beyond empathy other personality traits have been
   shown to interact with social perception and behavior. Here we tested if
   personality traits according to the Five-Factor-Model interact with
   vicarious activation in somatosensory brain regions. We conducted a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which subjects
   viewed video clips showing simple non-painful touch to a hand and a
   control condition including the same visual and motion parts. Results
   revealed vicarious somatosensory activation when viewing the touched
   hand, as expected. Vicarious activation in SI showed a trend for a
   positive correlation with the personality trait openness to experience.
   Moreover, mirror-like responses in the insula were strongly correlated
   with the personality trait conscientiousness, suggesting links to
   processes of self-control. We conclude that vicarious brain responses to
   seen touch seem to interact with personality traits.}},

   Communicative Action and the Social Brain}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{In the philosophical theory of communicative action, rationality refers
   to interpersonal communication rather than to a knowing subject. Thus, a
   social view of rationality is suggested. The theory differentiates
   between two kinds of rationality, the emancipative communicative and the
   strategic or instrumental reasoning. Using experimental designs in an
   fMRI setting, recent studies explored similar questions of reasoning in
   the social world and linked them with a neural network including
   prefrontal and parietal brain regions. Here, we employed an fMRI
   approach to highlight brain areas associated with strategic and
   communicative reasoning according to the theory of communicative action.
   Participants were asked to assess different social scenarios with
   respect to communicative or strategic rationality. We found a network of
   brain areas including temporal pole, precuneus, and STS more activated
   when participants performed communicative reasoning compared with
   strategic thinking and a control condition. These brain regions have
   been previously linked to moral sensitivity. In contrast, strategic
   rationality compared with communicative reasoning and control was
   associated with less activation in areas known to be related to moral
   sensitivity, emotional processing, and language control. The results
   suggest that strategic reasoning is associated with reduced social and
   emotional cognitions and may use different language related networks.
   Thus, the results demonstrate experimental support for the assumptions
   of the theory of communicative action.}},

Abstract = {{Unattractive job candidates face a disadvantage when interviewing for a
   job. Employers' evaluations are colored by the candidate's physical
   attractiveness even when they take job interview performance into
   account. This example illustrates unexplored questions about the neural
   basis of social evaluation in humans. What neural regions support the
   lasting effects of initial impressions (even after getting to know
   someone)? How does the brain process information that changes our minds
   about someone? Job candidates' competence was evaluated from photographs
   and again after seeing snippets of job interviews. Left lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex modulation serves as a warning signal for initial
   reactions that ultimately undermine evaluations even when additional
   information is taken into account. The neural basis of changing one's
   mind about a candidate is not a simple matter of computing the amount of
   competence-affirming information in their job interview. Instead, seeing
   a candidate for the better is somewhat distinguishable at the neural
   level from seeing a candidate for the worse. Whereas amygdala modulation
   marks the extremity of evaluation change, favorable impression change
   additionally draws on parametric modulation of lateral prefrontal cortex
   and unfavorable impression change additionally draws on parametric
   modulation of medial prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and striatum.
   Investigating social evaluation as a dynamic process (rather than a
   one-time impression) paints a new picture of its neural basis and
   highlights the partially dissociable processes that contribute to
   changing your mind about someone for the better or the worse.}},

Title = {{Cerebral responses to vocal attractiveness and auditory hallucinations
   in schizophrenia: a functional MRI study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Impaired self-monitoring and abnormalities of cognitive bias have been
   implicated as cognitive mechanisms of hallucination; regions fundamental
   to these processes including inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and superior
   temporal gyrus (STG) are abnormally activated in individuals that
   hallucinate. A recent study showed activation in IFG-STG to be modulated
   by auditory attractiveness, but no study has investigated whether these
   IFG-STG activations are impaired in schizophrenia. We aimed to clarify
   the cerebral function underlying the perception of auditory
   attractiveness in schizophrenia patients. Cerebral activation was
   examined in 18 schizophrenia patients and 18 controls when performing
   Favorability Judgment Task (FJT) and Gender Differentiation Task (GDT)
   for pairs of greetings using event-related functional MRI. A
   full-factorial analysis revealed that the main effect of task was
   associated with activation of left IFG and STG. The main effect of Group
   revealed less activation of left STG in schizophrenia compared with
   controls, whereas significantly greater activation in schizophrenia than
   in controls was revealed at the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), right
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), right occipital lobe, and right
   amygdala (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected). A significant positive correlation
   was observed at the right TPJ and right MFG between cerebral activation
   under FJT minus GDT contrast and the score of hallucinatory behavior on
   the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale. Findings of hypo-activation in
   the left STG could designate brain dysfunction in accessing vocal
   attractiveness in schizophrenia, whereas hyper-activation in the right
   TPJ and MFG may reflect the process of mentalizing other person's
   behavior by auditory hallucination by abnormality of cognitive bias.}},

Abstract = {{After a threatening event, the risk of developing social

Title = {{Action Prediction in Younger versus Older Adults: Neural Correlates of
   Motor Familiarity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 21}},
Abstract = {{Generating predictions during action observation is essential for
   efficient navigation through our social environment. With age, the
   sensitivity in action prediction declines. In younger adults, the action
   observation network (AON), consisting of premotor, parietal and
   occipitotemporal cortices, has been implicated in transforming executed
   and observed actions into a common code. Much less is known about
   age-related changes in the neural representation of observed actions.
   Using fMRI, the present study measured brain activity in younger and
   older adults during the prediction of temporarily occluded actions
   (figure skating elements and simple movement exercises). All
   participants were highly familiar with the movement exercises whereas
   only some participants were experienced figure skaters. With respect to
   the AON, the results confirm that this network was preferentially
   engaged for the more familiar movement exercises. Compared to younger
   adults, older adults recruited visual regions to perform the task and,
   additionally, the hippocampus and caudate when the observed actions were
   familiar to them. Thus, instead of effectively exploiting the
   sensorimotor matching properties of the AON, older adults seemed to rely
   predominantly on the visual dynamics of the observed actions to perform
   the task. Our data further suggest that the caudate played an important
   role during the prediction of the less familiar figure skating elements
   in better-performing groups. Together, these findings show that action
   prediction engages a distributed network in the brain, which is
   modulated by the content of the observed actions and the age and
   experience of the observer.}},

Abstract = {{Children with conduct problems (CP) persistently violate others' rights
   and represent a considerable societal cost {[}1]. These children also
   display atypical empathic responses to others' distress {[}2], which may
   partly account for their violent and antisocial behavior. Callous traits
   index lack of empathy in these children and confer risk for adult
   psychopathy {[}3]. Investigating neural responses to others' pain is an
   ecologically valid method to probe empathic processing {[}4], but
   studies in children with CP have been inconclusive {[}5, 6]. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured neural
   responses to pictures of others in pain (versus no pain) in a large
   sample of children with CP and matched controls. Relative to controls,
   children with CP showed reduced blood oxygen level-dependent responses
   to others' pain in bilateral anterior insula (Al), anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC), and inferior frontal gyrus, regions associated with
   empathy for pain in previous studies {[}7, 8]. In the CP group, callous
   traits were negatively associated with responses to others' pain in Al
   and ACC. We conclude that children with CP have atypical neural
   responses to others' pain. The negative association between callous
   traits and Al/ACC response could reflect an early neurobiological marker
   indexing risk for empathic deficits seen in adult psychopathy.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of deception in social contexts in normally developing
   children}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 17}},
Abstract = {{Deception is related to the ability to inhibit prepotent responses and
   to engage in mental tasks such as anticipating responses and inferring
   what another person knows, especially in social contexts. However, the
   neural correlates of deception processing, which requires mentalizing,
   remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we
   examined the neural correlates of deception, including mentalization, in
   social contexts in normally developing children. Healthy right-handed
   children (aged 8-9 years) were scanned while performing interactive
   games involving deception. The games varied along two dimensions: the
   type of reply (deception and truth) and the type of context (social and
   less social). Participants were instructed to deceive a witch and to
   tell the truth to a girl. Under the social-context conditions,
   participants were asked to consider what they inferred about
   protagonists' preferences from their facial expressions when responding
   to questions. Under the less-social-context conditions, participants did
   not need to consider others' preferences. We found a significantly
   greater response in the right precuneus under the social-context than
   under less-social-context conditions. Additionally, we found marginally
   greater activation in the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) under the
   deception than under the truth condition. These results suggest that
   deception in a social context requires not only inhibition of prepotent
   responses but also engagement in mentalizing processes. This study
   provides the first evidence of the neural correlates of the mentalizing
   processes involved in deception in normally developing children.}},

Abstract = {{We often have to make choices among multiattribute stimuli (e.g., a food
   that differs on its taste and health). Behavioral data suggest that
   choices are made by computing the value of the different attributes and
   then integrating them into an overall stimulus value signal. However, it
   is not known whether this theory describes the way the brain computes
   the stimulus value signals, or how the underlying computations might be
   implemented. We investigated these questions using a human fMRI task in
   which individuals had to evaluate T-shirts that varied in their visual
   esthetic (e.g., color) and semantic (e.g., meaning of logo printed in
   T-shirt) components. We found that activity in the fusiform gyrus, an
   area associated with the processing of visual features, correlated with
   the value of the visual esthetic attributes, but not with the value of
   the semantic attributes. In contrast, activity in posterior superior
   temporal gyrus, an area associated with the processing of semantic
   meaning, exhibited the opposite pattern. Furthermore, both areas
   exhibited functional connectivity with an area of ventromedial

   values at the time of decision. The results provide supporting evidence

Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{174-182}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Individual political preferences as expressed, for instance, in votes or
   donations are fundamental to democratic societies. However, the
   relevance of deliberative processing for political preferences has been
   highly debated, putting automatic processes in the focus of attention.
   Based on this notion, the present study tested whether brain responses
   reflect participants' preferences for politicians and their associated
   political parties in the absence of explicit deliberation and attention.
   Participants were instructed to perform a demanding visual fixation task
   while their brain responses were measured using fMRI. Occasionally,
   task-irrelevant images of German politicians from two major competing
   parties were presented in the background while the distraction task was
   continued. Subsequent to scanning, participants' political preferences
   for these politicians and their affiliated parties were obtained. Brain
   responses in distinct brain areas predicted automatic political
   preferences at the different levels of abstraction: activation in the
   ventral striatum was positively correlated with preference ranks for
   unattended politicians, whereas participants' preferences for the
   affiliated political parties were reflected in activity in the insula
   and the cingulate cortex. Using an additional donation task, we showed
   that the automatic preference-related processing in the brain extended
   to real-world behavior that involved actual financial loss to
   participants. Together, these findings indicate that brain responses
   triggered by unattended and task-irrelevant political images reflect
   individual political preferences at different levels of abstraction. (C)

Abstract = {{Studies of prefrontal cortex (PFC) lesion patients suggest that

   individuals. We hypothesized that the more the locus of activation is in
   the posterior (as opposed to anterior) PFC, the more the decision maker
   will be affected by recent information at the expense of past outcomes.
   Participants performed a complex decision task while their PFC activity
   was monitored using fMRI. Results indicate that individual differences

Title = {{Different Types of Laughter Modulate Connectivity within Distinct Parts
   of the Laughter Perception Network}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Laughter is an ancient signal of social communication among humans and
   non-human primates. Laughter types with complex social functions (e.g.,
   taunt and joy) presumably evolved from the unequivocal and reflex-like
   social bonding signal of tickling laughter already present in non-human
   primates. Here, we investigated the modulations of cerebral connectivity
   associated with different laughter types as well as the effects of
   attention shifts between implicit and explicit processing of social
   information conveyed by laughter using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). Complex social laughter types and tickling laughter were
   found to modulate connectivity in two distinguishable but partially
   overlapping parts of the laughter perception network irrespective of
   task instructions. Connectivity changes, presumably related to the
   higher acoustic complexity of tickling laughter, occurred between areas
   in the prefrontal cortex and the auditory association cortex,
   potentially reflecting higher demands on acoustic analysis associated
   with increased information load on auditory attention, working memory,
   evaluation and response selection processes. In contrast, the higher
   degree of socio-relational information in complex social laughter types
   was linked to increases of connectivity between auditory association
   cortices, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and brain areas
   associated with mentalizing as well as areas in the visual associative
   cortex. These modulations might reflect automatic analysis of acoustic
   features, attention direction to informative aspects of the laughter
   signal and the retention of those in working memory during evaluation
   processes. These processes may be associated with visual imagery
   supporting the formation of inferences on the intentions of our social
   counterparts. Here, the right dorsolateral precentral cortex appears as
   a network node potentially linking the functions of auditory and visual
   associative sensory cortices with those of the mentalizing-associated
   anterior mediofrontal cortex during the decoding of social information
   in laughter.}},

Abstract = {{Our preferences are influenced by what other people like, but depend
   critically on how we feel about those people, a classical psychological
   effect called ``cognitive balance.{''} Here, we manipulated preferences
   for goods by telling participants the preferences of strongly liked or
   disliked groups of other people. Participants' preferences converged to
   those of the liked group, but diverged from the disliked group.
   Activation of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) tracked the
   discrepancy between one's own preference and its social ideal and was
   associated with subsequent preference change (toward the liked and away
   from the disliked group), even several months later. A follow-up study
   found overlapping activation in this same region of dmPFC with negative
   monetary outcomes, but no overlap with nearby activations induced by
   response conflict. A single social encounter can thus result in
   long-lasting preference change, a mechanism that recruits dmPFC and that
   may reflect the aversive nature of cognitive imbalance.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Although many studies have examined the neural basis of empathy,
   relatively little is known about how empathic processes are affected by
   different attentional conditions. Thus, we examined whether instructions
   to empathize might amplify responses in empathy-related regions and
   whether cognitive load would diminish the involvement of these regions.
   Thirty-two participants completed a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging session assessing empathic responses to individuals experiencing
   happy, sad, and anxious events. Stimuli were presented under three
   conditions: watching naturally, actively empathizing, and under
   cognitive load. Across analyses, we found evidence for a core set of
   neural regions that support empathic processes (dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex, DMPFC; medial prefrontal cortex, MPFC; temporoparietal junction,
   TPJ; amygdala; ventral anterior insula, AI; and septal area, SA). Two
   key regions-the ventral AI and SA-were consistently active across all
   attentional conditions, suggesting that they are automatically engaged
   during empathy. In addition, watching vs. empathizing with targets was
   not markedly different and instead led to similar subjective and neural
   responses to others' emotional experiences. In contrast, cognitive load
   reduced the subjective experience of empathy and diminished neural
   responses in several regions related to empathy and social cognition
   (DMPFC, MPFC, TPJ, and amygdala). The results reveal how attention
   impacts empathic processes and provides insight into how empathy may
   unfold in everyday interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A hallmark of human social interaction is the ability to consider other
   people's mental states, such as what they see, believe, or desire. Prior
   neuroimaging research has predominantly investigated the neural
   mechanisms involved in computing one's own or another person's
   perspective and largely ignored the question of perspective selection.
   That is, which brain regions are engaged in the process of selecting
   between self and other perspectives? To address this question, the
   current fMRI study used a behavioral paradigm that required participants
   to select between competing visual perspectives. We provide two main
   extensions to current knowledge. First, we demonstrate that brain
   regions within dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices respond in
   a viewpoint-independent manner during the selection of task-relevant
   over task-irrelevant perspectives. More specifically, following the
   computation of two competing visual perspectives, common regions of
   frontoparietal cortex are engaged to select one's own viewpoint over
   another's as well as select another's viewpoint over one's own. Second,
   in the absence of conflict between the content of competing
   perspectives, we showed a reduced engagement of frontoparietal cortex
   when judging another's visual perspective relative to one's own. This
   latter finding provides the first brain-based evidence for the
   hypothesis that, in some situations, another person's perspective is
   automatically and effortlessly computed, and thus, less cognitive
   control is required to select it over one's own perspective. In doing
   so, we provide stronger evidence for the claim that we not only
   automatically compute what other people see but also, in some cases, we
   compute this even before we are explicitly aware of our own perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are known to be influenced by several
   biological variables, including sex. In adult populations studies using
   conventional high-contrast checkerboard have shown that females display
   larger amplitudes and shorter latencies than males. To date, few studies
   have been conducted in children; the available data suggests that girls
   display significantly larger amplitudes than boys but the effect on
   latency is absent or negligible. We investigated sex-related VEP
   differences in 149 school-age (11.3 +/- 0.6 years) children from
   Northern Quebec using several VEP protocols: achromatic pattern-reversal
   VEPs at high (95\%) and low contrast (30\%, 12\% and 4\%), as well as
   motion-onset VEPs and isoluminant pattern-reversal VEPs. Girls showed
   significantly larger amplitudes in achromatic VEPs for most of the
   contrast levels as well as in N2 response to motion-onset. No
   significant difference was found regarding the amplitude of isoluminant
   VEPs. In addition, girls showed shorter latencies for the achromatic N75
   and a trend (p < 0.1) for the P100, regardless of the contrast level.
   Interestingly, this latency effect appeared mostly due to head size, not
   sex. No differences in latency were found for motion or isoluminant
   responses. Overall, these findings show that sex-related differences are
   present in children mostly in VEP amplitude not only for high contrast
   achromatic pattern-reversal but also for low contrast levels and
   motion-onset VEPs, suggesting that sex affects VEP responses in a
   general fashion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The laterality difference in the occipitotemporal region between Chinese
   (bilaterality) and alphabetic languages (left laterality) has been
   attributed to their difference in visual appearance. However, these
   languages also differ in orthographic transparency. To disentangle the
   effect of orthographic transparency from visual appearance, we trained
   subjects to read the same artificial script either as an alphabetic
   (i.e., transparent orthography) or a logographic (i.e., nontransparent
   orthography) language. Consistent with our previous results, both types
   of phonological training enhanced activations in the left fusiform
   gyrus. More interestingly, the laterality in the fusiform gyrus
   (especially the posterior region) was modulated by the orthographic
   transparency of the artificial script (more left-lateralized activation
   after alphabetic training than after logographic training). These
   results provide an alternative account (i.e., orthographic transparency)
   for the laterality difference between Chinese and alphabetic languages,
   and may have important implications for the role of the fusiform in
   reading. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Current theories of cognitive aging emphasize that the prefrontal cortex
   might not only be a major source of dysfunction but also a source of
   compensation. We evaluated neural activity associated with retrieval
   monitoring-or the selection and evaluation of recollected information
   during memory retrieval for evidence of dysfunction or compensation.
   Younger and older adults studied pictures and words and were
   subsequently given criterial recollection tests during event-related
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although memory accuracy was
   greater on the picture test than the word test in both groups, activity
   in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was associated with
   greater retrieval monitoring demands (word test > picture test) only in
   younger adults. Similarly, DLPFC activity was consistently associated
   with greater item difficulty (studied > nonstudied) only in younger
   adults. Older adults instead exhibited high levels of DLPFC activity for
   all of these conditions, and activity was greater than younger adults
   even when test performance was naturally matched across the groups
   (picture test). Correlations also differed between DLPFC activity and
   test performance across the groups. Collectively, these findings are
   more consistent with accounts of DLPFC dysfunction than compensation,
   suggesting that aging disrupts the otherwise beneficial coupling between
   DLPFC recruitment and retrieval monitoring demands.}},

Abstract = {{Object manipulation produces characteristic sounds and causes specific
   haptic sensations that facilitate the recognition of the manipulated
   object. To identify the neural correlates of audio-haptic binding of
   object features, healthy volunteers underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging while they matched a target object to a sample object
   within and across audition and touch. By introducing a delay between the
   presentation of sample and target stimuli, it was possible to dissociate
   haptic-to-auditory and auditory-to-haptic matching. We hypothesized that
   only semantically coherent auditory and haptic object features activate
   cortical regions that host unified conceptual object representations.
   The left fusiform gyrus (FG) and posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) showed increased activation during crossmodal matching of
   semantically congruent but not incongruent object stimuli. In the FG,
   this effect was found for haptic-to-auditory and auditory-to-haptic
   matching, whereas the pSTS only displayed a crossmodal matching effect
   for congruent auditory targets. Auditory and somatosensory association
   cortices showed increased activity during crossmodal object matching
   which was, however, independent of semantic congruency. Together, the
   results show multisensory interactions at different hierarchical stages
   of auditory and haptic object processing. Object-specific crossmodal
   interactions culminate in the left FG, which may provide a higher order
   convergence zone for conceptual object knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative
   disorder resulting in social-cognitive deficits partially attributed to
   abnormalities processing social cues, such as facial expressions.
   However, to our knowledge, the functional neuroanatomy of deficient
   social cue processing in individuals with FTD has not been examined. The
   objective of this study was to delineate the functional abnormalities
   under lying altered facial expression processing in individuals with FTD
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: Patients
   meeting Neary criteria for behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) with
   supportive neuroimaging and 18 age-matched healthy controls completed an
   implicit facial expression task during fMRI. We conducted volumetric
   brain morphometry to correct functional imaging data for volume
   differences. Results: We included 20 patients with bvFTD and 18 controls
   in our study. The results demonstrate emotion-specific functional
   abnormalities in frontal and limbic regions in patients with bvFTD.
   Patients also showed decreased activity in posterior ventral visual
   regions, specifically the fusiform cortex, possibly reflecting reduced
   afferent input from limbic regions. Finally, bvFTD was associated with
   increased activity in posterior regions, including the inferior parietal
   cortex. Limitations: Autopsy validation of frontotemporal dementia is
   not yet available for this cohort. Conclusion: Together, these findings
   suggest that fMRI combined with tasks targeting social-cognitive
   deficits is a powerful technique to objectively measure neural systems
   involved in emotion processing in individuals with bvFTD. As viewing
   emotional expressions is known to engage many of the same neural systems
   that are active when experiencing the emotion itself, fMRI during
   expression processing provides a novel window into the emotions of
   patients with FTD.}},

Abstract = {{Progress in the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of
   the brain to differentiate lying from truth-telling has created an
   expectation of a breakthrough in the search for objective methods of lie
   detection. In the last few years, litigants have attempted to introduce
   fMRI-based lie detection evidence in courts. Both the science and its
   possible use as courtroom evidence have spawned much scholarly
   discussion. This article contributes to the interdisciplinary debate by
   identifying the missing pieces of the scientific puzzle that need to be
   completed if fMRI-based lie detection is to meet the standards of either
   legal reliability or general acceptance. The article provides a balanced
   analysis of the current science and the cases in which litigants have
   sought to introduce fMRI-based lie detection. Identifying the key
   limitations of the science as expert evidence, the article explores the
   problems that arise from using scientific evidence before it is proven
   valid and reliable. We conclude that the Daubert's ``known error
   rate{''} is the key concept linking the legal and scientific standards.
   We suggest that properly controlled clinical trials are the most
   convincing means to confirm or disprove the relevance of this promising
   laboratory research. Given the controversial nature and potential
   societal impact of this technology, collaboration of several government
   agencies may be required to sponsor impartial and comprehensive clinical

Title = {{An Intact Social Cognitive Process in Schizophrenia: Situational Context
   Effects on Perception of Facial Affect}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Background: Impaired facial affect recognition is the most consistent
   social cognitive finding in schizophrenia. Although social situations
   provide powerful constraints on our perception, little is known about
   how situational context modulates facial affect recognition in
   schizophrenia. Methods: Study 1 was a single-site study with 34
   schizophrenia patients and 22 healthy controls. Study 2 was a 2-site
   study with 68 schizophrenia patients and 28 controls. Both studies
   administered a Situational Context Facial Affect Recognition Task with 2
   conditions: a situational context condition and a no-context condition.
   For the situational context condition, a briefly shown face was preceded
   by a sentence describing either a fear- or surprise-inducing event. In
   the no-context condition, a face was presented without a sentence. For
   both conditions, subjects rated how fearful or surprised the face
   appeared on a 9-point Likert scale. Results: For the situational context
   condition of study 1, both patients and controls rated faces as more
   afraid when they were paired with fear-inducing sentences and as more
   surprised when they were paired with surprise-inducing sentences. The
   degree of modulation was comparable across groups. For the no-context
   condition, patients rated faces comparably to controls. The findings of
   study 2 replicated those from study 1. Conclusions: Despite previous
   abnormalities in other types of context paradigms, this study found
   intact situational context processing in schizophrenia, suggesting that
   patients benefit from situational context when interpreting ambiguous
   facial expression. This area of relative social cognitive strength in
   schizophrenia has implications for social cognitive training programs.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows observing cerebral
   activity not only in separated cortical regions but also in functionally
   coupled cortical networks. Although moderate doses of ethanol slowdown
   the neurovascular coupling, the functions of the primary sensorimotor
   and the visual system remain intact. Yet little is known about how more
   complex interactions between cortical regions are affected even at
   moderate doses of alcohol. Therefore the method of psychophysiological
   interaction (PPI) was applied to analyze ethanol-induced effects on the
   effective connectivity in the visuomotor system. Fourteen healthy social
   drinkers with no personal history of neurological disorders or substance
   abuse were examined. In a test/re-test design they served as their own
   controls by participating in both the sober and the ethanol condition.
   All participants were scanned in a 3 T MR scanner before and after
   ingestion of a body-weight-dependent amount of ethanol calculated to
   achieve a blood alcohol concentration of 1.0 parts per thousand. PPIs
   were calculated for the primary visual cortex, the supplementary motor
   area, and the left and right primary motor cortex using the statistical
   software package SPM. The PPI analysis showed selective disturbance of
   the effective connectivity between different cortical areas. The
   regression analysis revealed the influence of the supplementary motor
   area on connected regions like the primary motor cortex to be decreased
   yet preserved. However, the connection between the primary visual cortex
   and the posterior parietal cortex was more severely impaired by the
   influence of ethanol, leading to an uncoupled regression between these
   regions. The decreased effective connectivity in the visuomotor system
   suggests that complex tasks requiring interaction or synchronization
   between different brain areas are affected even at moderate levels of
   alcohol. This finding may have important consequences for determining
   which components of demanding tasks such as driving a car might be
   compromised earlier than the functions of the main cortical motor and
   visual areas. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{237}},

Abstract = {{There is general consensus in the literature that a distributed network
   of temporal and frontal brain areas is involved in speech comprehension.
   However, how active versus passive tasks modulate the activation and the
   functional connectivity of the critical brain areas is not clearly
   understood. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to identify intelligibility and task-related effects in speech
   comprehension. Participants performed a semantic judgment task on normal
   and time-reversed sentences, or passively listened to the sentences
   without making an overt response. The subtraction analysis demonstrated
   that passive sentence comprehension mainly engaged brain areas in the
   left anterior and posterior superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal
   gyrus (aSTS/MTG and pSTS/MTG), whereas active sentence comprehension
   recruited bilateral frontal regions in addition to the aSTS/MTG and
   pSTS/MTG regions. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that during
   passive sentence comprehension, the left aSTS/MTG was functionally
   connected with the left Heschl's gyrus (HG) and bilateral superior
   temporal gyrus (STG) but no area was functionally connected with the
   left pSTS/MTG; during active sentence comprehension, however, both the
   left aSTS/MTG and pSTS/MTG were functionally connected with bilateral
   superior temporal and inferior frontal areas. While these results are
   consistent with the view that the ventral stream of the temporo-frontal
   network subserves semantic processing, our findings further indicate
   that both the activation and the functional connectivity of the temporal
   and frontal areas are modulated by task demands. (C) 2013 IBRO.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{519-535}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Cognition can unfold with little regard to the events taking place in
   the environment, and such self-generated mental activity poses a
   specific set of challenges for its scientific analysis in both cognitive
   science and neuroscience. One problem is that the spontaneous onset of
   self-generated mental activity makes it hard to distinguish the events
   that control the occurrence of the experience from those processes that
   ensure the continuity of an internal train of thought once initiated.
   This review demonstrates that a distinction between process and
   occurrence (a) provides theoretical clarity that has been absent from
   current discussions of self-generated mental activity, (b) affords
   conceptual leverage on seemingly disparate results associating the state
   with both domain-general processes and task error, and (c) draws
   attention to important questions for understanding unconstrained thought
   in contexts such as psychopathology and education. It is suggested that
   identifying the moment that self-generated mental events begin is a
   necessary next step in moving toward a testable account of why the mind
   has evolved to neglect the present in favor of ruminations on the past
   or imaginary musings of what may yet come to pass.}},

Journal = {{ADDICTION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{570-580}},

Abstract = {{Cue-reactivity reflects enhanced motivational processing underlying
   continued substance use and relapse in substance use disorders.
   Substance use disorders are associated with greater cue-reactivity in
   orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, ventral
   tegmental area and amygdala. Here we examine whether this also holds for
   frequent cannabis users. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI), neural responses to neutral and cannabis-related cues were
   compared between frequent cannabis users (n=31), sporadic cannabis users
   (n=20) and cannabis-naive controls (n=21). In addition, fMRI findings
   were correlated with the level of cannabis use, problem severity and
   craving. In frequent users compared with sporadic users and controls,
   cannabis images engendered higher activation than control images in the
   ventral tegmental area. Activation of the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior
   cingulate cortex and striatum was only higher in a subgroup of frequent
   users with high compared with low-problem severity. Activity in the
   right putamen and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex correlated
   negatively with subjective craving in frequent users. Activity was not
   correlated with level of cannabis use. These findings indicate that
   cannabis cues activate areas associated with addiction pathology in
   frequent cannabis users compared with sporadic users and controls.
   However, among frequent users, cue-reactivity seems to be primarily
   associated with problem severity, not with amount of cannabis use. These
   findings imply neural cue-reactivity as a tool in assessing problem
   severity of cannabis use.}},

Abstract = {{Deficits in self monitoring are a core feature of cognitive dysfunction
   in schizophrenia, and may be the basis for disturbances of self and lack
   of insight, ultimately impacting social functioning. However, the
   functional and structural neural correlates of such deficits in self
   monitoring are not well understood. We investigated this issue using
   measurements of neurophysiological and structural brain indices, i.e.,
   error-related and correct-response negativity (ERN \& CRN) of
   event-related potentials, and gray matter volume of the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), and tested whether the association between these
   indices is altered in patients with schizophrenia. Participants
   consisted of 18 male patients with chronic schizophrenia and 18 healthy
   male controls. The 2 groups did not differ in ERN amplitude. In
   contrast, schizophrenia patients showed significantly larger CRN
   amplitudes than did healthy subjects. Although the 2 groups did not
   significantly differ in gray matter volume of the ACC subregions, a
   significant negative correlation was found between ERN amplitudes at the
   frontocentral electrodes and absolute gray matter volumes of the left
   cognitive region of ACC only in healthy controls. These results suggest
   a disruption of function-structure coupling of the brain regions
   sub-serving self monitoring in schizophrenia. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   correlates of advice evaluation and advice integration by means of
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Our results demonstrate that
   evaluating advice recruits the mentalizing network, brain regions
   activated when people think about others' mental states. Important
   activation differences exist, however, depending upon the perceived
   competence of the advisor. Consistently, additional analyses demonstrate
   that integrating others' advice, i.e., how much participants actually
   adjust their initial estimate, correlates with neural activity in the
   centromedial amygdala in the case of a competent and with activity in
   visual cortex in the case of an incompetent advisor. Taken together, our
   findings, therefore, demonstrate that advice evaluation and integration
   rely on dissociable neural mechanisms and that significant differences
   exist depending upon the advisor's reputation, which suggests different
   modes of processing advice depending upon the perceived competence of
   the advisor.}},

Abstract = {{Self-construal priming modulates human behavior and associated neural
   activity. However, the neural activity associated with the
   self-construal priming procedure itself remains unknown. It is also
   unclear whether and how self-construal priming affects neural activity
   prior to engaging in a particular task. To address this gap, we scanned
   Chinese adults, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, during
   self-construal priming and a following resting state. We found that,
   relative to a calculation task, both interdependent and independent
   self-construal priming activated the ventral medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The contrast of
   interdependent vs. independent self-construal priming also revealed
   increased activity in the dorsal MPFC and left middle frontal cortex.
   The regional homogeneity analysis of the resting-state activity revealed
   increased local synchronization of spontaneous activity in the dorsal
   MPFC but decreased local synchronization of spontaneous activity in the
   PCC when contrasting interdependent vs. independent self-construal
   priming. The functional connectivity analysis of the resting-state
   activity, however, did not show significant difference in
   synchronization of activities in remote brain regions between different
   priming conditions. Our findings suggest that accessible
   collectivistic/individualistic mind-set induced by self-construal
   priming is associated with modulations of both task-related and
   resting-state activity in the default mode network.}},

Abstract = {{The human ability to perceive and understand others' suffering is
   critical to reinforcing and maintaining our social bonds. What is not
   clear, however, is the extent to which this generalizes to nonhuman
   entities. Anecdotal evidence indicates that people may engage in
   empathy-like processes when observing suffering nonhuman entities, but
   psychological research suggests that we more readily empathize with
   those to whom we are closer and more similar. In this research, we
   examined neural responses in participants while they were presented with
   pictures of human versus dog suffering. We found that viewing human and
   animal suffering led to large overlapping regions of activation
   previously implicated in empathic responding to suffering, including the
   anterior cingulate gyrus and anterior insula. Direct comparisons of
   viewing human and animal suffering also revealed differences such that
   human suffering yielded significantly greater medial prefrontal
   activation, consistent with high-level theory of mind, whereas animal
   suffering yielded significantly greater parietal and inferior frontal
   activation, consistent with more semantic evaluation and perceptual
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Depressed mothers show negatively biased responses to their infants'
   emotional bids, perhaps due to faulty processing of infant cues. This
   study is the first to examine depression-related differences in mothers'
   neural response to their own infant's emotion faces, considering both
   effects of perinatal depression history and current depressive symptoms.
   Primiparous mothers (n=22), half of whom had a history of major
   depressive episodes (with one episode occurring during pregnancy and/or
   postpartum), were exposed to images of their own and unfamiliar infants'
   joy and distress faces during functional neuroimaging. Group differences
   (depression vs. no-depression) and continuous effects of current
   depressive symptoms were tested in relation to neural response to own
   infant emotion faces. Compared to mothers with no psychiatric diagnoses,
   those with depression showed blunted responses to their own infant's
   distress faces in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Mothers with
   higher levels of current symptomatology showed reduced responses to
   their own infant's joy faces in the orbitofrontal cortex and insula.
   Current symptomatology also predicted lower responses to own infant
   joydistress in left-sided prefrontal and insula/striatal regions. These
   deficits in self-regulatory and motivational response circuits may help
   explain parenting difficulties in depressed mothers.}},

Abstract = {{Taking another person's viewpoint and making sense of their actions are
   key processes that guide social behavior. Previous neuroimaging
   investigations have largely studied these processes separately. The
   current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine how
   the brain incorporates another person's viewpoint and actions into
   visual perspective judgments. Participants made a leftright judgment
   about the location of a target object from their own (egocentric) or an
   actor's visual perspective (altercentric). Actor location varied around
   a table and the actor was either reaching or not reaching for the target
   object. Analyses examined brain regions engaged in the egocentric and
   altercentric tasks, brain regions where response magnitude tracked the
   orientation of the actor in the scene and brain regions sensitive to the
   action performed by the actor. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   response in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was sensitive to actor
   orientation in the altercentric task, whereas the response in right
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) was sensitive to actor orientation in the
   egocentric task. Thus, dmPFC and right IFG may play distinct but
   complementary roles in visual perspective taking (VPT). Observation of a
   reaching actor compared to a non-reaching actor yielded activation in
   lateral occipitotemporal cortex, regardless of task, showing that these
   regions are sensitive to body posture independent of social context. By
   considering how an observed actor's location and action influence the
   neural bases of visual perspective judgments, the current study supports
   the view that multiple neurocognitive routes operate during VPT.}},

Title = {{Daytime sleepiness affects prefrontal regulation of food intake}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{216-223}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{The recent epidemic of obesity corresponds closely with the decline in
   the average number of hours of sleep obtained nightly. While growing
   research suggests that sleep loss may affect hormonal and other
   physiological systems related to food intake, no studies have yet
   explored the role that sleepiness may play in reducing prefrontal
   inhibitory control over food intake. Because evidence suggests that
   women may be more prone to obesity and eating disorders, as well as more
   likely to suffer from sleep problems, we examined the relation between
   general daytime sleepiness, brain responses to food stimuli, and
   self-reported overeating separately for men and women. Thirty-eight
   healthy adults (16 women; 22 men) aged 18 to 45 underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing pictures of high- and
   low-calorie foods. Subjects completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)
   and provided a rating to the query ``how often do you eat more than you
   intend to.{''} Contrast images comparing brain activation derived from
   the high- versus low-calorie conditions were correlated voxel-wise with
   scores from the ESS in a second-level regression model, the output of
   which was used to predict self-reported overeating. As hypothesized,
   daytime sleepiness correlated with reduced activation in the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex during perception of high- versus
   low-calorie food images. Moreover, activation within this cluster
   predicted overeating, but only for women. Findings suggest that normal
   fluctuations in sleepiness may be sufficient to affect brain regions
   important for regulating food intake, but that these effects may differ
   between men and women. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with schizophrenia are impaired in processing social signals
   such as facial expressions of emotion. Perceiving facial expressions is
   a complex process that depends on a distributed neural network of
   regions involved in affective, cognitive, and visual processing. We
   examined repetition priming, a non-conscious form of perceptual
   learning, to explore the visual-perceptual processes associated with
   perceiving facial expression in people with schizophrenia. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was also employed to probe the
   sensitivity of face-responsive regions in the ventral pathway to the
   repetition of stimuli. Subjects viewed blocks of novel and repeated
   faces displaying fear expressions and neutral expressions and identified
   each face as male or female. Gender decisions were faster for repeated
   encoding relative to initial encoding of faces, indicating significant
   priming for facial expressions. Priming was normal in schizophrenia
   patients, but, as expected, recognition memory for the expressions was
   impaired. Neuroimaging findings showed that priming-related activation
   for patients was reduced in the left fusiform gyrus, relative to
   controls, regardless of facial expression. The findings suggest that
   schizophrenia patients have altered neural sensitivity in regions of the
   ventral visual processing stream that underlie early perceptual learning
   of objects and faces. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Facial cues contain important information for guiding social
   interactions, but not all humans are equally expert at face processing.
   A number of factors, both genetic and environmental, contribute to
   differences in face-processing ability. For example, both heritable
   individual differences in temperament and exposure to childhood
   maltreatment are associated with alterations in face processing ability
   and social function. Understanding the neural correlates of alterations
   in face-processing ability can provide insights into how genetic and
   environmental risk factors impair social functioning. We examined the
   association between childhood maltreatment and
   blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal as measured in
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a group of young adults
   with an inhibited temperament. We hypothesized that childhood
   maltreatment exposure would correlate positively with BOLD signal in
   regions subserving face processing and novelty detection during viewing
   of novel compared to familiar faces. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) degree of exposure to childhood maltreatment was
   positively correlated with BOLD signal in the bilateral fusiform gyri
   and the left hippocampus. These fMRI findings suggest that young adults
   with an inhibited temperament and a history of maltreatment may be
   particularly vulnerable to neural alterations. These differences could
   be related to a heightened sensitivity to potential threat-for example,
   from new people-and may contribute to both the altered social
   functioning and increased incidence of anxiety disorders in these
   individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Positively valenced stimuli facilitate creative novel metaphoric
   processes by enhancing medial prefrontal cortical activation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{A metaphor is a figure of speech in which a subject is symbolic of
   another unrelated object. In the present study, we examined neural
   patterns associated with both novel unfamiliar and conventional familiar
   metaphoric processing, and how these patterns are modulated by affective
   valence. Prior to fMRI scanning, participants received a list of word
   pairs (novel unfamiliar metaphors as well as conventional familiar
   metaphors) and were asked to denote the valence (positive, negative, or
   neutral) of each word pair. During scanning, participants had to decide
   whether the word pairs formed meaningful or meaningless expressions.
   Results indicate that participants were faster and more accurate at
   deciding that positively valenced metaphors were meaningful compared to
   neutral metaphors. These behavioral findings were accompanied by
   increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior
   cingulate cortex (PCC), and the right inferior parietal lobe (RIPL).
   Specifically, positively valenced novel unfamiliar metaphors elicited
   activation in these brain regions in addition to the left superior
   temporal gyrus when compared to neutral novel metaphors. We also found
   that the mPFC and PCC mediated the processing of positively valenced
   metaphors when compared to negatively valenced metaphors. Positively
   valenced conventional metaphors, however, elicited different neural
   signatures when contrasted with either neutral or negatively valenced
   conventional metaphors. Together, our results indicate that positively
   valenced stimuli facilitate creative metaphoric processes (specifically
   novel metaphoric processes) by mediating attention and cognitive control
   processes required for the access, integration, and selection of
   semantic associations via modulation of the m PFC. The present study is
   important for the development of neural accounts of emotion-cognition
   interactions required for creativity, language, and successful social
   functioning in general.}},

Abstract = {{Self-evaluations undergo significant transformation during early
   adolescence, developing in parallel with the heightened complexity of
   teenagers' social worlds. Intuitive theories of adolescent development,
   based in part on animal work, suggest that puberty is associated with
   neural-level changes that facilitate a ``social reorientation{''}
   (Nelson et al., 2005). However, direct tests of this hypothesis using
   neuroimaging are limited in humans. This longitudinal fMRI study
   examined neurodevelopmental trajectories associated with puberty,
   self-evaluations, and the presumed social reorientation during the
   transition from childhood to adolescence. Participants (N = 27, mean age
   = 10.1 and 13.1 years at time points one and two, respectively) engaged
   in trait evaluations of two targets (the self and a familiar fictional
   other), across two domains of competence (social and academic).
   Responses in ventromedial PFC increased with both age and pubertal
   development during self-evaluations in the social domain, but not in the
   academic domain. These results suggest that changes in social
   self-evaluations are intimately connected with biology, not just peer
   contexts, and provide important empirical support for the relationship
   between neurodevelopment, puberty, and social functioning.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Considerable progress has been recently made in understanding the brain
   mechanisms underlying speech and language control. However, the
   neurochemical underpinnings of normal speech production remain largely
   unknown. We investigated the extent of striatal endogenous dopamine
   release and its influences on the organization of functional striatal
   speech networks during production of meaningful English sentences using
   a combination of positron emission tomography (PET) with the dopamine
   D-2/D-3 receptor radioligand {[}C-11]raclopride and functional MRI
   (fMRI). In addition, we used diffusion tensor tractography (DTI) to
   examine the extent of dopaminergic modulatory influences on striatal
   structural network organization. We found that, during sentence
   production, endogenous dopamine was released in the ventromedial portion
   of the dorsal striatum, in both its associative and sensorimotor
   functional divisions. In the associative striatum, speech-induced
   dopamine release established a significant relationship with neural
   activity and influenced the left-hemispheric lateralization of striatal
   functional networks. In contrast, there were no significant effects of
   endogenous dopamine release on the lateralization of striatal structural
   networks. Our data provide the first evidence for endogenous dopamine
   release in the dorsal striatum during normal speaking and point to the
   possible mechanisms behind the modulatory influences of dopamine on the
   organization of functional brain circuits controlling normal human
   speech. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{70}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{The BOLD signal measured in fMRI studies depends not only on neuronal
   activity, but also on other parameters like tissue vascularization,
   which may vary between subjects and between brain regions. A correction
   for variance from vascularization effects can thus lead to improved
   group statistics by reducing inter-subject variability. The fractional
   amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) as determined in a
   resting-state scan has been shown to be dependent on vascularization.
   Here we present a correction method termed RESCALE (REsting-state based
   SCALing of parameter Estimates) that uses local information to compute a
   voxel-wise scaling factor based on the correlation structure of fALFF
   and task activation parameter estimates from within a cube of 3 x 3 x 3
   surrounding that voxel. The scaling method was used on a visuo-motor
   paradigm and resulted in a consistent increase in t-values in all
   task-activated cortical regions, with increases in peak t-values of
   37.0\% in the visual cortex and 12.7\% in the left motor cortex. The
   RESCALE method as proposed herein can be easily applied to all
   task-based fMRI group studies provided that resting-state data for the
   same subject group is also acquired. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Humans possess unique social abilities that set us apart from other
   species. These abilities may be partially supported by a large capacity
   for maintaining and manipulating social information. Efficient social
   working memory might arise from two different sources: chunking of
   social information or a domain-specific buffer. We test these hypotheses
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) by manipulating
   sociality and working memory load in an n-back paradigm. We observe (i)
   an effect of load in the frontoparietal control network, (ii) an effect
   of sociality in regions associated with social cognition and face
   processing, and (iii) an interaction within the frontoparietal network
   such that social load has a smaller effect than nonsocial load. These
   results support the hypothesis that working memory is more efficient for
   social information than for nonsocial information, and suggest that
   chunking, rather than a domain-specific buffer, is the mechanism of this
   greater efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Persistent pain is measured by means of self-report, the sole reliance
   on which hampers diagnosis and treatment. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) holds promise for identifying objective measures of pain,
   but brain measures that are sensitive and specific to physical pain have
   not yet been identified.
   METHODS
   In four studies involving a total of 114 participants, we developed an
   fMRI-based measure that predicts pain intensity at the level of the
   individual person. In study 1, we used machine-learning analyses to
   identify a pattern of fMRI activity across brain regions - a neurologic
   signature - that was associated with heat-induced pain. The pattern
   included the thalamus, the posterior and anterior insulae, the secondary
   somatosensory cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, the periaqueductal
   gray matter, and other regions. In study 2, we tested the sensitivity
   and specificity of the signature to pain versus warmth in a new sample.
   In study 3, we assessed specificity relative to social pain, which
   activates many of the same brain regions as physical pain. In study 4,
   we assessed the responsiveness of the measure to the analgesic agent
   remifentanil.
   RESULTS
   In study 1, the neurologic signature showed sensitivity and specificity
   of 94\% or more (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 89 to 98) in
   discriminating painful heat from nonpainful warmth, pain anticipation,
   and pain recall. In study 2, the signature discriminated between painful
   heat and nonpainful warmth with 93\% sensitivity and specificity (95\%
   CI, 84 to 100). In study 3, it discriminated between physical pain and
   social pain with 85\% sensitivity (95\% CI, 76 to 94) and 73\%
   specificity (95\% CI, 61 to 84) and with 95\% sensitivity and
   specificity in a forced-choice test of which of two conditions was more
   painful. In study 4, the strength of the signature response was
   substantially reduced when remifentanil was administered.
   CONCLUSIONS
   It is possible to use fMRI to assess pain elicited by noxious heat in
   healthy persons. Future studies are needed to assess whether the
   signature predicts clinical pain. (Funded by the National Institute on

Title = {{Why Don't Men Understand Women? Altered Neural Networks for Reading the

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Men are traditionally thought to have more problems in understanding
   women compared to understanding other men, though evidence supporting
   this assumption remains sparse. Recently, it has been shown, however,
   that mens problems in recognizing women's emotions could be linked to
   difficulties in extracting the relevant information from the eye region,
   which remain one of the richest sources of social information for the
   attribution of mental states to others. To determine possible
   differences in the neural correlates underlying emotion recognition from
   female, as compared to male eyes, a modified version of the Reading the
   Mind in the Eyes Test in combination with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) was applied to a sample of 22 participants. We found that
   men actually had twice as many problems in recognizing emotions from
   female as compared to male eyes, and that these problems were
   particularly associated with a lack of activation in limbic regions of
   the brain (including the hippocampus and the rostral anterior cingulate
   cortex). Moreover, men revealed heightened activation of the right
   amygdala to male stimuli regardless of condition (sex vs. emotion
   recognition). Thus, our findings highlight the function of the amygdala
   in the affective component of theory of mind (ToM) and in empathy, and
   provide further evidence that men are substantially less able to infer
   mental states expressed by women, which may be accompanied by
   sex-specific differences in amygdala activity.}},

Title = {{Are abstract action words embodied? An fMRI investigation at the
   interface between language and motor cognition}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{The cognitive and neural representation of abstract words is still an
   open question for theories of embodied cognition. Generally, it is
   proposed that abstract words are grounded in the activation of
   sensorimotor or at least experiential properties, exactly as concrete
   words. Further behavioral theories propose multiple representations
   evoked by abstract and concrete words. We conducted a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to investigate the neural
   correlates of concrete and abstract multi-word expressions in an action
   context. Participants were required to read simple sentences which
   combined each concrete noun with an adequate concrete verb and an
   adequate abstract verb, as well as an adequate abstract noun with either
   kind of verbs previously used. Thus, our experimental design included a
   continuum from pure concreteness to mere abstractness. As expected,
   comprehension of both concrete and abstract language content activated
   the core areas of the sensorimotor neural network namely the left
   lateral (precentral gyrus) and medial (supplementary motor area)
   premotor cortex. While the purely concrete multi-word expressions
   elicited activations within the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars
   triangularis) and two foci within the left inferior parietal cortex, the
   purely abstract multi-word expressions were represented in the anterior
   part of left middle temporal gyrus that is part of the language
   processing system. Although the sensorimotor neural network is engaged
   in both concrete and abstract language contents, the present findings
   show that concrete multi-word processing relies more on the sensorimotor
   system, and abstract multi-word processing relies more on the linguistic
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Intentional harms are typically judged to be morally worse than
   accidental harms. Distinguishing between intentional harms and accidents
   depends on the capacity for mental state reasoning (i.e., reasoning
   about beliefs and intentions), which is supported by a group of brain
   regions including the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). Prior
   research has found that interfering with activity in RTPJ can impair
   mental state reasoning for moral judgment and that high-functioning
   individuals with autism spectrum disorders make moral judgments based
   less on intent information than neurotypical participants. Three
   experiments, using multivoxel pattern analysis, find that (i) in
   neurotypical adults, the RTPJ shows reliable and distinct spatial
   patterns of responses across voxels for intentional vs. accidental
   harms, and (ii) individual differences in this neural pattern predict
   differences in participants' moral judgments. These effects are specific
   to RTPJ. By contrast, (iii) this distinction was absent in adults with
   autism spectrum disorders. We conclude that multivoxel pattern analysis
   can detect features of mental state representations (e. g., intent), and
   that the corresponding neural patterns are behaviorally and clinically
   relevant.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Humans are especially tuned to the movements of other people. Neural
   correlates of this social attunement have been proposed to lie in and
   around the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) region, which
   robustly responds to biological motion in contrast to a variety of
   non-biological motions. This response persists even when no form
   information is provided, as in point-light displays (PLDs). The aim of
   the current study was to assess the ability of functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS) to reliably measure brain responses to PLDs of
   biological motion, and determine the sensitivity of these responses to
   interpersonal contextual factors. To establish reliability, we measured
   brain activation to biological motion with fNIRS and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) during two separate sessions in an identical
   group of 12 participants. To establish sensitivity, brain responses to
   biological motion measured with fNIRS were subjected to an additional
   social manipulation where participants were either socially included or
   excluded before viewing PLDs of biological motion. Results revealed
   comparable brain responses to biological motion using fMRI and fNIRS in
   the right supramarginal gyrus. Further, social inclusion increased brain
   responses to biological motion in right supramarginal gyrus and
   posterior STS. Thus, fNIRS can reliably measure brain responses to
   biological motion and can detect social experience-dependent modulations
   of these brain responses.}},

Abstract = {{The use and misuse of digital technologies among adolescents has been
   the focus of fiery debates among parents, educators, policy-makers and
   in the media. Recently, these debates have become shaped by emerging
   data from cognitive neuroscience on the development of the adolescent
   brain and cognition. Neuroplasticity has functioned as a powerful
   metaphor in arguments both for and against the pervasiveness of digital
   media cultures that increasingly characterize teenage life. In this
   paper, we propose that the debates concerning adolescents are the
   meeting point of two major social anxieties both of which are
   characterized by the threat of abnormal (social) behaviour: existing
   moral panics about adolescent behaviour in general and the growing alarm
   about intense, addictive, and widespread media consumption in modern
   societies. Neuroscience supports these fears but the same kinds of
   evidence are used to challenge these fears and reframe them in positive
   terms. Here, we analyze discourses about digital media, the Internet,
   and the adolescent brain in the scientific and lay literature. We argue
   that while the evidential basis is thin and ambiguous, it has immense
   social influence. We conclude by suggesting how we might move beyond the
   poles of neuro-alarmism and neuro-enthusiasm. By analyzing the
   neurological adolescent in the digital age as a socially extended mind,
   firstly, in the sense that adolescent cognition is distributed across
   the brain, body, and digital media tools and secondly, by viewing
   adolescent cognition as enabled and transformed by the institution of
   neuroscience, we aim to displace the normative terms of current debates.}},

Title = {{FKBP5 and Attention Bias for Threat Associations With Hippocampal

Abstract = {{Importance: The FKBP5 gene product regulates glucocorticoid receptor
   (GR) sensitivity and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning and
   has been associated with many stress-related psychiatric disorders. The
   study of intermediate phenotypes, such as emotion-processing biases and
   their neural substrates, provides a way to clarify the mechanisms by
   which FKBP5 dysregulation mediates risk for psychiatric disorders.
   Objective: To examine whether allelic variations for a putatively
   functional single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with FKBP5 gene
   regulation (rs1360780) would relate differentially to attention bias for
   threat. this was measured through behavioral response on a dot probe
   task and hippocampal activation during task performance. Morphologic
   substrates of differential hippocampal response were also measured.
   Design: Cross-sectional study conducted from 2010 to 2012 examining
   associations between genotype, behavioral response, and neural response
   (using functional magnetic resonance imaging {[}fMRI]) on the dot probe;
   voxel-based morphometry and global and local shape analyses were used to
   measure structural differences in hippocampi between genotype groups.
   Setting: Participants were recruited from primary care clinics of a
   publicly funded hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.
   Participants: An African American cohort of adults (N = 103) was
   separated into 2 groups by genotype: one genotype group included
   carriers of the rs1360780 T allele, which has been associated with
   increased risk for posttraumatic stress disorder and affective
   disorders; the other group did not carry this allele. Behavioral data
   included both sexes (N = 103); the MRI cohort (n = 36) included only
   women.
   Main Outcome Measures: Behavioral and fMRI (blood oxygen
   level-dependent) response, voxel-based morphometry, and shape analyses.
   Results: Carriers of the rs1360780 T allele showed an attention bias
   toward threat compared with individuals without this allele (F-1,F-90=
   5.19, P = .02). Carriers of this allele demonstrated corresponding
   increases in hippocampal activation and differences in morphology;
   global and local shape analyses revealed alterations in hippocampal
   shape for TT/TC compared with CC genotype groups.
   Conclusion: Genetic variants of FKBP5 may be associated with risk for
   stress-related psychiatric disorders via differential effects on
   hippocampal structure and function, resulting in altered attention
   response to perceived threat.}},

Abstract = {{The current study uses an RT distribution analysis approach to examine
   the self-bias in face categorization. In two experiments we
   systematically manipulated the decision boundaries between the self,
   familiar, and unfamiliar others in face categorization tasks. For the
   first time in studies of self-categorization we estimated parameters
   from ex-Gaussian fits of reaction time distributions in order to capture
   the influence of different boundaries on the latency distribution of the
   categorization responses. The results showed that the distribution of
   responses to self faces was stable regardless of the face context and
   the task demands, and changes in context only shifted the response
   distribution in time. In contrast, varying the decisions with familiar
   and unfamiliar faces changed the shape of the RT distributions in
   addition to shifting RTs in time. The results indicate that, in contrast
   to our perception of familiar and unfamiliar faces of other people, self
   face perception forms a unique perceptual category unaffected by shifts
   in context and task demands.}},

Abstract = {{With the dissemination of non-invasive human neuroimaging techniques
   such as fMRI and the advancement of cognitive science, neuroimaging
   studies focusing on emotions and social cognition have become
   established. Along with this advancement, behavioral economics taking
   emotional and social factors into account for economic decisions has
   been merged with neuroscientific studies, and this interdisciplinary
   approach is called neuroeconomics. Past neuroeconomics studies have
   demonstrated that subcortical emotion-related brain structures play an
   important role in ``irrational{''} decision-making. The research field
   that investigates the role of central neurotransmitters in this process
   is worthy of further development. Here, we provide an overview of recent
   molecular neuroimaging studies to further the understanding of the
   neurochemical basis of ``irrational{''} or emotional decision-making and
   the future direction, including clinical implications, of the field. (C)

Abstract = {{In the context of chronic childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM;
   emotional abuse and/or neglect), adequately responding to facial
   expressions is an important skill. Over time, however, this adaptive
   response may lead to a persistent vigilance for emotional facial
   expressions. The amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are
   key regions in face processing. However, the neurobiological correlates
   of face processing in adults reporting CEM are yet unknown. We examined
   amydala and mPFC reactivity to emotional faces (Angry, Fearful, Sad,
   Happy, Neutral) vs scrambled faces in healthy controls and unmedicated
   patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders reporting CEM before
   the age of 16 years (n = 60), and controls and patients who report no
   childhood abuse (n = 75). We found that CEM was associated with enhanced
   bilateral amygdala reactivity to emotional faces in general, and
   independent of psychiatric status. Furthermore, we found no support for
   differential mPFC functioning, suggesting that amygdala
   hyper-responsivity to emotional facial perception in adults reporting
   CEM may be independent from top-down influences of the mPFC. These
   findings may be key in understanding the increased emotional sensitivity
   and interpersonal difficulties, that have been reported in individuals
   with a history of CEM.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown overlapping neural activations for
   observation and execution or imitation of emotional facial expressions.
   These shared representations have been assumed to provide indirect
   evidence for a human mirror neuron system, which is suggested to be a
   prerequisite of action comprehension. We aimed at clarifying whether
   shared representations in and beyond human mirror areas are specifically
   activated by affective facial expressions or whether they are activated
   by facial expressions independent of the emotional meaning. During
   neuroimaging, participants observed and executed happy and non-emotional
   facial expressions. Shared representations were revealed for happy
   facial expressions in the pars opercularis, the precentral gyrus, in the
   superior temporal gyrus/medial temporal gyrus (MTG), in the
   pre-supplementary motor area and in the right amygdala. All areas showed
   less pronounced activation in the non-emotional condition. When directly
   compared, significant stronger neural responses emerged for happy facial
   expressions in the pre-supplementary motor area and in the MTG than for
   non-emotional stimuli. We assume that activation of shared
   representations depends on the affect and (social) relevance of the
   facial expression. The pre-supplementary motor area is a core-shared
   representation-structure supporting observation and execution of
   affective contagious facial expressions and might have a modulatory role
   during the preparation of executing happy facial expressions.}},

Abstract = {{`Social brain' circuitry has recently been implicated in processing
   slow, gentle touch targeting a class of slow-conducting, unmyelinated
   nerves, CT afferents, which are present only in the hairy skin of
   mammals. Given the importance of such `affective touch' in social
   relationships, the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study aimed to replicate the finding of `social brain' involvement in
   processing CT-targeted touch and to examine the relationship between the
   neural response and individuals' social abilities. During an fMRI scan,
   19 healthy adults received alternating blocks of slow (CT-optimal) and
   fast (non-optimal) brushing to the forearm. Relative to fast touch, the
   slow touch activated contralateral insula, superior temporal sulcus
   (STS), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and
   amygdala. Connectivity analyses revealed co-activation of the mPFC,
   insula and amygdala during slow touch. Additionally, participants'
   autistic traits negatively correlated with the response to slow touch in
   the OFC and STS. The current study replicates and extends findings of
   the involvement of a network of `social brain' regions in processing
   CT-targeted affective touch, emphasizing the multimodal nature of this
   system. Variability in the brain response to such touch illustrates a
   tight coupling of social behavior and social brain function in typical
   adults.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the existence and underlying neural mechanism of a new norm

   willing to make choices-such as who is more intelligent, or who is more
   polite-between two white individuals (same-race decisions) than between
   a white and a black individual (cross-race decisions), a tendency which
   was evident more when judgments involved traits related to black
   stereotypes. We use functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the
   mechanisms underlying racial paralysis, to examine the mechanisms
   underlying racial paralysis, revealing greater recruitment of brain
   regions implicated in socially appropriate behavior (ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex), conflict detection (anterior cingulate cortex),
   deliberative processing (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and inhibition
   (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex). We also discuss the impact of racial
   paralysis on the quality of interracial relations.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{394-403}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Social dysfunction has been recognized as an elementary feature of
   schizophrenia, but it remains a crucial issue whether social deficits in
   schizophrenia concern the inter-subjective domain or primarily have
   their roots in disturbances of self-experience. Social perception
   comprises vicarious processes grounding an experiential
   inter-relationship with others as well as self-regulation processes
   allowing to maintain a coherent sense of self. The present study
   investigated whether the functional neural basis underlying these
   processes is altered in first-episode schizophrenia (FES). Twenty-four
   FES patients and 22 healthy control participants underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging during a social perception task requiring
   them to watch videos depicting other individuals' inanimate and
   animate/social tactile stimulations, and a tactile localizer condition.
   Activation in ventral premotor cortex for observed bodily tactile
   stimulations was reduced in the FES group and negatively correlated with
   self-experience disturbances. Moreover, FES patients showed aberrant
   differential activation in posterior insula for first-person tactile
   experiences and observed affective tactile stimulations. These findings
   suggest that social perception in FES at a pre-reflective level is
   characterized by disturbances of self-experience, including impaired
   multisensory representations and self-other distinction. However, the
   results also show that social perception in FES involves more complex
   alterations of neural activation at multiple processing levels.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{410-417}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The ability to self-regulate can become impaired when people are
   required to engage in successive acts of effortful self-control, even
   when self-control occurs in different domains. Here, we used functional
   neuroimaging to test whether engaging in effortful inhibition in the
   cognitive domain would lead to putative dysfunction in the emotional
   domain. Forty-eight participants viewed images of emotional scenes
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging in two sessions that were
   separated by a challenging attention control task that required
   effortful inhibition (depletion group) or not (control group). Compared
   to the control group, depleted participants showed increased activity in
   the left amygdala to negative but not to positive or neutral scenes.
   Moreover, whereas the control group showed reduced amygdala activity to
   all scene types (i.e. habituation), the depletion group showed increased
   amygdala activity relative to their pre-depletion baseline; however this
   was only significant for negative scenes. Finally, depleted participants
   showed reduced functional connectivity between the left amygdala and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex during negative scene processing. These
   findings demonstrate that consuming self-regulatory resources leads to
   an exaggerated neural response to emotional material that appears
   specific to negatively valenced stimuli and further suggests a failure
   to recruit top-down prefrontal regions involved in emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Rejections of unfair offers in the ultimatum game (UG) are commonly
   assumed to reflect negative emotional arousal mediated by the anterior
   insula and medial prefrontal cortex. We aimed to disentangle those
   neural mechanisms associated with direct personal involvement ('I have
   been treated unfairly') from those associated with fairness
   considerations, such as the wish to discourage unfair behavior or social
   norm violations ('this person has been treated unfairly'). For this
   purpose, we used fMRI and asked participants to play the UG as
   responders either for themselves (myself) or on behalf of another person
   (third party). Unfair offers were equally often rejected in both
   conditions. Neuroimaging data revealed a dissociation between the medial
   prefrontal cortex, specifically associated with rejections in the myself
   condition, thus confirming its role in self-related emotional responses,
   and the left anterior insula, associated with rejections in both myself
   and third-party conditions, suggesting a role in promoting fair behavior
   also toward third parties. Our data extend the current understanding of
   the neural substrate of social decision making, by disentangling the
   structures sensitive to direct emotional involvement of the self from
   those implicated in pure fairness considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Perception and evaluation of facial expressions are known to be heavily
   modulated by emotional features of contextual information. Such
   contextual effects, however, might also be driven by non-emotional
   aspects of contextual information, an interaction of emotional and
   non-emotional factors, and by the observers' inherent traits. Therefore,
   we sought to assess whether contextual information about self-reference
   in addition to information about valence influences the evaluation and
   neural processing of neutral faces. Furthermore, we investigated whether
   social anxiety moderates these effects. In the present functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, participants viewed neutral
   facial expressions preceded by a contextual sentence conveying either
   positive or negative evaluations about the participant or about somebody
   else. Contextual influences were reflected in rating and fMRI measures,
   with strong effects of self-reference on brain activity in the medial
   prefrontal cortex and right fusiform gyrus. Additionally, social anxiety
   strongly affected the response to faces conveying negative, self-related
   evaluations as revealed by the participants' rating patterns and brain
   activity in cortical midline structures and regions of interest in the
   left and right middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that face
   perception and processing are highly individual processes influenced by
   emotional and non-emotional aspects of contextual information and
   further modulated by individual personality traits.}},

Abstract = {{Humans observe various peoples' social suffering throughout their lives,
   but it is unknown whether the same brain mechanisms respond to people we
   are close to and strangers' social suffering. To address this question,
   we had participant's complete functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) while observing a friend and stranger experience social
   exclusion. Observing a friend's exclusion activated affective pain
   regions associated with the direct (i.e. firsthand) experience of
   exclusion {[}dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula], and
   this activation correlated with self-reported self-other overlap with
   the friend. Alternatively, observing a stranger's exclusion activated
   regions associated with thinking about the traits, mental states and
   intentions of others {[}'mentalizing'; dorsal medial prefrontal cortex
   (DMPFC), precuneus, and temporal pole]. Comparing activation from
   observing friend's vs stranger's exclusion showed increased activation
   in brain regions associated with the firsthand experience of exclusion
   (dACC and anterior insula) and with thinking about the self {[}medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC)]. Finally, functional connectivity analyses
   demonstrated that MPFC and affective pain regions activated in concert
   during empathy for friends, but not strangers. These results suggest
   empathy for friends' social suffering relies on emotion sharing and
   self-processing mechanisms, whereas empathy for strangers' social
   suffering may rely more heavily on mentalizing systems.}},

Abstract = {{Although creativity has been called the most important of all human
   resources, its neural basis is still unclear. In the current study, we
   used fMRI to measure neural activity in participants solving a
   visuospatial creativity problem that involves divergent thinking and has
   been considered a canonical right hemisphere task. As hypothesized, both
   the visual creativity task and the control task as compared to rest
   activated a variety of areas including the posterior parietal cortex
   bilaterally and motor regions, which are known to be involved in
   visuospatial rotation of objects. However, directly comparing the two
   tasks indicated that the creative task more strongly activated left
   hemisphere regions including the posterior parietal cortex, the premotor
   cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the medial PFC. These
   results demonstrate that even in a task that is specialized to the right
   hemisphere, robust parallel activity in the left hemisphere supports
   creative processing. Furthermore, the results support the notion that
   higher motor planning may be a general component of creative
   improvisation and that such goal-directed planning of novel solutions
   may be organized top-down by the left DLPFC and by working memory
   processing in the medial prefrontal cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Shakespeare made extensive use of the functional shift (FS), a
   rhetorical device involving a change in the grammatical status of words,
   e.g., using nouns as verbs. Previous work using event-related brain
   potentials showed how FS triggers a surprise effect inviting mental
   re-evaluation, seemingly independent of semantic processing. Here, we
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain
   activation in participants making judgements on the semantic
   relationship between sentences -some containing a Shakespearean FS- and
   subsequently presented words. Behavioural performance in the semantic
   decision task was high and unaffected by sentence type. However,
   neuroimaging results showed that sentences featuring FS elicited
   significant activation beyond regions classically activated by typical
   language tasks, including the left caudate nucleus, the right inferior
   frontal gyrus and the right inferior temporal gyrus. These findings show
   how Shakespeare's grammatical exploration forces the listener to take a
   more active role in integrating the meaning of what is said. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Language and action systems are functionally coupled in the brain as
   demonstrated by converging evidence using Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS), and lesion studies. In particular, this coupling has
   been demonstrated using the action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE)
   in which motor activity and language interact. The ACE task requires
   participants to listen to sentences that described actions typically
   performed with an open hand (e.g., clapping), a closed hand (e.g.,
   hammering), or without any hand action (neutral); and to press a large
   button with either an open hand position or closed hand position
   immediately upon comprehending each sentence. The ACE is defined as a
   longer reaction time (RT) in the action-sentence incompatible conditions
   than in the compatible conditions. Here we investigated direct
   motor-language coupling in two novel and uniquely informative ways.
   First, we measured the behavioural ACE in patients with motor impairment
   (early Parkinson's disease - EPD), and second, in epileptic patients
   with direct electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings. In experiment 1, EPD
   participants with preserved general cognitive repertoire, showed a much
   diminished ACE relative to non-EPD volunteers. Moreover, a correlation
   between ACE performance and action-verb processing (kissing and dancing
   test - KDT) was observed. Direct cortical recordings (ECoG) in motor and
   language areas (experiment 2) demonstrated simultaneous bidirectional
   effects: motor preparation affected language processing (N400 at left
   inferior frontal gyrus and middle/superior temporal gyrus), and language
   processing affected activity in movement-related areas (motor potential
   at premotor and M1). Our findings show that the ACE paradigm requires
   ongoing integration of preserved motor and language coupling (abolished
   in EPD) and engages motor-temporal cortices in a bidirectional way. In
   addition, both experiments suggest the presence of a motor-language
   network which is not restricted to somatotopically defined brain areas.
   These results open new pathways in the fields of motor diseases,
   theoretical approaches to language understanding, and models of
   action-perception coupling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has long been associated with an
   inability to experience wholes without full attention to the constituent
   parts. A zoom-out attentional dysfunction might be partially responsible
   for this perceptual integration deficit in ASD. In the present study,
   the efficiency of attentional focusing mechanisms was investigated in
   children affected by ASD. We measured response latencies to a visual
   target onset displayed at three eccentricities from the fixation.
   Attentional resources were focused (zoom-in) or distributed (zoom-out)
   in the visual field presenting a small (containing only the nearest
   target eccentricity) or large (containing also the farthest target
   eccentricity) cue, 100 or 800 msec, before the target onset. Typically
   developing children, at the short cue-target interval, showed a gradient
   effect (i.e., latencies are slower at the farthest eccentricity) in the
   small focusing cue, but not in the large focusing cue condition. These
   results indicate an efficient zoom-in and zoom-out attentional
   mechanism. In contrast, children with ASD showed a gradient effect also
   in the large focusing cue condition, suggesting a specific zoom-out
   attentional impairment. In addition, the ASD group showed an atypical
   gradient effect at the long cue-target interval only in the small cue
   condition, suggesting a prolonged zoom-in and sluggish zoom-out
   attentional mechanism. This abnormal attentional focusing - probably
   linked to a dysfunctional top-down feedback from fronto-parietal network
   to the early visual areas - could contribute to the atypical visual
   perception associated to individuals with ASD which, in turn, could have
   consequences in their social-communicative development. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Background
   Childhood adversity is associated with significantly increased risk of
   psychiatric disorder. To date, functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) studies of children have mainly focused on institutionalisation
   and investigated conscious processing of affect.
   Aims
   To investigate neural response to pre-attentively presented affect cues
   in a community sample of children with documented experiences of
   maltreatment in the home.
   Method
   A masked dot-probe paradigm involving pre-attentive presentation of
   angry, happy and neutral facial expressions was employed. Eighteen
   maltreated children were compared with 23 carefully matched
   non-maltreated peers.
   Results
   Increased neural response was observed in the right amygdala for
   pre-attentively presented angry and happy faces in maltreated v.
   non-maltreated children. Level of amygdala activation was negatively
   associated with age at onset for several abuse subtypes.
   Conclusions
   Maltreatment is associated with heightened neural response to positive
   and negative facial affect, even to stimuli outside awareness. This may
   represent a latent neural risk factor for future psychiatric disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) is characterized by
   excessive fear of public scrutiny and reticence in social engagement.
   Previous studies have probed the neural basis of GSAD often using
   static, noninteractive stimuli (e.g., face photographs) and have
   identified dysfunction in fear circuitry. We sought to investigate
   brain-based dysfunction in GSAD during more real-world, dynamic social
   interactions, focusing on the role of reward-related regions that are
   implicated in social decision-making. Methods Thirty-six healthy
   individuals (healthy control {[}HC]) and 36 individuals with GSAD
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning while
   participating in a behavioral economic game (Trust Game) involving
   iterative exchanges with fictive partners who acquire differential
   reputations for reciprocity. We investigated brain responses to
   reciprocation of trust in one's social partner, and how these brain
   responses are modulated by partner reputation for repayment. Results In
   both HC and GSAD, receipt of reciprocity robustly engaged ventral
   striatum, a region implicated in reward. In HC, striatal responses to
   reciprocity were specific to partners who have consistently returned the
   investment (cooperative partners), and were absent for partners who lack
   a cooperative reputation. In GSAD, modulation of striatal responses by
   partner reputation was absent. Social anxiety severity predicted
   diminished responses to cooperative partners. Conclusion These results
   suggest abnormalities in GSAD in reward-related striatal mechanisms that

Abstract = {{Background: The ability to self-report on affective experience is
   essential to both our everyday communication about emotion and our
   scientific understanding of it. However, the underlying cognitive and
   neural mechanisms for how people construct statements even as simple as
   ``I feel bad!{''} remain unclear. We examined whether the neural
   architecture underlying the ability to make statements about affective
   experience is composed of distinct functional systems.
   Methods: In a novel functional magnetic neuroimaging paradigm, 20
   participants were shown images varying in affective intensity; they were
   required either to attend to and judge the affective response versus to
   nonaffective aspects of the stimulus and either to categorize their
   response into a verbal label or report on a scale that did not require
   verbal labeling.
   Results: We found that the ability to report on affective states
   involves (at least) three separable systems, one for directing attention
   to the affective response and making attributions about it that involves
   the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, one for categorizing the response
   into a verbal label or word that involves the ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex, and one sensitive to the intensity of the affective response
   including the ventral anterior insula and amygdala.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that unified statements about
   affective experience rely on integrating information from several
   distinct neural systems. Results are discussed in the context of how
   disruptions to one or another of these systems may produce unique
   deficits in the ability to describe affective states and the
   implications this may hold for clinical populations.}},

Abstract = {{Higher visual areas in the occipitotemporal cortex contain discrete
   regions for face processing, but it remains unclear if V1 is modulated
   by top-down influences during face discrimination, and if this is
   widespread throughout V1 or localized to retinotopic regions processing
   task-relevant facial features. Employing functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), we mapped the cortical representation of two feature
   locations that modulate higher visual areas during categorical
   judgements the eyes and mouth. Subjects were presented with happy and
   fearful faces, and we measured the fMRI signal of V1 regions processing
   the eyes and mouth whilst subjects engaged in gender and expression
   categorization tasks. In a univariate analysis, we used a
   region-of-interest-based general linear model approach to reveal changes
   in activation within these regions as a function of task. We then
   trained a linear pattern classifier to classify facial expression or
   gender on the basis of V1 data from eye' and mouth' regions, and from
   the remaining non-diagnostic V1 region. Using multivariate techniques,
   we show that V1 activity discriminates face categories both in local
   diagnostic' and widespread non-diagnostic' cortical subregions. This
   indicates that V1 might receive the processed outcome of complex facial
   feature analysis from other cortical (i.e. fusiform face area, occipital
   face area) or subcortical areas (amygdala).}},

Abstract = {{Accurate recognition of gender in another individual is integral to
   successful human social interaction and to mate selection. When we
   encounter another person, we are effortlessly able to identify their
   gender, most often through the information conveyed by their facial
   features. Faces comprise the most abundantly encountered cue used to
   classify human gender. Considering the importance of facial information
   in gender perception, relatively little is known about the mechanisms
   involved in perceiving gender through human facial cues. We used an
   event-related fMRI repetition suppression paradigm to explore the neural
   circuitry underlying gender perception from facial information.
   Participants viewed brief consecutive images consisting of either
   gender-same face pairings (two male faces or two female faces) or images
   of gender-different face pairings (a male face preceded or followed by a
   female face), while attending to facial attractiveness in both
   conditions. Using a region-of-interest approach, we found repetition
   suppression on gender-same trials within the left ventral temporal
   fusiform gyrus and in the right collateral sulcus. Whole-brain
   voxel-wise analyses revealed selectivity for face gender again in the
   right collateral sulcus, in addition to the left cuneus and the right
   lateral occipital gyrus. Our results indicate that in addition to the
   face-selective FFA, cortical areas that are not traditionally considered
   to be ``face-selective{''} are involved in the perception of
   gender-based facial cues.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate whether prenatal exposure to nicotine has an
   impact on several reading skill outcomes in school age children.
   Study design Using a longitudinal sample of 5119 school age children in
   the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, this study
   investigated specific reading skill outcomes in the area of speed,
   fluency, accuracy, spelling, and comprehension in relation to prenatal
   nicotine exposure, after adjusting for potential mediators and
   confounders. Prenatal nicotine exposure was divided into 3 categories:
   high (>17 mg per day), low (<= 17 mg per day), and no exposure.
   Results We found that prenatal nicotine exposure was associated with
   increased risk of underperformance in specific reading skill outcomes
   after adjusting for potential mediators and confounders (P = .006). The
   effect of poor performance in decoding single words was most pronounced
   among children with prenatal exposure to high levels of nicotine in
   conjunction with a phonological deficit. Overall, the results showed
   that maternal smoking has moderate to large associations with delayed or
   decreased reading skills of children in the Longitudinal Study of
   Parents and Children.
   Conclusions High prenatal nicotine exposure has a negative association
   with reading performance in school age children. In addition, modeling
   showed that environmental factors significantly moderated the
   interaction between prenatal nicotine exposure and reading skill
   outcomes. (J Pediatr 2013;162:713-8).}},

Abstract = {{To choose between manifestly distinct options, it is suggested that the
   brain assigns values to goals using a common currency. Although previous
   studies have reported activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)

   whether such goal-value representations are independent of the
   associated stimulus categorization, as required by a common currency.
   Using multivoxel pattern analyses on functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data, we found a region of medial prefrontal cortex to
   contain a distributed goal-value code that is independent of stimulus
   category. More ventrally in the vmPFC, we found spatially distinct areas
   of the medial orbitofrontal cortex to contain unique category-dependent
   distributed value codes for food and consumer items. These results
   implicate the medial prefrontal cortex in the implementation of a common
   currency and suggest a ventral versus dorsal topographical organization
   of value signals in the vmPFC.}},

Abstract = {{The upsurge in alcohol use that often occurs during the first year of
   college has been convincingly linked to a number of negative
   psychosocial consequences and may negatively affect brain development.
   In this longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) pilot
   study, we examined changes in neural responses to alcohol cues across
   the first year of college in a normative sample of late adolescents.
   Participants (N = 11) were scanned three times across their first year
   of college (summer, first semester, second semester), while completing a
   go/no-go task in which images of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages
   were the response cues. A state-of-the-art effective connectivity
   mapping technique was used to capture spatiotemporal relations among
   brain regions of interest (ROIs) at the level of the group and the
   individual. Effective connections among ROIs implicated in cognitive
   control were greatest at the second assessment (when negative
   consequences of alcohol use increased), and effective connections among
   ROIs implicated in emotion processing were lower (and response times
   were slower) when participants were instructed to respond to alcohol
   cues compared to non-alcohol cues. These preliminary findings
   demonstrate the value of a prospective effective connectivity approach
   for understanding adolescent changes in alcohol-related neural
   processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT), an emerging treatment for
   anxiety disorders, is thought to modify underlying, stable patterns of
   attention. Therefore, ABMT research should take into account the impact
   of attention bias stability on attention training response, especially
   in pediatric populations. ABMT research typically relies on the
   dot-probe task, where individuals detect a probe following an
   emotional-neutral stimulus pair. The current research presents two
   dot-probe experiments relevant to ABMT and attention-bias stability. In
   Experiment 1, anxious youth receiving 8-weeks of cognitive-behavioral
   therapy (CBT) were randomly assigned to ABMT that trains attention
   towards happy faces (n = 18) or placebo (n = 18). Two additional
   comparison groups, anxious youth receiving only CBT (n = 17) and healthy
   comparison youth (n = 16), were studied. Active attention training
   towards happy faces did not augment clinician-rated response to CBT;
   however, individuals receiving training exhibited reductions on
   self-report measures of anxiety earlier than individuals receiving CBT
   only. In Experiment 2, healthy youth (n = 12) completed a dot-probe task
   twice while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Intra-class correlation demonstrated stability of neural activation in
   response to attention bias in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and
   amygdala. Together, these two studies investigate the ways in which
   attention-bias stability may impact future work on ABMT. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Despite the crucial role of touch in social development, there is very
   little functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research on brain
   mechanisms underlying social touch processing. The skin as a social
   organ hypothesis is supported by the discovery of C-tactile (CT) nerves
   that are present in hairy skin and project to the insular cortex.
   CT-fibers respond specifically well to slow, gentle touch such as that
   which occurs during close social interactions. Given the social
   significance of such touch researchers have proposed that the CT-system
   represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism important for normative
   social development. However, it is currently unknown whether brain
   regions other than the insula are involved in processing CT-targeted
   touch. In the current fMRI study, we sought to characterize the brain
   regions involved in the perception of CT-supported affective touch.
   Twenty-two healthy adults received manual brush strokes to either the
   arm or palm. A direct contrast of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
   (BOLD) response to gentle brushing of the arm and palm revealed the
   involvement of a network of brain regions, in addition to the posterior
   insula, during CT-targeted affective touch to the arm. This network
   included areas known to be involved in social perception and social
   cognition, including the right posterior superior temporal sulcus and
   the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/dorso anterior cingulate cortex
   (dACC). Connectivity analyses with an mPFC/dACC seed revealed
   coactivation with the left insula and amygdala during arm touch. These
   findings characterize a network of brain regions beyond the insula
   involved in coding CT-targeted affective touch. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013.

Abstract = {{Inducing and experiencing emotions about others' mental and physical
   circumstances is thought to involve self-relevant processing and
   personal memories of similar experiences. The hippocampus is important
   for self-referential processing during recall and prospection; however,
   its contributions during social emotions have not been systematically
   investigated. We use event-related averaging and Granger causal
   connectivity mapping to investigate hippocampal contributions during the
   processing of varieties of admiration and compassion pertaining to
   protagonists' mental versus physical circumstances {[}admiration for
   virtue (AV) versus for skill; compassion for social/psychological pain
   (CSP) versus for physical pain]. Data were collected using a multistep
   emotion-induction paradigm that included psychosocial interviews, BOLD
   fMRI, and simultaneous psychophysiological recording. Given that
   mnemonic demands were equivalent among conditions, we tested whether:
   (1) the hippocampi would be recruited more strongly and for a longer
   duration during the processing of AV and CSP; and (2) connectivity
   between the hippocampi and cortical systems involved in visceral
   somatosensation/emotional feeling, social cognitive, and self-related
   processing would be more extensive during AV and CSP. Results elucidate
   the hippocampus' facilitative role in inducing and sustaining
   appropriate emotional reactions, the importance of self-related
   processing during social emotions, and corroborate the conception that
   varieties of emotional processing pertaining to others' mental and
   physical situations engage at least partially distinct neural
   mechanisms. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic disorders of consciousness, particularly the vegetative and the
   minimally conscious states, pose serious diagnostic challenges to
   neurologists and clinical psychologists. A look at the concept of
   ``diagnosis{''} in medicine reveals its social construction: While
   medical categorizations are intended to describe facts in the real
   world, they are nevertheless dependent on conventions and agreements
   between experts and practitioners. For chronic disorders of
   consciousness in particular, the terminology has proven problematic and
   controversial over the years. Novel research utilizing functional brain
   imaging has demonstrated that a substantial number of patients retain
   their capabilities to communicate by brain activity even when they are
   incapable of classic verbal and nonverbal responses due to the
   dysfunction of their motor behavior. Moreover, thorough diagnostic
   assessments constitute the foundations for suitable rehabilitation
   measures. Thus, ethical arguments support the claim that the potential
   of emerging methods for communication via brain activity should be
   evaluated comprehensively in patients with chronic disorders of
   consciousness, once the technological methodology for this endeavor
   progresses to a reliable and affordable stage.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{721-731}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background. Distorted images of the observable self are considered
   crucial in the development and maintenance of social anxiety. We
   generated an experimental situation in which participants viewed
   themselves from an observer's perspective when exposed to scrutiny and
   evaluation by others.
   Method. Twenty patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) and 20
   control subjects were assessed using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) during the public exposure of pre-recorded videos in
   which they were each shown performing a verbal task. The examiners acted
   as the audience in the experiment and rated performance. Whole-brain
   functional maps were computed using Statistical Parametric Mapping.
   Results. Robust activation was observed in regions related to self-face
   recognition, emotional response and general arousal in both study
   groups. Patients showed significantly greater activation only in the
   primary visual cortex. By contrast, they showed significant deactivation
   or smaller activation in dorsal frontoparietal and anterior cingulate
   cortices relevant to the cognitive control of negative emotion.
   Task-related anxiety ratings revealed a pattern of negative correlation
   with activation in this frontoparietal/cingulate network. Importantly,
   the relationship between social anxiety scores and neural response
   showed an inverted-U function with positive correlations in the lower
   score range and negative correlations in the higher range.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest that exposure to scrutiny and
   evaluation in SAD may be associated with changes in cortical systems
   mediating the cognitive components of anxiety. Disorder severity seems
   to be relevant in shaping the neural response pattern, which is
   distinctively characterized by a reduced cortical response in the most
   severe cases.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. - Mirror neurons are a special class of neurons discovered
   in the 1990s. They respond when we perform an action and also when we
   see someone else perform that action. They play a role in the
   pathophysiology of some neuropsychiatric diseases.
   State of art. - Mirror neurons have been identified in humans: in
   Broca's area and the inferior parietal cortex. Their responses are
   qualitative and selective depending on the observed action. Emotions
   (including disgust) and empathy seem to operate according to a mirror
   mechanism. Indeed, the mirror system allows us to encode the sensory
   experience and to simulate the emotional state of others. This results
   in our improved identification of the emotions in others. Additionally,
   mirror neurons can encode an observed action in motor stimuli and allow
   its reproduction; thus, they are involved in imitation and learning.
   Perspectives. - Current studies are assessing the role of mirror neurons
   in the pathopysiology of social-behavior disorders, including autism and
   schizophrenia. Understanding this mirror system will allow us to develop
   psychotherapy practices based on empathic resonance between the patient
   and the therapist. Also, some authors report that a passive
   rehabilitation technique, based on stimulation of the mirror-neuron
   system, has a beneficial effect in the treatment of patients with
   post-stroke motor deficits.
   Conclusions. - Mirror neurons are an anatomical entity that enables
   improved understanding of behavior and emotions, and serves as a base
   for developing new cognitive therapies. Additional studies are needed to
   clarify the exact role of this neuronal system in social cognition and
   its role in the development of some neuropsychiatric diseases. (C) 2013

   this work has been conducted in the context of semantic and low-level
   visual processing. An open question is whether ambiguity in social
   signals (e. g., emotional facial expressions) is processed similarly or
   whether a unique set of processors come on-line to resolve ambiguity in
   a social context. Our work has examined ambiguity using surprised facial
   expressions, as they have predicted both positive and negative outcomes
   in the past. Specifically, whereas some people tended to interpret
   surprise as negatively valenced, others tended toward a more positive
   interpretation. Here, we examined neural responses to social ambiguity
   using faces (surprise) and nonface emotional scenes (International
   Affective Picture System). Moreover, we examined whether these effects
   are specific to ambiguity resolution (i.e., judgments about the
   ambiguity) or whether similar effects would be demonstrated for
   incidental judgments (e. g., nonvalence judgments about ambiguously
   valenced stimuli). We found that a distinct task control (i.e.,
   cingulo-opercular) network was more active when resolving ambiguity. We
   also found that activity in the ventral amygdala was greater to faces
   and scenes that were rated explicitly along the dimension of valence,
   consistent with findings that the ventral amygdala tracks valence. Taken
   together, there is a complex neural architecture that supports decision
   making in the presence of ambiguity: (a) a core set of cortical
   structures engaged for explicit ambiguity processing across stimulus
   boundaries and (b) other dedicated circuits for biologically relevant
   learning situations involving faces.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most robust ways that people protect themselves from
   social-evaluative threat is by emphasizing the desirability of their
   personal characteristics, yet the neural underpinnings of this
   fundamental process are unknown. The current fMRI study addresses this
   question by examining self-evaluations of desirability (in comparison
   with other people) as a response to threat. Participants judged how much
   personality traits described themselves in comparison with their average
   peer. These judgments were preceded by threatening or nonthreatening
   social-evaluative feedback. Self-evaluations made in response to threat
   significantly increased activation in a number of regions including the
   OFC, medial pFC, lateral pFC, amygdala, and insula. Individual
   differences in the extent to which threat increased desirability were
   significantly correlated with medial OFC activity. This is the first
   study to examine the neural associations of a fundamental
   self-protection strategy: responding to threat by emphasizing the self `
   s desirability. Although neural research has separately examined
   self-evaluation processes from the regulation of social-evaluative
   threat, little is known about the interplay between the two. The
   findings build on this previous research by showing that regions, often
   associated with self-evaluation, are modulated by the degree to which
   people respond to threat by emphasizing their own desirability.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{11-20}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{Faces are complex social stimuli, which can be processed both at the
   categorical and the individual level. Behavioral studies have shown that
   children take more than a decade of exposure and training to become
   proficient at processing faces at the individual level. The
   neurodevelopmental trajectories for different aspects of face-processing
   are still poorly understood. In this study, we used an fMR-adaptation
   design to investigate differential processing of three face aspects
   (identity, expression and gaze) in children, adolescents and adults. We
   found that, while all three tasks showed some overlap in activation
   patterns, there was a significant age effect in the occipital and
   temporal lobes and the inferior frontal gyrus. More importantly, the
   degree of adaptation differed across the three age groups in the
   inferior occipital gyrus, a core face processing area that has been
   shown in previous studies to be both integral and necessary for
   individual-level face processing. In the younger children, adaptation in
   this region seemed to suggest the use of a predominantly featural
   processing strategy, whereas adaptation effects in the adults exhibited
   a more strategic pattern that depended on the task. Interestingly, our
   sample of adolescents did not exhibit any differential adaptation
   effects: possibly reflecting increased heterogeneity in processing
   strategies in this age group. Our results support the notion that, in
   line with improving behavioral face-processing abilities, core
   face-responsive regions develop throughout the first two decades of
   life. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to infer other people's mental
   states like intentions or desires. ToM can be differentiated into
   affective (i.e., recognizing the feelings of another person) and
   cognitive (i.e., inferring the mental state of the counterpart)
   subcomponents. Recently, subcortical structures such as the basal
   ganglia (BG) have also been ascribed to the multifaceted concept ToM and
   most BG disorders have been reported to elicit ToM deficits. In order to
   assess both the correlates of affective and cognitive ToM as well as
   involvement of the basal ganglia, 30 healthy participants underwent
   event-related fMRI scanning, neuropsychological testing, and filled in
   questionnaires concerning different aspects of ToM and empathy. Directly
   contrasting affective (aff) as well as cognitive (cog) ToM to the
   control (phy) condition, activation was found in classical ToM regions,
   namely parts of the temporal lobe including the superior temporal
   sulcus, the supplementary motor area, and parietal structures in the
   right hemisphere. The contrast aff > phy yielded additional activation
   in the orbitofrontal cortex on the right and the cingulate cortex, the
   precentral and inferior frontal gyrus and the cerebellum on the left.
   The right BG were recruited in this contrast as well. The direct
   contrast aff > cog showed activation in the temporoparietal junction and
   the cingulate cortex on the right as well as in the left supplementary
   motor area. The reverse contrast cog > aff however did not yield any
   significant clusters. In summary, affective and cognitive ToM partly
   share neural correlates but can also be differentiated anatomically.
   Furthermore, the BG are involved in affective ToM and thus their
   contribution is discussed as possibly providing a motor component of
   simulation processes, particularly in affective ToM.}},

Abstract = {{Reading requires the interaction of a distributed set of cortical areas
   whose distinct patterns give rise to a wide range of individual skill.
   However, the nature of these neural interactions and their relation to
   reading performance are still poorly understood Functional connectivity
   analyses of fMRI data can be used to characterize the nature of
   interactivity of distributed brain networks, yet most previous studies
   have focused on connectivity during task-free (i.e., ``resting
   state{''}) conditions. Here, we report new methods for assessing task
   related functional connectivity using data-driven graph theoretical
   methods and describe how large-scale patterns of connectivity relate to
   individual variability in reading Performance among children. We found
   that connectivity Patterns of subjects Performing a reading task could
   be decomposed hierarchically into multiple sub-networks, and we observed
   stronger long-range interaction between sub-networks in subjects with
   higher task accuracy. Additionally, we found a network of hub regions
   known to be critical to reading that displays increased short-range
   synchronization in higher accuracy subjects. These individual
   differences in task-related functional connectivity reveal that
   increased interaction between distant regions, coupled with selective
   local integration within key regions, is associated with better reading
   performance. Importantly, we show that task-related neuroimaging data
   contains far more information than usually extracted via standard
   univariate analyses - information that can meaningfully relate neural
   connectivity patterns to cognition and task.}},

   Lying or Telling the Truth}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{The capacity to deceive others is a complex mental skill that requires
   the ability to suppress truthful information. The polygraph is widely
   used in countries such as the USA to detect deception. However, little
   is known about the effects of emotional processes (such as the fear of
   being found guilty despite being innocent) on the physiological
   responses that are used to detect lies. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the time course and neural correlates of untruthful behavior
   by analyzing electrocortical indexes in response to visually presented
   neutral and affective questions. Affective questions included sexual,
   shameful or disgusting topics. A total of 296 questions that were
   inherently true or false were presented to 25 subjects while ERPs were
   recorded from 128 scalp sites. Subjects were asked to lie on half of the
   questions and to answer truthfully on the remaining half. Behavioral and
   ERP responses indicated an increased need for executive control
   functions, namely working memory, inhibition and task switching
   processes, during deceptive responses. Deceptive responses also elicited
   a more negative N400 over the prefrontal areas and a smaller late
   positivity (LP 550-750 ms) over the prefrontal and frontal areas.
   However, a reduction in LP amplitude was also elicited by truthful
   affective responses. The failure to observe a difference in LP responses
   across conditions likely results from emotional interference. A swLORETA
   inverse solution was computed on the N400 amplitude (300-400 ms) for the
   dishonest - honest contrast. These results showed the activation of the
   superior, medial, middle and inferior frontal gyri (BA9, 11, 47) and the
   anterior cingulate cortex during deceptive responses. Our results
   conclude that the N400 amplitude is a reliable neural marker of
   deception.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{280}},
Number = {{1755}},

Abstract = {{In many animal species, social communication and mate choice are
   influenced by cues encoded by the major histocompatibility complex
   (MHC). The mechanism by which the MHC influences sexual selection is a
   matter of intense debate. In mice, peptide ligands of MHC molecules
   activate subsets of vomeronasal and olfactory sensory neurons and
   influence social memory formation; in sticklebacks, such peptides
   predictably modify the outcome of mate choice. Here, we examine whether
   this evolutionarily conserved mechanism of interindividual communication
   extends to humans. In psychometric tests, volunteers recognized the
   supplementation of their body odour by MHC peptides and preferred `self'
   to `non-self' ligands when asked to decide whether the modified odour
   smelled `like themselves' or `like their favourite perfume'. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging indicated that `self'-peptides specifically
   activated a region in the right middle frontal cortex. Our results
   suggest that despite the absence of a vomeronasal organ, humans have the
   ability to detect and evaluate MHC peptides in body odour. This may
   provide a basis for the sensory evaluation of potential partners during
   human mate choice.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{1501}},

Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{To study if the neural system responds the same or differently to the
   same rewards in different social competition conditions, event-related
   brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded as 18 participants engaged in two
   kinds of decision tasks. In the auction condition (the competition
   condition), participants were instructed to bid against their
   competitors and then informed the outcome (failing and gaining no money,
   or winning and gaining a certain amount of money); in the lottery
   condition (the neutral condition), subjects were asked to play a lottery
   against the computer and then informed the outcome (the same as in
   auction). Scalp ERPs revealed that, in the outcome phase, failing
   (rewards=0) in auction induced a larger late positive complex response
   (in the time window of 700-1200 ms) than that in lottery; while winning
   (rewards >0) in lottery induced a larger late positive complex response
   (in the time window of 500-800 ms) than that in auction. The present
   data suggest, when evaluating rewards, our neural systems care about not
   only rewards themselves, but also how the rewards have been obtained.

Title = {{High-Frequency TRNS Reduces BOLD Activity during Visuomotor Learning}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial random
   noise stimulation (tRNS) consist in the application of electrical
   current of small intensity through the scalp, able to modulate
   perceptual and motor learning, probably by changing brain excitability.
   We investigated the effects of these transcranial electrical stimulation
   techniques in the early and later stages of visuomotor learning, as well
   as associated brain activity changes using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). We applied anodal and cathodal tDCS, low-frequency and
   high-frequency tRNS (lf-tRNS, 0.1-100 Hz; hf-tRNS 101-640 Hz,
   respectively) and sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1)
   during the first 10 minutes of a visuomotor learning paradigm and
   measured performance changes for 20 minutes after stimulation ceased.
   Functional imaging scans were acquired throughout the whole experiment.
   Cathodal tDCS and hf-tRNS showed a tendency to improve and lf-tRNS to
   hinder early learning during stimulation, an effect that remained for 20
   minutes after cessation of stimulation in the late learning phase. Motor
   learning-related activity decreased in several regions as reported
   previously, however, there was no significant modulation of brain
   activity by tDCS. In opposition to this, hf-tRNS was associated with
   reduced motor task-related-activity bilaterally in the frontal cortex
   and precuneous, probably due to interaction with ongoing neuronal
   oscillations. This result highlights the potential of lf-tRNS and
   hf-tRNS to differentially modulate visuomotor learning and advances our
   knowledge on neuroplasticity induction approaches combined with
   functional imaging methods.}},

Title = {{Immediate processing of erotic stimuli in paedophilia and controls: a
   case control study}},
Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most neuroimaging studies investigating sexual arousal in
   paedophilia used erotic pictures together with a blocked fMRI design and
   long stimulus presentation time. While this approach allows the
   detection of sexual arousal, it does not enable the assessment of the
   immediate processing of erotically salient stimuli. Our study aimed to
   identify neuronal networks related to the immediate processing of erotic
   stimuli in heterosexual male paedophiles and healthy age-matched
   controls.
   Methods: We presented erotic pictures of prepubescent children and
   adults in an event related fMRI-design to eight paedophilic subjects and
   age-matched controls.
   Results: Erotic pictures of females elicited more activation in the
   right temporal lobe, the right parietal lobe and both occipital lobes
   and erotic pictures of children activated the right dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex in both groups. An interaction of sex, age and group
   was present in the right anteriolateral oribitofrontal cortex.
   Conclusions: Our event related study design confirmed that erotic
   pictures activate some of the brain regions already known to be involved
   in the processing of erotic pictures when these are presented in blocks.
   In addition, it revealed that erotic pictures of prepubescent children
   activate brain regions critical for choosing response strategies in both
   groups, and that erotically salient stimuli selectively activate a brain
   region in paedophilic subjects that had previously been attributed to
   reward and punishment, and that had been shown to be implicated in the
   suppression of erotic response and deception.}},

Title = {{Susceptibility to emotional contagion for negative emotions improves
   detection of smile authenticity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{A smile is a context-dependent emotional expression. A smiling face can
   signal the experience of enjoyable emotions, but people can also smile
   to convince another person that enjoyment is occurring when it is not.
   For this reason, the ability to discriminate between felt and faked
   enjoyment expressions is a crucial social skill. Despite its importance,
   adults show remarkable individual variation in this ability. Revealing
   the factors responsible for these huge individual differences is a key
   challenge in this domain. Here we investigated, on a large sample of
   participants, whether individual differences in smile authenticity
   recognition are accounted for by differences in the predisposition to
   experience other people's emotions, i.e., by susceptibility to emotional
   contagion. Results showed that susceptibility to emotional contagion for
   negative emotions increased smile authenticity detection, while
   susceptibility to emotional contagion for positive emotions worsened
   detection performance, because it leaded to categorize most of the faked
   smiles as sincere. These findings suggest that susceptibility to
   emotional contagion plays a key role in complex emotion recognition, and
   point out the importance of analyzing the tendency to experience other
   people's positive and negative emotions as separate abilities.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Seed-based cross-correlation analysis (sCCA) and independent component
   analysis have been widely employed to extract functional networks from
   the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. However,
   the results of sCCA, in terms of both connectivity strength and network
   topology, can be sensitive to seed selection variations. ICA avoids the
   potential problems due to seed selection, but choosing which
   component(s) to represent the network of interest could be subjective
   and problematic. In this study, we proposed a seed-based iterative
   cross-correlation analysis (siCCA) method for resting state brain
   network analysis. The method was applied to extract default mode network
   (DMN) and stable task control network (STCN) in two independent datasets
   acquired from normal adults. Compared with the networks obtained by
   traditional sCCA and ICA, the resting state networks produced by siCCA
   were found to be highly stable and independent on seed selection. siCCA
   was used to analyze DMN in first-episode major depressive disorder (MDD)
   patients. It was found that, in the MDD patients, the volume of DMN
   negatively correlated with the patients' social disability screening
   schedule scores.}},

Title = {{Playing nice: a multi-methodological study on the effects of social
   conformity on memory}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Conformity is an important aspect of social behavior. Two main motives
   have been identified: people may adapt their behavior to ``play nice{''}
   despite knowing better (normative conformity) or they may accept the
   others' opinion as a valid source of information (informative
   conformity). Neuroimaging studies can help to distinguish between these
   two possibilities. Here, we present a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study on memory conformity in a real group situation. We
   investigated the effects of group pressure on activity in hippocampus
   and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) which likely support in formative
   and normative memory conformity, respectively. Furthermore, we related
   the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4680 {[}called
   Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met] on the gene coding for
   COMT to both behavior and fMRI activation. Homozygous Met-allele
   carriers (Val-) behaved more conformist than carriers of at least one
   Val-allele (Val+). In the neuroimaging data, we compared trials in which
   subjects were confronted with a majority of incorrect group responses to
   trials in which they were confronted with a majority of correct group
   responses. We found increased hippocampal activity when the majority of
   the group was correct, possibly indicating retrieval processes.
   Moreover, we observed enhanced activity in the ACC when the majority of
   the group was incorrect, suggesting that conformity was mostly
   normative. Most interestingly, this latter effect was more pronounced
   for Val- as compared to Val+ participants. This offers a speculative
   explanation for the higher behavioral levels of social conformity in
   Val-allele carriers, because their subjectively perceived conflict in
   the presence of an incorrect group majority may have been higher.
   Overall, this study demonstrate show the mechanisms leading to complex
   social behavior such as conformity can be studied by combining genetic
   analyses and fMRI in social neuroscience paradigms.}},

Title = {{Observation of sonified movements engages a basal ganglia frontocortical
   network}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Producing sounds by a musical instrument can lead to
   audiomotor coupling, i.e. the joint activation of the auditory and motor
   system, even when only one modality is probed. The sonification of
   otherwise mute movements by sounds based on kinematic parameters of the
   movement has been shown to improve motor performance and perception of
   movements.
   Results: Here we demonstrate in a group of healthy young non-athletes
   that congruently (sounds match visual movement kinematics) vs.
   incongruently (no match) sonified breaststroke movements of a human
   avatar lead to better perceptual judgement of small differences in
   movement velocity. Moreover, functional magnetic resonance imaging
   revealed enhanced activity in superior and medial posterior temporal
   regions including the superior temporal sulcus, known as an important
   multisensory integration site, as well as the insula bilaterally and the
   precentral gyrus on the right side. Functional connectivity analysis
   revealed pronounced connectivity of the STS with the basal ganglia and
   thalamus as well as frontal motor regions for the congruent stimuli.
   This was not seen to the same extent for the incongruent stimuli.
   Conclusions: We conclude that sonification of movements amplifies the
   activity of the human action observation system including subcortical
   structures of the motor loop. Sonification may thus be an important
   method to enhance training and therapy effects in sports science and
   neurological rehabilitation.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of adaptive social responses to real-life frustrating
   situations: a functional MRI study}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frustrating situations are encountered daily, and it is
   necessary to respond in an adaptive fashion. A psychological definition
   states that adaptive social behaviors are ``self-performing{''} and
   ``contain a solution.{''} The present study investigated the neural
   correlates of adaptive social responses to frustrating situations by
   assessing the dimension of causal attribution. Based on attribution
   theory, internal causality refers to one's aptitudes that cause natural
   responses in real-life situations, whereas external causality refers to
   environmental factors, such as experimental conditions, causing such
   responses. To investigate the issue, we developed a novel approach that
   assesses causal attribution under experimental conditions. During fMRI
   scanning, subjects were required to engage in virtual frustrating
   situations and play the role of protagonists by verbalizing social
   responses, which were socially adaptive or non-adaptive. After fMRI
   scanning, the subjects reported their causal attribution index of the
   psychological reaction to the experimental condition. We performed a
   correlation analysis between the causal attribution index and brain
   activity. We hypothesized that the brain region whose activation would
   have a positive and negative correlation with the self-reported index of
   the causal attributions would be regarded as neural correlates of
   internal and external causal attribution of social responses,
   respectively.
   Results: We found a significant negative correlation between external
   causal attribution and neural responses in the right anterior temporal
   lobe for adaptive social behaviors.
   Conclusion: This region is involved in the integration of emotional and
   social information. These results suggest that, particularly in adaptive
   social behavior, the social demands of frustrating situations, which
   involve external causality, may be integrated by a neural response in
   the right anterior temporal lobe.}},

Abstract = {{People often conform to the behavior of others with whom they identify.
   However, it is unclear what fundamental mechanisms underlie this type of
   conformity. Here, we investigate the processes mediating in-group
   conformity by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Participants completed a perceptual decision-making task while
   undergoing fMRI, during which they were exposed to the judgments of both
   in-group and out-group members. Our data suggest that conformity to the
   in-group is mediated by both positive affect as well as the cognitive
   capacity of perspective taking. Examining the processes that drive
   in-group conformity by utilizing a basic decision-making paradigm
   combined with neuroimaging methods provides important insights into the
   potential mechanisms of conformity. These results may provide an
   integral step in developing more effective campaigns using group
   conformity as a tool for behavioral change.}},

   the right amygdala}},
Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{1499}},
Pages = {{29-42}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{The neuropeptide vasopressin has been shown to modulate social and
   affective processes. Using fMRI we investigated the influence of
   intranasal vasopressin (AVP) on neural activations related to social
   cognitions and emotion processing in a group of healthy young men. In a
   double-blind, placebo controlled between groups design, 20 IU AVP were
   administered intranasally to half of the participants before scanning,
   while the other half received saline intranasally. All participants
   viewed line drawings depicting either one or two persons (social factor)
   in an emotionally neutral or negative scene (emotional factor).
   Vasopressin modulated the activation of the right amygdala related to
   the emotional component of empathy. Moreover, vasopressin also increased
   connectivity of the right amygdala with the medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) and the inferior parietal lobule during the processing of
   pictures illustrating a socially threatening scene. This suggests that
   AVP reduces suppressive effects of the mPFC on amygdala activity
   resulting in the observed enhanced neural pattern in the amygdala. At
   present, it remains unclear whether the increased amygdala activity
   reflects a direct impact of AVP on vasopressin V1 receptors in the
   amygdala or an indirect effect via vasopressin V1 receptors in the mPFC
   or other remote brain sites. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   State: A Resting-State fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{MAR 6}},
Abstract = {{Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is a severely debilitating illness,
   which is characterized by episodes of mania and depression separated by
   periods of remission. Previous fMRI studies investigating PBD were
   mainly task-related. However, little is known about the abnormalities in
   PBD, especially during resting state. Resting state brain activity
   measured by fMRI might help to explore neurobiological biomarkers of the
   disorder. Methods: Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was examined with
   resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) on 15 patients with PBD in manic state,
   with 15 age-and sex-matched healthy youth subjects as controls. Results:
   Compared with the healthy controls, the patients with PBD showed altered
   ReHo in the cortical and subcortical structures. The ReHo measurement of
   the PBD group was negatively correlated with the score of Young Mania
   Rating Scale (YMRS) in the superior frontal gyrus. Positive correlations
   between the ReHo measurement and the score of YMRS were found in the
   hippocampus and the anterior cingulate cortex in the PBD group.
   Conclusions: Altered regional brain activity is present in patients with
   PBD during manic state. This study presents new evidence for abnormal
   ventral-affective and dorsal-cognitive circuits in PBD during resting
   state and may add fresh insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms
   underlying PBD.}},

Abstract = {{Low frequency oscillations are essential in cognitive function
   impairment in schizophrenia. While functional connectivity can reveal
   the synchronization between distant brain regions, the regional
   abnormalities in task-independent baseline brain activity are less
   clear, especially in specific frequency bands. Here, we used a regional
   homogeneity (ReHo) method combined with resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to investigate low frequency spontaneous
   neural activity in the three different frequency bands (slow-5:
   0.01-0.027 Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.08 Hz; and typical band: 0.01-0.08 Hz) in
   69 patients with schizophrenia and 62 healthy controls. Compared with
   controls, schizophrenia patients exhibited decreased ReHo in the
   precentral gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and posterior insula, whereas
   increased ReHo in the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula.
   Significant differences in ReHo between the two bands were found in
   fusiform gyrus and superior frontal gyrus (slow-4> slow-5), and in basal
   ganglia, parahippocampus, and dorsal middle prefrontal gyrus (slow-5>
   slow-4). Importantly, we identified significant interaction between
   frequency bands and groups in the inferior occipital gyrus and caudate
   body. This study demonstrates that ReHo changes in schizophrenia are
   widespread and frequency dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Learning does not only depend on rationality, because real-life learning
   cannot be isolated from emotion or social factors. Therefore, it is
   intriguing to determine how emotion changes learning, and to identify
   which neural substrates underlie this interaction. Here, we show that
   the task-independent presentation of an emotional face before a
   reward-predicting cue increases the speed of cue-reward association
   learning in human subjects compared with trials in which a neutral face
   is presented. This phenomenon was attributable to an increase in the
   learning rate, which regulates reward prediction errors. Parallel to
   these behavioral findings, functional magnetic resonance imaging
   demonstrated that presentation of an emotional face enhanced reward
   prediction error (RPE) signal in the ventral striatum. In addition, we
   also found a functional link between this enhanced RPE signal and
   increased activity in the amygdala following presentation of an
   emotional face. Thus, this study revealed an acceleration of cue-reward
   association learning by emotion, and underscored a role of
   striatum-amygdala interactions in the modulation of the reward
   prediction errors by emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Olfactometers have been gaining popularity as research tools, but they
   have yet to replace established testing procedures in a variety of
   laboratory and clinical settings, including absolute threshold tests. In
   this research, we designed and operated a simple olfactometer with which
   to assess threshold. To do this, we used a method-of-adjustment test
   that was compared to the three-alternative forced choice ascending sniff
   bottle staircase method, which is currently a standard threshold test
   procedure. We found that the olfactometer threshold test correlated
   highly with the staircase method, and that it possessed suitable
   test-retest reliability. The advantages of the olfactometer threshold
   test include faster test time and reduced cleaning and reassembly
   demands. Future use of the olfactometer in olfactory identification
   and/or detection thresholds amongst odors is also outlined.}},

Abstract = {{We present a neurobiological model of empathic dysfunction in borderline
   personality disorder (BPD) to guide future empirical research. Empathy
   is a necessary component of interpersonal functioning, involving two
   distinct, parallel neural networks. One form of empathic processing
   relies on shared representations (SR) of others' mental states, while
   the other is associated with explicit mental state attribution (MSA). SR
   processing is visceral and automatic, contributing to attunement, but
   also emotional contagion. MSA processing contributes to deliberate,
   perspectival forms of empathic understanding. Empathic dysfunction in
   BPD may involve hyper-reactivity of SR networks and impairment of MSA
   networks. Nevertheless, this empathic dysfunction is subtle, but
   contributes to interpersonal difficulties. Interaction between genetic
   factors and traumatic attachment stressors may contribute to development
   of BPD, with painful attachment insecurity and disorganization affecting
   SR and MSA network functioning. Future avenues for BPD research will
   include developmental assessment of attachment and neurobiological
   functioning under varying conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The association of verbal labels with visuo-spatial patterns and
   sequences detectably alters neuronal activity in the brain in ways that
   have yet to be fully characterized. This study investigated the neural
   substrates involved in the effect of spontaneous verbal labeling on
   memorizing increasingly complex sequences of hand movements. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test our hypothesis that
   when verbal labels were employed, neuronal activity in imitation-related
   regions, such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), would be
   reduced, whereas without verbal labels, neuronal activation would
   increase. Sixteen healthy adults satisfactorily performed an immediate
   imitation task involving six levels of increasing complexity. After the
   fMRI experiment, participants reported at which complexity level they
   had formed verbal labels. Based on the self-report, we categorized the
   task blocks at each complexity level as either with verbal labeling
   (VL+) or without (VL-). Compared with VL+, the VL- condition activated
   the left IFG, bilateral middle frontal gyri, left precentral gyrus, and
   the right angular gyrus, whereas the opposite contrast revealed no
   significant brain activation. Verbal labeling seems to serve as an
   efficient heuristic that reduces the cost of cortical activation in the
   imitation-related regions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan

Abstract = {{This research examines the relationship between brain activity recorded
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event related
   potentials (ERP) as these responses varied over a series of emotionally
   evocative and neutral pictures. We investigate the relationship of early
   occipitotemporal and later centroparietal emotion-modulated ERPs in one
   sample to fMRI estimates of neural activity in another sample in a
   replicated experiment. Using this approach, we aimed to link effects
   found in time-resolved electrocortical measures to specific neural
   structures across individual emotional and nonemotional picture stimuli.
   The centroparietal late positive potential (LPP) showed covariation with
   emotion-modulated regions of hemodynamic activation across multiple
   dorsal and ventral visual cortical structures, while the early
   occipitotemporal potential was not reliably associated. Subcortical and
   corticolimbic structures involved in the perception of motivationally
   relevant stimuli also related to modulation of the LPP, and were
   modestly associated to the amplitude of the early occipitotemporal
   potential. These data suggest that early occipitotemporal potentials may
   reflect multiple sources of modulation including motivational relevance,
   and supports the perspective that the slow-wave LPP represents aggregate
   cortical and subcortical structures involved in emotional
   discrimination. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deception is commonly seen in everyday social interactions. However,
   most of the knowledge about the underlying neural mechanism of deception
   comes from studies where participants were instructed when and how to
   lie. To study spontaneous deception, we designed a guessing game modeled
   after Greene and Paxton (2009) ``Proceedings of the National Academy of
   Sciences, 106(30), 12506-12511{''}, in which lying is the only way to
   achieve the performance level needed to end the game. We recorded neural
   responses during the game using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We
   found that when compared to truth-telling, spontaneous deception, like
   instructed deception, engenders greater involvement of such prefrontal
   regions as the left superior frontal gyrus. We also found that the
   correct-truth trials produced greater neural activities in the left
   middle frontal gyrus and right superior frontal gyrus than the
   incorrect-truth trials, suggesting the involvement of the reward system.
   Furthermore, the present study confirmed the feasibility of using NIRS
   to study spontaneous deception. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Various noncanonical sentence constructions are derived from basic
   sentence structures by a phrase displacement called Movement. The moved
   phrase (filler) leaves a silent copy at the extracted position (gap) and
   is reactivated when the hearer/reader passes over the gap. Consequently,
   memory operations are assumed to occur to establish the filler-gap link.
   For languages that have a relatively free word order like German, a
   distinct linguistic operation called Scrambling is proposed. Although
   Movement and Scrambling are assumed to be different linguistic
   operations, they both involve memory prone filler-gap processes. To
   clarify whether filler-gap memory processes in Scrambling and Movement
   differ neuroanatomically, we designed a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging study and compared the effect of memory load parameterized by
   filler-gap distance in the 2 sentence types. Here, we show that
   processing of the 2 sentence types commonly relies on a left hemispheric
   network consisting of the inferior frontal gyrus, middle part of the
   middle temporal gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus. However, we found
   differences for the 2 sentence types in the linearity of filler-gap
   distance effect. Thus, the present results suggest that the same neural
   substrate supports the memory processes of sentences constructed by
   Movement and Scrambling, although differentially modulated by memory
   load.}},

Abstract = {{The neurobiology of social anxiety disorder (SAD) is not yet fully
   understood. Structural and functional neuroimaging studies in SAD have
   identified abnormalities in various brain areas, particularly the
   amygdala and elements of the salience network. This study is the first
   to examine resting-state functional brain connectivity in a drug-naive
   sample of SAD patients without psychiatric comorbidity and healthy
   controls, using seed regions of interest in bilateral amygdala, in
   bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate cortex for the salience network, and
   in bilateral posterior cingulate cortex for the default mode network.
   Twelve drug-naive SAD patients and pair-wise matched healthy controls,
   all drawn from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety sample,
   underwent resting-state fMRI. Group differences were assessed with
   voxel-wise gray matter density as nuisance regressor. All results were
   cluster corrected for multiple comparisons (Z>2.3, p<.05). Relative to
   control subjects, drug-naive SAD patients demonstrated increased
   negative right amygdala connectivity with the left middle temporal
   gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus and left lateral occipital cortex. In
   the salience network patients showed increased positive bilateral dorsal
   anterior cingulate connectivity with the left precuneus and left lateral
   occipital cortex. Default mode network connectivity was not different
   between groups. These data demonstrate that drug-naive SAD patients
   without comorbidity show differences in functional connectivity of the
   amygdala, and of areas involved in self-awareness, some of which have
   not been implicated in SAD before. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All

Abstract = {{Objective This study aimed to investigate the adolescent brain
   activation patterns in response to performance feedback (PF), social
   reward (SR) and monetary reward (MR) and their association with
   psychological factors.
   Methods Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed while
   middle school boys (n=15) performed tests pertained to PF, SR and MR.
   The brain activation pattern in each condition was investigated, and the
   extent of brain activation in each of the three conditions was compared
   at once.
   Results The caudate and the dorsal prefrontal area were activated in all
   three conditions. Furthermore, the cuneus showed significantly greater
   activation in the PF condition than the SR or MR condition. And the self
   - related areas, such as the right precentral gyms and paracenral
   lobule, were more activated in the SR condition than the PF or MR
   condition. The left middle frontal gyrus was more activated in the MR
   condition than the PF or SR condition.
   Conclusion Not only various reward stimuli but also feedback stimulus
   might commonly activate dorsal prefrontal and subcortical area in
   adolescents. Moreover, several different brain activation patterns were
   also observed in each condition. The results of this study could be
   applied to planning of learning and teaching strategy for adolescents in
   various ways. Psychiatry Investig 2013;10:47-55}},

Abstract = {{Dimensions of psychopathy are theorized to be associated with distinct
   cognitive and emotional abnormalities that may represent unique
   neurobiological risk factors for the disorder. This hypothesis was
   investigated by examining whether the psychopathic personality
   dimensions of fearless-dominance and impulsive-antisociality moderated
   neural activity and behavioral responses associated with selective
   attention and emotional processing during an emotion-word Stroop task in
   49 adults. As predicted, the dimensions evidenced divergent
   selective-attention deficits and sensitivity to emotional distraction.
   Fearless-dominance was associated with disrupted attentional control to
   positive words, and activation in right superior frontal gyrus mediated
   the relationship between fearless-dominance and errors to positive
   words. In contrast, impulsive-antisociality evidenced increased
   behavioral interference to both positive and negative words and
   correlated positively with recruitment of regions associated with
   motivational salience (amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula), emotion
   regulation (temporal cortex, superior frontal gyrus) and attentional
   control (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Individuals high on both
   dimensions had increased recruitment of regions related to attentional
   control (temporal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate cortex), response
   preparation (pre-/post-central gyri) and motivational value
   (orbitofrontal cortex) in response to negative words. These findings
   provide evidence that the psychopathy dimensions represent dual sets of
   risk factors characterized by divergent dysfunction in cognitive and
   affective processes.}},

Abstract = {{A functional polymorphism within the serotonin transporter gene
   (5-HTTLPR) has been reported to modulate emotionality and risk for
   affective disorders. The short (S) allele has less functional efficacy
   than the long (L) allele and has been associated with enhanced emotional
   reactivity. One possible contributing factor to the high emotionality in
   S carriers may be inefficient use of cognitive strategies such as
   reappraisal to regulate emotional responses. The aim of the present
   study was to test whether the 5-HTTLPR genotype modulates the neural
   correlates of emotion regulation. To determine neural differences
   between S and L allele carriers during reappraisal of negative emotions,
   15 homozygous S (S'/S') and 15 homozygous L (L'/L') carriers underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while performing an
   instructed emotion regulation task including downregulation,
   upregulation and passive viewing of negative emotional pictures.
   Compared to L'/L' allele carriers, subjects who carry the S'/S' allele
   responded with lower posterior insula and prefrontal brain activation
   during passive perception of negative emotional information but showed
   greater prefrontal activation and anterior insula activation during
   down- and upregulation of negative emotional responses. The current
   results support and extend previous findings of enhanced emotionality in
   S carriers by providing additional evidence of 5-HTTLPR modulation of
   volitional emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Studies in psychiatry and cognitive neuroscience have reported an
   important relationship between individual interoceptive accuracy and
   anxiety level. This indicates that greater attention to one's bodily
   state may contribute to the development of intense negative emotions and
   anxiety disorders. We hypothesized that reactivity in the anterior
   insular cortex underlies the intensity of interoceptive awareness and
   anxiety. To elucidate this triadic mechanism, we conducted functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and mediation analyses to examine the
   relationship between emotional disposition and activation in the
   anterior insular cortex while participants evaluated their own emotional
   and bodily states. Our results indicated that right anterior insular
   activation was positively correlated with individual levels of social
   anxiety and neuroticism and negatively correlated with agreeableness and
   extraversion. The results of the mediation analyses revealed that
   activity in the right anterior insula mediated the activity of neural
   correlates of interoceptive sensibility and social fear. Our findings
   suggest that attention to interoceptive sensation affects personality
   traits through how we feel emotion subjectively in various situations.}},

Abstract = {{Aversive social learning experiences might play a significant role in
   the aetiology of social anxiety disorder. Therefore, we investigated
   emotional learning and unlearning processes in healthy humans using a
   social conditioning paradigm. Forty-nine healthy subjects participated
   in a 2-day fMRI differential conditioning protocol. Acquisition and
   extinction were conducted on Day 1 and extinction recall on Day 2. BOLD
   responses, ratings and skin conductance responses were collected. Our
   data indicate successful conditioning and extinction on the neural and
   subjective level. As a main result, we observed a positive correlation
   of social anxiety and conditioning responses on the subjective level
   (valence and fear) as well as on the neural level with significant
   CS+/CS- differentiation in the left amygdala and the left hippocampus.
   Further, significant CS+/CS- differentiation in the left amygdala was
   found during extinction and was associated with lower scores in social
   anxiety. During extinction recall, we found a tendentially negative
   correlation of social anxiety and CS+/CS- differentiation in the vmPFC.
   In sum, we were able to show that social anxiety is related to
   conditionability with socially threatening stimuli. This could point to
   an important aspect in the aetiology of social anxiety disorder.}},

   combining methods and theories from psychology, economics and
   neuroscience to outline a novel, expectation-based, computational model
   of social preferences. Results demonstrate that this model outperforms
   the standard inequity-aversion model in explaining decision behavior in
   a social interactive bargaining task. This is supported by fMRI findings
   showing that the tracking of social expectation violations is processed
   by anterior cingulate cortex, extending previous computational
   conceptualizations of this region to the social domain. This study
   demonstrates the usefulness of this interdisciplinary approach in better
   characterizing the psychological processes that underlie social
   interactive decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroscience research on the social evaluation of faces has accumulated
   over the last decade, yielding divergent results. We used a
   meta-analytic technique, multi-level kernel density analysis (MKDA), to
   analyze 29 neuroimaging studies on face evaluation. Across negative face
   evaluations, we observed the most consistent activations in bilateral
   amygdala. Across positive face evaluations, we observed the most
   consistent activations in medial prefrontal cortex, pregenual anterior
   cingulate cortex (pgACC), medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), left
   caudate and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Based on additional analyses
   comparing linear and non-linear responses, we propose a ventral/dorsal
   dissociation within the amygdala, wherein separate populations of
   neurons code for face valence and intensity, respectively. Finally, we
   argue that some of the differences between studies are attributable to
   differences in the typicality of face stimuli. Specifically, extremely
   attractive faces are more likely to elicit responses in NAcc/caudate and
   mOFC.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the distracting effects of emotional stimuli on concurrent task
   performance, humans are able to uphold goal-directed behavior. Here, we
   investigated the hypothesis that this effect is due to the enhanced
   recruitment of task-specific neural resources. In a two-step functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study, we first localized those areas
   involved in mental arithmetics by contrasting arithmetic problems with a
   number detection task. The resulting activation maps were then used as
   masks in a second experiment that compared the effects of neutral and
   emotional distracter images on mental arithmetics. We found increased
   response times in the emotional distracter condition, accompanied by
   enhanced activation in task-specific areas, including superior parietal
   cortex, dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. This activation
   increase correlated with larger behavioral impairment through emotional
   distraction. Similar error rates in both conditions indicate that
   cognitive task performance is preserved through enhanced recruitment of
   task-specific neural resources when emotional distracter stimuli are
   present.}},

Abstract = {{Fear learning is a crucial process in the pathogeneses of psychiatric
   disorders, which highlights the need to identify specific factors
   contributing to interindividual variation. We hypothesized variation in
   the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and stressful life events
   (SLEs) to be associated with neural correlates of fear conditioning in a
   sample of healthy male adults (n = 47). Subjects were exposed to a
   differential fear conditioning paradigm after being preselected
   regarding 5-HTTLPR genotype and SLEs. Individual differences in brain
   activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
   skin conductance responses and preference ratings were assessed. We
   report significant variation in neural correlates of fear conditioning
   as a function of 5-HTTLPR genotype. Specifically, the conditioned
   stimulus (CS+) elicited elevated activity within the fear-network
   (amygdala, insula, thalamus, occipital cortex) in subjects carrying two
   copies of the 5-HTTLPR S' allele. Moreover, our results revealed
   preliminary evidence for a significant gene-by-environment interaction,
   such as homozygous carriers of the 5-HTTLPR S' allele with a history of
   SLEs demonstrated elevated reactivity to the CS+ in the occipital cortex
   and the insula. Our findings contribute to the current debate on
   5-HTTLPR x SLEs interaction by investigating crucial alterations on an
   intermediate phenotype level which may convey an elevated vulnerability
   for the development of psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term cultural experiences influence neural response to one's own

   from British and Chinese adults during judgments of orientations of
   one's own and friend's faces after they were primed with independent and
   interdependent self-construals. We found that an early frontal negative
   activity at 220-340 ms (the anterior N2) differentiated between one's
   own and friend's faces in both cultural groups. Most remarkably, for
   British participants, priming an interdependent self-construal reduced
   the default anterior N2 to their own faces. For Chinese participants,
   however, priming an independent self-construal suppressed the default
   anterior N2 to their friend's faces. These findings indicate fast
   modulations of culturally specific neural responses induced by temporary

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation strategies can alter behavioral and physiological
   responses to emotional stimuli and the neural correlates of those
   responses in regions such as the amygdala or striatum. The current study
   investigates the brain systems engaged when using an emotion regulation
   technique during financial decisions. In decision making, regulating
   emotion with reappraisal-focused strategies that encourage taking a
   different perspective has been shown to reduce loss aversion as observed
   both in choices and in the relative arousal responses to actual loss and
   gain outcomes. In the current study, we find using fMRI that behavioral
   loss aversion correlates with amygdala activity in response to losses
   relative to gains. Success in regulating loss aversion also correlates
   with the reduction in amygdala responses to losses but not to gains.
   Furthermore, across both decisions and outcomes, we find the reappraisal
   strategy increases baseline activity in dorsolateral and ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex and the striatum. The similarity of the neural
   circuitry observed to that seen in emotion regulation, despite divergent
   tasks, serves as further evidence for a role of emotion in decision
   making, and for the power of reappraisal to change assessments of value
   and thereby choices.}},

Abstract = {{Following the two-stage model of disgust, `core disgust' (e.g. elicited
   by rotten food) is extended to stimuli that remind us of our animal
   nature `AR disgust' (e.g. mutilations, animalistic instincts). There is
   ample evidence that core and AR represent distinct domains of disgust
   elicitors. Moreover, people show large differences in their tendency to
   respond with disgust to potential disgust elicitors (propensity), as
   well as in their appraisal of experiencing disgust (sensitivity). Thus
   these traits may be important moderators of people's response patterns.
   Here, we aimed to find brain mechanisms associated with these distinct
   disgust domains and traits, as well as the interaction between them. The
   right ventrolateral occipitotemporal cortex, which preferentially
   responded to visual AR, was functionally coupled to the middle cingulate
   cortex (MCC), thalamus and prefrontal cortex (medial, dorsolateral), as
   a function of disgust domain. Coupling with the anterior part of MCC was
   modulated by disgust `propensity', which was strongest during AR.
   Coupling with anterior insula and ventral premotor cortex was weaker,
   but relied fully on this domain-trait interaction. Disgust `sensitivity'
   modulated left anterior insula activity irrespective of domain, and did
   not affect functional connectivity. Thus a frontal-posterior network
   that interacts with disgust `propensity' dissects AR and core disgust.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: There is a pressing need to elucidate the brain-behavior
   interactions underlying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) given the marked
   rise in ASD diagnosis over the past decade. Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) has begun to address this need, but few fMRI
   studies have evaluated age-related changes in ASD. Therefore, we
   conducted a developmental analysis of activation likelihood estimation
   (ALE) meta-analysis to compare child versus adult ASD fMRI studies. We
   hypothesized that children and adolescents with ASD (<18 years old)
   would rely less on prefrontal cortex structures than adults (>= 18 years
   old). Method: PubMed and PsycInfo literature searches were conducted to
   identify task-dependent fMRI studies of children or adults with ASD.
   Then recent GingerALE software improvements were leveraged to perform
   direct comparisons of child (n = 18) versus adult (n = 24) studies.
   Results: ALE meta-analyses of social tasks showed that children and
   adolescents with ASD versus adults had significantly greater
   hyperactivation in the left post-central gyrus, and greater
   hypoactivation in the right hippocampus and right superior temporal
   gyrus. ALE meta-analyses of nonsocial tasks showed that children with
   ASD versus adults had significantly greater hyperactivation in the right
   insula and left cingulate gyrus, and hypoactivation in the right middle
   frontal gyrus. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the neural alterations
   associated with ASD are not static, occurring only in early childhood.
   Instead, children with ASD have altered neural activity compared to
   adults during both social and nonsocial tasks, especially in
   fronto-temporal structures. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies are
   required to examine these changes prospectively, as potential targets
   for brain-based treatments for ASD. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD) has been associated with aberrant
   processing of socio-emotional stimuli and failure to adaptively regulate
   emotion, corroborated by functional neuroimaging studies. However, only
   a few studies of structural brain abnormalities in SAD have been
   reported, and among these only one investigated cortical thickness. In
   the present study we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in
   conjunction with an automated method to measure cortical thickness in
   patients with SAD (n=14) and healthy controls (n=12). Results showed
   significantly increased thickness of the left inferior temporal cortex
   in SAD patients relative to controls. Within the patient group, a
   negative association was found between social anxiety symptom severity
   and thickness of the right rostral anterior cingulate cortex. The
   observed alterations in brain structure may help explain previous
   findings of dysfunctional regulation and processing of emotion in SAD.

Abstract = {{Intrinsic activity of the brain during resting-state is not random and
   is currently discussed as a neural reflection of self-referential
   processing. Self-reference is typically reduced in schizophrenia as a
   disorder of the self while extensive self-attribution of, eg, negative
   thoughts is characteristic for major depression. However, a quantitative
   meta-analysis targeting the resting-state brain activity in both
   disorders is lacking. Here, we predict primarily abnormal resting-state
   activity in brain regions related to self-referential processing. By
   means of activation likelihood estimation (ALE) on functional magnetic
   resonance imaging and positron emission tomography studies, we
   investigated concurrence of hyperactivation and hypoactivation in
   resting-state measurements of schizophrenic and depressed patients
   compared with healthy controls. We found hypoactivation in ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), left hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex,
   lower precueus and the precuneus, and hyperactivation in bilateral
   lingual gyrus of schizophrenic patients. In major depression, we found
   hyperactivation in vmPFC, left ventral striatum, and left thalamus and
   hypoactivation in left postcentral gyrus, left fusiform gyms, and left
   insula. An overall ALE analysis confirmed the proximity of
   hypoactivation in schizophrenia and hyperactivation in major depression
   in the vmPFC.The opposing resting-state activity in vmPFC for the 2
   disorders is in line with the different expression of dysfunctional
   self-reference as core characteristics of schizophrenia and major
   depression. The vmPFC has previously been identified as a crucial area
   for self-referential processing and may represent a target to increase
   the diagnostic validity of resting-state activity for disorders with
   dysfunctions of the self.}},

Abstract = {{Recent approaches suggest that emotional reactivity can be used to
   differentiate between subgroups of individuals who are at risk for
   showing elevated levels of aggression and violence. In this study, we
   examined how emotion governs decision making within two subgroups of
   antisocial criminal offenders with either emotional hypo- or
   hyper-reactivity compared with healthy, noncriminal controls. Offenders
   were recruited from high-security forensic treatment facilities and
   penal institutions and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging
   during a financial decision-making task. In this task, participants were
   required to choose between low-risk (bonds) and high-risk alternatives
   (stocks). Bonds were always the safe choice; stocks could win or lose,
   with a varying degree of uncertainty. We found that emotionally
   hypo-reactive offenders differed most from healthy controls by showing
   diminished neural activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in
   response to uncertainty as well as decreased activity in the prefrontal
   cortex when trying to regulate their behavior accordingly (i.e., when
   consistently choosing safe alternatives). Hence, the data indicate that
   emotionally hypo-reactive offenders (with psychopathic traits)
   constitute a special subgroup within antisocial offenders characterized
   in particular by a limited capacity to emotionally represent uncertainty
   and to anticipate punishment.}},

Abstract = {{Research with violent offenders and delinquent adolescents suggests that

   Nineteen healthy Asian male participants were insulted and asked to
   control their anger during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   When cortisol levels were low, testosterone positively correlated with
   activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and thalamus,
   but not when cortisol levels were high. During induced anger control,
   functional connectivity was increased between the amygdala and a
   top-down prefrontal cortical control network. Moreover, the amygdala-PFC
   connectivity was strongest among those high in testosterone and low in

Abstract = {{In recent years, educational neuroscience has begun to move into the
   limelight, suggesting an increased importance on the ethical
   considerations of educational neuroscience work, or educational
   neuroethics. In a departure from previous work on educational
   neuroethics, this article focuses on the ethical considerations that are
   applicable to empirical educational neuroscience research. Neuroethics
   concepts were compiled through a thorough survey of neuroethics
   articles. Then, 28 empirical educational neuroscience articles were
   analyzed through the lens of five categories of neuroethics concepts
   collected through the literature survey: the scientific enterprise,
   prediction, neuro-manipulation, social considerations, and philosophical
   considerations. Three of the five categories (i.e., the nature of
   scientific investigation, prediction, and social considerations) applied
   to a subset of the articles. In addition, a fourth ethical issue not
   stemming from the neuroethics literature, referred to here as
   brain-based justifications, emerged from the nature of educational
   neuroscience work. Limitations of this study and future directions for
   educational neuroethics research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The ability to perceive facial emotion varies with age.
   Relative to younger adults (YA), older adults (OA) are less accurate at
   identifying fear, anger, and sadness, and more accurate at identifying
   disgust. Because different emotions are conveyed by different parts of
   the face, changes in visual scanning patterns may account for
   age-related variability. We investigated the relation between scanning
   patterns and recognition of facial emotions. Additionally, as
   frontal-lobe changes with age may affect scanning patterns and emotion
   recognition, we examined correlations between scanning parameters and
   performance on executive function tests. Methods: We recorded eye
   movements from 16 OA (mean age 68.9) and 16 YA (mean age 19.2) while
   they categorized facial expressions and non-face control images
   (landscapes), and administered standard tests of executive function.
   Results: OA were less accurate than YA at identifying fear (p<.05, r =
   .44) and more accurate at identifying disgust (p<.05, r = .39). OA
   fixated less than YA on the top half of the face for disgust, fearful,
   happy, neutral, and sad faces (p values<.05, r values .38), whereas
   there was no group difference for landscapes. For OA, executive function
   was correlated with recognition of sad expressions and with scanning
   patterns for fearful, sad, and surprised expressions. Conclusion: We
   report significant age-related differences in visual scanning that are
   specific to faces. The observed relation between scanning patterns and
   executive function supports the hypothesis that frontal-lobe changes
   with age may underlie some changes in emotion recognition.}},

Title = {{Alcohol-Induced Changes in Cerebral Blood Flow and Cerebral Blood Volume
   in Social Drinkers}},
Journal = {{ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLISM}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{160-165}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Although it is known that alcohol has vasoactive properties,
   previous studies have not investigated the relationship between cerebral
   blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) after alcohol
   consumption. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of alcohol
   on CBF and CBV, both globally and regionally, in social drinkers.
   Methods: The method of choice was dynamic susceptibility contrast
   magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI). Eight males were scanned twice on
   two separate days; once after consumption of alcohol (blood-alcohol
   concentration (BAC) of 0.08\%) and once sober. Results: The results
   showed an average increase of CBF after alcohol consumption, both in
   grey matter (GM) and in white matter (WM), with a CBFBAC of
   0.08\%/CBFbaseline ratio of 1.2. Regional increases in CBF were seen in
   areas close to where the large brain-feeding blood vessels enter the
   brain, in the thalamus region and in the frontal brain regions. The
   lowest CBF changes were seen in the occipital brain regions. There was
   also an increase in CBV after alcohol consumption, in particular across
   WM regions. Conclusion: In conclusion, a BAC of 0.08\% causes both an
   average increase in global and regional CBF. There was stronger
   correlation between alcohol-induced changes in CBF and CBV in WM than in
   GM, suggesting the vasculature in the WM to be relatively more affected
   than the GM. Simultaneous measurements of CBF and CBV after acute
   alcohol intoxication in social drinkers are important in basic human
   neuroscience research to elucidate and understand brain physiology in
   the presence of exogenous neuro-pharmaceutical manipulations.}},

Abstract = {{Yawning is contagious. However, little research has been done to
   elucidate the neuronal representation of this phenomenon. Our study
   objective was to test the hypothesis that the human mirror neuron system
   (MNS) is activated by visually perceived yawning. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to assess brain activity during contagious
   yawning (CY). Signal-dependent changes in blood oxygen levels were
   compared when subjects viewed videotapes of yawning faces as opposed to
   faces with a neutral expression. In response to yawning, subjects showed
   unilateral activation of their Brodmann's area 9 (BA 9) portion of the
   right inferior frontal gyrus, a region of the MNS. In this way, two
   individuals could share physiological and associated emotional states
   based on perceived motor patterns. This is one component of empathy
   (motor empathy) that underlies the development of cognitive empathy. The
   BA 9 is reportedly active in tasks requiring mentalizing abilities. Our
   results emphasize the connection between the MNS and higher cognitive
   empathic functions, including mentalizing. We conclude that CY is based
   on a functional substrate of empathy.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The fear of negative evaluation is one of the hallmark features of
   social anxiety. Behavioral evidence thus far largely supports cognitive
   models which postulate that information processing biases in the face of
   socially relevant information are a key factor underlying this
   widespread phobia. So far only one neuroimaging study has explicitly
   focused on the fear of negative evaluation in social anxiety where the
   brain responses of social phobics were compared to healthy participants
   during the processing of self-referential relative to other-referential
   criticism, praise or neutral information. Only self-referential
   criticism led to stronger activations in emotion-relevant regions of the
   brain, such as the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortices (mPFC), in
   the social phobics. The objective of the current study was to determine
   whether these findings could be extended to subclinical social anxiety.
   In doing so, the specificity of this self-referential bias was also
   examined by including both social and non-social (physical
   illness-related) threat information as well as a highly health anxious
   control group in the experimental paradigm. The fMRI findings indicated
   that the processing of emotional stimuli was accompanied by activations
   in the amygdala and the ventral mPFC, while self-referential processing
   was associated with activity in regions such as the mPFC, posterior
   cingulate and temporal poles. Despite the validation of the paradigm,
   the results revealed that the previously reported behavioral and brain
   biases associated with social phobia could not be unequivocally extended
   to subclinical social anxiety. The divergence between the findings is
   explored in detail with reference to paradigm differences and conceptual
   issues.}},

Abstract = {{The experience of pain can be significantly influenced by expectancy
   (predictive cues). This ability to modulate pain has the potential to
   affect therapeutic analgesia substantially and constitutes a foundation
   for nonpharmacological pain relief. In this study, we investigated (1)
   brain regions involved in visual cue modulation of pain during
   anticipation of pain, pain administration, and pain rating; and (2) the
   association between pretest resting state functional connectivity and
   the magnitude of cue effects on pain ratings. We found that after cue
   conditioning, visual cues can significantly modulate subjective pain
   ratings. Functional magnetic resonance imaging results suggested that
   brain regions pertaining to the frontoparietal network (prefrontal and
   parietal cortex) and a pain/emotion modulatory region (rostral anterior
   cingulate cortex) are involved in cue modulation during both pain
   anticipation and administration stage. Most interestingly, we found that
   pretest resting state functional connectivity between the frontoparietal
   network (as identified by independent component analysis) and the
   rostral anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex was
   positively associated with cue effects on pain rating changes. We
   believe that these findings will shed new light on our understanding of
   variable cue/expectancy effects across individuals and how the intrinsic
   connectivity of the brain may influence expectancy-induced modulation of
   pain. (C) 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that the observation of an action induces in the
   observers an enhancement of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded by
   the observer's muscles corresponding to those involved in the observed
   action. Although this is a well-studied phenomenon, it remains still
   unclear how the viewer's motor facilitation is influenced by the social
   content characterizing the observed scene. In the present study we
   investigated the facilitation of the corticospinal system during the
   observation of either an action that does not imply a social interaction
   (i.e., an actor throwing a ball against a wall), or an action which
   implies a social interaction (i.e., an actor passing a ball to a
   partner). Results indicate that MEPs amplitude is enhanced during the
   observation of a social rather than an individual action. We contend
   that the increase in MEPs activation might reflect an enhancement of the
   simulative activity stemming from the mirror system during the
   observation of social interactions. Altogether these findings show that
   the human corticospinal system is sensitive to social interactions and
   may support the role of the mirror neurons system in social cognition.

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) plays an important role in complex
   socio-affective behaviours such as affiliation, attachment, stress and
   anxiety. Previous studies have focused on the amygdala as an important
   target of OXT's effects. However, the effects of OXT on connectivity of
   the amygdala with cortical regions such as medial frontal cortex, an
   important mediator of social cognition and emotion regulation, remain
   unexplored. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, 15
   volunteers received intranasal OXT or placebo prior to resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. OXT significantly increased
   connectivity between both amygdalae and rostral medial frontal cortex
   (rmFC), while having only negligible effects on coupling with other
   brain regions. These results demonstrate that OXT is a robust and highly
   selective enhancer of amygdala connectivity with rmFC, a region critical
   to social cognition and emotion regulation, and add to our understanding
   of the neural mechanisms by which OXT modulates complex social and
   cognitive behaviours.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Abnormal task-related activation and connectivity is present
   in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was the analysis of functional
   networks in schizophrenia patients in remission after the first episode.
   Experimental design: Twenty-nine male patients in remission after the
   first episode of schizophrenia and 22 healthy controls underwent
   examination by functional magnetic resonance during verbal fluency tasks
   (VFT). The functional connectivity of brain networks was analyzed using
   independent component analysis. Results: The patients showed lower
   activation of the salience network during VFT. They also showed lower
   deactivation of the default mode network (DMN) during VFT processing.
   Spectral analysis of the component time courses showed decreased power
   in slow frequencies of signal fluctuations in the salience and DMNs and
   increased power in higher frequencies in the left frontoparietal cortex
   reflecting higher fluctuations of the network activity. Moreover, there
   was decreased similarity of component time courses in schizophreniathe
   patients had smaller negative correlation between VFT activated and
   deactivated networks, and smaller positive correlations between DMN
   subcomponents. Conclusions: There is still an abnormal functional
   connectivity of several brain networks in remission after the first
   episode of schizophrenia. The effect of different treatment modalities
   on brain connectivity, together with temporal dynamics of this
   functional abnormality should be the objective of further studies to
   assess its potential as a marker of disease stabilization. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{Group level statistical maps of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
   signals acquired using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have
   become a basic measurement for much of systems, cognitive and social
   neuroscience. A challenge in making inferences from these statistical
   maps is the noise and potential confounds that arise from the head
   motion that occurs within and between acquisition volumes. This motion
   results in the scan plane being misaligned during acquisition,
   ultimately leading to reduced statistical power when maps are
   constructed at the group level. In most cases, an attempt is made to
   correct for this motion through the use of retrospective analysis
   methods. In this paper, we use a prospective active marker motion
   correction (PRAMMO) system that uses radio frequency markers for
   real-time tracking of motion, enabling on-line slice plane correction.
   We show that the statistical power of the activation maps is
   substantially increased using PRAMMO compared to conventional
   retrospective correction. Analysis of our results indicates that the
   PRAMMO acquisition reduces the variance without decreasing the signal
   component of the BOLD (beta). Using PRAMMO could thus improve the
   overall statistical power of fMRI based BOLD measurements, leading to
   stronger inferences of the nature of processing in the human brain. (C)

   social pain. Finally, participants played a dictator game with those who
   included them, excluded them, or with new players. Results showed that
   financial compensation increased offers to sources of exclusion to the
   amount that was given to sources of inclusion or new players. Hence,
   financially compensating exclusion helps those who are hurt and those

Abstract = {{Evidence has suggested that women have greater emotional reactivity than
   men. However, it is unclear whether these differences in basic emotional
   responses are also associated with differences in emotional
   distractibility, and what the neural mechanisms that implement
   differences in emotional distractibility between women and men are.
   Functional MRI recording was used in conjunction with a working memory
   (WM) task, with emotional distraction (angry faces) presented during the
   interval between the memoranda and the probes. First, we found an
   increased impact of emotional distraction among women in trials
   associated with high-confidence responses, in the context of overall
   similar WM performance in women and men. Second, women showed increased
   sensitivity to emotional distraction in brain areas associated with
   ``hot{''} emotional processing, whereas men showed increased sensitivity
   in areas associated with ``cold{''} executive processing, in the context
   of overall similar patterns of response to emotional distraction in
   women and men. Third, a sex-related dorsal-ventral hemispheric
   dissociation emerged in the lateral PFC related to coping with emotional
   distraction, with women showing a positive correlation with WM
   performance in left ventral PFC, and men showing similar effects in the
   right dorsal PFC. In addition to extending to men results that have
   previously been reported in women, by showing that both sexes engage
   mechanisms that are similar overall in response to emotional
   distraction, the present study identifies sex differences in both the
   response to and coping with emotional distraction. These results have
   implications for understanding sex differences in the susceptibility to
   affective disorders, in which basic emotional responses, emotional
   distractibility, and coping abilities are altered.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to explore regional homogeneity (ReHo), an

   Participants comprised 30 patients and 21 healthy controls who underwent
   with 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning and ReHo
   functional MRI analysis. All participants were studied with clinical
   rating scales to assess the severity of PD symptoms. ReHo values were
   obtained using the REST toolbox (resting-state functional MRI data
   analysis toolbox). Differences in demographic data and ReHo values
   between the two groups were evaluated with the independent two-sample
   t-test function of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and
   REST. There were significant differences in clinical ratings between the
   two groups. No demographic differences were noted. We found decreased
   ReHo in the left lingual gyrus and increased ReHo in the right cuneus
   cortex of patients compared with controls. ReHo values of patients were
   negatively correlated with PD ratings in the right cuneus. ReHo
   differences found in the left lingual gyrus and the right cuneus might
   suggest sensory and inhibitory dysfunction in first-episode,
   medication-naive, late-onset patients with PD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Emotion regulation is crucial for successfully engaging in social
   interactions. Yet, little is known about the neural mechanisms
   controlling behavioral responses to emotional expressions perceived in
   the face of other people, which constitute a key element of
   interpersonal communication. Here, we investigated brain systems
   involved in social emotion perception and regulation, using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 20 healthy participants. The latter
   saw dynamic facial expressions of either happiness or sadness, and were
   asked to either imitate the expression or to suppress any expression on
   their own face (in addition to a gender judgment control task). fMRI
   results revealed higher activity in regions associated with emotion
   (e.g., the insula), motor function (e.g., motor cortex), and theory of
   mind (e.g., {[}pre]cuneus) during imitation. Activity in dorsal
   cingulate cortex was also increased during imitation, possibly
   reflecting greater action monitoring or conflict with own feeling
   states. In addition, premotor regions were more strongly activated
   during both imitation and suppression, suggesting a recruitment of motor
   control for both the production and inhibition of emotion expressions.
   Expressive suppression (eSUP) produced increases in dorsolateral and
   lateral prefrontal cortex typically related to cognitive control. These
   results suggest that voluntary imitation and eSUP modulate brain
   responses to emotional signals perceived from faces, by up- and
   down-regulating activity in distributed subcortical and cortical
   networks that are particularly involved in emotion, action monitoring,
   and cognitive control.}},

Title = {{Implicitly Priming the Social Brain: Failure to Find Neural Effects}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 20}},
Abstract = {{Humans have a fundamental need for social relationships. Rejection from
   social groups is especially detrimental, rendering the ability to detect
   threats to social relationships and respond in adaptive ways critical.
   Indeed, previous research has shown that experiencing social rejection
   alters the processing of subsequent social cues in a variety of socially
   affiliative and avoidant ways. Because social perception and cognition
   occurs spontaneously and automatically, detecting threats to social
   relationships may occur without conscious awareness or control. Here, we
   investigated the automaticity of social threat detection by examining
   how implicit primes affect neural responses to social stimuli. However,
   despite using a well-established implicit priming paradigm and large
   sample size, we failed to find any evidence that implicit primes induced
   changes at the neural level. That implicit primes influence behavior has
   been demonstrated repeatedly and across a variety of domains, and our
   goal is not to question these effects. Rather, we offer the present
   study as cautionary evidence that such a paradigm may not be amenable to
   scanning in an fMRI environment.}},

Abstract = {{Neural correlates of Braille reading have been widely studied with
   different neuroimaging techniques. Nevertheless, the exact brain
   processes underlying this unique activity are still unknown, due to
   suboptimal accuracy of imaging and/or stimuli delivery methods. To study
   somatosensory perception effectively, the stimulation must reflect
   parameters of the natural stimulus and must be applied with precise
   timing. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) providing these
   characteristics requires technologically advanced solutions and there
   have been several successful direct tactile stimulation devices designed
   that allow investigation of somatotopic organization of brain sensory
   areas. They may, however, be of limited applicability in studying brain
   mechanisms related to such distinctive tactile activity as Braille
   reading.
   In this paper we describe the design and experimental evaluation of an
   innovative MRI-compatible Braille Character Stimulator (BCS) enabling
   precise and stable delivery of standardized Braille characters with high
   temporal resolution. Our device is fully programmable, flexible in
   stimuli delivery and can be easily implemented in any research unit. The
   Braille Character Stimulator was tested with a same-different
   discrimination task on Braille characters during an event-related fMRI
   experiment in eleven right-handed sighted adult subjects. The results
   show significant activations in several cortical areas, including
   bilateral primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory (SII) cortices,
   bilateral premotor and supplementary motor areas, inferior frontal gyri,
   inferior temporal gyri and precuneus, as well as contralateral (to the
   stimulated hand) thalamus. The results validate the use of the BCS as a
   method of effective stimuli application in fMRI studies, in both sighted
   and visually impaired subjects. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Functional neuroimaging studies have provided consistent
   support for the idea that obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is
   associated with disturbances of brain corticostriatal systems. However,
   in general, these studies have not sought to account for the disorder's
   prominent clinical heterogeneity.
   Methods: To address these concerns, we investigated the influence of
   major OCD symptom dimensions on brain corticostriatal functional systems
   in a large sample of OCD patients (n = 74) and control participants (n =
   74) examined with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   We employed a valid method for mapping ventral and dorsal striatal
   functional connectivity, which supported both standard group comparisons
   and linear regression analyses with patients' scores on the Dimensional
   Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale.
   Results: Consistent with past findings, patients demonstrated a common
   connectivity alteration involving the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal
   cortex that predicted overall illness severity levels. This common
   alteration was independent of the effect of particular symptom
   dimensions. Instead, we observed distinct anatomical relationships
   between the severity of symptom dimensions and striatal functional
   connectivity. Aggression symptoms modulated connectivity between the
   ventral striatum, amygdala, and ventromedial frontal cortex, while
   sexual/religious symptoms had a specific influence on ventral
   striatal-insular connectivity. Hoarding modulated the strength of
   ventral and dorsal striatal connectivity with distributed frontal
   regions.
   Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that
   pathophysiological changes among orbitofrontal-striatal regions may be
   common to all forms of OCD. They suggest that a further examination of
   certain dimensional relationships will also be relevant for advancing
   current neurobiological models of the disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Generalized social phobia (gSP), also known as generalized
   social anxiety disorder, is characterized by excessive fear of scrutiny
   by others and pervasive avoidance of social interactions.
   Pathophysiologic models of gSP implicate exaggerated reactivity of the
   amygdala and insula in response to social evaluative threat, making them
   plausible targets for treatment. Although selective serotonin reuptake
   inhibitor (SSRI) treatment is known to be an effective treatment, little
   is known about the mechanism through which these agents exert their
   anxiolytic effects at a brain level in gSP.
   Methods: We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging data of brain
   response to social signals of threat (fearful/angry faces) in 21 gSP
   patients before and after they completed 12 weeks of open-label
   treatment with the SSRI sertraline. For comparison, 19 healthy control
   (HC) subjects also underwent two functional magnetic resonance imaging
   scans, 12 weeks apart.
   Results: Whole-brain voxelwise analysis of variance revealed significant
   Group x Time interactions in the amygdala and the ventral medial
   prefrontal cortex. Follow-up analyses showed that treatment in gSP
   subjects reduced amygdala reactivity to fearful faces (which was
   exaggerated relative to HCs before treatment) and enhanced ventral
   medial prefrontal cortex activation to angry faces (which was attenuated
   relative to HCs before treatment). However, these brain changes were not
   significantly related to social anxiety symptom improvement.
   Conclusions: SSRI treatment response in gSP is associated with changes
   in a discrete limbic-paralimbic brain network, representing a neural
   mechanism through which SSRIs may exert their actions.}},

Abstract = {{Liberals and conservatives exhibit different cognitive styles and
   converging lines of evidence suggest that biology influences differences
   in their political attitudes and beliefs. In particular, a recent study
   of young adults suggests that liberals and conservatives have
   significantly different brain structure, with liberals showing increased
   gray matter volume in the anterior cingulate cortex, and conservatives
   showing increased gray matter volume in the in the amygdala. Here, we
   explore differences in brain function in liberals and conservatives by
   matching publicly-available voter records to 82 subjects who performed a
   risk-taking task during functional imaging. Although the risk-taking
   behavior of Democrats (liberals) and Republicans (conservatives) did not
   differ, their brain activity did. Democrats showed significantly greater
   activity in the left insula, while Republicans showed significantly
   greater activity in the right amygdala. In fact, a two parameter model
   of partisanship based on amygdala and insula activations yields a better
   fitting model of partisanship than a well-established model based on
   parental socialization of party identification long thought to be one of
   the core findings of political science. These results suggest that
   liberals and conservatives engage different cognitive processes when
   they think about risk, and they support recent evidence that
   conservatives show greater sensitivity to threatening stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Infant cries are a critical survival mechanism that draw the attention
   of adult caregivers, who can then satisfy the basic needs of otherwise
   helpless infants. Here, we used functional neuroimaging to determine the
   effects of infant hunger cries on the brain activity of adults who were
   in a cognitively nondemanding mental state of awake rest. We found that
   the brains of men and women, independent of parental status (parent or
   nonparent), reacted differently to infant cries. Specifically, the
   dorsal medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate areas, known to be
   involved in mind wandering (the stream of thought typical of awake
   rest), remained active in men during exposure to infant cries, whereas
   in women, activity in these regions decreased. These results show
   sex-dependent modulation of brain responses to infant requests to be
   fed, and specifically, they indicate that women interrupt mind wandering
   when exposed to the sounds of infant hunger cries, whereas men carry on
   without interruption. NeuroReport 24:142-146 (c) 2013 Wolters Kluwer

Abstract = {{The advent of high-throughput technologies and the concurrent advances
   in information sciences have led to an explosion in size and complexity
   of the data sets collected in biological sciences. The biggest challenge
   today is to assimilate this wealth of information into a conceptual
   framework that will help us decipher biological functions. A large and
   complex collection of data, usually called a data cloud, naturally
   embeds multi-scale characteristics and features, generically termed
   geometry. Understanding this geometry is the foundation for extracting
   knowledge from data. We have developed a new methodology, called data
   cloud geometry-tree (DCG-tree), to resolve this challenge. This new
   procedure has two main features that are keys to its success. Firstly,
   it derives from the empirical similarity measurements a hierarchy of
   clustering configurations that captures the geometric structure of the
   data. This hierarchy is then transformed into an ultrametric space,
   which is then represented via an ultrametric tree or a Parisi matrix.
   Secondly, it has a built-in mechanism for self-correcting clustering
   membership across different tree levels. We have compared the trees
   generated with this new algorithm to equivalent trees derived with the
   standard Hierarchical Clustering method on simulated as well as real
   data clouds from fMRI brain connectivity studies, cancer genomics,
   giraffe social networks, and Lewis Carroll's Doublets network. In each
   of these cases, we have shown that the DCG trees are more robust and
   less sensitive to measurement errors, and that they provide a better
   quantification of the multi-scale geometric structures of the data. As
   such, DCG-tree is an effective tool for analyzing complex biological
   data sets.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Both situational (e.g., perceived power) and sustained social factors
   (e.g., cultural stereotypes) are known to affect how people academically
   perform, particularly in the domain of mathematics. the ability to
   compute even simple mathematics, such as addition, relies on distinct
   neural circuitry within the inferior parietal and inferior frontal
   lobes, brain regions where magnitude representation and addition are
   performed. Despite prior behavioral evidence of social influence on
   academic performance, little is known about whether or not temporarily
   heightening a person's sense of power may influence the neural bases of
   math calculation. Here we primed female participants with either high or
   low power (LP) and then measured neural response while they performed
   exact and approximate math problems. We fond that priming power affected
   math performance; specifically, females primed with high power (HP)
   performed better on approximate math calculation compared to females
   primed with LP. Furthermore, neural response within the left inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG), a regions previously associated with cognitive
   interference, was reduced for females in the HP compared to LP group.
   Taken together, these results indicate that even temporarily heightening
   a person's sense of social power can increase their math performance,
   possibly by reducing cognitive interference during math performance.}},

Title = {{Binding in Haptics: Integration of ``What{''} and ``Where{''}
   Information in Working Memory for Active Touch}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Information about the identity and the location of perceptual objects
   can be automatically integrated in perception and working memory (WM).
   Contrasting results in visual and auditory WM studies indicate that the
   characteristics of feature-to-location binding can vary according to the
   sensory modality of the input. The present study provides first evidence
   of binding between ``what{''} and ``where{''} information in WM for
   haptic stimuli. In an old-new recognition task, blindfolded participants
   were presented in their peripersonal space with sequences of three
   haptic stimuli varying in texture and location. They were then required
   to judge if a single probe stimulus was previously included in the
   sequence. Recall was measured both in a condition in which both texture
   and location were relevant for the task (Experiment 1) and in two
   conditions where only one feature had to be recalled (Experiment 2).
   Results showed that when both features were task-relevant, even if the
   association of location and texture was neither necessary nor required
   to perform the task, participants exhibited a recall advantage in
   conditions in which the location and the texture of the target probe was
   kept unaltered between encoding and recall. By contrast, when only one
   feature was task-relevant, the concurrent feature did not influence the
   recall of the target feature. We conclude that attention to feature
   binding is not necessary for the emergence of feature integration in
   haptic WM. For binding to take place, however, it is necessary to encode
   and maintain in memory both the identity and the location of items.}},

Title = {{When Pinocchio's nose does not grow: belief regarding lie-detectability
   modulates production of deception}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 4}},
Abstract = {{Does the brain activity underlying the production of deception differ
   depending on whether or not one believes their deception can be
   detected? To address this question, we had participants commit a mock
   theft in a laboratory setting, and then interrogated them while they
   underwent functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. Crucially, during some parts
   of the interrogation participants believed a lie-detector was activated,
   whereas in other parts they were told it was switched-off. We were thus
   able to examine the neural activity associated with the contrast between
   producing true vs. false claims, as well as the independent contrast
   between believing that deception could and could not be detected. We
   found increased activation in the right amygdala and inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG), as well as the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),
   during the production of false (compared to true) claims. Importantly,
   there was a significant interaction between the effects of deception and
   belief in the left temporal pole and right hippocampus/parahippocampal
   gyrus, where activity increased during the production of deception when
   participants believed their false claims could be detected, but not when
   they believed the lie-detector was switched-off. As these regions are
   associated with binding socially complex perceptual input and memory
   retrieval, we conclude that producing deceptive behavior in a context in
   which one believes this deception can be detected is associated with a
   cognitively taxing effort to reconcile contradictions between one's
   actions and recollections.}},

Abstract = {{Psychobiological accounts of face processing predict that greater
   salience is attributed to faces matching a viewer's sexual preference
   than to faces that do not. However, behaviorally, this effect could only
   be demonstrated in tasks assessing reward `wanting' (e.g.
   work-per-view-tasks) but not in tasks assessing `liking' (e.g. facial
   attractiveness ratings), and has been found to be more pronounced in
   heterosexual men than women, especially with regard to very attractive
   faces. Here, we addressed the question if sex differences at the level
   of `wanting' persist if participants are uninformed about the
   attractiveness of an anticipated male or female face. Seventeen
   heterosexual men and 13 heterosexual women (all single) participated in
   a social incentive delay task (SID). Participants were required to react
   on simple graphical cues in order to view a smiling face. Cues provided
   a priori information on the level of smile intensity (low/medium/high)
   as well as sex of the face (male/female). A significant interaction of
   sex-of-face and sex-of-participant was observed in a priori defined
   regions of interest in the brain reward system (including ventral
   tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex),
   reflecting enhanced activation to cues signaling opposite-sex faces
   relative to same-sex faces in both, men and women. Women additionally
   recruited the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) during processing of
   opposite- vs. same-sex cues, suggesting stronger incorporation of social
   cognition processes in women than men. The findings speak against a
   general male bias for opposite-sex faces. Instead they provide
   preliminary evidence that men and women recruit different brain circuits
   during reward value assessment of facial stimuli. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Animal models of predator defense distinguish qualitatively different
   behavioral modes that are activated at increasing levels of predation
   threat. A defense mode observed at intermediate threat levels is
   freezing: a cessation of locomotion that is characterized by a
   parasympathetically dominated autonomic nervous system response that
   causes heart rate deceleration, or fear bradycardia. Studies in rodents
   have shown that freezing depends on amygdalar projections to the
   periaqueductal grey (PAG). In humans, freezing-like behaviors are
   implicated in development and maintenance of psychopathology, but neural
   mechanisms underlying freezing or its characteristic autonomic response
   profile have not been identified. Here, we combined event-related blood
   oxygenation level-dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) with autonomic
   response measures in a picture viewing paradigm to probe activity and
   interconnectivity within the amygdala-PAG pathway and test for an
   association with parasympathetic as opposed to sympathetic activation.
   In response to negatively arousing pictures, we observed parasympathetic
   (bradycardia) and sympathetic (pupil dilation) autonomic responses, BOLD
   responses in the amygdala and PAG, and effective connectivity between
   these regions. Critically, BOLD responses in the PAG to negative
   pictures correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with bradycardia but not
   pupil dilation. This correlation with bradycardia remained significant
   when partialling out pupil dilation. Additionally, activity in regions
   associated with motor planning and inhibition mirrored the PAG response.
   Thus, our findings implicate the human PAG in a parasympathetically
   dominated defense mode that subserves a state of attentive immobility.
   Mechanistic insight into this qualitatively distinct defense mode may
   importantly advance translational models of anxiety disorders. (C) 2012

Title = {{fMRI reveals reciprocal inhibition between social and physical cognitive

Abstract = {{Two lines of evidence indicate that there exists a reciprocal inhibitory
   relationship between opposed brain networks. First, most
   attention-demanding cognitive tasks activate a stereotypical set of
   brain areas, known as the task-positive network and simultaneously
   deactivate a different set of brain regions, commonly referred to as the
   task negative or default mode network. Second, functional connectivity
   analyses show that these same opposed networks are anti-correlated in
   the resting state. We hypothesize that these reciprocally inhibitory
   effects reflect two incompatible cognitive modes, each of which may be
   directed towards understanding the external world. Thus, engaging one
   mode activates one set of regions and suppresses activity in the other.
   We test this hypothesis by identifying two types of problem-solving task
   which, on the basis of prior work, have been consistently associated
   with the task positive and task negative regions: tasks requiring social
   cognition, i.e., reasoning about the mental states of other persons, and
   tasks requiring physical cognition, i.e., reasoning about the
   causal/mechanical properties of inanimate objects. Social and mechanical
   reasoning tasks were presented to neurologically normal participants
   during fMRI. Each task type was presented using both text and video
   clips. Regardless of presentation modality, we observed clear evidence
   of reciprocal suppression: social tasks deactivated regions associated
   with mechanical reasoning and mechanical tasks deactivated regions
   associated with social reasoning. These findings are not explained by
   self-referential processes, task engagement, mental simulation, mental
   time travel or external vs. internal attention, all factors previously
   hypothesized to explain default mode network activity. Analyses of
   resting state data revealed a close match between the regions our tasks
   identified as reciprocally inhibitory and regions of maximal
   anti-correlation in the resting state. These results indicate the
   reciprocal inhibition is not attributable to constraints inherent in the
   tasks, but is neural in origin. Hence, there is a physiological
   constraint on our ability to simultaneously engage two distinct
   cognitive modes. Further work is needed to more precisely characterize
   these opposing cognitive domains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Dissimilar processing of emotional facial expressions in human and

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{402-411}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Emotional facial expressions play an important role in social
   communication across primates. Despite major progress made in our
   understanding of categorical information processing such as for objects
   and faces, little is known, however, about how the primate brain evolved
   to process emotional cues. In this study, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the processing of emotional facial
   expressions between monkeys and humans. We used a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial
   design with species (human and monkey), expression (fear and chewing)
   and configuration (intact versus scrambled) as factors. At the whole
   brain level, neural responses to conspecific emotional expressions were
   anatomically confined to the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in humans.
   Within the human STS, we found functional subdivisions with a
   face-selective right posterior STS area that also responded to emotional
   expressions of other species and a more anterior area in the right
   middle STS that responded specifically to human emotions. Hence, we
   argue that the latter region does not show a mere emotion-dependent
   modulation of activity but is primarily driven by human emotional facial
   expressions. Conversely, in monkeys, emotional responses appeared in
   earlier visual cortex and outside face-selective regions in inferior
   temporal cortex that responded also to multiple visual categories.
   Within monkey IT, we also found areas that were more responsive to
   conspecific than to non-conspecific emotional expressions but these
   responses were not as specific as in human middle STS. Overall, our
   results indicate that human STS may have developed unique properties to
   deal with social cues such as emotional expressions. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Title = {{The neural mechanisms of semantic and response conflicts: An fMRI study
   of practice-related effects in the Stroop task}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{577-584}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have demonstrated that there are separate neural
   mechanisms underlying semantic and response conflicts in the Stroop
   task. However, the practice effects of these conflicts need to be
   elucidated and the possible involvements of common neural mechanisms are
   yet to be established. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) in a 4-2 mapping practice-related Stroop task to determine the
   neural substrates under these conflicts. Results showed that different
   patterns of brain activations are associated with practice in the
   attentional networks (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC),
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and posterior parietal cortex (PPC))
   for both conflicts, response control regions (e.g., inferior frontal
   junction (IFJ), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)/insula, and
   pre-supplementary motor areas (pre-SMA)) for semantic conflict, and
   posterior cortex for response conflict. We also found areas of common
   activation in the left hemisphere within the attentional networks, for
   the early practice stage in semantic conflict and the late stage in
   ``pure{''} response conflict using conjunction analysis. The different
   practice effects indicate that there are distinct mechanisms underlying
   these two conflict types: semantic conflict practice effects are
   attributable to the automation of stimulus processing, conflict and
   response control; response conflict practice effects are attributable to
   the proportional increase of conflict-related cognitive resources. In
   addition, the areas of common activation suggest that the semantic
   conflict effect may contain a partial response conflict effect,
   particularly at the beginning of the task. These findings indicate that
   there are two kinds of response conflicts contained in the key-pressing
   Stroop task: the vocal-level (mainly in the early stage) and
   key-pressing (mainly in the late stage) response conflicts; thus, the
   use of the subtraction method for the exploration of semantic and
   response conflicts may need to be further examined. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Suggestions of limb paralysis in highly hypnotically suggestible
   subjects have been employed to successfully model conversion disorders,
   revealing similar patterns of brain activation associated with attempted
   movement of the affected limb. However, previous studies differ with
   regard to the executive regions involved during involuntary inhibition
   of the affected limb. This difference may have arisen as previous
   studies did not control for differences in hypnosis depth between
   conditions and/or include subjective measures to explore the experience
   of suggested paralysis. In the current study we employed functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the functional anatomy of
   left and right upper limb movements in eight healthy subjects selected
   for high hypnotic suggestibility during (i) hypnosis (NORMAL) and (ii)
   attempted movement following additional left upper limb paralysis
   suggestions (PARALYSIS). Contrast of left upper limb motor function
   during NORMAL relative to PARALYSIS conditions revealed greater
   activation of contralateral M1/S1 and ipsilateral cerebellum, consistent
   with the engagement of these regions in the completion of movements. By
   contrast, two significant observations were noted in PARALYSIS relative
   to NORMAL conditions. In conjunction with reports of attempts to move
   the paralysed limb, greater supplementary motor area (SMA) activation
   was observed, a finding consistent with the role of SMA in motor
   intention and planning. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, BA 24) was
   also significantly more active in PARALYSIS relative to NORMAL
   conditions - suggesting that ACC (BA 24) may be implicated in
   involuntary, as well as voluntary inhibition of prepotent motor
   responses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroplastic changes that take place in the brain after sustaining a
   spinal cord injury have generally been studied encompassing various
   post-injury time periods, sometimes ranging from just a few days to many
   years. Although research on the low-end of this time spectrum has
   established that neuroplastic changes can be detected shortly after
   trauma, electroencephalographic changes that take place in long-term
   injuries are still poorly defined. To investigate this, the present
   study recorded the movement-related brain potentials from 9 long
   suffering spinal cord injury patients (post-injury range 6-24 years,
   mean 14.63; age range 27-44 years, mean 36.78) while they were
   attempting to move their paralysed toes. Their data were compared with
   the data of similar age and same sex spinal intact participants; 10 of
   whom only prepared for action and 10 others who actually executed the
   movement The results showed that the amplitudes of the readiness
   potential and motor potential were lower in the spinal cord injury group
   than in the movement control group. The topographic distribution of the
   motor potential was also more similar between the spinal cord injury
   group and the no-movement control group, whereas that of the readiness
   potential was more similar between the spinal cord injury group and the
   movement control group. These findings suggest that both motor
   preparatory processes and motor execution processes are affected by
   neuroplastic changes that take place in the brain of long suffering
   spinal cord injury patients. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum
   Disorder (ASD) are often comorbid and share behavioural-cognitive
   abnormalities in sustained attention. A key question is whether this
   shared cognitive phenotype is based on common or different underlying
   pathophysiologies. To elucidate this question, we compared 20 boys with
   ADHD to 20 age and IQ matched ASD and 20 healthy boys using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a parametrically modulated
   vigilance task with a progressively increasing load of sustained
   attention. ADHD and ASD boys had significantly reduced activation
   relative to controls in bilateral striato-thalamic regions, left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and superior parietal cortex.
   Both groups also displayed significantly increased precuneus activation
   relative to controls. Precuneus was negatively correlated with the DLPFC
   activation, and progressively more deactivated with increasing attention
   load in controls, but not patients, suggesting problems with
   deactivation of a task-related default mode network in both disorders.
   However, left DLPFC underactivation was significantly more pronounced in
   ADHD relative to ASD boys, which furthermore was associated with
   sustained performance measures that were only impaired in ADHD patients.
   ASD boys, on the other hand, had disorder-specific enhanced cerebellar
   activation relative to both ADHD and control boys, presumably reflecting
   compensation. The findings show that ADHD and ASD boys have both shared
   and disorder-specific abnormalities in brain function during sustained
   attention. Shared deficits were in fronto-striato-parietal activation
   and default mode suppression. Differences were a more severe DLPFC
   dysfunction in ADHD and a disorder-specific fronto-striato-cerebellar
   dysregulation in ASD. Molecular Psychiatry (2013) 18, 236-244;

Title = {{Access to lexical meaning in pitch-flattened Chinese sentences: An fMRI

Abstract = {{Chinese is a tonal language in which variation in pitch is used to
   distinguish word meanings. Thus, in order to understand a word,
   listeners have to extract the pitch patterns in addition to its
   phonemes. Can the correct word meaning still be accessed in sentence
   contexts if pitch patterns of words are altered? If so, how is this
   accomplished? The present study attempts to address such questions with
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Native
   speakers of Mandarin Chinese listened to normal and pitch-flattened
   (monotone) speech inside the scanner. The behavioral results indicated
   that they rated monotone sentences as intelligible as normal sentences,
   and performed equally well in a dictation test on the two types of
   sentences. The fMRI results showed that both types of sentences elicited
   similar activation in the left insular, middle and inferior temporal
   gyri, but the monotone sentences elicited greater activation in the left
   planum temporale (PT) compared with normal sentences. These results
   demonstrate that lexical meaning can still be accessed in
   pitch-flattened Chinese sentences, and that this process is realized by
   automatic recovery of the phonological representations of lexical tones
   from the altered tonal patterns. Our findings suggest that the details
   of spoken pitch patterns are not essential for adequate lexical-semantic
   processing during sentence comprehension even in tonal languages like
   Mandarin Chinese, given that listeners can automatically use additional
   neural and cognitive resources to recover distorted tonal patterns in
   sentences. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on culture-related differences in cognition have shown that
   Westerners attend more to object-related information, whereas East
   Asians attend more to contextual information. Neural correlates of these
   different culture-related visual processing styles have been reported in
   the ventral-visual and fronto-parietal regions. We conducted an fMRI
   study of East Asians and Westerners on a visuospatial judgment task that
   involved relative, contextual judgments, which are typically more
   challenging for Westerners. Participants judged the relative distances
   between a dot and a line in visual stimuli during task blocks and
   alternated finger presses during control blocks. Behaviorally, East
   Asians responded faster than Westerners, reflecting greater ease of the
   task for East Asians. In response to the greater task difficulty,
   Westerners showed greater neural engagement compared to East Asians in
   frontal, parietal, and occipital areas. Moreover, Westerners also showed
   greater suppression of the default network-a brain network that is
   suppressed under condition of high cognitive challenge. This study
   demonstrates for the first time that cultural differences in visual
   attention during a cognitive task are manifested both by differences in
   activation in fronto-parietal regions as well as suppression in default
   regions.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{151-157}},

Abstract = {{Converging behavioral evidence suggests that people respond to
   experiences of social exclusion with both defensive and affiliative
   strategies, allowing them to avoid further distress while also
   encouraging re-establishment of positive social connections. However,
   there are unresolved questions regarding the cognitive mechanisms
   underlying people's responses to social exclusion. Here, we sought to
   gain insight into these behavioral tendencies by using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the impact of social
   exclusion on neural responses to visual scenes that varied on dimensions
   of sociality and emotional valence. Compared to socially included
   participants, socially excluded participants failed to recruit
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), a brain region involved in
   mentalizing, for negative social scenes. Moreover, following social
   exclusion, dmPFC demonstrated a linear effect of valence, with greater
   activity to positive social scenes compared to negative social scenes.
   These results suggest that, following social exclusion, people display a
   preference for mentalizing about positive social information and tend to
   avoid negative aspects of their social world.}},

Abstract = {{Disgust for contaminating objects (core disgust), immoral behaviors
   (moral disgust) and unsavory others (interpersonal disgust), have been
   assumed to be closely related. It is not clear, however, whether
   different forms of disgust are mediated by overlapping or specific
   neural substrates. We report that 10 patients with damage to the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) avoided behaviors that normally
   elicit interpersonal disgust (e. g. using the scarf of a busker) less
   frequently than healthy and brain-damaged controls, whereas they avoided
   core and moral disgust elicitors at normal rates. These results indicate
   that different forms of disgust are dissociated neurally. We propose
   that the vmPFC is causally (and selectively) involved in mediating
   interpersonal disgust, shaping patterns of social avoidance and

Abstract = {{Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with impaired memory
   performance coupled with functional changes in brain areas involved in
   declarative memory and emotion regulation. It is not yet clear how
   symptom severity and comorbidity affect neurocognitive functioning in
   PTSD. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study
   with an emotional declarative memory task in 28 Complex PTSD patients
   with comorbid depressive and personality disorders, and 21 healthy
   non-trauma-exposed controls. In Complex PTSD patients-compared to
   controls-encoding of later remembered negative words vs baseline was
   associated with increased blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
   response in the left ventral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsal
   ACC extending to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) together with
   a trend for increased left hippocampus activation. Patients tended to
   commit more False Alarms to negative words compared to controls, which
   was associated with enhanced left ventrolateral prefrontal and
   orbitofrontal cortex (vlPFC/OFC) responses. Severity of child abuse was
   positively correlated with left ventral ACC activity and severity of
   depression with (para) hippocampal and ventral ACC activity. Presented
   results demonstrate functional abnormalities in Complex PTSD in the
   frontolimbic brain circuit also implicated in fear conditioning models,
   but generally in the opposite direction, which may be explained by
   severity of the trauma and severity of comorbid depression in Complex
   PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{Empathic decision-making involves making choices on behalf of others in
   order to maximize their well-being. Examples include the choices that
   parents make for their children, as well as the decisions of a
   politician trying to make good choices on behalf of his constituency. We
   investigated the neurobiological and computational basis of empathic
   choice using a human fMRI task in which subjects purchased DVDs for
   themselves with their own money, or DVDs for others with the other's
   money. We found that empathic choices engage the same regions of
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex that are known to compute stimulus
   values, and that these value signals were modulated by activity from a
   region of inferior parietal lobule (IPL) known to play a critical role
   in social processes such as empathy. We also found that the stimulus
   value signals used to make empathic choices were computed using a
   mixture of self-simulation and other-simulation processes, and that
   activity in IPL encoded a variable measuring the distance between the
   other's and self preferences, which provides a hint for how the mixture
   of self-and other-simulation might be implemented.}},

Abstract = {{The motives underlying prosocial behavior, like charitable donations,
   can be related either to actions or to outcomes. To address the neural
   basis of outcome orientation in charitable giving, we asked 33 subjects
   to make choices affecting their own payoffs and payoffs to a charity
   organization, while being scanned by functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). We experimentally induced a reward prediction error
   (RPE) by subsequently discarding some of the chosen outcomes.
   Co-localized to a nucleus accumbens BOLD signal corresponding to the RPE
   for the subject's own payoff, we observed an equivalent RPE signal for
   the charity's payoff in those subjects who were willing to donate. This
   unique demonstration of a neuronal RPE signal for outcomes exclusively
   affecting unrelated others indicates common brain processes during
   outcome evaluation for selfish, individual and nonselfish, social
   rewards and strongly suggests the effectiveness of outcome-oriented
   motives in charitable giving.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence indicates that a sexually dimorphic feature of humans,
   the facial width-to-height ratio (FWHR), is positively correlated with
   reactive aggression, particularly in men. Also, predictions about the
   aggressive tendencies of others faithfully map onto FWHR in the absence
   of explicit awareness of this metric. Here, we provide the first
   evidence that amygdala reactivity to social signals of interpersonal
   challenge may underlie the link between aggression and the FWHR.
   Specifically, amygdala reactivity to angry faces was positively
   correlated with aggression, but only among men with relatively large
   FWHRs. The patterns of association were specific to angry facial
   expressions and unique to men. These links may reflect the common
   influence of pubertal testosterone on craniofacial growth and
   development of neural circuitry underlying aggression. Amygdala
   reactivity may also represent a plausible pathway through which FWHR may
   have evolved to represent an honest indicator of conspecific threat,
   namely by reflecting the responsiveness of neural circuitry mediating
   aggressive behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary computational accounts of instrumental conditioning have
   emphasized a role for a model-based system in which values are computed
   with reference to a rich model of the structure of the world, and a
   model-free system in which values are updated without encoding such
   structure. Much less studied is the possibility of a similar distinction
   operating at the level of Pavlovian conditioning. In the present study,
   we scanned human participants while they participated in a Pavlovian
   conditioning task with a simple structure while measuring activity in
   the human amygdala using a high-resolution fMRI protocol. After fitting
   a model-based algorithm and a variety of model-free algorithms to the
   fMRI data, we found evidence for the superiority of a model-based
   algorithm in accounting for activity in the amygdala compared to the
   model-free counterparts. These findings support an important role for
   model-based algorithms in describing the processes underpinning
   Pavlovian conditioning, as well as providing evidence of a role for the
   human amygdala in model-based inference.}},

Abstract = {{Hypersexuality with compulsive sexual behaviour is a significant source
   of morbidity for patients with Parkinson's disease receiving dopamine
   replacement therapies. We know relatively little about the
   pathophysiology of hypersexuality in Parkinson's disease, and it is
   unknown how visual sexual stimuli, similar to the portrayals of
   sexuality in the mainstream mass media may affect the brain and
   behaviour in such susceptible individuals. Here, we have studied a group
   of 12 patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality using a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging block design exposing participants
   to both sexual, other reward-related and neutral visual cues. We
   hypothesized that exposure to visual sexual cues would trigger increased
   sexual desire in patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality
   that would correspond to changes in brain activity in regions linked to
   dopaminergically stimulated sexual motivation. Patients with Parkinson's
   disease with hypersexuality were scanned ON and OFF dopamine drugs, and
   their results were compared with a group of 12 Parkinson's disease
   control patients without hypersexuality or other impulse control
   disorders. Exposure to sexual cues significantly increased sexual desire
   and hedonic responses in the Parkinson's disease hypersexuality group
   compared with the Parkinson's disease control patients. These
   behavioural changes corresponded to significant blood oxygen
   level-dependent signal changes in regions within limbic, paralimbic,
   temporal, occipital, somatosensory and prefrontal cortices that
   correspond to emotional, cognitive, autonomic, visual and motivational
   processes. The functional imaging data showed that the hypersexuality
   patients' increased sexual desire correlated with enhanced activations
   in the ventral striatum, and cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices. When
   the patients with Parkinson's disease with hypersexuality were OFF
   medication, the functional imaging data showed decreases in activation
   during the presentation of sexual cues relative to rest. These
   deactivations were not observed when the patients were ON medication,
   suggesting that dopamine drugs may release inhibition within local
   neuronal circuits in the cerebral cortex that may contribute to
   compulsive sexual behaviour. The findings of this study have
   implications with respect to the potential influence of cue exposure via
   exposure to mass media in enhancing libido, which in this group of
   vulnerable patients can lead to devastating social consequences and
   occasionally, custodial sentences. Stimulation through exposure to
   sexual visual cues in patients with Parkinson's disease with
   hypersexuality provides a motivational impetus for seeking this reward
   behaviour through activations and deactivations of cerebral cortex.}},

Abstract = {{One goal of social science in general, and of psychology in particular,
   is to understand and predict human behavior. Psychologists have
   traditionally used self-report measures and performance on laboratory
   tasks to achieve this end. However, these measures are limited in their
   ability to predict behavior in certain contexts. We argue that current
   neuroscientific knowledge has reached a point where it can complement
   other existing psychological measures in predicting behavior and other
   important outcomes. This brain-as-predictor approach integrates
   traditional neuroimaging methods with measures of behavioral outcomes
   that extend beyond the immediate experimental session. Previously, most
   neuroimaging experiments focused on understanding basic psychological
   processes that could be directly observed in the laboratory. However,
   recent experiments have demonstrated that brain measures can predict
   outcomes (e.g., purchasing decisions, clinical outcomes) over longer
   timescales in ways that go beyond what was previously possible with
   self-report data alone. This approach can be used to reveal the
   connections between neural activity in laboratory contexts and
   longer-term, ecologically valid outcomes. We describe this approach and
   discuss its potential theoretical implications. We also review recent
   examples of studies that have used this approach, discuss methodological
   considerations, and provide specific guidelines for using it in future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the so-called ``social brain,{''} we need to
   monitor social interactions in face-to-face paradigms. Near-infrared
   spectroscopy (NIRS) is a promising technique to achieve this goal. We
   investigate the neuronal underpinnings of sharing a task in a proper
   social context. We record cortical activity by means of NIRS, while
   participants perform a joint Simon task. Different from other
   hemodynamic techniques, NIRS allows us to have both participants sit
   comfortably close to each other in a realistic and ecological
   environment. We found higher activation in the sensorimotor cortex while
   processing compatible trials as compared to incompatible ones referring
   to one's own action alternative. Strikingly, when the participant was
   not responding because it was the turn of the other member of the pair,
   the inferior parietal was activated. This study provides twofold
   findings: first, they suggest that the joint Simon effect relies more on
   shared attentional mechanisms than a proper mapping of the other's motor
   response. Second, they highlight the invaluable contribution NIRS can
   afford to social neuroscience in order to preserve ecological and
   naturalistic settings. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests the anterior temporal lobe( ATL) plays an important
   role in person identification and memory. In humans, neuroimaging
   studies of person memory report consistent activations in the ATL to
   famous and personally familiar faces and studies of patients report
   resection or damage of the ATL causes an associative prosopagnosia in
   which face perception is intact but face memory is compromised. In
   addition, high-resolution fMRI studies of non-human primates and
   electrophysiological studies of humans also suggest regions of the
   ventral ATL are sensitive to novel faces. The current study extends
   previous findings by investigating whether similar subregions in the
   dorsal, ventral, lateral, or polar aspects of the ATL are sensitive to
   personality familiar, famous, and novel faces. We present the results of
   two studies of person memory: a meta-analysis of exiting fMRI studies
   and an empirical fMRI study using optimized imaging parameters. Both
   studies showed left-lateralized ATL activations to familiar individuals
   while novel faces activated the right ATL. Activations to famous faces
   were quite ventral, similar to what has been reported in previous
   high-resolution fMRI studies of non-human primates. These findings
   suggest that face memory-sensitive patches in the human ATL are in the
   ventral/polar ATL.}},

Abstract = {{People with schizophrenia exhibit impaired social cognitive functions,
   particularly emotion regulation. Abnormal activations of the ventral
   medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) during emotional tasks have been
   demonstrated in schizophrenia, suggesting its important role in emotion
   processing in patients. We used the resting-state functional
   connectivity approach, setting a functionally relevant region, the
   vMPFC, as a seed region to examine the intrinsic functional interactions
   and communication between the vMPFC and other brain regions in
   schizophrenic patients. We found hypo-connectivity between the vMPFC and
   the medial frontal cortex, right middle temporal lobe (MTL), right
   hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and amygdala. Further, there
   was a decreased strength of the negative connectivity (or
   anticorrelation) between the vMPFC and the bilateral dorsal lateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and pre-supplementary motor areas. Among these
   connectivity alterations, reduced vMPFC-DLPFC connectivity was
   positively correlated with positive symptoms on the Positive and
   Negative Syndrome Scale, while vMPFC-right MTL/PHC/amygdala functional
   connectivity was positively correlated with the performance of emotional
   regulation in patients. These findings imply that communication and
   coordination throughout the brain networks are disrupted in
   schizophrenia. The emotional correlates of vMPFC connectivity suggest a
   role of the hypo-connectivity between these regions in the
   neuropathology of abnormal social cognition in chronic schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Previous work investigating deficits in self-appraisal in
   behavioural-variant frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD) has focused on a
   single domain: social/behavioural processes. We examined whether a
   domain-specific versus multi-domain model best explains degraded
   self-appraisal in bvFTD.
   Methods 49 patients with bvFTD and 73 patients with Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) were administered quantitative assessments of episodic memory,
   naming and grammatical comprehension. Self-appraisal of cognitive test
   performance was assessed by asking patients to rate their performance
   immediately after completing each neuropsychological test. A discrepancy
   score was created to reflect the difference between patient performance
   on neuropsychological tests and self-appraisal of their test
   performance. Self-appraisal for each neuropsychological measure was
   related to grey matter (GM) density in each group using voxel-based
   morphometry.
   Results bvFTD patients were poor at evaluating their own performance on
   all cognitive tests, with no significant correlations between
   self-appraisal and actual performance. By contrast, poor self-appraisal
   in AD was restricted to episodic memory performance. Poor self-appraisal
   on each task in bvFTD and AD was related to reduced GM density in
   several ventral and rostral medial prefrontal regions. Crucially, poor
   self-appraisal for all domains in bvFTD was related to a specific area
   of reduced GM density in the subgenual cingulate (BA 25).
   Conclusion Poor self-appraisal in bvFTD affects multiple domains, and
   this multi-domain impairment pattern is associated with frontal disease
   in the subgenual cingulate.}},

Abstract = {{Variation at a single nucleotide polymorphism in the mu-opioid receptor
   gene (OPRM I), Al 18G (Asn40Asp), may moderate naltrexone (NTX) effects
   in alcohol dependence. Both NTX and Al 18G variation have also been
   reported to affect alcohol cue-elicited brain activation. This study
   investigated whether sub-acute NTX treatment and Al 18G genotype
   interacted in their effects on cue-elicited activation of the ventral
   striatum (VS), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and orbitofrontal cortex
   (OFC). Secondarily, variation at a variable number tandem repeat
   polymorphism in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT I/SLC6A3), which has
   been associated with increased reward-related activation in VS, was
   analyzed as a moderator of medication and Al 18G effects. Seventy-four
   non-treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent individuals, half preselected to
   carry at least one copy of the Al 18G G (Asp) allele, were randomized to
   NTX (50 mg) or placebo for 7 days, and performed an fMRI alcohol cue
   reactivity task on day 6. Region-of-interest analyses indicated no main
   effects of medication or Al 18G genotype. However, these factors
   interacted in their effects on OFC activation, such that, among
   NTX-treated individuals, G-allele carriers had less activation than
   A-allele homozygotes. DAT I variation also moderated medication/Al 18G
   effects. There was a three-way interaction between medication and Al 18G
   and DAT I genotypes on VS activation, such that, among G-allele carriers
   who received NTX, DATI 10-repeat-allele (10R) homozygotes had less
   activation than 9-repeat-allele (9R) carriers. Further, IOR homozygotes
   who received NIX had less mPFC activation than 9R carriers. Polymorphic
   variation in OPRM I and DATI should be considered in future studies of
   NTX, particularly regarding its effects on reward processing.

Abstract = {{Objectives. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence
   of concurrently presented emotional stimuli on cognitive task processing
   in violent criminal offenders primarily characterized by affective
   instability. Methods. Fifteen male criminal offenders with antisocial
   and borderline personality disorder (ASPD and BPD) and 17 healthy
   controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while
   performing a working memory task with low and high working memory load.
   In a second experimental run, to investigate the interaction of emotion
   and cognition, we presented emotionally neutral, low, or high salient
   social scenes in the background of the task. Results. During the memory
   task without pictures, both groups did not differ in general task
   performance and neural representation of working memory processes.
   During the memory task with emotional background pictures, however,
   ASPD-BPD subjects compared to healthy controls showed delayed responses
   and enhanced activation of the left amygdala in the presence of
   emotionally high salient pictures independent of working memory load.
   Conclusions. These results illustrate an interaction of emotion and
   cognition in affective instable individuals with enhanced reactivity to
   emotionally salient stimuli which might be an important factor regarding
   the understanding of aggressive and violent behaviour in these
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation strategies provide a means by which to modulate our
   social behavior. In this study, we investigated the effect of using
   reappraisal to both up- and downregulate social decision making. After
   being instructed on how to use reappraisal, participants played the
   Ultimatum Game while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging
   and applied the strategies of upregulation (reappraising the proposer's
   intentions as more negative), down-regulation (reappraising the
   proposer's intentions as less negative), as well as a baseline
   ``look{''} condition. As hypothesized, when reappraising, decision
   acceptance rates were altered, with a greater number of unfair offers
   accepted while down-regulating and a greater number of unfair offers
   rejected while upregulating, both relative to the baseline condition. At
   the neural level, during reappraisal, significant activations were
   observed in the inferior and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), in addition to
   the medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus for unfair offers only.
   Regulated decisions involved left inferior frontal gyrus for
   upregulation and MFG for down-regulation strategies, respectively.
   Importantly, the effects of emotion modulation were evident in posterior
   insula, with less activation for down-regulation and more activation for
   upregulation in these areas. Notably, we show for the first time that
   top-down strategies such as reappraisal strongly affect our
   socioeconomic decisions.}},

Journal = {{HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{467-486}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Linking observed and executable actions appears to be achieved by an
   action observation network (AON), comprising parietal, premotor, and
   occipitotemporal cortical regions of the human brain. AON engagement
   during action observation is thought to aid in effortless, efficient
   prediction of ongoing movements to support action understanding. Here,
   we investigate how the AON responds when observing and predicting
   actions we cannot readily reproduce before and after visual training.
   During pre- and posttraining neuroimaging sessions, participants watched
   gymnasts and wind-up toys moving behind an occluder and pressed a button
   when they expected each agent to reappear. Between scanning sessions,
   participants visually trained to predict when a subset of stimuli would
   reappear. Posttraining scanning revealed activation of inferior
   parietal, superior temporal, and cerebellar cortices when predicting
   occluded actions compared to perceiving them. Greater activity emerged
   when predicting untrained compared to trained sequences in
   occipitotemporal cortices and to a lesser degree, premotor cortices. The
   occipitotemporal responses when predicting untrained agents showed
   further specialization, with greater responses within body-processing
   regions when predicting gymnasts' movements and in object-selective
   cortex when predicting toys' movements. The results suggest that (1)
   select portions of the AON are recruited to predict the complex
   movements not easily mapped onto the observer's body and (2) greater
   recruitment of these AON regions supports prediction of less familiar
   sequences. We suggest that the findings inform both the premotor model
   of action prediction and the predictive coding account of AON function.

   Thirty-two youths viewed African American and European American faces

Abstract = {{The present study reports an exploration of the multi-dimensional space

   the affective responses to individual sound sources have often been
   described in terms of pleasantness and arousal (or vibrancy), so could
   the acoustic scenarios of urban life. However, different from previous
   research, the acoustic and psychoacoustic variables contributed very
   little to judgements about pleasantness and vibrancy. We surmise that
   the perceived quality of the soundscape is very much an individual
   subjective experience that is likely to be embedded within contextual
   domain and that it probably relates to personal preference, past history
   and other social and cultural factors. Crown Copyright (C) 2011

Title = {{Attribution of intentional causation influences the perception of
   observed movements: behavioral evidence and neural correlates}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{Recent research on human agency suggests that intentional causation is
   associated with a subjective compression in the temporal interval
   between actions and their effects. That is, intentional movements and
   their causal effects are perceived as closer together in time than
   equivalent unintentional movements and their causal effects. This
   so-called intentional binding effect is consistently found for one's own
   self-generated actions. It has also been suggested that intentional
   binding occurs when observing intentional movements of others. However,
   this evidence is undermined by limitations of the paradigm used. In the
   current study we aimed to overcome these limitations using a more
   rigorous design in combination with functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (fMRI) to explore the neural underpinnings of intentional
   binding of observed movements. In particular, we aimed to identify brain
   areas sensitive to the interaction between intentionality and causality
   attributed to the observed action. Our behavioral results confirmed the
   occurrence of intentional binding for observed movements using this more
   rigorous paradigm. Our fMRI results highlighted a collection of brain
   regions whose activity was sensitive to the interaction between
   intentionality and causation. Intriguingly, these brain regions have
   previously been implicated in the sense of agency over one's own
   movements. We discuss the implications of these results for intentional
   binding specifically, and the sense of agency more generally.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Face perception is critical for social communication. Given its
   fundamental importance in the course of evolution, the innate neural
   mechanisms can anticipate the computations necessary for representing
   faces. However, the effect of visual deprivation on the formation of
   neural mechanisms that underlie face perception is largely unknown. We
   previously showed that sighted individuals can recognize basic facial
   expressions by haptics surprisingly well. Moreover, the inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in the sighted
   subjects are involved in haptic and visual recognition of facial
   expressions. Here, we conducted both psychophysical and functional
   magnetic-resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to determine the nature of
   the neural representation that subserves the recognition of basic facial
   expressions in early blind individuals. In a psychophysical experiment,
   both early blind and sighted subjects haptically identified basic facial
   expressions at levels well above chance. In the subsequent fMRI
   experiment, both groups haptically identified facial expressions and
   shoe types (control). The sighted subjects then completed the same task
   visually. Within brain regions activated by the visual and haptic
   identification of facial expressions (relative to that of shoes) in the
   sighted group, corresponding haptic identification in the early blind
   activated regions in the inferior frontal and middle temporal gyri.
   These results suggest that the neural system that underlies the
   recognition of basic facial expressions develops supramodally even in
   the absence of early visual experience.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{1492}},

Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{This fMRI study examined recall and familiarity for words and scenes
   using the novel recognition without cued recall (RWCR) paradigm.
   Subjects performed a cued recall task in which half of the test cues
   resembled studied items (and thus were familiar) and half did not.
   Subjects also judged the familiarity of the cue itself. RWCR is the
   finding that, among cues for which recall fails, subjects generally rate
   cues that resemble studied items as more familiar than cues that do not.
   For words, left and right hippocampal activity increased when recall
   succeeded relative to when it failed. When recall failed, right
   hippocampal activity was decreased for familiar relative to unfamiliar
   cues. In contrast, right Prc activity increased for familiar cues for
   which recall failed relative to both familiar cues for which recall
   succeeded and to unfamiliar cues. For scenes, left hippocampal activity
   increased when recall succeeded relative to when it failed but did not
   differentiate familiar from unfamiliar cues when recall failed. In
   contrast, right Prc activity increased for familiar relative to
   unfamiliar cues when recall failed. Category-specific cortical regions
   showed effects unique to their respective stimulus types: The visual
   word form area (VWFA) showed effects for recall vs. familiarity specific
   to words, and the parahippocampal place area (PPA) showed effects for
   recall vs. familiarity specific to scenes. In both cases, these effects
   were such that there was increased activity occurring during recall
   relative to when recall failed, and decreased activity occurring for
   familiar relative to unfamiliar cues when recall failed. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Rewards in real life are rarely received without incurring costs and
   successful reward harvesting often involves weighing and minimizing
   different types of costs. In the natural environment, such costs often
   include the physical effort required to obtain rewards and potential
   risks attached to them. Costsmayalso include potential risks. In this
   study, we applied fMRI to explore the neural coding of physical effort
   costs as opposed to costs associated with risky rewards. Using an
   incentive-compatible valuation mechanism, we separately measured the
   subjective costs associated with effortful and risky options. As
   expected, subjective costs of options increased with both increasing
   effort and increasing risk. Despite the similar nature of behavioral
   discounting of effort and risk, distinct regions of the brain coded
   these two cost types separately, with anterior insula primarily
   processing risk costs and midcingulate and supplementary motor area
   (SMA) processing effort costs. To investigate integration of the two
   cost types, we also presented participants with options that combined
   effortful and risky elements. We found that the frontal pole integrates
   effort and risk costs through functional coupling with the SMA and
   insula. The degree to which the latter two regions influenced frontal
   pole activity correlated with participant-specific behavioral
   sensitivity to effort and risk costs. These data support the notion
   that, although physical effort costs may appear to be behaviorally
   similar to other types of costs, such as risk, they are treated
   separately at the neural level and are integrated only if there is a
   need to do so.}},

Title = {{Time Will Show: Real Time Predictions during Interpersonal Action
   Perception}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Predictive processes are crucial not only for interpreting the actions
   of individual agents, but also to predict how, in the context of a
   social interaction between two agents, the actions of one agent relate
   to the actions of a second agent. In the present study we investigated
   whether, in the context of a communicative interaction between two
   agents, observers can use the actions of one agent to predict when the
   action of a second agent will take place. Participants observed
   point-light displays of two agents (A and B) performing separate
   actions. In the communicative condition, the action performed by agent B
   responded to a communicative gesture performed by agent A. In the
   individual condition, agent A's communicative action was substituted
   with a non-communicative action. For each condition, we manipulated the
   temporal coupling of the actions of the two agents, by varying the onset
   of agent A's action. Using a simultaneous masking detection task, we
   demonstrated that the timing manipulation had a critical effect on the
   communicative condition, with the visual discrimination of agent B
   increasing linearly while approaching the original interaction timing.
   No effect of the timing manipulation was found for the individual
   condition. Our finding complements and extends previous evidence for
   interpersonal predictive coding, suggesting that the communicative
   gestures of one agent can serve not only to predict what the second
   agent will do, but also when his/her action will take place.}},

Title = {{Lateralized interactive social content and valence processing within the
   human amygdala}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 18}},
Abstract = {{In the past, the amygdala has generally been conceptualized as a
   fear-processing module. Recently, however, it has been proposed to
   respond to all stimuli that are relevant with respect to the current
   needs, goals, and values of an individual. This raises the question of
   whether the human amygdala may differentiate between separate kinds of
   relevance. A distinction between emotional (vs. neutral) and social (vs.
   non-social) relevance is supported by previous studies showing that the
   human amygdala preferentially responds to both emotionally and socially
   significant information, and these factors might even display
   interactive encoding properties. However, no investigation has yet
   probed a full 2 (positive vs. negative valence) x 2 (social vs.
   non-social content) processing pattern, with neutral images as an
   additional baseline. Applying such an extended orthogonal factorial
   design, our fMRI study demonstrates that the human amygdala is (1) more
   strongly activated for neutral social vs. non-social information, (2)
   activated at a similar level when viewing social positive or negative
   images, but (3) displays a valence effect (negative vs. positive) for
   non-social images. In addition, this encoding pattern is not influenced
   by cognitive or behavioral emotion regulation mechanisms, and displays a
   hemispheric lateralization with more pronounced effects on the right
   side. Finally, the same valence x social content interaction was found
   in three additional cortical regions, namely the right fusiform gyrus,
   right anterior superior temporal gyrus, and medial orbitofrontal cortex.
   Overall, these findings suggest that valence and social content
   processing represent distinct kinds of relevance that interact within
   the human amygdala as well as in a more extensive cortical network,
   likely subserving a key role in relevance detection.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 18}},
Abstract = {{In this note, we assess the predictive validity of stochastic dynamic
   causal modeling (sDCM) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   data, in terms of its ability to explain changes in the frequency
   spectrum of concurrently acquired electroencephalography (EEG) signal.
   We first revisit the heuristic model proposed in Kilner et al. (2005),
   which suggests that fMRI activation is associated with a frequency
   modulation of the EEG signal (rather than an amplitude modulation within
   frequency bands). We propose a quantitative derivation of the underlying
   idea, based upon a neural field formulation of cortical activity. In
   brief, dense lateral connections induce a separation of time scales,
   whereby fast (and high spatial frequency) modes are enslaved by slow
   (low spatial frequency) modes. This slaving effect is such that the
   frequency spectrum of fast modes (which dominate EEG signals) is
   controlled by the amplitude of slow modes (which dominate fMRI signals).
   We then use conjoint empirical EEG-fMRI data-acquired in epilepsy
   patients-to demonstrate the electrophysiological underpinning of neural
   fluctuations inferred from sDCM for fMRI.}},

Abstract = {{In social life actions are tightly linked with emotions. The integration
   of affective- and action-related information has to be considered as a
   fundamental component of appropriate social understanding. The present
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at investigating
   whether an emotion (Happiness, Anger or Neutral) dynamically expressed
   by an observed agent modulates brain activity underlying the perception
   of his grasping action. As control stimuli, participants observed the
   same agent either only expressing an emotion or only performing a
   grasping action. Our results showed that the observation of an action
   embedded in an emotional context (agent's facial expression), compared
   with the observation of the same action embedded in a neutral context,
   elicits higher neural response at the level of motor frontal cortices,
   temporal and occipital cortices, bilaterally. Particularly, the dynamic
   facial expression of anger modulates the re-enactment of a motor
   representation of the observed action. This is supported by the evidence
   that observing actions embedded in the context of anger, but not
   happiness, compared with a neutral context, elicits stronger activity in
   the bilateral pre-central gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus, besides the
   pre-supplementary motor area, a region playing a central role in motor
   control. Angry faces not only seem to modulate the simulation of
   actions, but may also trigger motor reaction. These findings suggest
   that emotions exert a modulatory role on action observation in different
   cortical areas involved in action processing.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by abnormal
   fear and anxiety in social situations. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) is a brain imaging technique that can be used to
   demonstrate neural activation to emotionally salient stimuli. However,
   no attempt has yet been made to statistically collate fMRI studies of
   brain activation, using the activation likelihood-estimate (ALE)
   technique, in response to emotion recognition tasks in individuals with
   SAD. Methods: A systematic search of fMRI studies of neural responses to
   socially emotive cues in SAD was undertaken. ALE meta-analysis, a
   voxel-based meta-analytic technique, was used to estimate the most
   significant activations during emotional recognition. Results: Seven
   studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, constituting a
   total of 91 subjects with SAD, and 93 healthy controls. The most
   significant areas of activation during emotional vs. neutral stimuli in
   individuals with SAD compared to controls were: bilateral amygdala, left
   medial temporal lobe encompassing the entorhinal cortex, left medial
   aspect of the inferior temporal lobe encompassing perirhinal cortex and
   parahippocampus, right anterior cingulate, right globus pallidus, and
   distal tip of right postcentral gyrus. Conclusion: The results are
   consistent with neuroanatomic models of the role of the amygdala in fear
   conditioning, and the importance of the limbic circuitry in mediating
   anxiety symptoms.}},

   Sentence Comprehension}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Using event-related fMRI in a sample of 42 healthy participants, we
   compared the cerebral activity maps obtained when classifying spoken
   sentences based on the mental content of the main character (belief,
   deception or empathy) or on the emotional tonality of the sentence
   (happiness, anger or sadness). To control for the effects of different
   syntactic constructions (such as embedded clauses in belief sentences),
   we subtracted from each map the BOLD activations obtained during
   plausibility judgments on structurally matching sentences, devoid of
   emotions or ToM. The obtained theory of mind (ToM) and emotional speech
   comprehension networks overlapped in the bilateral temporo-parietal
   junction, posterior cingulate cortex, right anterior temporal lobe,
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and in the left inferior frontal sulcus.
   These regions form a ToM network, which contributes to the emotional
   component of spoken sentence comprehension. Compared with the ToM task,
   in which the sentences were enounced on a neutral tone, the emotional
   sentence classification task, in which the sentences were play-acted,
   was associated with a greater activity in the bilateral superior
   temporal sulcus, in line with the presence of emotional prosody.
   Besides, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex was more active during
   emotional than ToM sentence processing. This region may link mental
   state representations with verbal and prosodic emotional cues. Compared

Abstract = {{Value-based decisions optimize the relation of costs and benefits. Costs
   and benefits confer not only value but also salience, which may
   influence decision making through attentional mechanisms. However, the
   computational and neurobiological role of salience in value-based
   decisions remains elusive. Here we develop and contrast two formal
   concepts of salience for value-based choices involving costs and
   benefits. Specifically, global salience (GS) first integrates costs and
   benefits and then determines salience based on this overall sum, whereas
   elemental salience (ES) first determines the salience of costs and
   benefits before integrating them. We dissociate the behavioral and
   neural effects of GS and ES from those of value using a value-based
   decision-making task and fMRI in humans. Specifically, we show that
   value guides choices and correlates with neural signals in the striatum.
   In contrast, only ES but not GS impacts decision making by speeding up
   reaction times. Moreover, activity in the right temporoparietal junction
   (RTPJ) reflects only ES and correlates with its response-accelerating
   behavioral effects. Finally, we report an ES-dependent change in
   functional connectivity between the RTPJ and the locus ceruleus,
   suggesting noradrenergic processes underlying the response-facilitating
   effects of ES on decision making. Together, these results support a
   novel concept of salience in value-based decision making and suggest a
   computational, anatomical, and neurochemical dissociation of value-and
   salience-based factors supporting value-based choices.}},

Abstract = {{Human empathy is an important component of social cognition that
   involves complex processes of emotional perspective taking and the issue
   of self/other distinction. Empathic perception enables us to experience
   negative emotions when someone else undergoes painful events. We
   investigated the influence of an extended time interval (10 s) and
   subjective performance evaluation (following each trial) of perspective
   taking on the cortical and subcortical correlates of pain empathy in
   eighteen healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Subjects were presented pictures of hands and feet in painful
   and non-painful situations. They were instructed to simply view the
   picture (View) or adopt either their own perspective (Self) or the
   perspective of a third-person (Other). Prolonged time intervals of
   stimulus presentation enabled the analysis of different perspective
   taking processes (Self versus Other). Enhanced activation in the left
   supramarginal gyrus was detected for adopting the Self compared to the
   Other perspective. Time course analysis showed an early peak in the
   trials, suggesting that taking the first-person perspective is an
   intuitive more automatic process. The comparison between the Other and
   Self condition evoked stronger activity in dorso- and ventrolateral
   prefrontal areas and the superior temporal sulcus (STS). For these
   areas, a peak in the later phase of the trials was found, suggesting
   that taking the third-person perspective requires more effort and is an
   ongoing process. This was also supported by the fact that the
   participants were subjectively more successful in adopting the Self
   perspective compared to the Other. Our findings support that especially
   during the Other condition, prolonged time periods seem to facilitate
   empathic responses.
   Individual ratings of performance enabled the comparison between
   subjects that were successful and unsuccessful at taking the Self or
   Other perspective. For Self, differential activations were found in the
   left insula and postcentral gyrus. For Other, differential activations
   were mainly observed in the left pallidum, bilateral VLPFC, the right
   middle orbitofrontal cortex OFC and the middle cingulate cortex (MCC).
   These results suggest that trial-specific success ratings allow us to
   disentangle differences between effort-related and successful engagement
   in perspective taking.
   These two adjustments to the well-known paradigm showed new insight into
   the aspects of perspective taking during pain perception. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{As complex social beings, people communicate, in addition to spoken
   language, also via nonverbal behavior. In social face-to-face
   situations, people readily read the affect and intentions of others in
   their face expressions and gestures recognizing their meaning.
   Importantly, the addressee further has to discriminate the meanings of
   the seen communicative motor acts in order to be able to react upon them
   appropriately. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study 15
   healthy non-alexithymic right-handers observed video-clips that showed
   the dynamic evolution of emotional face expressions and gestures
   evolving from a neutral to a fully developed expression. We aimed at
   disentangling the cerebral circuits related to the observation of the
   incomplete and the subsequent discrimination of the evolved bodily
   expressions of emotion which are typical for everyday social situations.
   We show that the inferior temporal gyrus and the inferior and dorsal
   medial frontal cortex in both cerebral hemispheres were activated early
   in recognizing faces and gestures, while their subsequent discrimination
   involved the right dorsolateral frontal cortex. Interregional
   correlations showed that the involved regions constituted a widespread
   circuit allowing for a formal analysis of the seen expressions, their
   empathic processing and the subjective interpretation of their
   contextual meanings. Right-left comparisons revealed a greater
   activation of the right dorsal medial frontal cortex and the inferior
   temporal gyrus which supports the notion of a right hemispheric
   dominance for processing affective body expressions. These novel data
   provide a neurobiological basis for the intuitive understanding of other
   people which is relevant for socially appropriate decisions and intact
   social functioning. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In schizophrenia patients negative symptoms and cognitive impairment
   often persist despite treatment with second generation antipsychotics
   leading to reduced quality of life and psychosocial functioning. One
   core cognitive deficit is impaired working memory (WM) suggesting
   malfunctioning of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. High frequency
   repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used to
   transiently facilitate or consolidate neuronal processes. Pilot studies
   using rTMS have demonstrated improvement of psychopathology in other
   psychiatric disorders, but a systematic investigation of working memory
   effects outlasting the stimulation procedure has not been performed so
   far. The aim of our study was to explore the effect of a 3-week high
   frequency active or sham 10 Hz rTMS on cognition, specifically on
   working memory, in schizophrenia patients (n = 25) in addition to
   antipsychotic therapy and in healthy controls (n = 22). We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activation
   patterns during verbal WM (letter 2-back task) before and after 3-weeks
   treatment with rTMS. Additionally, other cognitive tasks were conducted.
   10 Hz rTMS was applied over the left posterior middle frontal gyrus (EEG
   electrode location F3) with an intensity of 110\% of the individual
   resting motor threshold (RMT) over a total of 15 sessions. Participants
   recruited the common fronto- parietal and subcortical WM network.
   Multiple regression analyses revealed no significant activation
   differences over time in any contrast or sample. According to the ANOVAs
   for repeated measures performance remained without alterations in all
   groups. This is the first fMRI study that has systematically
   investigated this topic within a randomized, placebo-controlled,
   double-blind design, contrasting the effects in schizophrenia patients
   and healthy controls. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atypical face processing plays a key role in social interaction
   difficulties encountered by individuals with autism. In the current fMRI
   study, the Thatcher illusion was used to investigate several aspects of
   face processing in 20 young adults with high-functioning autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) and 20 matched neurotypical controls. ``Thatcherized{''}
   stimuli were modified at either the eyes or the mouth and participants
   discriminated between pairs of faces while cued to attend to either of
   these features in upright and inverted orientation. Behavioral data
   confirmed sensitivity to the illusion and intact configural processing
   in ASD. Directing attention towards the eyes vs. the mouth in upright
   faces in ASD led to (1) improved discrimination accuracy; (2) increased
   activation in areas involved in social and emotional processing; (3)
   increased activation in subcortical face-processing areas. Our findings
   show that when explicitly cued to attend to the eyes, activation of
   cortical areas involved in face processing, including its social and
   emotional aspects, can be enhanced in autism. This suggests that
   impairments in face processing in autism may be caused by a deficit in
   social attention, and that giving specific cues to attend to the
   eye-region when performing behavioral therapies aimed at improving
   social skills may result in a better outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT)
   is a key measure of social cognition in schizophrenia that has good
   psychometric properties and is recommended by the MATRICS committee. As
   a way to further investigate the validity of the MSCEIT, this study
   sought to examine the neurobiological correlates of MSCEIT performance
   in patients with early course schizophrenia.
   Methods: A total of 51 patients diagnosed with early course, stabilized
   schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder completed structural magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) scans and the MSCEIT. Investigation of the
   associations between MSCEIT performance and gray matter morphology was
   examined by conducting voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses across
   hypothesized social-cognitive regions of interest using automated
   anatomical labeling in Statistical Parametric Mapping Software, version
   5 (SPM5). All VBM analyses utilized general linear models examining gray
   matter density partitioned images, adjusting for demographic and
   illness-related confounds. VBM results were then followed up with
   confirmatory volumetric analyses.
   Results: Patients with poorer overall and Facilitating, Understanding,
   and Managing Emotions subscale performances on the MSCEIT showed
   significantly reduced gray matter density in the left parahippocampal
   gyrus. Additionally, attenuated performance on the Facilitating and
   Managing Emotions subscales was significantly associated with reduced
   right posterior cingulate gray matter density. All associations observed
   between MSCEIT performance and gray matter density were supported with
   confirmatory gray matter volumetric analyses, with the exception of the
   association between the right posterior cingulate and the facilitation
   of emotions.
   Conclusion: These findings provide additional evidence for the MSCEIT as
   a valid social-cognitive measure by elucidating its correlates with
   neurobiological structures commonly implicated in emotion processing.
   These findings provide additional biological evidence supporting the use
   of the MSCEIT in cognitive enhancing clinical trials in schizophrenia.

Title = {{Learning by Observation: Insights from Williams Syndrome}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Observing another person performing a complex action accelerates the
   observer's acquisition of the same action and limits the time-consuming
   process of learning by trial and error. Observational learning makes an
   interesting and potentially important topic in the developmental domain,
   especially when disorders are considered. The implications of studies
   aimed at clarifying whether and how this form of learning is spared by
   pathology are manifold. We focused on a specific population with
   learning and intellectual disabilities, the individuals with Williams
   syndrome. The performance of twenty-eight individuals with Williams
   syndrome was compared with that of mental age- and gender-matched
   thirty-two typically developing children on tasks of learning of a
   visuo-motor sequence by observation or by trial and error. Regardless of
   the learning modality, acquiring the correct sequence involved three
   main phases: a detection phase, in which participants discovered the
   correct sequence and learned how to perform the task; an exercise phase,
   in which they reproduced the sequence until performance was error-free;
   an automatization phase, in which by repeating the error-free sequence
   they became accurate and speedy. Participants with Williams syndrome
   beneficiated of observational training (in which they observed an actor
   detecting the visuo-motor sequence) in the detection phase, while they
   performed worse than typically developing children in the exercise and
   automatization phases. Thus, by exploiting competencies learned by
   observation, individuals with Williams syndrome detected the visuo-motor
   sequence, putting into action the appropriate procedural strategies.
   Conversely, their impaired performances in the exercise phases appeared
   linked to impaired spatial working memory, while their deficits in
   automatization phases to deficits in processes increasing efficiency and
   speed of the response. Overall, observational experience was
   advantageous for acquiring competencies, since it primed subjects'
   interest in the actions to be performed and functioned as a catalyst for
   executed action.}},

Title = {{The Neural Substrates of Social Influence on Decision Making}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{The mechanisms that govern human learning and decision making under
   uncertainty have been the focus of intense behavioral and, more
   recently, neuroscientific investigation. Substantial progress has been
   made in building models of the processes involved, and identifying
   underlying neural mechanisms using simple, two-alternative forced choice
   decision tasks. However, less attention has been given to how social
   information influences these processes, and the neural systems that
   mediate this influence. Here we sought to address these questions by
   using tasks similar to ones that have been used to study individual
   decision making behavior, and adding conditions in which participants
   were given trial-by-trial information about the performance of other
   individuals (their choices and/or their rewards) simultaneously playing
   the same tasks. We asked two questions: How does such information about
   the behavior of others influence performance in otherwise simple
   decision tasks, and what neural systems mediate this influence? We found
   that bilateral insula exhibited a parametric relationship to the degree
   of misalignment of the individual's performance with those of others in
   the group. Furthermore, activity in the bilateral insula significantly
   predicted participants' subsequent choices to align their behavior with
   others in the group when they were misaligned either in their choices
   (independent of success) or their degree of success (independent of
   specific choices). These findings add to the growing body of empirical
   data suggesting that the insula participates in an important way in
   social information processing and decision making.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to infer deceptive intents from nonverbal behavior is
   critical for social interactions. By combining single-pulse and
   repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy humans, we
   provide both correlational and causative evidence that action simulation
   is actively involved in the ability to recognize deceptive body
   movements. We recorded motor-evoked potentials during a faked-action
   discrimination (FAD) task: participants watched videos of actors lifting
   a cube and judged whether the actors were trying to deceive them
   concerning the real weight of the cube. Seeing faked actions facilitated
   the observers' motor system more than truthful actions in a
   body-part-specific manner, suggesting that motor resonance was sensitive
   to deceptive movements. Furthermore, we found that TMS virtual lesion to
   the anterior node of the action observation network, namely the left
   inferior frontal cortex (IFC), reduced perceptual sensitivity in the FAD
   task. In contrast, no change in FAD task performance was found after
   virtual lesions to the left temporoparietal junction (control site).
   Moreover, virtual lesion to the IFC failed to affect performance in a
   difficulty-matched spatial-control task that did not require processing
   of spatiotemporal (acceleration) and configurational (limb displacement)
   features of seen actions, which are critical to detecting deceptive
   intent in the actions of others. These findings indicate that the human
   IFC is critical for recognizing deceptive body movements and suggest
   that FAD relies on the simulation of subtle changes in action kinematics
   within the motor system.}},

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Recent functional neuroimaging studies show that the amygdala has a
   central role in threat evaluation, in response to conditioned and
   unconditioned stimuli, in fear learning and fear extinction. The
   amygdala is involved in the pathophysiology of phobias and anxiety. In
   this review we critically examine the main findings of functional
   neuroimaging studies reporting data on the amygdala. Findings suggest
   that the response of the amygdala to threatening stimuli is mainly
   modulated by the infralimbic and prefrontal cortices, which inhibit
   activation of the amygdala (top-down inhibition), and by the
   hippocampus, the function of which is related to stimulus learning. The
   activity of the amygdala is modulated by various factors, like stimulus
   type and origin, emotion triggered by stimulus perception, and
   attention. The neural network comprising the amygdala and the frontal
   cortex is involved not only in top-down inhibition, but also in the
   emotional perception of facial expressions. This network also includes
   the thalamic pulvinar, which is densely interconnected with the
   amygdala, directly or indirectly, and which is activated by emotional
   face recognition of scary fear. Both top-down inhibition mechanisms and
   emotional face recognition are altered in anxiety disorders,
   particularly in specific and social phobia, resulting in reduced
   amygdalar activity inhibition after anxiety - or fear - inducing
   stimulus perception. Future functional neuroimaging studies will be able
   to provide new insights of normal and altered neurophysiology of the
   amygdala.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Acupuncture is a commonly used therapy for treating functional diarrhea
   (FD), although there is limited knowledge on the mechanism. The
   objectives of this study were to investigate the differences in brain
   activities elicited by acupuncture between FD patients and healthy
   controls (HC) so as to explore the possible mechanism. Eighteen FD
   patients and eighteen HC received 10 sessions of acupuncture treatment
   at ST25 acupoints. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans
   were, respectively, performed before and after acupuncture. The
   defecation frequency, Bristol stool form scale (SBFS), and MOS 36-item
   Short Healthy Survey (SF-36) were employed to evaluate the clinical
   efficacy. After acupuncture, the FD patients showed a significant
   decrease in defecation frequency and BSFS score. The regional
   homogeneity (ReHo) map showed a decrease in the paracentral lobule and
   postcentral gyrus, and an increase in the angular gyrus, insula,
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and precuneus in the FD group.
   Moreover, the changes in ReHo values in the ACC were correlated with the
   reduction in defecation frequency. Decreasing functional connectivity
   among the ACC, insula, thalamus, and orbital frontal cortex only existed
   in the FD group. Conclusively, acupuncture alleviated defecation
   frequency and improved stool formation in FD patients. The efficacy
   might result from the regulation of the homeostasis afferent processing

Abstract = {{Background: The failure to inhibit pleasurable but inappropriate urges
   is associated with frontal lobe pathology and has been suggested as a
   possible cause of pedophilic behavior. However, imaging and
   neuropsychological findings about frontal pathology in pedophilia are
   heterogeneous. In our study we therefore address inhibition behaviorally
   and by means of functional imaging, aiming to assess how inhibition in
   pedophilia is related to a differential recruitment of frontal brain
   areas. Method: Eleven pedophilic subjects and 7 non-pedophilic controls
   underwent fMRI while performing a go/no-go task composed of neutral
   letters. Results: Pedophilic subjects showed a slower reaction time and
   less accurate visual target discrimination. fMRI voxel-level ANOVA
   revealed as a main effect of the go/no-go task an activation of
   prefrontal and parietal brain regions in the no-go condition, while the
   left anterior cingulate, precuneus and gyrus angularis became more
   activated in the go condition. In addition, a group x task interaction
   was found in the left precuneus and gyrus angularis. This interaction
   was based on an attenuated deactivation of these brain regions in the
   pedophilic group during performance of the no-go condition. The positive
   correlation between blood oxygen level-dependent imaging signal and
   reaction time in these brain areas indicates that attenuated
   deactivation is related to the behavioral findings. Conclusion: Slower
   reaction time and less accurate visual target discrimination in
   pedophilia was accompanied by attenuated deactivation of brain areas
   belonging to the default mode network. Our findings thus support the
   notion that behavioral differences might also derive from self-related
   processes and not necessarily from frontal lobe pathology. (C) 2013 S.

Abstract = {{Background: The judgment of the approachability of others based on their
   facial appearance often precedes social interaction. Whether we
   ultimately approach or avoid others may depend on such judgments.
   Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the
   neural basis for such approachability judgments and the relationship
   between these judgments and trait anxiety. Participants viewed ambiguous
   (i.e. neutral) or relatively unambiguous (i.e. angry, happy) faces,
   assessing either the approachability or the sex of the person depicted.
   Results: Neutral faces elicited more inconsistent responses within
   participants only during approachability judgment, suggesting ambiguous
   property as signals. The contrast pertaining to the interaction between
   task and face valence demonstrated activation in several areas, such
   that the left amygdala and medial, middle and inferior frontal gyri were
   responsive to angry faces when subjects were asked to recognize the sex
   (implicit task) and to neutral faces when required to discern the
   approachability (explicit task). Moreover, the blood oxygenation
   level-de-pendent change within the left amygdala in response to neutral
   faces during the judgment of approachability was positively correlated
   with participant trait anxiety. Conclusions: These findings extend a
   proposed model of social cognition by highlighting the functional
   engagement of the amygdala in approachability judgments, which underlie
   an individual's sensitivity to ambiguous sources of probable threat. (C)

Abstract = {{Using fMRI and self-reports, we explore the relationship between
   ad-elicited emotional arousal and memory for the ad, as well as the
   mechanisms involved in this relationship. A broad conceptual framework
   proposes three routes for emotional memory: attention, elaboration, and
   social cognition. Our exploratory study examines the association between
   ad-elicited emotional arousal and predetermined ad memorability, as a
   proxy for memory for the ad. Results reveal greater amygdala activation
   in memorable (versus unmemorable) ads, reinforcing the association
   between ad-elicited emotional arousal and memory for the ad. Amygdala
   activation was accompanied by activation in the brain region termed the
   superior temporal sulcus (STS), which is involved in social cognition.
   These results are indicative of a sociocognitive emotional memory
   process, which has been neglected in past research. Future research
   directions are discussed.}},

Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the neurobiological basis of two subtypes
   of dyslexia with either a double deficit (concerning phonological
   awareness and rapid naming) or a single rapid naming deficit. We
   compared such groups of German dyslexic primary school children to each
   other and with good reading children in a phoneme deletion task
   performed during fMRI scanning. Children heard German words or
   pseudowords and repeated the remainder of the stimulus while deleting
   the initial phoneme (e.g. tear - \_ear). In four conditions, the input
   stimulus (word or pseudoword) could either become another word or
   pseudoword as output. The word-word condition stuck out against all
   other conditions involving pseudowords: Dyslexics with a double deficit
   showed a strong response in left areas 44 and 45 in Boca's region,
   whereas dyslexics with rapid naming difficulties revealed a
   contralateral effect in right areas 44 and 45. These findings, which
   were obtained without presenting written or pictorial stimuli, reveal
   that a double deficit in dyslexia is not the sum of single deficits, but
   rather involves the interaction of lexical and phonological processing,
   making strong demands on the left inferior frontal cortex. In general,
   the results stress the importance of considering subtypes of dyslexia
   differentially in order to obtain better insights in the neurocognitive
   mechanisms of impaired and successful reading.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. The aim of this work is to study the association between autism in
   a group of autistic children and risk factors for specific familiar
   diseases and developmental disease in the early years of life, through a
   medical social investigation.
   Materials and Methods. For this study, we have submitted an anamnestic
   questionnaire to 29 autistic children and their families in a South
   Italy region (Basilicata), collecting data about children and their
   parents.
   Results. The results show that many children have a family history of
   autoimmune diseases (psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease,
   Takayasu's arteritis), allergies and food intolerances, suggesting a
   putative involvement of the immune system in autism etiopathogenesis.
   Analyzing residences areas of patients, Potenza and Matera, with their
   environmental factors (radioactive waste repositories, incinerators,
   intensive farming), we demonstrate that the particular territorial
   characteristics don't affect autism.
   Conclusions. Autistic disorder is a spectrum of neurologic disorders
   complex both in etiopathogenesis and healthcare. So we aim to continue
   the study already undertaken on cytokines of autistic subjects serum and
   to extend it through biomolecular approaches assessing the presence of
   specific genetic polymorphisms in order to identify the
   physiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disease and to evaluate the
   predictive risk with the aim to improve care interventions.}},

Abstract = {{A major aim of Jon Driver's research was to identify principles by which
   the brain selects behaviorally relevant stimuli or thoughts for in-depth
   processing. His insights have shaped neurobiological models of selective
   attention that highlight top-down modulations of sensory cortex as a
   neural substrate of adaptive behavioral control. In this paper, I review
   research on the characteristics and neural origins of such top-down
   modulations. The studies reviewed show that neural processing in sensory
   cortical areas can be biased toward behaviorally relevant stimuli and
   thoughts by feedback projections from frontal and parietal brain areas.
   Such modulatory influences are similarly present for judgments about
   external sensory information (during attention) or internal
   representations (during imagery and short-term memory), potentially
   reflecting common neural mechanisms that enhance sensory processing of
   relevant neural signals. How such top-down control processes may
   ultimately be guided by motivational brain systems is a topic of current
   debate, for which Jon Driver's work will continue to provide important
   inspiration.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroeconomics shares the main goals of microeconomics: to understand
   what causes choices, and the welfare properties of choice. The novel
   goal is linking mathematical constructs and observable behavior to
   mechanistic details of neural circuitry. Several complementary methods
   are used. An initial insight from neuroscience is that distinct systems
   guide choice: Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning (learning) of
   state-value and response-value associations, overlearned habits, and
   model- (or goal-) directed value that requires deliberation. These
   systems can differ economically from rational choice-for example,
   habitual choices have low utility and price elasticities, whereas
   model-directed values are often constructed preferences. Neuroeconomics
   also provides evidence of situations in which utility maximization
   either works well (in simple binary choice) or benefits from the
   introduction of behavioral constructs. Neuroeconomics is well equipped
   to guide the theory of how choices depend on mental states, such as fear
   or cognitive load. Examples include extensive studies of risk and time
   preference, finance, and neural decoding of private information.}},

   expression is directed towards the viewer. Therefore, we conjectured
   that the efficiency in visual search for deviant emotional expression is
   modulated by gaze direction, which is one of the primary clues for
   encoding the focus of social attention. To examine this hypothesis, two
   visual search tasks were conducted. In Emotional Face Search, the
   participants were required to detect an emotional expression amongst
   distractor faces with neutral expression; in Neutral Face Search they
   were required to detect a neutral target among emotional distractors.
   The results revealed that target detection was accelerated when the
   target face had direct gaze compared to averted gaze for fearful, angry,
   and neutral targets, but no effect of distractor gaze direction was
   observed. An additional experiment including multiple display sizes has
   shown a shallower search slope in search for a target face with direct
   gaze than that with averted gaze, indicating that the advantage of a
   target face with direct gaze is attributable to efficient orientation of
   attention towards target faces. These results indicate that direct gaze
   facilitates detection of target face in visual scenery even when gaze
   discrimination is not the primary task at hand.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Current behavioral measures poorly predict treatment outcome in
   social anxiety disorder (SAD). To our knowledge, this is the first study
   to examine neuro-imaging- based treatment prediction in SAD.
   Objective: To measure brain activation in patients with SAD as a
   biomarker to predict subsequent response to cognitive behavioral therapy
   (CBT).
   Design: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected
   prior to CBT intervention. Changes in clinical status were regressed on
   brain responses and tested for selectivity for social stimuli.
   Setting: Patients were treated with protocol-based CBT at anxiety
   disorder programs at Boston University or Massachusetts General Hospital
   and underwent neuroimaging data collection at Massachusetts Institute of
   Technology.
   Patients: Thirty-nine medication-free patients meeting DSM-IV criteria
   for the generalized subtype of SAD.
   Interventions: Brain responses to angry vs neutral faces or emotional vs
   neutral scenes were examined with fMRI prior to initiation of CBT.
   Main Outcome Measures: Whole-brain regression analyses with differential
   fMRI responses for angry vs neutral faces and changes in Liebowitz
   Social Anxiety Scale score as the treatment outcome measure.
   Results: Pretreatment responses significantly predicted subsequent
   treatment outcome of patients selectively for social stimuli and
   particularly in regions of higher-order visual cortex. Combining the
   brain measures with information on clinical severity accounted for more
   than 40\% of the variance in treatment response and substantially
   exceeded predictions based on clinical measures at baseline. Prediction
   success was unaffected by testing for potential confounding factors such
   as depression severity at baseline.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that brain imaging can provide
   biomarkers that substantially improve predictions for the success of
   cognitive behavioral interventions and more generally suggest that such
   biomarkers may offer evidence-based, personalized medicine approaches
   for optimally selecting among treatment options for a patient.}},

   Implications for theories of visual coding}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{In this study we tested predictions of two important theories of visual
   coding, contrast energy and sparse coding theory, on the dependence of
   population activity level and metabolic demands on spatial structure of
   the visual input. With carefully calibrated displays we find that in
   humans neither the V1 blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response
   nor the initial visually evoked fields in magnetoencephalography (MEG)
   are sensitive to phase perturbations in photographs of natural scenes.
   As a control, we quantitatively show that the applied phase
   perturbations decrease sparseness (kurtosis) of our stimuli but preserve
   their root mean square (RMS) contrast. Importantly, we show that the
   lack of sensitivity of the V1 population response level to phase
   perturbations is not due to a lack of sensitivity of our methods because
   V1 responses were highly sensitive to variations of image RMS contrast.
   Our results suggest that the transition from a sparse to a distributed
   neural code in the early visual system induced by reducing image
   sparseness has negligible consequences for population metabolic cost.
   This result imposes a novel and important empirical constraint on
   quantitative models of sparse coding: Population metabolic rate and
   population activation level is sensitive to second order statistics (RMS
   contrast) of the input but not to its spatial phase and fourth order
   statistics (kurtosis).}},

Title = {{Timing deficits in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD):
   Evidence from neurocognitive and neuroimaging studies}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{2, SI}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Relatively recently, neurocognitive and neuroimaging studies have
   indicated that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
   (ADHD) may have deficits in a range of timing functions and their
   underlying neural networks. Despite this evidence, timing deficits in
   ADHD are still somewhat neglected in the literature and mostly omitted
   from reviews on ADHD. There is therefore a lack of integrative reviews
   on the up-to-date evidence on neurocognitive and neurofunctional
   deficits of timing in ADHD and their significance with respect to other
   behavioural and cognitive deficits. The present review provides a
   synthetic overview of the evidence for neurocognitive and
   neurofunctional deficits in ADHD in timing functions, and integrates
   this evidence with the cognitive neuroscience literature of the neural
   substrates of timing. The review demonstrates that ADHD patients are
   consistently impaired in three major timing domains, in motor timing,
   perceptual timing and temporal foresight, comprising several timeframes
   spanning milliseconds, seconds, minutes and longer intervals up to
   years. The most consistent impairments in ADHD are found in sensorimotor
   synchronisation, duration discrimination, reproduction and delay
   discounting. These neurocognitive findings of timing deficits in ADHD
   are furthermore supported by functional neuroimaging studies that show
   dysfunctions in the key inferior fronto-striato-cerebellar and
   fronto-parietal networks that mediate the timing functions. Although
   there is evidence that these timing functions are inter-correlated with
   other executive functions that are well established to be impaired in
   the disorder, in particular working memory, attention, and to a lesser
   degree inhibitory control, the key timing deficits appear to survive
   when these functions are controlled for, suggesting independent
   cognitive deficits in the temporal domain. There is furthermore strong
   evidence for an association between timing deficits and behavioural
   measures of impulsiveness and inattention, suggesting that timing
   problems are key to the clinical behavioural profile of ADHD. Emerging
   evidence shows that the most common treatment of ADHD with the dopamine
   agonist and psychostimulant Methylphenidate attenuates most timing
   deficits in ADHD and normalises the abnormally blunted recruitment of
   the underlying fronto-striato-cerebellar networks. Timing function
   deficits in ADHD, therefore, next to executive function deficits, form
   an independent impairment domain, and should receive more attention in
   neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and pharmacological basic research as
   well as in translational research aimed to develop pharmacological or
   non-pharmacological treatment of abnormal timing behaviour and cognition
   in ADHD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Developmental changes in within- and between-network connectivity
   between late childhood and adulthood}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{156-167}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A number of behavioral changes occur between late childhood and
   adulthood, including maturation of social cognition, reward receptivity,
   impulsiveness, risk-taking and cognitive control. Although some of these
   abilities show linear improvements with age, some abilities may
   temporarily worsen, reflecting both the restructuring and/or
   strengthening of connections within some brain systems. The current
   study uses resting state functional connectivity to examine
   developmental differences between late childhood and adulthood in task
   positive (TP) regions, which play a role in cognitive control functions,
   and task negative (TN) regions, which play a role in social cognition,
   self-referential, and internally-directed thought. Within the TP
   network, developmental differences in connectivity were found with the
   left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Within the TN network,
   developmental differences in connectivity were found with a broad area
   of the medial prefrontal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus.
   Connections between the two networks also showed significant
   developmental differences. Stronger anticorrelations were found in the
   TN maps of the adult group for the right anterior insula/inferior
   frontal gyrus, bilateral anterior inferior parietal lobule, bilateral
   superior parietal lobule and an anterior portion of the right posterior
   cingulate cortex. There was a significant brain-behavior relationship
   between the strength of anticorrelation in these regions and inhibitory
   control performance on two Go/No-go tasks suggesting that the
   development of anticorrelations between. late childhood and adulthood
   supports mature inhibitory control. Overall, maturation of these
   networks occurred in specific regions which are associated with
   cognitive control of goal-directed behavior, including those involved in
   working memory, social cognition, and inhibitory control. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Background Heavy drinkers show altered functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) response to alcohol cues. Little is known about alcohol
   cue reactivity among college age drinkers, who show the greatest rates
   of alcohol use disorders. Family history of alcoholism (family history
   positive {[}FHP]) is a risk factor for problematic drinking, but the
   impact on alcohol cue reactivity is unclear. We investigated the
   influence of heavy drinking and family history of alcoholism on alcohol
   cue-related fMRI response among college students. Methods Participants
   were 19 family history negative (FHN) light drinkers, 11 FHP light
   drinkers, 25 FHN heavy drinkers, and 10 FHP heavy drinkers, aged 18 to
   21. During fMRI scanning, participants viewed alcohol images, nonalcohol
   beverage images, and degraded control images, with each beverage image
   presented twice. We characterized blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   contrast for alcohol versus nonalcohol images and examined BOLD response
   to repeated alcohol images to understand exposure effects. Results Heavy
   drinkers exhibited greater BOLD response than light drinkers in
   posterior visual association regions, anterior cingulate, medial frontal
   cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsal striatum, and hyperactivation
   to repeated alcohol images in temporo-parietal, frontal, and insular
   regions (clusters > 8,127 mu l, p < 0.05). FHP individuals showed
   increased activation to repeated alcohol images in temporo-parietal
   regions, fusiform, and hippocampus. There were no interactions between
   family history and drinking group. Conclusions Our results parallel
   findings of hyperactivation to alcohol cues among heavy drinkers in
   regions subserving visual attention, memory, motivation, and habit.
   Heavy drinkers demonstrated heightened activation to repeated alcohol
   images, which could influence continued drinking. Family history of
   alcoholism was associated with greater response to repeated alcohol
   images in regions underlying visual attention, recognition, and
   encoding, which could suggest aspects of alcohol cue reactivity that are
   independent of personal drinking. Heavy drinking and family history of
   alcoholism may have differential impacts on neural circuitry involved in
   cue reactivity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a neuroscientific study of aesthetic judgments on
   written texts. In an fMRI experiment participants read a number of
   proverbs without explicitly evaluating them. In a post-scan rating they
   rated each item for familiarity and beauty. These individual ratings
   were correlated with the functional data to investigate the neural
   correlates of implicit aesthetic judgments. We identified clusters in
   which BOLD activity was correlated with individual post-scan beauty
   ratings. This indicates that some spontaneous aesthetic evaluation takes
   place during reading, even if not required by the task. Positive
   correlations were found in the ventral striatum and in medial prefrontal
   cortex, likely reflecting the rewarding nature of sentences that are
   aesthetically pleasing. On the contrary, negative correlations were
   observed in the classic left frontotemporal reading network. Midline
   structures and bilateral temporoparietal regions correlated positively
   with familiarity, suggesting a shift from the task-network towards the
   default network with increasing familiarity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All
