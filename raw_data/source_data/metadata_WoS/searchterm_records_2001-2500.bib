Abstract = {{Proficiency in arithmetic learning can be achieved by using a multitude
   of strategies, the most salient of which are procedural learning
   (applying a certain set of computations) and rote learning (direct
   retrieval from long-term memory). Here we investigated the effect of
   transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), a non-invasive brain
   stimulation method previously shown to enhance cognitive training, on
   both types of learning in a 5-day sham-controlled training study, under
   two conditions of task difficulty, defined in terms of item repetition.
   On the basis of previous research implicating the prefrontal and
   posterior parietal cortex in early and late stages of arithmetic
   learning, respectively, sham-controlled tRNS was applied to bilateral
   prefrontal cortex for the first 3 days and to the posterior parietal
   cortex for the last 2 days of a 5-day training phase. The training
   involved learning to solve arithmetic problems by applying a calculation
   algorithm; both trained and untrained problems were used in a brief
   testing phase at the end of the training phase. Task difficulty was
   manipulated between subjects by using either a large ({''}easy{''}
   condition) or a small ({''}difficult{''} condition) number of repetition
   of problems during training. Measures of attention and working memory
   were acquired before and after the training phase. As compared to sham,
   participants in the tRNS condition displayed faster reaction times and
   increased learning rate during the training phase; as well as faster
   reaction times for both trained and untrained (new) problems, which
   indicated a transfer effect after the end of training. All stimulation
   effects reached significance only in the ``difficult{''} condition when
   number of repetition was lower. There were no transfer effects of tRNS
   on attention or working memory. The results support the view that tRNS
   can produce specific facilitative effects on numerical cognition
   specifically, on arithmetic learning. They also highlight the importance
   of task difficulty in the neuromodulation of learning, which in the
   current study due to the manipulation of item repetition might have
   being mediated by the memory system. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Interpersonal pain perception is a fundamental and evolutionarily
   beneficial social process. While critical for navigating the social
   world, whether or not people rely on similar processes to perceive and
   respond to the harm of the non-human biological world remains largely
   unknown. Here we investigate whether neural reactivity toward the
   suffering of other people is distinct from or overlapping with the
   neural response to pain and harm inflicted upon non-human entities,
   specifically animals and nature. We used fMRI to measure neural activity
   while participants (n=15) perceived and reported how badly they felt for
   the pain or harm of humans, animals, and nature, relative to neutral
   situations. Neural regions associated with perceiving the pain of other
   people (e.g. dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral anterior
   insula) were similarly recruited when perceiving and responding to
   painful scenes across people, animals, and nature. These results suggest
   that similar brain responses are relied upon when perceiving the harm of
   social and non-social biological entities, broadly construed, and that
   activity within the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral
   anterior insula in response to pain-relevant stimuli is not uniquely
   specific to humans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{People often find it hard to disagree with others, but how this
   disposition varies across individuals or how it is influenced by social
   factors like other people's level of expertise remains little
   understood. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found
   that activity across a network of brain areas {[}comprising posterior
   medial frontal cortex (pMFC), anterior insula (Al), inferior frontal
   gyms (IFG), lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and angular gyrus] was
   modulated by individual differences in the frequency with which
   participants actively disagreed with statements made by others.
   Specifically, participants who disagreed less frequently exhibited
   greater brain activation in these areas when they actually disagreed.
   Given the role of this network in cognitive dissonance, our results
   suggest that some participants had more trouble disagreeing due to a
   heightened cognitive dissonance response. Contrary to expectation, the
   level of expertise (high or low) had no effect on behavior or brain
   activity.}},

Title = {{Is Brain Activity during Action Observation Modulated by the Perceived
   Fairness of the Actor?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Perceiving other people's actions triggers activity in premotor and
   parietal areas, brain areas also involved in executing and sensing our
   own actions. Paralleling this phenomenon, observing emotional states
   (including pain) in others is associated with activity in the same brain
   areas as activated when experiencing similar emotions directly. This
   emotion perception associated activity has been shown to be affected by
   the perceived fairness of the actor, and in-group membership more
   generally. Here, we examine whether action observation associated brain
   activity is also affected by the perceived social fairness of the
   actors. Perceived fairness was manipulated using an alternating iterated
   Prisoner's Dilemma game between the participant and two confederates,
   one of whom played fairly and the other unfairly. During fMRI scanning
   the participants watched movies of the confederates performing
   object-directed hand actions, and then performed hand actions
   themselves. Massunivariate analysis showed that observing the actions
   triggered robust activation in regions associated with action execution,
   but failed to identify a strong modulation of this activation based on
   perceived fairness. Multivariate pattern analysis, however, identified
   clusters potentially carrying information about the perceived fairness
   of the actor in the middle temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right
   inferior parietal lobule, right middle cingulate cortex, right angular
   gyrus, and right superioroccipital gyrus. Despite being identified by a
   wholebrain searchlight analysis (and so without anatomical restriction),
   these clusters fall into areas frequently associated with action
   observation. We conclude that brain activity during action observation
   may be modulated by perceived fairness, but such modulation is subtle;
   robust activity is associated with observing the actions of both fair
   and unfair individuals.}},

Title = {{Altered functional connectivity of the amygdaloid input nuclei in
   adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder: a resting
   state fMRI study}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Background: Amygdala dysfunction is hypothesized to underlie the social
   deficits observed in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the
   neurobiological basis of this hypothesis is underspecified because it is
   unknown whether ASD relates to abnormalities of the amygdaloid input or
   output nuclei. Here, we investigated the functional connectivity of the
   amygdaloid social-perceptual input nuclei and emotion-regulation output
   nuclei in ASD versus controls.
   Methods: We collected resting state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data, tailored to provide optimal sensitivity in the
   amygdala as well as the neocortex, in 20 adolescents and young adults
   with ASD and 25 matched controls. We performed a regular correlation
   analysis between the entire amygdala (EA) and the whole brain and used a
   partial correlation analysis to investigate whole-brain functional
   connectivity uniquely related to each of the amygdaloid subregions.
   Results: Between-group comparison of regular EA correlations showed
   significantly reduced connectivity in visuospatial and superior parietal
   areas in ASD compared to controls. Partial correlation analysis revealed
   that this effect was driven by the left superficial and right
   laterobasal input subregions, but not the centromedial output nuclei.
   Conclusions: These results indicate reduced connectivity of specifically
   the amygdaloid sensory input channels in ASD, suggesting that abnormal
   amygdalo-cortical connectivity can be traced down to the
   socio-perceptual pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Of current interest is how variations in early language experience shape
   patterns of functional connectivity in the human brain. In the present
   study, we compared simultaneous (two languages from birth) and
   sequential (second language learned after age 5 years) bilinguals using
   a seed-based resting-state MRI approach. We focused on the inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG) as our ROI, as recent studies have demonstrated both
   neurofunctional and neurostructural changes related to age of second
   language acquisition in bilinguals in this cortical area. Stronger
   functional connectivity was observed for simultaneous bilinguals between
   the left and right IFG, as well as between the inferior frontal gyrus
   and brain areas involved in language control, including the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and cerebellum. Functional
   connectivity between the left IFG and the right IFG and right inferior
   parietal lobule was also significantly correlated with age of
   acquisition for sequential bilinguals; the earlier the second language
   was acquired, the stronger was the functional connectivity. In addition,
   greater functional connectivity between homologous regions of the
   inferior frontal gyrus was associated with reduced neural activation in
   the left IFG during speech production. The increased connectivity at
   rest and reduced neural activation during task performance suggests
   enhanced neural efficiency in this important brain area involved in both
   speech production and domain-general cognitive processing. Together, our
   findings highlight how the brain's intrinsic functional patterns are
   influenced by the developmental timeline in which second language
   acquisition occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Recent theories distinguish anxiety from fear in the brain. Anxiety is
   associated with activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and
   hippocampus, while fear is associated with activation in periaqueductal
   gray, with amygdala involved in processing aspects of both emotional
   responses. These theories propose that the amount of information
   available about threat determines which of the two defensive responses
   is elicited, with fear and anxiety associated with well-defined and
   uncertain threats respectively. However, a direct test of this
   hypothesis is lacking. Here we provide such a test using fMRI to record
   participants' brain activity while they performed a computer-based task
   which required to press a button to move an artificial agent to a target
   position while an artificial predator chased the agent. In one condition
   (associated with fear) the predator was visible, while in another
   condition (associated with anxiety) the predator was invisible.
   Ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala showed
   increased activity when the predator was invisible compared to visible,
   while the opposite effect was observed in periaqueductal gray. We also
   observed that participants with high but not low trait-anxiety showed an
   hippocampal activation with invisible threat at an earlier time stage
   during the trial. These findings help clarify the neural mechanisms that
   underlie different defensive emotions and shed light on how these
   mechanisms may contribute to exaggerated anxiety. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {{Gray matter volume and executive functioning correlate with time since
   injury following mild traumatic brain injury}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{612}},
Pages = {{238-244}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{Most people who sustain a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) will
   recover to baseline functioning within a period of several days to
   weeks. A substantial minority of patients, however, will show persistent
   symptoms and mild cognitive complaints for much longer. To more clearly
   delineate how the duration of time since injury (TSI) is associated with
   neuroplastic cortical volume changes and cognitive recovery, we employed
   voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and select neuropsychological measures in
   a cross-sectional sample of 26 patients with mTBI assessed at either
   two-weeks, one-month, three-months, six-months, or one-year post injury,
   and a sample of 12 healthy controls. Longer duration of TSI was
   associated with larger gray matter volume (GMV) within the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and right fusiform gyrus, and better
   neurocognitive performance on measures of visuospatial design fluency
   and emotional functioning. In particular, volume within the vmPFC was
   positively correlated with design fluency and negatively correlated with
   symptoms of anxiety, whereas GMV of the fusiform gyrus was associated
   with greater design fluency and Sustained visual psychomotor vigilance
   performance. Moreover, the larger GMV seen among the more chronic
   individuals was significantly greater than healthy controls, suggesting
   possible enlargement of these regions with time since injury. These
   findings are interpreted in light of burgeoning evidence suggesting that
   cortical regions often exhibit structural changes following experience
   or practice, and suggest that with greater time since an mTBI, the brain
   displays compensatory remodeling of cortical regions involved in
   emotional regulation, which may reduce distractibility during attention
   demanding visuo-motor tasks. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Title = {{White Matter Microstructure is Associated with Auditory and Tactile
   Processing in Children with and without Sensory Processing Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{Sensory processing disorders (SPDs) affect up to 16\% of school-aged
   children, and contribute to cognitive and behavioral deficits impacting
   affected individuals and their families. While sensory processing
   differences are now widely recognized in children with autism, children
   with sensory-based dysfunction who do not meet autism criteria based on
   social communication deficits remain virtually unstudied. In a previous
   pilot diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) study, we demonstrated that boys
   with SPD have altered white matter microstructure primarily affecting
   the posterior cerebral tracts, which subserve sensory processing and
   integration. This disrupted microstructural integrity, measured as
   reduced white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), correlated with parent
   report measures of atypical sensory behavior. In this present study, we
   investigate white matter microstructure as it relates to tactile and
   auditory function in depth with a larger, mixed-gender cohort of
   children 8-12 years of age. We continue to find robust alterations of
   posterior white matter microstructure in children with SPD relative to
   typically developing children (TDC), along with more spatially
   distributed alterations. We find strong correlations of FA with both
   parent report and direct measures of tactile and auditory processing
   across children, with the direct assessment measures of tactile and
   auditory processing showing a stronger and more continuous mapping to
   the underlying white matter integrity than the corresponding parent
   report measures. Based on these findings of microstructure as a neural
   correlate of sensory processing ability, diffusion MRI merits further
   investigation as a tool to find biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and
   treatment response in children with SPD. To our knowledge, this work is
   the first to demonstrate associations of directly measured tactile and
   non-linguistic auditory function with white matter microstructural
   integrity - not just in children with SPD, but also in TDC.}},

Title = {{Atypical functional connectivity in resting-state networks of
   individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: associations with
   neurocognitive and psychiatric functioning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a neurogenetic
   condition associated with deficits in neuropsychological functioning and
   psychiatric disorders. This deletion confers a high risk for the
   development of psychosis, as approximately 30-45 \% of individuals
   develop psychosis in adulthood. Previous reports of resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) functional connectivity
   patterns in 22q11DS have demonstrated that atypical connectivity is
   associated with both the emergence and severity of psychotic symptoms.
   However, due to sample overlap and large age ranges of samples spanning
   multiple critical periods of brain maturation, more independent studies
   with samples within the window of time when psychotic symptoms have been
   shown to emerge (ages 17-26) are needed. Resting-state networks (RSNs)
   in 22q11DS during this stage of brain development may thus provide
   insight into the dynamic changes in functional integration that
   influence the incidence of prodromal symptoms and neurocognitive
   deficits characteristic of this syndrome.
   Methods: Independent component analysis (ICA) was performed to identify
   RSNs in a combined sample of 55 individuals with 22q11DS (27 males; age
   range 17-26) and 29 controls (17 males; age range 17-23, consisting of 8
   siblings without the deletion and 21 typically developed individuals)
   from two research sites. We conducted a full factorial analysis to
   determine group differences between 22q11DS and controls. A Poisson
   regression analysis was conducted in the 22q11DS group to determine
   relationships of rs-fMRI network connectivity with psychiatric symptoms
   based on factors of the 18-item Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale.
   Nonparametric Spearman correlations were performed to test associations
   between within-network functional connectivity (FC) and performance on
   measures of verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test) and
   executive function (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function
   Adult version) in 22q11DS.
   Results: Between-group network connectivity analyses revealed
   significant differences in 9 RSNs. Decreased network FC in 22q11DS was
   observed in the following networks: high-level visual processing network
   (HLVPN), low-level visual processing network (LLVPN), visual/precuneus
   network, left frontal-parietal network (LFPN), right frontal-parietal
   network (RFPN), and self-referential network (SRN). In contrast, greater
   network FC in 22q11DS was observed in subclusters of the LLVPN,
   visual/precuneus network, limbic network (LN), default mode network
   (DMN), and visuospatial processing network (VSPN). Increased functional
   connectivity of the right cuneus (visual/precuneus network) and right
   superior parietal lobule (DMN) in 22q11DS was positively associated with
   both thought disturbance and disorganization factors of the Brief
   Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Decreased functional connectivity in
   the left posterior cingulate (LLVPN) was associated with higher thought
   disturbance scores in 22q11DS. No associations with our neurocognitive
   measures passed correction for multiple comparisons
   (Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.0014).
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that atypical network connectivity
   within RSNs may be indicative of increased risk for developing psychosis
   and supports the utility of RSNs as biomarkers of prodromal symptoms in
   22q11DS.}},

   Functional Regions of Interest}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{The functional region of interest (fROI) approach has increasingly
   become a favored methodology in functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) because it can circumvent inter-subject anatomical and functional
   variability, and thus increase the sensitivity and functional resolution
   of fMRI analyses. The standard fROI method requires human experts to
   meticulously examine and identify subject-specific fROIs within
   activation clusters. This process is time-consuming and heavily
   dependent on experts' knowledge. Several algorithmic approaches have
   been proposed for identifying subject-specific fROIs; however, these
   approaches cannot easily incorporate prior knowledge of inter-subject
   variability. In the present study, we improved the multi-atlas labeling
   approach for defining subject-specific fROIs. In particular, we used a
   classifier-based atlas-encoding scheme and an atlas selection procedure
   to account for the large spatial variability across subjects. Using a
   functional atlas database for face recognition, we showed that with
   these two features, our approach efficiently circumvented inter-subject
   anatomical and functional variability and thus improved labeling
   accuracy. Moreover, in comparison with a single-atlas approach, our
   multi-atlas labeling approach showed better performance in identifying
   subject-specific fROIs.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{Morphological decomposition is an important part of complex word
   processing. In Chinese, this requires a comprehensive consideration of
   phonological, orthographic and morphemic information. The left inferior
   frontal gyrus (L-IFG) has been implicated in this process in alphabetic
   languages. However, it is unclear whether the neural mechanisms
   underlying morphological processing in alphabetic languages would be the
   same in Chinese, a logographic language. To investigate the neural basis
   of morphological processing in Chinese compound words, an fMRI
   experiment was conducted using an explicit auditory morphological
   judgment task. Results showed the L-IFG to be a core area in Chinese
   morphological processing, consistent with research in alphabetic
   languages. Additionally, a broad network consisting of the L-MTG, the
   bilateral STG and the L-FG that taps phonological, orthographic, and
   semantic information was found to be involved. These results provide
   evidence that the L-IFG plays an important role in morphological
   processing even in languages that are typologically different.}},

Abstract = {{Although robots are becoming an ever-growing presence in society, we do
   not hold the same expectations for robots as we do for humans, nor do we
   treat them the same. As such, the ability to recognize cues to human
   animacy is fundamental for guiding social interactions. We review
   literature that demonstrates cortical networks associated with person
   perception, action observation and mentalizing are sensitive to human
   animacy information. In addition, we show that most prior research has
   explored stimulus properties of artificial agents (humanness of
   appearance or motion), with less investigation into knowledge cues
   (whether an agent is believed to have human or artificial origins).
   Therefore, currently little is known about the relationship between
   stimulus and knowledge cues to human animacy in terms of cognitive and
   brain mechanisms. Using fMRI, an elaborate belief manipulation, and
   human and robot avatars, we found that knowledge cues to human animacy
   modulate engagement of person perception and mentalizing networks, while
   stimulus cues to human animacy had less impact on social brain networks.
   These findings demonstrate that self-other similarities are not only
   grounded in physical features but are also shaped by prior knowledge.
   More broadly, as artificial agents fulfil increasingly social roles, a
   challenge for roboticists will be to manage the impact of pre-conceived
   beliefs while optimizing human-like design.}},

Abstract = {{The short-and long-term impact of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) is
   an increasingly vital concern for both military and civilian personnel.
   Such injuries produce significant social and financial burdens and
   necessitate improved diagnostic and treatment methods. Recent
   integration of neuroimaging and biomechanical studies in youth
   collision-sport athletes has revealed that significant alterations in
   brain structure and function occur even in the absence of traditional
   clinical markers of ``concussion.{''} While task performance is
   maintained, athletes exposed to repetitive head accelerations exhibit
   structural changes to the underlying white matter, altered glial cell
   metabolism, aberrant vascular response, and marked changes in functional
   network behavior. Moreover, these changes accumulate with accrued years
   of exposure, suggesting a cumulative trauma mechanism that may culminate
   in categorization as ``concussion{''} and long-term neurological
   deficits. The goal of this review is to elucidate the role of medical
   imaging in recharacterizing TBI, as a whole, to better identify at-risk
   individuals and improve the development of preventative and
   interventional approaches.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1631}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Face detection, the perceptual capacity to identify a visual stimulus as
   a face before probing deeper into specific attributes (such as its
   identity or emotion), is essential for social functioning. Despite the
   importance of this functional capacity, face detection and its
   underlying brain mechanisms are not well understood. This study
   evaluated the roles that the cortical face processing system, which is
   identified largely through studying other aspects of face perception,
   play in face detection. Specifically, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the activations of the fusifom face
   area (FFA), occipital face area (OFA) and superior temporal sulcus (STS)
   when face detection was isolated from other aspects of face perception
   and when face detection was perceptually equated across individual human
   participants (n=20). During face detection, FFA and OFA were
   significantly activated, even for stimuli presented at
   perceptual-threshold levels, whereas STS was not. During tree detection,
   however, FFA and OFA were responsive only for highly salient (i.e., high
   contrast) stimuli. Moreover, activation of FFA during face detection
   predicted a significant portion of the perceptual performance levels
   that were determined psychophysically for each participant. This pattern
   of result indicates that FFA and OFA have a greater sensitivity to face
   detection signals and selectively support the initial process of face
   vs. non-face object perception. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDPatients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy have reported
   cognitive impairments that may last for years after the completion of
   treatment. Working memory-related and long-term memory-related changes
   in this population are not well understood. The objective of this study
   was to demonstrate that cancer-related cognitive impairments are
   associated with the under recruitment of brain regions involved in
   working and recognition memory compared with controls.
   METHODSOncology patients (n=15) who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy
   and had evidence of cognitive impairment according to neuropsychological
   testing and self-report and a group of age-matched, education
   group-matched, cognitively normal control participants (n=14) underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. During functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, participants performed a nonverbal n-back working
   memory task and a visual recognition task.
   RESULTSOn the working memory task, when 1-back and 2-back data were
   averaged and contrasted with 0-back data, significantly reduced
   activation was observed in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for
   oncology patients versus controls. On the recognition task, oncology
   patients displayed decreased activity of the left-middle hippocampus
   compared with controls. Neuroimaging results were not associated with
   patient-reported cognition.
   CONCLUSIONSDecreased recruitment of brain regions associated with the
   encoding of working memory and recognition memory was observed in the
   oncology patients compared with the control group. These results suggest
   that there is a reduction in neural functioning postchemotherapy and
   corroborate patient-reported cognitive difficulties after cancer
   treatment, although a direct association was not observed. Cancer

   After chemotherapy, patients with cancer exhibit decreased activation in
   brain regions associated with working memory and long-term visual
   recognition memory encoding. The current results corroborate the
   development of patient-reported cognitive impairments after cancer

Abstract = {{Despite intense neurobiological investigation in psychiatric disorders
   like major depressive disorder (MDD), the basic disturbance that
   underlies the psychopathological symptoms of MDD remains, nevertheless,
   unclear. Neuroimaging has focused mainly on the brain's extrinsic
   activity, specifically task-evoked or stimulus-induced activity, as
   related to the various sensorimotor, affective, cognitive, and social
   functions. Recently, the focus has shifted to the brain's intrinsic
   activity, otherwise known as its resting state activity. While various
   abnormalities have been observed during this activity, their meaning and
   significance for depression, along with its various psychopathological
   symptoms, are yet to be defined. Based on findings in healthy brain
   resting state activity and its particular spatial and temporal structure
   - defined in a functional and physiological sense rather than anatomical
   and structural - I claim that the various depressive symptoms are
   spatiotemporal disturbances of the resting state activity and its
   spatiotemporal structure. This is supported by recent findings that link
   ruminations and increased self-focus in depression to abnormal spatial
   organization of resting state activity. Analogously, affective and
   cognitive symptoms like anhedonia, suicidal ideation, and thought
   disorder can be traced to an increased focus on the past, increased
   past-focus as basic temporal disturbance of the resting state. Based on
   these findings, I conclude that the various depressive symptoms must be
   conceived as spatiotemporal disturbances of the brain's resting state's
   activity and its spatiotemporal structure. Importantly, this entails a
   new form of psychopathology, ``Spatiotemporal Psychopathology{''} that
   directly links the brain and psyche, therefore having major diagnostic
   and therapeutic implications for clinical practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{During a dyadic social interaction, two individuals can share visual
   attention through gaze, directed to each other (mutual gaze) or to a
   third person or an object (joint attention). Shared attention is
   fundamental to dyadic face-to-face interaction, but how attention is
   shared, retained, and neutrally represented in a pair-specific manner
   has not been well studied. Here, we conducted a two-day hyperscanning
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which pairs of
   participants performed a real-time mutual gaze task followed by a joint
   attention task on the first day, and mutual gaze tasks several days
   later. The joint attention task enhanced eye-blink synchronization,
   which is believed to be a behavioral index of shared attention. When the
   same participant pairs underwent mutual gaze without joint attention on
   the second day, enhanced eye-blink synchronization persisted, and this
   was positively correlated with inter-individual neural synchronization
   within the right inferior frontal gyrus. Neural synchronization was also
   positively correlated with enhanced eye-blink synchronization during the
   previous joint attention task session. Consistent with the Hebbian
   association hypothesis, the right inferior frontal gyrus had been
   activated both by initiating and responding to joint attention. These
   results indicate that shared attention is represented and retained by
   pair-specific neural synchronization that cannot be reduced to the
   individual level. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{For most people, adolescence is synonymous with emotional turmoil and it
   has been shown that early difficulties with emotion regulation can lead
   to persistent problems for some people. This suggests that intervention
   during development might reduce long-term negative consequences for
   those individuals. Recent research has highlighted the suitability of
   real-time fMRI-based neurofeedback (NF) in training emotion regulation
   (ER) networks in adults. However, its usefulness in directly influencing
   plasticity in the maturing ER networks remains unclear. Here, we used NF
   to teach a group of 17 7-16 year-olds to up-regulate the bilateral
   insula, a key ER region. We found that all participants learned to
   increase activation during the up-regulation trials in comparison to the
   down-regulation trials. Importantly, a subsequent Granger causality
   analysis of Granger information flow within the wider ER network found
   that during up-regulation trials, bottom-up driven Granger information
   flow increased from the amygdala to the bilateral insula and from the
   left insula to the mid-cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area and
   the inferior parietal lobe. This was reversed during the down-regulation
   trials, where we observed an increase in top-down driven Granger
   information flow to the bilateral insula from mid-cingulate cortex,
   pre-central gyrus and inferior parietal lobule. This suggests that: 1)
   NF training had a differential effect on up-regulation vs
   down-regulation network connections, and that 2) our training was not
   only superficially concentrated on surface effects but also relevant
   with regards to the underlying neurocognitive bases. Together these
   findings highlight the feasibility of using NF in children and
   adolescents and its possible use for shaping key social cognitive
   networks during development. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although language is a key tool for communication in social interaction,
   most studies in the neuroscience of language have focused on language
   structures such as words and sentences. Here, the neural correlates of
   speech acts, that is, the actions performed by using language, were
   investigated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Participants were shown videos, in which the same critical utterances
   were used in different communicative contexts, to Name objects, or to
   Request them from communication partners. Understanding of critical
   utterances as Requests was accompanied by activation in bilateral
   premotor, left inferior frontal and temporo-parietal cortical areas
   known to support action-related and social interactive knowledge.
   Naming, however, activated the left angular gyrus implicated in linking
   information about word forms and related reference objects mentioned in
   critical utterances. These findings show that understanding of
   utterances as different communicative actions is reflected in distinct
   brain activation patterns, and thus suggest different neural substrates
   for different speech act types. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{Selective Audiovisual Semantic Integration Enabled by Feature-Selective
   Attention}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{An audiovisual object may contain multiple semantic features, such as
   the gender and emotional features of the speaker. Feature-selective
   attention and audiovisual semantic integration are two brain functions
   involved in the recognition of audiovisual objects. Humans often
   selectively attend to one or several features while ignoring the other
   features of an audiovisual object. Meanwhile, the human brain integrates
   semantic information from the visual and auditory modalities. However,
   how these two brain functions correlate with each other remains to be
   elucidated. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study,
   we explored the neural mechanism by which feature-selective attention
   modulates audiovisual semantic integration. During the fMRI experiment,
   the subjects were presented with visual-only, auditory-only, or
   audiovisual dynamical facial stimuli and performed several
   feature-selective attention tasks. Our results revealed that a
   distribution of areas, including heteromodal areas and brain areas
   encoding attended features, may be involved in audiovisual semantic
   integration. Through feature-selective attention, the human brain may
   selectively integrate audiovisual semantic information from attended
   features by enhancing functional connectivity and thus regulating
   information flows from heteromodal areas to brain areas encoding the
   attended features.}},

   on Brain Activations during the Aesthetic Judgment of Representational}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{Movement perception and its role in aesthetic experience have been often
   studied, within empirical aesthetics, in relation to the human body. No
   such specificity has been defined in neuroimaging studies with respect
   to contents lacking a human form. The aim of this work was to explore,
   through functional magnetic imaging (fMRI), how perceived movement is
   processed during the aesthetic judgment of paintings using two types of
   content: human subjects and scenes of nature. Participants, untutored in
   the arts, were shown the stimuli and asked to make aesthetic judgments.
   Additionally, they were instructed to observe the paintings and to rate
   their perceived movement in separate blocks. Observation highlighted
   spontaneous processes associated with aesthetic experience, whereas
   movement judgment outlined activations specifically related to movement
   processing. The ratings recorded during aesthetic judgment revealed that
   nature scenes received higher scored than human content paintings. The
   imaging data showed similar activation, relative to baseline, for all
   stimuli in the three tasks, including activation of occipito-temporal
   areas, posterior parietal, and premotor cortices. Contrast analyses
   within aesthetic judgment task showed that human content activated,
   relative to nature, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and posterior temporal
   areas, whose activation was prominent for dynamic human paintings. In
   contrast, nature scenes activated, relative to human stimuli, occipital
   and posterior parietal cortex/precuneus, involved in visuospatial
   exploration and pragmatic coding of movement, as well as central insula.
   Static nature paintings further activated, relative to dynamic nature
   stimuli, central and posterior insula. Besides insular activation, which
   was specific for aesthetic judgment, we found a large overlap in the
   activation pattern characterizing each stimulus dimension (content and
   dynamism) across observation, aesthetic judgment, and movement judgment
   tasks. These findings support the idea that the aesthetic evaluation of
   artworks depicting both human subjects and nature scenes involves a
   motor component, and that the associated neural processes occur quite
   spontaneously in the viewer. Furthermore, considering the functional
   roles of posterior and central insula, we suggest that nature paintings
   may evoke aesthetic processes requiring an additional proprioceptive and
   sensori -motor component implemented by ``motor accessibility{''} to the
   represented scenario, which is needed to judge the aesthetic value of
   the observed painting.}},

   judgment) or positive/neutral outcomes with helpful/neutral intentions
   (helpful judgment). Significant ERP differences between attempted and
   successful actions over prefrontal and bilateral temporo-parietal
   regions were found in both harmful and helpful moral judgment, which
   suggest a possible time course of the integration processing in the
   brain, starting from the right temporo-parietal area (N180) to the left
   temporo-parietal area (N250), then the prefrontal area (FSW) and the
   right temporo-parietal area (TP450 and TPSW) again. These results
   highlighted the fast moral intuition reaction and the late integration
   processing over the right temporo-parietal area.}},

Title = {{Effect of Frustration on Brain Activation Pattern in Subjects with

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{In spite of the prevalence of frustration in everyday life, very few
   neuroimaging studies were focused on this emotional state. In the
   current study we aimed to examine effects of frustration on brain
   activity while performing a well-learned task in participants with low
   and high tolerance for arousal. Prior to the functional magnetic
   resonance imaging session, the subjects underwent 2 weeks of Braille
   reading training. Frustration induction was obtained by using a novel
   highly difficult tactile task based on discrimination of Braille-like
   raised dots patterns and negative feedback. Effectiveness of this
   procedure has been confirmed in a pilot study using galvanic skin
   response and questionnaires. Brain activation pattern during tactile
   discrimination task before and after frustration were compared directly.
   Results revealed changes in brain activity in structures mostly reported
   in acute stress studies: striatum, cingulate cortex, insula, middle
   frontal gyrus and precuneus and in structures engaged in tactile Braille
   discrimination: SI and SII. Temperament type affected activation
   pattern. Subjects with low tolerance for arousal showed higher
   activation in the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and inferior
   parietal lobule than high reactivity group. Even though performance in
   the discrimination trials following frustration was unaltered, we
   observed increased activity of primary and secondary somatosensory
   cortex processing the tactile information. We interpret this effect as
   an indicator of additional involvement required to counteract the
   effects of frustration.}},

   processing: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{71-78}},
Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{This fMRI study aimed at investigating how differences in personality
   traits affect the processing of dynamic and natural gestures containing
   social versus nonsocial intent. We predicted that while processing
   gestures with social intent extraversion would be associated with
   increased activity within the reticulothalamic-cortical arousal system
   (RTCS), while neuroticism would be associated with increased activity in
   emotion processing circuits. The obtained findings partly support our
   hypotheses. We found a positive correlation between bilateral thalamic
   activity and extraversion scores while participants viewed social
   (versus nonsocial) gestures. For neuroticism, the data revealed a more
   complex activation pattern. Activity in the bilateral frontal operculum
   and anterior insula, extending into bilateral putamen and right
   amygdala, was moderated as a function of actor-orientation (i.e., first
   versus third-person engagement) and face-visibility (actor faces visible
   versus blurred). Our findings point to the existence of factors other
   than emotional valence that can influence social gesture processing in
   particular, and social cognitive affective processing in general, as a
   function of personality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   perceptual stages of face processing}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{115-125}},
Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{It is frequently assumed that facial identity and facial expression are
   analysed in functionally and anatomically distinct streams within the
   core visual face processing system. To investigate whether expression
   and identity interact during the visual processing of faces, we employed
   a sequential matching procedure where participants compared either the
   identity or the expression of two successively presented faces, and
   ignored the other irrelevant dimension. Repetitions versus changes of
   facial identity and expression were varied independently across trials,
   and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during task
   performance. Irrelevant facial identity and irrelevant expression both
   interfered with performance in the expression and identity matching
   tasks. These symmetrical interference effects show that neither identity
   nor expression can be selectively ignored during face matching, and
   suggest that they are not processed independently. N250r components to
   identity repetitions that reflect identity matching mechanisms in
   face-selective visual cortex were delayed and attenuated when there was
   an expression change, demonstrating that facial expression interferes
   with visual identity matching. These findings provide new evidence for
   interactions between facial identity and expression within the core
   visual processing system, and question the hypothesis that these two
   attributes are processed independently. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Stress research has progressively become more integrative in nature,
   seeking to unfold crucial relations between the different phenotypic
   levels of stress manifestations. This study sought to unravel
   stress-induced variations in expression of human microRNAs sampled in
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells and further assess their relationship
   with neuronal and psychological indices.
   We obtained blood samples from 49 healthy male participants before and
   three hours after performing a social stress task, while undergoing
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A seed-based functional
   connectivity (FC) analysis was conducted for the ventro-medial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a key area of stress regulation. Out of
   hundreds of microRNAs, a specific increase was identified in
   microRNA-29c (miR-29c) expression, corresponding with both the
   experience of sustained stress via self-reports, and alterations in
   vmPFC functional connectivity. Explicitly, miR-29c expression levels
   corresponded with both increased connectivity of the vmPFC with the
   anterior insula (alns), and decreased connectivity of the vmPFC with the
   left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Our findings further
   revealed that miR-29c mediates an indirect path linking enhanced
   vmPFC-alns connectivity during stress with subsequent experiences of
   sustained stress. The correlative patterns of miR-29c expression and
   vmPFC FC, along with the mediating effects on subjective stress
   sustainment and the presumed localization of miR-29c in astrocytes,
   together point to an intriguing assumption; miR-29c may serve as a
   biomarker in the blood for stress-induced functional neural alterations
   reflecting regulatory processes. Such a multi-level model may hold the
   key for future personalized intervention in stress psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Deficits in empathy enhance conflicts and human suffering. Thus, it is
   crucial to understand how empathy can be learned and how learning
   experiences shape empathy-related processes in the human brain. As a
   model of empathy deficits, we used the well-established suppression of
   empathy-related brain responses for the suffering of out-groups and
   tested whether and how out-group empathy is boosted by a learning
   intervention. During this intervention, participants received costly
   help equally often from an out-group member (experimental group) or an
   in-group member (control group). We show that receiving help from an
   out-group member elicits a classical learning signal (prediction error)
   in the anterior insular cortex. This signal in turn predicts a
   subsequent increase of empathy for a different out-group member
   (generalization). The enhancement of empathy-related insula responses by
   the neural prediction error signal was mediated by an establishment of
   positive emotions toward the out-group member. Finally, we show that
   surprisingly few positive learning experiences are sufficient to
   increase empathy. Our results specify the neural and psychological
   mechanisms through which learning interacts with empathy, and thus
   provide a neurobiological account for the plasticity of empathic
   reactions.}},

Title = {{Haptically Guided Grasping. fMRI Shows Right-Hemisphere Parietal
   Stimulus Encoding, and Bilateral Dorso-Ventral Parietal Gradients of
   Object- and Action-Related Processing during Grasp Execution}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{The neural bases of haptically-guided grasp planning and execution are
   largely unknown, especially for stimuli having no visual
   representations. Therefore, we used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain activity during haptic exploration of
   novel 3D complex objects, subsequent grasp planning, and the execution
   of the pre-planned grasps. Haptic object exploration, involving
   extraction of shape, orientation, and length of the to-be-grasped
   targets, was associated with the fronto-parietal, temporo-occipital, and
   insular cortex activity. Yet, only the anterior divisions of the
   posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of the right hemisphere were
   significantly more engaged in exploration of complex objects (vs. simple
   control disks). None of these regions were re-recruited during the
   planning phase. Even more surprisingly, the left-hemisphere
   intraparietal, temporal, and occipital areas that were significantly
   invoked for grasp planning did not show sensitivity to object features.
   Finally, grasp execution, involving the re-recruitment of the critical
   right-hemisphere PPC clusters, was also significantly associated with
   two kinds of bilateral parieto-frontal processes. The first represents
   transformations of grasp-relevant target features and is linked to the
   dorso-dorsal (lateral and medial) parieto-frontal networks. The second
   monitors grasp kinematics and belongs to the ventro-dorsal networks.
   Indeed, signal modulations associated with these distinct functions
   follow dorso-ventral gradients, with left alPS showing significant
   sensitivity to both target features and the characteristics of the
   required grasp. Thus, our results from the haptic domain are consistent
   with the notion that the parietal processing for action guidance
   reflects primarily transformations from object-related to
   effector-related coding, and these mechanisms are rather independent of
   sensory input modality.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Resting-state functionalmagnetic resonance imaging studies
   examining low frequency fluctuations (0.01-0.08 Hz) have revealed
   atypical whole brain functional connectivity patterns in adolescents
   with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and these atypical patterns can be
   used to discriminate individuals with ASD from controls. However, at
   present it is unknown whether functional connectivity at specific
   frequency bands can be used to discriminate individuals with ASD from
   controls, and whether relationships with symptom severity are stronger
   in specific frequency bands.
   Methods: We selected 240 adolescent subjects (12-18 years old, 112 with
   autism spectrum disorder (101/11, males/females) and 128 healthy
   controls (104/24, males/females)) from 6 separate international sites in
   the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange database. Whole brain functional
   connectivity networks were constructed in the Slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) and
   Slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) frequency bands, which were then used as
   classification features.
   Results: An accuracy of 79.17\% (p < 0.001) was obtained using support
   vectormachine. Most of the discriminative features were concentrated on
   the Slow-4 band. In the Slow-4 band, atypical connections between the
   default mode network, fronto-parietal network and cingulo-opercular
   network were detected. A significant correlation was found between
   social and communication deficits as measured by the ADOS in individuals
   with ASD and the classification scores based on connectivity between the
   default mode network and the cingulo-opercular network. Connections of
   the thalamus were of the highest classification weight in the Slow-4
   band.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide preliminary evidence for
   frequency-specificwhole brain functional connectivity indices that may
   eventually be used to aid detection of ASD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In recent years, major depressive disorder (MDD) has been demonstrated
   to be associated with abnormalities in neural networks, particularly the
   prefrontal-limbic network (PLN). However, there are few current studies
   that have examined information flow in the PLN. In this study, Granger
   causality analysis (GCA), based on signed regression coefficient, was
   used to explore changes in causal connectivity in resting-state PLNs of
   MDD patients. A total of 23 first-episode medication-naive MDD patients
   and 20 normal control participants were subjected to resting- state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) scans. Increased causal
   effects of the right insular cortex, right putamen and right caudate on
   the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and reduced causal effects
   of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) on the rACC were found in MDD patients
   compared to normal controls. The extensive reduction in the causal
   effect of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) demonstrates impaired top-down
   cognitive control in MDD patients. Changes in the causal relationship
   between the right insula and rACC suggest problems in coordination of
   the default mode network by the right anterior insular cortex (rAI).
   These findings provide valuable insight into MDD-related neural network
   disorders reported in previous RS-fMRI studies and may potentially guide
   clinical treatment of MDD in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Objectives: Research into the neural basis of social anxiety disorder
   (SAD) suggests alterations in prefrontal networks, which may in turn
   disrupt regulation of the limbic system. Better understanding of the
   disturbed interface between these networks may improve current
   pathogenic models of this disorder. Methods: Applying group independent
   component analysis (ICA) to recordings of fMRI resting-state,
   connectivity in the executive control network was studied in 18 patients
   with SAD and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Results: Results
   revealed a dissociation within the left executive control network, with
   SAD patients showing decreased connectivity of the orbitofrontal gyrus
   and increased connectivity of the middle frontal gyrus compared to
   healthy controls. In a subsequent seed-based functional connectivity
   analysis, patients with SAD displayed increased connectivity between the
   left orbitofrontal gyrus and the left amygdala. Conclusions: Findings
   suggest that hypo-connectivity in the executive control network and
   hyper-connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala may
   reflect a disturbance in the balance between top-down and bottom-up
   control processes, potentially contributing to the development of SAD.}},

Abstract = {{Current theory suggests that the processing of different types of threat
   is supported by distinct neural networks. Here we tested whether there
   are distinct neural correlates associated with different types of threat
   processing in shyness. Using fMRI and multivariate techniques, we
   compared neural responses and functional connectivity during the
   processing of imminent (i.e., congruent angry/angry face pairs) and
   ambiguous (i.e., incongruent angry/neutral face pairs) social threat in
   young adults selected for high and low shyness. To both types of threat
   processing, non-shy adults recruited a right medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) network encompassing nodes of the default mode network involved
   in automatic emotion regulation, whereas shy adults recruited a right
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) network encompassing nodes of
   the frontoparietal network that instantiate active attentional and
   cognitive control. Furthermore, in shy adults, the mPFC interacted with
   the dACC network for ambiguous threat, but with a distinct network
   encompassing nodes of the salience network for imminent threat. These
   preliminary results expand our understanding of right mPFC function
   associated with temperamental shyness. They also provide initial
   evidence for differential neural networks associated with shy and
   non-shy profiles in the context of different types of social threat
   processing.}},

   contributions to educational psychology, have continued growing without
   interruption. In this paper, three of Vygotsky's hypotheses are examined
   in light of 21st century scientific developments:
   1) The influence of cultural factors on human cognition. A diversity of
   research studies in different countries has corroborated the crucial
   impact of culture on cognitive test performance;
   2) The role of language in higher psychological processes. According to
   Vygotsky's cultural-historical approach, cognitive processes
   ({''}complex psychological processes{''}) are social in origin, but
   complex and hierarchical in their structure. Intrinsic to the systemic
   organization of higher cognitive processes is the engagement of external
   artifacts (objects, symbols, signs), which have an independent history
   of development within a culture; and
   3) The hypothesis that thought and general complex cognition is
   associated with certain ``inner speech.{''} Some contemporary
   neuroimaging studies (particularly PET and fMRI) analyzing ``inner
   speech{''} have been carried out. These studies have attempted to find
   the areas of the brain involved in ``inner speech.{''} These scientific
   advances significantly support Vygotsky's interpretation of human
   cognition. It has been found that inner speech depends on activity in
   Broca's area and related brain network activity in the left hemisphere.
   Hence, inner speech is closely related to grammar, language production,
   and executive functions.
   Vygotsky's important contribution to the understanding of psychological
   processes has stimulated, and continues to stimulate, a substantial
   amount of research in this area.}},

Title = {{Developing a Social Cognition Task for fMRI in Patients with Mild
   Traumatic Brain Injury}},
Journal = {{UNIVERSITAS PSYCHOLOGICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Social cognition impairments are frequently found in patients with mild
   traumatic brain injury (TBI) when structural lesions may not reveal the
   severity of the injury. Though instruments used to assess social
   behavior are thought to be sensitive, the absence of structural damage
   in TBI patients may lead to underscore such problems. The aim of this
   study was to develop a complementary diagnostic tool such as a paradigm
   for functional Magnetic resonance Imaging (fMRI) involving a simple task
   that could tell how patients understand certain complex social behavior
   by identifying different movements with or without social intentions
   where language and complex cognitive process were not required. Eleven
   patients with mild TBI and social cognition difficulties and twelve
   control subjects were matched by demographic variables. A paradigm of
   social fMRI was developed by using dots in movement representing human
   motion, human motion with social intention such as dancing or sharing,
   and dots moving without meaning. Patients had less activation in
   parietotemporal junction and bilateral middle frontal gyrus in the
   social perception task movement compared with control group subjects.
   The fMRI paradigm developed can be an additional diagnostic tool for
   identifying social cognition impairments in mild TBI patients.
   Regardless the absence of structural injury, changes in activation areas
   suggest a prospective use of this tool since clinical, cognitive and
   functional outcomes support such finding.}},

   threshold parameter}},
Journal = {{METHODSX}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{477-482}},
Abstract = {{Cluster-based analysis methods in neuroimaging provide control of
   whole-brain false positive rates without the need to conservatively
   correct for the number of voxels and the associated false negative
   results. The current method defines clusters based purely on shapes in
   the landscape of activation, instead of requiring the choice of a
   statistical threshold that may strongly affect results. Statistical
   significance is determined using permutation testing, combining both
   size and height of activation. A method is proposed for dealing with
   relatively small local peaks. Simulations confirm the method controls
   the false positive rate and correctly identifies regions of activation.
   The method is also illustrated using real data.
   A landscape-based method to define clusters in neuroimaging data avoids
   the need to pre-specify a threshold to define clusters.
   The implementation of the method works as expected, based on simulated
   and real data.
   The recursive method used for defining clusters, the method used for
   combining clusters, and the definition of the ``value{''} of a cluster
   may be of interest for future variations. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Abstract = {{Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) display an
   impoverished sense of self and representations of self and others that
   shift between positive and negative poles. However, little research has
   investigated the nature of representational disturbance in BPD. The
   present study takes a multimodal approach. A card sort task was used to
   investigate complexity, integration, and valence of self-representation
   in BPD. Impairment in maintenance of self and other representations was
   assessed using a personality representational maintenance task. Finally,
   functional MRI (fMRI) was used to assess whether individuals with BPD
   show neural abnormalities related specifically to the self and what
   brain areas may be related to poor representational maintenance.
   Individuals with BPD sorted self-aspects suggesting more complexity of
   self-representation, but also less integration and more negative valence
   overall. On the representational maintenance task, individuals with BPD
   showed less consistency in their representations of self and others over
   the 3-hr period, but only for abstract, personality-based
   representations. Performance on this measure mediated between-groups
   brain activation in several areas supporting social cognition. We found
   no evidence for social-cognitive disturbance specific to the self.
   Additionally, the BPD group showed main effects, insensitive to
   condition, of hyperactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex, temporal
   parietal junction, several regions of the frontal pole, the precuneus
   and middle temporal gyrus, all areas crucial social cognition. In
   contrast, controls evidenced greater activation in visual, sensory,
   motor, and mirror neuron regions. These findings are discussed in
   relation to research regarding hypermentalization and the overlap
   between self-and other-disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Addiction is a chronic relapsing brain disease. Brain
   structural abnormalities may constitute an abnormal neural network that
   underlies the risk of drug dependence. We hypothesized that individuals
   with Betel Quid Dependence (BQD) have functional connectivity
   alterations that can be described by long- and short-range functional
   connectivity density(FCD) maps. Methods: We tested this hypothesis using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from subjects of the
   Han ethnic group in Hainan, China. Here, we examined BQD individuals (n
   = 33) and age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n =
   32) in a rs-fMRI study to observe FCD alterations associated with the
   severity of BQD. Results: Compared with HCs, long-range FCD was
   decreased in the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and increased in
   the left cerebellum posterior lobe (CPL) and bilateral inferior parietal
   lobule (IPL) in the BQD group. Short-range FCD was reduced in the right
   ACC and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dIPFC), and increased in
   the left CPL The short-range FCD alteration in the right ACC displayed a
   negative correlation with the Betel Quid Dependence Scale (B(JDS) (r=
   -0.432, P=0.012), and the long-range FCD alteration of left IPL showed a
   positive correlation with the duration of BQD(r=0.519, P=0.002) in BQD
   individuals. Conclusions: fMRI revealed differences in long- and short-
   range FCD in BQD individuals, and these alterations might be due to BQ
   chewing, BQ dependency, or risk factors for developing BQD. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Testosterone Modulates Altered Prefrontal Control of Emotional Actions
   in Psychopathic Offenders}},
Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Psychopathic individuals are notorious for their controlled
   goal-directed aggressive behavior. Yet, during social challenges, they
   often show uncontrolled emotional behavior. Healthy individuals can
   control their social emotional behavior through anterior prefrontal
   cortex (aPFC) downregulation of neural activity in the amygdala, with
   testosterone modulating aPFC-amygdala coupling. This study tests whether
   individual differences in this neuroendocrine system relate to the
   paradoxical lack of emotional control observed in human psychopathic
   offenders. Emotional control was operationalized with an fMRI-adapted
   approach-avoidance task requiring rule-driven control over rapid
   emotional responses. Fifteen psychopathic offenders and 19 matched
   healthy control subjects made approaching and avoiding movements in
   response to emotional faces. Control of social emotional behavior was
   required during affectincongruent trials, when participants had to
   override affect-congruent, automatic action tendencies and select the
   opposite response. Psychopathic offenders showed less control-related
   aPFC activity and aPFC-amygdala coupling during trials requiring control
   of emotional actions, when compared with healthy control subjects. This
   pattern was particularly pronounced in psychopathic individuals with
   high endogenous testosterone levels. These findings suggest that reduced
   prefrontal coordination underlies reduced behavioral control in
   psychopathic offenders during emotionally provoking situations. Even
   though the modest sample size warrants replication, the modulatory role
   of endogenous testosterone on the aPFC-amygdala circuit suggests a
   neurobiological substrate of individual differences that is relevant for
   the advancement of treatment and the reduction of recidivism.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{In high-dimensional data, structured noise caused by observed and
   unobserved factors affecting multiple target variables simultaneously,
   imposes a serious challenge for modeling, by masking the often weak
   signal. Therefore, (1) explaining away the structured noise in
   multiple-output regression is of paramount importance. Additionally, (2)
   assumptions about the correlation structure of the regression weights
   are needed. We note that both can be formulated in a natural way in a
   latent variable model, in which both the interesting signal and the
   noise are mediated through the same latent factors. Under this
   assumption, the signal model then borrows strength from the noise model
   by encouraging similar effects on correlated targets. We introduce a
   hyperparameter for the latent signal-to-noise ratio which turns out to
   be important for modelling weak signals, and an ordered infinite
   dimensional shrinkage prior that resolves the rotational

Journal = {{COGENT PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{The human amygdala consciously and nonconsciously processes facial
   expressions and directs spatial attention to them. Research has shown
   that amygdala activity habituates after repeated exposure to emotionally
   salient stimuli during passive viewing tasks. However, it is unclear to
   what extent the amygdala habituates during biologically relevant
   amygdala-mediated behaviors, such as the orienting of attention to
   environmentally salient social signals. The present study investigated
   amygdala habituation during a dot-probe task measuring attentional bias
   to backward masked fearful faces. The results suggest that across the
   duration of the 50min (1,098 trial) task both attentional bias behavior
   and amygdala activity were sustainedrather than habituated. Thus, these
   initial findings indicate that when biologically relevant behavior is
   sustained, so too is amygdala activation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety-spectrum
   disorder that affects 1-2\% of the adult population. People with OCD are
   more likely to report impaired social and occupational functioning.
   Although effective treatments of the OCD exist, many sufferers from this
   disorder are continuously misdiagnosed. Therefore, improving the
   assessment of the OCD remains an important area of scientific research.
   The main goal of the study is the initial verification of psychometric
   properties in the Polish version of the Obsessive-Compulsive
   Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) in a college student sample. Material and
   Methods: A group of students completed a battery of measures consisting
   of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (The OCI-R, The Yale-Brown Obsessive
   Compulsive Scale), depression (The Beck Depression Inventory) and
   anxiety trait (The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). Results: A
   confirmatory factor analysis, conducted on data from 334 university
   students, supported a solid and replicable 6-fold factor structure of
   the OCI-R. Further analyses on test-retest reliability (following a
   1-month interval), convergent and divergent validity of the OCI-R were
   respectively conducted in a group of 137 students who had completed a
   battery of measures mentioned above. The results showed adequate
   test-retest reliability for the full scale and subscales cores, high
   internal consistency and confirmed satisfactory convergent and divergent
   validity. Conclusions: The study constitutes the first phase of work on
   a Polish version of measurement for obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
   Satisfactory results obtained in a non-clinical sample allow to
   recognize this method to be promising for further research.}},

Title = {{Amplitude variability over trials in hemodynamic responses in
   adolescents with ADHD: The role of the anterior default mode network and
   the non-specific role of the striatum}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{397-404}},
Abstract = {{It has been suggested that intra-individual variability (IIV) in
   performance on attention and other cognitive tasks might be a cognitive
   endophenotype in individuals with ADHD. Despite robust IIV findings in
   behavioral data, only sparse data exist on how what type of brain
   dysfunction underlies variable response times. In this study, we asked
   whether ADHD IIV in reaction time on a commonly-used test of attention
   might be related to variation in hemodynamic responses (HRs) observed
   trial-to-trial. Based on previous studies linking IIV to regions within
   the ``default mode{''} network (DMN), we predicted that adolescentswith
   ADHD would have higher HR variability in the DMN compared with controls,
   and this in turn would be related to behavioral IIV. We also explored
   the influence of social anxiety on HR variability in ADHD as means to
   test whether higher arousal associated with high trait anxiety would
   affect the neural abnormalities. We assessed single-trial variability of
   HRs, estimated from fMRI event-related responses elicited during an
   auditory oddball paradigm in adolescents with ADHD and healthy controls
   (11-18 years old; N = 46). Adolescents with ADHD had higher HR
   variability compared with controls in anterior regions of the DMN. This
   effect was specific to ADHD and not associated with traits of age, IQ
   and anxiety. However, an ADHD effect of higher HR variability also
   appeared in a basal ganglia network, but for these brain regions the
   relationships of HR variability and social anxiety levels were more
   complex. Performance IIV correlated significantlywith variability of HRs
   in both networks. These results suggest that assessment of
   trial-to-trial HR variability in ADHD provides information beyond that
   detectable through analysis of behavioral data and average brain
   activation levels, revealing specific neural correlates of a possible
   ADHD IIV endophenotype. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Aberrant prefrontal beta oscillations predict episodic memory encoding
   deficits in schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{499-505}},
Abstract = {{Verbal episodic memory is one of the core cognitive functions affected
   in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Although this verbal memory
   impairment in SZ is a well-known finding, our understanding about its
   underlying neurophysiological mechanisms is rather scarce. Here we
   address this issue by recording brain oscillations during a memory task
   in a sample of healthy controls and patients with SZ. Brain oscillations
   represent spectral fingerprints of specific neurocognitive operations
   and are therefore a promising tool to identify neurocognitive mechanisms
   that are affected by SZ. Healthy controls showed a prominent suppression
   of left prefrontal beta oscillatory activity during successful memory
   formation, which replicates several previous oscillatory memory studies.
   In contrast, patients failed to exhibit such a left prefrontal beta
   power suppression. Utilizing a new topographical pattern similarity
   approach, we further demonstrate that the degree of similarity between a
   patient's beta power decrease to that of the controls reliably predicted
   memory performance. This relationship between beta power decreases and
   memory was such that the patients' memory performance improved as they
   showed a more similar topographical beta desynchronization pattern
   compared to that of healthy controls. Together, these findings support
   left prefrontal beta desynchronization as the spectral fingerprint of
   verbal episodic memory formation, likely indicating deep semantic
   processing of verbal material. These findings also demonstrate that left
   prefrontal beta power suppression (or lack thereof) during memory
   encoding are a reliable biomarker for the observed encoding impairments
   in SZ in verbal memory. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

   and reward processing and may engender gaming behaviors or trigger
   relapse, ameliorating cue-induced craving may be a promising target for
   interventions for IGD. This study compared neural activation between 40
   IGD and 19 healthy control (HC) subjects during an Internet-gaming
   cue-reactivity task and found that IGD subjects showed stronger
   activation in multiple brain areas, including the dorsal striatum,
   brainstem, substantia nigra, and anterior cingulate cortex, but lower
   activation in the posterior insula. Furthermore, twenty-three IGD
   subjects (CBI+ group) participated in a craving behavioral intervention
   (CBI) group therapy, whereas the remaining 17 IGD subjects (CBI-group)
   did not receive any intervention, and all IGD subjects were scanned
   during similar time intervals. The CBI+ group showed decreased IGD
   severity and cue-induced craving, enhanced activation in the anterior
   insula and decreased insular connectivity with the lingual gyrus and
   precuneus after receiving CBI. These findings suggest that CBI is
   effective in reducing craving and severity in IGD, and it may exert its
   effects by altering insula activation and its connectivity with regions
   involved in visual processing and attention bias. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Pages = {{698-706}},
Abstract = {{Background: Despite considerable effort, the neurobiological
   underpinnings of hyper-responsive threat processing specific to patients
   suffering fromgeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD) remain poorly
   understood. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study aims to delineate GAD-specific brain activity during immediate
   threat processing by comparing GAD patients to healthy controls (HC), to
   social anxiety disorder (SAD) and to panic disorder (PD) patients.
   Method: Brain activation and functional connectivity patterns to threat
   vs. neutral pictures were investigated using event-related fMRI. The
   sample consisted of 21 GAD, 21 PD, 21 SAD and 21 HC.
   Results: GAD-specific elevated activity to threat vs. neutral pictures
   was found in cingulate cortex, dorsal anterior insula/frontal operculum
   (daI/FO) and posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Defining
   these effects as seed regions, we detected GAD-specific increased
   functional connectivity to threat vs. neutral pictures between posterior
   dlPFC and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, between cingulate cortex and
   amygdala, between cingulate cortex and anterior insula, as well as
   decreased functional connectivity between daI/FO and mid-dlPFC.
   Conclusion: The findings present the first evidence for GAD-specific
   neural correlates of hyper-responsive threat processing, possibly
   reflecting exaggerated threat sensitivity, maladaptive appraisal and
   attention-allocation processes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{The polygenic risk for bipolar disorder influences brain regional
   function relating to visual and default state processing of emotional
   information}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{838-844}},
Abstract = {{Genome-wise association studies have identified a number of common
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each of small effect, associated
   with risk to bipolar disorder (BD). Several risk-conferring SNPs have
   been individually shown to influence regional brain activation thus
   linking genetic risk for BD to altered brain function. The current study
   examined whether the polygenic risk score method, which models the
   cumulative load of all known risk-conferring SNPs, may be useful in the
   identification of brain regions whose function may be related to the
   polygenic architecture of BD. We calculated the individual polygenic
   risk score for BD (PGR-BD) in forty-one patients with the disorder,
   twenty-five unaffected first-degree relatives and forty-six unrelated
   healthy controls using the most recent Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
   data. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to define
   task-related brain activation patterns in response to facial affect and
   working memory processing. We found significant effects of the PGR-BD
   score on task-related activation irrespective of diagnostic group. There
   was a negative association between the PGR-BD score and activation in
   the visual association cortex during facial affect processing. In
   contrast, the PGR-BD score was associated with failure to deactivate the
   ventromedial prefrontal region of the default mode network during
   working memory processing. These results are consistent with the
   threshold-liability model of BD, and demonstrate the usefulness of the
   PGR-BD score in identifying brain functional alternations associated
   with vulnerability to BD. Additionally, our findings suggest that the
   polygenic architecture of BD is not regionally confined but impacts on
   the task-dependent recruitment of multiple brain regions. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Neural basis of distorted self-face recognition in social anxiety
   disorder}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{956-964}},
Abstract = {{Background: The observer perspective causes patients with social anxiety
   disorder (SAD) to excessively inspect their performance and appearance.
   This study aimed to investigate the neural basis of distorted self-face
   recognition in non-social situations in patients with SAD.
   Methods: Twenty patients with SAD and 20 age-and gender-matched healthy
   controls participated in this fMRI study. Data were acquired while
   participants performed a Composite Face Evaluation Task, during which
   they had to press a button indicating how much they liked a series of
   self-faces, attractively transformed self-faces, and attractive others'
   faces.
   Results: Patients had a tendency to show more favorable responses to the
   self-face and unfavorable responses to the others' faces compared with
   controls, but the two groups' responses to the attractively transformed
   self-faces did not differ. Significant group differences in regional
   activity were observed in the middle frontal and supramarginal gyri in
   the self-face condition (patients < controls); the inferior frontal
   gyrus in the attractively transformed self-face condition (patients >
   controls); and the middle frontal, supramarginal, and angular gyri in
   the attractive others' face condition (patients > controls). Most
   fronto-parietal activities during observation of the self-face were
   negatively correlated with preference scores in patients but not in
   controls.
   Conclusion: Patients with SAD have a positive point of view of their own
   face and experience self-relevance for the attractively transformed
   self-faces. This distorted cognition may be based on dysfunctions in the
   frontal and inferior parietal regions. The abnormal engagement of the
   fronto-parietal attentional network during processing face stimuli in
   non-social situations may be linked to distorted self-recognition in
   SAD. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{The evaluation of affection in human-robot interaction}},
Journal = {{KYBERNETES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1257-1272}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel method for
   evaluation of human-robot affection. The model is inspired by the
   scientific methods of human-human love evaluation. This paper would
   benefit the researchers in the field of developing new technologies
   where emotional interaction is involved.
   Design/methodology/approach - Among the two available options of
   Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and user study, the latter
   is adopted and the conventional method of Love Attitude Scale is
   transformed for human-robot interaction as Lovotics (love + robotics)
   Love Attitude Scale. A user study is conducted to evaluate the emotional
   effect of interaction with the robot.
   Findings - The proposed method is employed in order to evaluate the
   performance of Lovotics robot. In total, 20 users experienced
   interaction with Lovotics robot and answered questionnaires which were
   designed based on the psychology of love, especially to measure love
   scales between the participants and the robot. Data from the user study
   are analyzed statistically to evaluate the overall performance of the
   designed robot.
   Research limitations/implications - Various aspects including human to
   robot love styles, robot to human love styles, overall love values and
   gender study are investigated during the data analysis. The concept of
   human-robot affection is still in initial stage of development. Personal
   and social robots are increasing and much limitation from artificial
   intelligence, mechanical development and integration still exist.
   Practical implications - This is a multidisciplinary research field
   utilizing fundamentals concepts from robotics, artificial intelligence,
   philosophy, psychology, biology, anthropology, neuroscience, social
   science, computer science and engineering.
   Social implications - Considering the recent technical advancement in
   robotics which is brining robots closer to home, this paper aims to
   bridge the gap between human and robot affection measurement. The final
   goal is to introduce robots to the society which are useful and can be
   especially used to take care of those in need such as elderly.
   Originality/value - This paper is one of the first kind to get inspired
   from scientific human love evaluation methods and apply that to
   human-robot application.}},

Abstract = {{Globalization phenomena and Information \& Communication Technology
   (ICT) are producing deep changes worldwide. The economic environment and
   society where firms both cooperate and compete with each other are
   rapidly changing leading firms towards recognizing the role of
   intangible resources as a source of fresh competitive advantage.
   Experience, innovation and the ability to create new knowledge
   completely arise from the act of human resources inviting firms to focus
   on how to generate and shape knowledge. Therefore, the future of firms
   depends greatly on how managers are able to explore and exploit human
   resources.
   However, without a clear understanding of the nature of human beings and
   the complexity behind human interactions, we cannot understand the
   theory of organizational knowledge creation. Thus, how can firms
   discover, manage and valorize this ``human advantage{''}?
   Neuroscience can increase the understanding of how cognitive and
   emotional processes work; in doing so, we may he able to better
   understand how individuals involved in a business organization make
   decisions and how external factors influence their behavior, especially
   in terms of commitment-activation and engagement level. In this respect,
   a neuroscientific approach to business can support managers in
   decision-making processes. In a scenario where economic humanism plays a
   central role in the process of fostering firms' competitiveness and
   emerging strategies, we believe that a neuroscience approach in a
   business organization could be a valid source of value and inspiration
   for manager decision-making processes.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Mindfulness can be viewed as an important dispositional characteristic
   that reflects the tendency to be mindful in daily life, which is
   beneficial for improving individuals' both hedonic and eudaimonic
   well-being. However, no study to date has examined the brain regions
   involved in individual differences in dispositional mindfulness during
   the resting state and its relation with hedonic and eudaimonic
   well-being. To investigate this issue, the present study employed
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to
   evaluate the regional homogeneity (ReHo) that measures the local
   synchronization of spontaneous brain activity in a large sample. We
   found that dispositional mindfulness was positively associated with the
   ReHo in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left parahippocampal gyrus
   (PHG), and right insula implicated in emotion processing, body
   awareness, and selfreferential processing, and negatively associated
   with the ReHo in right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) implicated in
   response inhibition and attentional control. Furthermore, we found
   different neural associations with hedonic (i.e., positive and negative
   affect) and eudaimonic well-being (i.e., the meaningful and purposeful
   life). Specifically, the ReHo in the IFG predicted eudaimonic well-being
   whereas the OFC predicted positive affect, both of which were mediated
   by dispositional mindfulness. Taken together, our study provides the
   first evidence for linking individual differences in dispositional
   mindfulness to spontaneous brain activity and demonstrates that
   dispositional mindfulness engages multiple brain mechanisms that
   differentially influence hedonic and eudaimonic well-being.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{344-352}},
Abstract = {{The right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is involved in intention
   understanding during interpersonal interactions. To examine how prior
   experience of cooperation and competition affects one's right IFG
   activation in the subsequent interaction, using near-infrared
   spectroscopy (NIRS) we simultaneously measured paired participants'
   bilateral IFG activations during a turn-taking game. Participant pairs
   were assigned to either one of two roles: a Builder taking the initial
   move to copy a target disk-pattern on monitor and the Partner taking the
   second move to aid in (cooperation) or to obstruct (competition) the
   Builder. The experiment consisted of two sessions. One participant (B-P)
   played as a Builder (B-) in session 1 and changed the role to the
   Partner (-P) in session 2, and vice versa for the paired participant
   (P-B). NIRS data in competition demonstrated that the Builder (B-) being
   obstructed in session 1 showed higher right IFG activation when (s) he
   took a role of obstructor (-P) in session 2 (the obstructed effect),
   whereas ``the cooperated effect{''} was not revealed in cooperation.
   These results suggest that prior experience of being obstructed may
   facilitate understanding of the Builder and/or the obstructor's tactical
   move, thereby increasing his/her right IFG activation when one is meant
   to obstruct in subsequent competitions.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{395-408}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, we used a valence classification task to
   investigate the common and distinct neural basis of the two fundamental
   dimensions of social cognition (agency and communion) using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results showed that several brain
   areas associated with mentalizing, along with the inferior parietal
   gyrus in the mirror system, showed overlap in response to both agentic
   and communal words. These findings suggest that both content categories
   are related to the neural basis of social cognition; further, several
   areas in the default mode network (DMN) showed similar deactivations
   between agency and communion, reflecting task-induced deactivation
   (TID). In terms of distinct activations, the findings indicated greater
   deactivations for communal than agentic content in the ventral anterior
   cingulate (vACC) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). Communion also
   showed greater activation in some visual areas compared to agentic
   content, including occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus.
   These activations may reflect greater allocation of attentional
   resources to visual areas when processing communal content, or
   inhibition of cognitive activity irrelevant to task performance. If so,
   this suggests greater attention and engagement with communion-related
   content. The present research thus suggests common and differential
   activations for agency-versus communion-related content.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The weighing of intentions and consequences is inconsistent in adult's
   moral judgments, and this is particularly prominent when assigning blame
   to the immoral intentions in the absence of negative outcomes. The
   current study extends previous research by examining how individual
   differences in moral judgment competence are reflected in the cortical
   network when making judgments about immoral intentions. Twenty-four
   participants were scanned, using functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   while making judgments about three kinds of moral scenarios: a neutral
   condition, an immoral intention condition, and an immoral condition. The
   result showed that comparing with making judgments about the other two
   conditions, making judgments about the immoral intentions takes longer
   time and was associated with significantly elevated activity in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.
   Additionally, moral judgment competence scores were inversely correlated
   with activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when assigning
   blame to the immoral intentions. Greater activity in the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in participants with lower moral judgment
   competence possibly reflected increased recruitment of cognitive
   resource applied to control impulsive response and integrate competitive
   information in making judgments about the immoral intention.}},

Abstract = {{Pain is a multidimensional experience that involves interacting sensory,
   cognitive, and affective factors, rendering the treatment of chronic
   pain challenging and financially burdensome. Further, the widespread use
   of opioids to treat chronic pain has led to an opioid epidemic
   characterized by exponential growth in opioid misuse and addiction. The
   staggering statistics related to opioid use highlight the importance of
   developing, testing, and validating fast-acting nonpharmacological
   approaches to treat pain. Mindfulness meditation is a technique that has
   been found to significantly reduce pain in experimental and clinical
   settings. The present review delineates findings from recent studies
   demonstrating that mindfulness meditation significantly attenuates pain
   through multiple, unique mechanisms-an important consideration for the
   millions of chronic pain patients seeking narcotic-free,

Title = {{Klinefelter syndrome has increased brain responses to auditory stimuli

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) (KS) is a genetic syndrome characterized
   by the presence of an extra X chromosome and low level of testosterone,
   resulting in a number of neurocognitive abnormalities, yet little is
   known about brain function. This study investigated the fMRI-BOLD
   response from KS relative to a group of Controls to basic motor,
   perceptual, executive and adaptation tasks. Participants (N: KS=49;
   Controls=49) responded to whether the words ``GREEN{''} or ``RED{''}
   were displayed in green or red (incongruent versus congruent colors).
   One of the colors was presented three times as often as the other,
   making it possible to study both congruency and adaptation effects
   independently. Auditory stimuli saying ``GREEN{''} or ``RED{''} had the
   same distribution, making it possible to study effects of perceptual
   modality as well as Frequency effects across modalities. We found that
   KS had an increased response to motor output in primary motor cortex and
   an increased response to auditory stimuli in auditory cortices, but no
   difference in primary visual cortices. KS displayed a diminished
   response to written visual stimuli in secondary visual regions near the
   Visual Word Form Area, consistent with the widespread dyslexia in the
   group. No neural differences were found in inhibitory control (Stroop)
   or in adaptation to differences in stimulus frequencies. Across groups
   we found a strong positive correlation between age and BOLD response in
   the brain's motor network with no difference between groups. No effects
   of testosterone level or brain volume were found. In sum, the present
   findings suggest that auditory and motor systems in KS are selectively
   affected, perhaps as a compensatory strategy, and that this is not a
   systemic effect as it is not seen in the visual system. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Although resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI) is increasingly used to generate
   biomarkers of psychiatric illnesses, analytical choices such as seed
   size and placement can lead to variable findings. Seed placement
   especially impacts on RS-fMRI studies of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD),
   because individuals with ASD are known to possess more variable network
   topographies. Here, we present a novel pipeline for analysing RS-fMRI in
   ASD using the cingulate cortex as an exemplar anatomical region of
   interest. Rather than using seeds based on previous literature, or gross
   morphology, we used a combination of structural information,
   task-independent (RS-fMRI) and task-dependent functional connectivity
   (Meta-Analytic Connectivity Modeling) to partition the cingulate cortex
   into six subregions with unique connectivity fingerprints and diverse
   behavioural profiles. This parcellation was consistent between groups
   and highly replicable across individuals (up to 93\% detection)
   suggesting that the organisation of cortico-cingulo connections is
   highly similar between groups. However, our results showed an
   age-related increase in connectivity between the anterior middle
   cingulate cortex and right lateral prefrontal cortex in ASD, whilst this
   connectivity decreased in controls. There was also a Group x Grey Matter
   (GM) interaction, showing increased connectivity between the anterior
   cingulate cortex and the rectal gyrus in concert with increasing rectal
   gyrus GM in controls. By comparing our approach to previously
   established methods we revealed that our approach improves network
   detection in both groups, and that the ability to detect group
   differences using 4 mm radius spheres varies greatly with seed
   placement. Using our multi-modal approach we find disrupted
   cortico-cingulo circuits that, based on task-dependent information, may
   contribute to ASD deficits in attention and social interaction.
   Moreover, we highlight how more sensitive approaches to RS-fMRI are
   crucial for establishing robust and reproducible connectivity-based
   biomarkers in psychiatric disorders. (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Background: Our knowledge with respect to psychological, endocrine, and
   neural correlates of attentional bias in individuals with high
   vulnerability to developing depression - the subclinically depressed,
   still remains limited. Design: The study used a 2 x 2 mixed design.
   Methods: Attentional bias toward happy and sad faces in healthy (N = 26)
   and subclinically depressed individuals (N = 22) was assessed via a
   neuroimaging dot-probe attention task. Participants also completed trait
   and state psychological measures and provided saliva samples for
   cortisol analysis. Results: The subclinical group showed attentional
   bias toward happy faces; past use of problem- focused coping strategies
   when dealing with a personally relevant stressor as well as state levels
   of anxiety, together, contributed to this bias. In the control group,
   the happy attentional bias was positively correlated with activity in
   the right caudate. In the subclinical group, the bias was negatively
   associated with the left fusiform gyrus and positively with the left
   inferior parietal lobule and bilateral putamen. We observed group
   differences in association between cortisol levels during the task and
   neural activity during happy attentional bias processing within the key
   regions involved in attention. Conclusions: The attentional bias toward
   happy faces may reflect an active coping attempt by the subclinical
   participants.}},

   were revealed for both action execution and action observation in

   However, a higher activity in motor areas was observed for action
   execution than motor observation. In contrast the posterior parietal
   cortex was similarly activated in case of both execution and observation
   task. Finally, it was shown that action execution and observation of
   transitive more than intransitive gestures was supported by similar
   parietal posterior areas. These findings support the hypothesis of a

   significant implications related to action types (transitive vs.

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the difference of
   resting-state default-mode network (DMN) between patients with
   leukoaraiosis (LA)-associated subcortical vascular cognitive impairment
   (SVCI) and control subjects, and to provide functional imaging evidence
   of SVCI.
   Methods: All subjects (n = 58) were divided into two groups based on
   their clinical diagnosis: a LA-associated SVCI group (n = 31, 14 males)
   and a control group (n = 27, 14 males). Demographic information and
   resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data were obtained. These
   subjects were assessed using the Hamilton Anxiety Depression Scale,
   Clinical Dementia Rating, Mini Mental State Exam, and Montreal Cognitive
   Assessment. Experimental data and confounding factors were described
   with a General Liner Model. Independent components of fMRI data were
   analyzed with an fMRI toolbox.
   Results: The active areas involved in DMN of LA-associated SVCI group
   were similar to those of the control group. However, several active
   areas of LA-associated SVCI group, especially the left anterior
   cingulate cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus, showed
   significantly lower blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals compared
   with the control group (p = 0.05); whereas the left caudate nucleus (p =
   0.015), the right frontal lobe (p = 0.004), and the superior temporal
   gyrus/inferior parietal gyrus (p = 0.001) exhibited significantly higher
   BOLD signals compared with the control group.
   Discussion: The present study provides neuroimaging evidence for the
   recognition of LA-associated SVCI. Moreover, the differences in the
   functional alterations of the resting-state DMN might be a
   distinguishing feature between SVCI and amnestic mild cognitive
   impairment patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to use amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuation (ALFF) to investigate local features of spontaneous brain
   activity in patients with congenital comitant strabismus and clarify
   their relationship with emotional and psychosocial problems.
   Methods: A total of 20 patients with congenital comitant strabismus (ten
   males and ten females), and 20 healthy controls (ten males and ten
   females) closely matched in age, sex, and education underwent
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. The ALFF
   method was used to assess local features of spontaneous brain activity.
   Congenital comitant strabismus patients were distinguished from healthy
   controls by receiver operating characteristic curve. Correlation
   analysis was performed to explore the relationships between the observed
   mean ALFF signal values of the different areas and the Chinese version
   of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
   Results: Compared with healthy controls, patients with congenital
   comitant strabismus had significantly lower ALFF in the bilateral
   medialfrontal gyrus and higher values in the bilateral cerebellum
   posterior lobe and left angular gyrus. In the congenital comitant
   strabismus group, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression
   score showed a negative correlation with the ALFF signal values of the
   bilateral medial frontal gyrus (r=-0.550, P=0.012) and a negative
   correlation was noted between the mean ALFF signal values of the left
   angular gyrus and strabismus duration (r=-0.515, P=0.020).
   Conclusion: Congenital comitant strabismus mainly involves dysfunction
   in the bilateral medial frontal gyrus, bilateral cerebellum posterior
   lobe, and left angular gyrus, which may reflect the underlying
   pathologic mechanism of congenital strabismus.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are highly sensitive to directional gaze cues and rapidly shift
   attention in accordance with others' gaze (i.e., gaze following).
   Besides providing information about the physical environment, for
   instance, the location of an object, gaze direction can be used to
   extract information about the social environment, such as whether or not
   two people are interacting with each other. In the present fMRI study we
   investigated how these two different types of information conveyed by
   gaze direction interact with one another. Participants saw two faces
   that were either looking at each other or away from each other before
   jointly shifting gaze toward one of two target locations. Targets either
   appeared at the gazed at or the non-gazed at location. Behaviorally,
   gaze following (faster responses to congruent versus incongruent trials)
   was more prominent after observing eye contact than after observing no
   eye contact. In line with behavioral findings, neuroimaging results
   revealed enhanced activation in fronto-parietal and temporal areas in
   congruent trials when faces had looked at each other versus away from
   each other. These findings demonstrate that observing an attentional
   relation between others augments processing of their subsequent gaze
   cues.}},

Abstract = {{Discourse is a commonly occurring and cognitively demanding form of
   naturalistic communication (e.g., conversation, event narration,
   personal and fictional narratives, text reading/generation). Because of
   the prevalence of these communication acts in daily routines (e.g.,
   educational, vocational, and social), disrupted discourse is an
   important target for treatment of persons with cognitive-communication
   (CC) disorders (American Speech-Language Hearing Association, 2005).
   However, there is a paucity of information with regard to the underlying
   cognitive architecture and processing demands associated with the
   various forms of discourse in non-brain-injured adults. This is, in
   part, due to a number of methodological constraints of functional
   neuroimaging technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging
   that severely limit ecologically typical communication acts such as
   listening and speaking during scanning. To circumvent these issues, this
   pilot investigation used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
   to monitor hemodynamic activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during
   natural discourse-processing tasks in 13 neurologically healthy adult
   participants. Task demands were manipulated across a variety of
   discourse types to elucidate the associated neural and cognitive
   resources. Results indicate that the comprehension of well-organized
   discourse text is minimally demanding on the PFC. However, discourse
   production places a significant burden on the PFC and these processing
   demands generally reflect the relative complexity of the discourse task.
   These findings are discussed in terms of potential clinically relevant
   implications with regard to the elicitation, assessment, and remediation
   of CC impairments in clinical populations.}},

Title = {{Neural Network of Predictive Motor Timing in the Context of Gender
   Differences}},
Journal = {{NEURAL PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Time perception is an essential part of our everyday lives, in both the
   prospective and the retrospective domains. However, our knowledge of
   temporal processing is mainly limited to the networks responsible for
   comparing or maintaining specific intervals or frequencies. In the
   presented fMRI study, we sought to characterize the neural nodes engaged
   specifically in predictive temporal analysis, the estimation of the
   future position of an object with varying movement parameters, and the
   contingent neuroanatomical signature of differences in behavioral
   performance between genders. The established dominant cerebellar
   engagement offers novel evidence in favor of a pivotal role of this
   structure in predictive short-term timing, overshadowing the basal
   ganglia reported together with the frontal cortex as dominant in
   retrospective temporal processing in the subsecond spectrum.
   Furthermore, we discovered lower performance in this task and massively
   increased cerebellar activity in women compared to men, indicative of
   strategy differences between the genders. This promotes the view that
   predictive temporal computing utilizes comparable structures in the
   retrospective timing processes, but with a definite dominance of the
   cerebellum.}},

Title = {{State and Training Effects of Mindfulness Meditation on Brain Networks
   Reflect Neuronal Mechanisms of Its Antidepressant Effect}},
Journal = {{NEURAL PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The topic of investigating how mindfulness meditation training can have
   antidepressant effects via plastic changes in both resting state and
   meditation state brain activity is important in the rapidly emerging
   field of neuroplasticity. In the present study, we used a longitudinal
   design investigating resting state fMRI both before and after 40 days of
   meditation training in 13 novices. After training, we compared
   differences in network connectivity between rest and meditation using
   common resting state functional connectivity methods. Interregional
   methods were paired with local measures such as Regional Homogeneity. As
   expected, significant differences in functional connectivity both
   between states (rest versus meditation) and between time points (before
   versus after training) were observed. During meditation, the internal
   consistency in the precuneus and the temporoparietal junction increased,
   while the internal consistency of frontal brain regions decreased. A
   follow-up analysis of regional connectivity of the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex further revealed reduced connectivity with anterior
   insula during meditation. After meditation training, reduced resting
   state functional connectivity between the pregenual anterior cingulate
   and dorsal medical prefrontal cortex was observed. Most importantly,
   significantly reduced depression/anxiety scores were observed after
   training. Hence, these findings suggest that mindfulness meditation
   might be of therapeutic use by inducing plasticity related network
   changes altering the neuronal basis of affective disorders such as
   depression.}},

Title = {{Classification of autistic individuals and controls using cross-task
   characterization of fMRI activity}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{78-88}},
Abstract = {{Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been applied successfully to
   task-based and resting-based fMRI recordings to investigate which neural
   markers distinguish individuals with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD)
   from controls. While most studies have focused on brain connectivity
   during resting state episodes and regions of interest approaches (ROI),
   a wealth of task-based fMRI datasets have been acquired in these
   populations in the last decade. This calls for techniques that can
   leverage information not only from a single dataset, but from several
   existing datasets that might share some common features and biomarkers.
   We propose a fully data-driven (voxel-based) approach that we apply to
   two different fMRI experiments with social stimuli (faces and bodies).
   The method, based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Recursive
   Feature Elimination (RFE), is first trained for each experiment
   independently and each output is then combined to obtain a final
   classification output. Second, this RFE output is used to determine
   which voxels are most often selected for classification to generate maps
   of significant discriminative activity. Finally, to further explore the
   clinical validity of the approach, we correlate phenotypic information
   with obtained classifier scores. The results reveal good classification
   accuracy (range between 69\% and 92.3\%). Moreover, we were able to
   identify discriminative activity patterns pertaining to the social brain
   without relying on a priori ROI definitions. Finally, social motivation
   was the only dimension which correlated with classifier scores,
   suggesting that it is the main dimension captured by the classifiers.
   Altogether, we believe that the present RFE method proves to be
   efficient and may help identifying relevant biomarkers by taking
   advantage of acquired task-based fMRI datasets in psychiatric
   populations. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{326-335}},
Abstract = {{Schizophrenia and depression are prevalent psychiatric disorders, but
   their underlying neural bases remains poorly understood. Neuroimaging
   evidence has pointed towards the relevance of functional connectivity
   aberrations in defaultmode network (DMN) hubs, dorso-medial prefrontal
   cortex and precuneus, in both disorders, but commonalities and
   differences in resting state functional connectivity of those two
   regions across disorders has not been formally assessed. Here, we took a
   transdiagnostic approach to investigate resting state functional
   connectivity of those two regions in 75 patients with schizophrenia and
   82 controls from 4 scanning sites and 102 patients with depression and
   106 controls from 3 sites. Our results demonstrate common
   dysconnectivity patterns as indexed by a significant reduction of
   functional connectivity between precuneus and bilateral superior
   parietal lobe in schizophrenia and depression. Furthermore, our findings
   highlight diagnosis-specific connectivity reductions of the parietal
   operculum in schizophrenia relative to depression. In light of evidence
   that points towards the importance of the DMN for social cognitive
   abilities and well documented impairments of social interaction in both
   patient groups, it is conceivable that the observed transdiagnostic
   connectivity alterations may contribute to interpersonal difficulties,
   but this could not be assessed directly in our study as measures of
   social behavior were not available. Given the operculum's role in
   somatosensory integration, diagnosis-specific connectivity reductions
   may indicate a pathophysiological mechanism for basic self-disturbances
   that is characteristic of schizophrenia, but not depression. (C) 2015

   online game (game-CBT), and ten ASD adolescents participated in an
   offline-CBT. At baseline and 6 weeks later, social communication
   quality, correct identification of emotional words and facial emoticons,
   and brain activity were assessed in both groups. Social communication
   quality and correct response rate of emotional words and facial
   emoticons improved in both groups over the course of the intervention,
   and there were no significant differences between groups. In response to
   the emotional words, the brain activity within the temporal and parietal
   cortices increased in the game-CBT group, while the brain activity
   within cingulate and parietal cortices increased in the offline-CBT
   group. In addition, ASD adolescents in the game-CBT group showed
   increased brain activity within the right cingulate gyrus, left medial
   frontal gyrus, left cerebellum, left fusiform gyrus, left insular
   cortex, and sublobar area in response to facial emoticons. A prosocial
   online game designed for CBT was as effective as offline-CBT in ASD
   adolescents. Participation in the game especially increased social
   arousal and aided ASD adolescents in recognizing emotion. The therapy
   also helped participants more accurately consider associated
   environments in response to facial emotional stimulation. However, the
   online CBT was less effective than the offline-CBT at evoking emotions
   in response to emotional words.}},

Abstract = {{Human civilization is based on the successful pursuit of long-term
   goals, requiring the ability to forego immediate pleasure for the sake
   of larger future rewards. This ability improves with age, but the
   precise cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying its development
   remain elusive. The developmental changes could result either from
   younger children valuing immediate rewards more strongly or because
   older children become better at controlling their impulses. By
   implementing 2 tasks, a choice-independent valuation task and an
   intertemporal choice task, both behaviorally and using fMRI in twenty 6-
   to 13-year old children, we show developmental improvements in
   behavioral control to uniquely account for age-related changes in
   temporal discounting. We show further that overcoming temptation during
   childhood occurs as a function of an age-related increase in functional
   coupling between value signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and
   brain regions dedicated to behavioral control, such as left dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex during choice. These findings can help to devise
   measures that reduce the substantial costs of impatience to society.}},

Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) has been implicated in an array of
   social-cognitive functions, including self-referential processing,
   theory of mind, and mentalizing. Yet, the properties of the external
   stimuli that elicit DMN activity in relation to these domains remain
   unknown. Previous studies suggested that motion kinematics is utilized
   by the brain for social-cognitive processing. Here, we used functional
   MRI to examine whether the DMN is sensitive to parametric manipulations
   of observed motion kinematics. Preferential responses within core DMN
   structures differentiating non-biological from biological kinematics
   were observed for the motion of a realistically looking, human-like
   avatar, but not for an abstract object devoid of human form. Differences
   in connectivity patterns during the observation of biological versus
   non-biological kinematics were additionally observed. Finally, the
   results additionally suggest that the DMN is coupled more strongly with
   key nodes in the action observation network, namely the STS and the SMA,
   when the observed motion depicts human rather than abstract form. These
   findings are the first to implicate the DMN in the perception of
   biological motion. They may reflect the type of information used by the
   DMN in social-cognitive processing.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain readily perceives fluent movement from static input.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated brain
   mechanisms that mediate fluent apparent biological motion (ABM)
   perception from sequences of body postures. We presented body and
   nonbody stimuli varying in objective sequence duration and fluency of
   apparent movement. Three body postures were ordered to produce a fluent
   (ABC) or a nonfluent (ACB) apparent movement. This enabled us to
   identify brain areas involved in the perceptual reconstruction of body
   movement from identical lower-level static input. Participants judged
   the duration of a rectangle containing body/nonbody sequences, as an
   implicit measure of movement fluency. For body stimuli, fluent apparent
   motion sequences produced subjectively longer durations than nonfluent
   sequences of the same objective duration. This difference was reduced
   for nonbody stimuli. This body-specific bias in duration perception was
   associated with increased blood oxygen level-dependent responses in the
   primary (M1) and supplementary motor areas. Moreover, fluent ABM was
   associated with increased functional connectivity between M1/SMA and
   right fusiform body area. We show that perceptual reconstruction of
   fluent movement from static body postures does not merely enlist areas
   traditionally associated with visual body processing, but involves
   cooperative recruitment of motor areas, consistent with a ``motor way of
   seeing{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive and affective theory of mind (ToM) can be impaired in the
   course of neurodegenerative dementias. Experimental tests based on
   different task conditions and/or complexity may fail to capture
   disease-specific patterns of impairments. In this study, we assessed
   with a single task both the affective and the cognitive facets of ToM
   ability in a sample of 47 patients (i.e., 12 AD, 20 bvFTD, and 15 aMCI
   fulfilling IWG criteria for AD in predementia phase) and 65 healthy
   controls. Subjects were administered the Story-based Empathy task (SET),
   a non-verbal task measuring the ability to infer others' intentions (IA)
   and emotions (EA) compared to a control condition (causal inferences,
   CI). Global and single sub-condition scores were evaluated with a
   vectorial method, analyzing the relationship between social abilities
   and basic cognitive functioning by means of two indices representing the
   basic ability to perform the task and the balance between basic
   functions and ToM skills.
   Dementia (AD and bvFTD) patients showed impaired performances on all SET
   sub-conditions, whereas aMCI subjects' performance was not different
   from healthy controls. Vectorial analysis revealed a specific change in
   the balance between EA and CI conditions only in the bvFTD group,
   supporting a disproportionate deficit in mental states attribution based
   on affective cues. The overall deficit in the task in AD appears to be
   more general and related to the severity of dementia. This latter
   finding is further supported by the normal performance of the prodromal
   AD group.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is increasingly recognized as a neurodevelopmental
   disorder with altered connectivity among brain networks. In the current
   study we examined large-scale network interactions in childhood-onset
   schizophrenia, a severe form of the disease with salient genetic and
   neurobiological abnormalities. Using a data-driven analysis of
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging fluctuations, we
   characterized data from 19 patients with schizophrenia and 26 typically
   developing controls, group matched for age, sex, handedness, and
   magnitude of head motion during scanning. This approach identified 26
   regions with decreased functional correlations in schizophrenia compared
   to controls. These regions were found to organize into two
   function-related networks, the first with regions associated with social
   and higher-level cognitive processing, and the second with regions
   involved in somatosensory and motor processing. Analyses of across-and
   within-network regional interactions revealed pronounced across-network
   decreases in functional connectivity in the schizophrenia group, as well
   as a set of across-network relationships with overall negative coupling
   indicating competitive or opponent network dynamics. Critically,
   across-network decreases in functional connectivity in schizophrenia
   predicted the severity of positive symptoms in the disorder, such as
   hallucinations and delusions. By contrast, decreases in functional
   connectivity within the social-cognitive network of regions predicted
   the severity of negative symptoms, such as impoverished speech and
   flattened affect. These results point toward the role that abnormal
   integration of sensorimotor and social-cognitive processing may play in
   the pathophysiology and symptomatology of schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{The study investigates the pragmatics of irony processing and contextual
   effects in schizophrenia from a neurolinguistic perspective. Relying on
   neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques the research reveals the brain networks
   involved in social cognition and non-compositional processing,
   identifying an area with an integrative role, fulfilling basic tasks
   that serve as pillars of pragmatic meaning construction, in line with
   the hypothesized meta-module of pragmatic comprehension.
   Schizophrenic patients are known to be diagnosed with a typical Theory
   of Mind (ToM) mechanisms even during remission, which is believed to be
   responsible, or at least, to contribute to their deficit in pragmatic
   competence. Several studies reveal a connection between irony
   comprehension and ToM capacities in patients, who demonstrate difficulty
   in irony processing, which has been associated with their deficient
   mentalization skills. We examined the neural correlates of irony
   understanding in patients, as an indicator of ToM capacity, and
   evaluated how surface cues (linguistic help) affect irony comprehension.
   Patients and control subjects were submitted to event-related functional
   MRI scanning while performing three tasks: (1) irony, (2) irony with
   linguistic help and (3) control tasks. Results show that mentalizing
   skills are central for a fully-fledged pragmatic competence, and that
   linguistic surface cues enhance understanding of implicit content. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of the current research was to study functional connectivity
   (FC) of the right superior temporal sulcus (rSTS) during visual target
   stimulus processing. This structure is presumed to be crucial in social
   cognition, but evidently participates in target detection as well.
   Twenty subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance
   examination for studying FC. We used psychophysiological interaction
   (PPI) analysis of data acquired during the visual oddball task. During
   the visual oddball task rSTS had increased connectivity bilaterally with
   structures involved in memory operations (mesiotemporal cortices and
   basal ganglia) and evaluative processing related to decision making
   (left anterior cingulate cortex). Moreover, we revealed decreased
   connectivity of rSTS with structures involved in attentional processes
   (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the posterior area
   with bilateral parietal cortex). Based on our results we hypothesize
   that in the detection of rare events, during visual information
   processing, rSTS is involved within neuronal networks related to
   attention, but also at later stages of stimuli processing.}},

Abstract = {{Interpreting emotional expressions appropriately poses a challenge for
   individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In particular,
   difficulties with emotional processing in ASD are more pronounced in
   contexts where emotional expressions are subtle, automatic, and
   reflexivethat is, implicit. In contrast, explicit emotional processing,
   which requires the cognitive evaluation of an emotional experience,
   appears to be relatively intact in individuals with ASD. In the present
   study, we examined the brain activation and functional connectivity
   differences underlying explicit and implicit emotional processing in
   age- and IQ-matched adults with (n=17) and without (n=15) ASD. Results
   indicated: (1) significantly reduced levels of brain activation in
   participants with ASD in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and superior
   temporal gyrus (STG) during implicit emotion processing; (2)
   significantly weaker functional connectivity in the ASD group in
   connections of the MPFC with the amygdala, temporal lobe, parietal lobe,
   and fusiform gyrus; (3) No group difference in performance accuracy or
   reaction time; and (4) Significant positive relationship between
   empathizing ability and STG activity in ASD but not in typically
   developing participants. These findings suggest that the neural
   mechanisms underlying implicit, but not explicit, emotion processing may
   be altered at multiple levels in individuals with ASD. Autism Res2015.

Journal = {{NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{24-32}},

Abstract = {{Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is associated with long-term and
   negative effect on arousal regulation. Recent neuroimaging studies have
   examined brain mechanisms related to arousal dysregulation with
   cross-sectional experimental designs; but longitudinal changes in the
   brain, reflecting group differences in neurodevelopment, have never been
   directly examined. To directly assess the interaction of PCE and
   neurodevelopment, the present study used a longitudinal design to
   analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from
   33 adolescents (21 with PCE and 12 non-exposed controls) while they
   performed the same working memory task with emotional distracters at two
   points in time. The mean age of participants was 14.3 years at time\_1
   and 16.7 years at time\_2. With confounding factors statistically
   controlled, the fMRI data revealed significant exposure-by-time
   interaction in the activations of the amygdala and default mode network
   (DMN). For the control adolescents, brain activations associated with
   emotional arousal (amygdala) and cognitive effort (DMN) were both
   reduced at time\_2 as compared to that at time\_1. However, these
   activation reductions were not observed in the PCE group, indicating
   persistently high levels of emotional arousal and cognitive effort. In
   addition, correlations between longitudinal changes in the brain and in
   behavior have shown that adolescents with persistently high emotional
   arousal were more likely in need of high cognitive effort; and their
   cognitive performance was more likely to be affected by distractive
   challenges. The present results complement and extend previous findings
   from cross-sectional studies with further evidence supporting the view
   of PCE associated long-term teratogenic effects on arousal regulation.

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the neural correlates of emotion regulation
   across adolescence and young adulthood. Existing studies of cognitive
   reappraisal indicate that improvements in regulatory efficiency may
   develop linearly across this period, in accordance with maturation of
   prefrontal cortical systems. However, there is also evidence for
   adolescent differences in reappraisal specific to the activation of
   ``social-information processing network{''} regions, including the
   amygdala and temporal-occipital cortices. Here, we use fMRI to examine
   the neural correlates of emotional reactivity and reappraisal in
   response to aversive social imagery in a group of 78 adolescents and
   young adults aged 15-25 years. Within the group, younger participants
   exhibited greater activation of temporal-occipital brain regions during
   reappraisal in combination with weaker suppression of amygdala
   reactivity-the latter being a general correlate of successful
   reappraisal. Further analyses demonstrated that these age-related
   influences on amygdala reactivity were specifically mediated by
   activation of the fusiform face area. Overall, these findings suggest
   that enhanced processing of salient social cues (i.e., faces) increases
   reactivity of the amygdala during reappraisal and that this relationship
   is stronger in younger adolescents. How these relationships contribute
   to well-known vulnerabilities of emotion regulation during this
   developmental period will be an important topic for ongoing research.

Abstract = {{Successful social interactions depend on the ability to anticipate other
   people's actions. Current conceptualizations of brain function propose
   that causes of sensory input are inferred through their integration with
   internal predictions generated in the observer's motor system during
   action observation. Less is known concerning how action prediction
   changes with age. Previously we showed that internal action
   representations are less specific in older compared with younger adults
   at behavioral and neural levels. Here, we characterize how neural
   activity varies while healthy older adults aged 56-71 years predict the
   time-course of an unfolding action as well as the relation to task
   performance. By using fMRI, brain activity was measured while
   participants observed partly occluded actions and judged the temporal
   coherence of the action continuation that was manipulated. We found that
   neural activity in frontoparietal and occipitotemporal regions increased
   the more an action continuation was shifted backwards in time. Action
   continuations that were shifted towards the future preferentially
   engaged early visual cortices. Increasing age was associated with neural
   activity that extended from posterior to anterior regions in frontal and
   superior temporal cortices. Lower sensitivity in action prediction
   resulted in activity increases in the caudate. These results imply that
   the neural implementation of predicting actions undergoes similar
   changes as the neural process of executing actions in older adults. The
   comparison between internal predictions and sensory input seems to
   become less precise with age leading to difficulties in anticipating
   observed actions accurately, possibly due to less specific internal
   action models. (C) 2015 The Authors Human Brain Mapping Published by

Abstract = {{Background: Mounting evidence suggests that autism is a network
   disorder, characterized by atypical brain connectivity, especially in
   the context of high level cognitive processes such as working memory
   (WM). Accordingly, atypical WM processes have been related to the social
   and cognitive deficits observed in children with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD). Methods: We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to
   investigate connectivity differences during a high memory load (2-back)
   WM task between 17 children with ASD and 20 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched
   controls. Results: We identified reduced inter-regional alpha-band (9-15
   Hz) phase synchronization in children with ASD during the WM task.
   Reduced WM-related brain synchronization encompassed fronto-temporal
   networks (ps<0.04 corrected) previously associated with challenging
   high-level conditions (i.e. the left insula and the anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC)) and memory encoding and/or recognition (i.e. the right
   middle temporal gyrus and the right fusiform gyrus). Additionally, we
   found that reduced connectivity processes related to the right fusiform
   were correlated with the severity of symptoms in children with ASD,
   suggesting that such atypicalities could be directly related to the
   behavioural deficits observed. Discussion: This study provides new
   evidence of atypical long-range synchronization in children with ASD in
   fronto-temporal areas that crucially contribute to challenging WM tasks,
   but also emotion regulation and social cognition processes. Thus, these
   results support the network disorder hypothesis of ASD and argue for a
   specific pathophysiological contribution of brain processes related to
   working memory and executive functions on the symptomatology of autism.

Abstract = {{This functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study examined
   subjective and neural responses to social exclusion in adolescents (age
   12-15) who either had a stable accepted (n = 27; 14 males) or a chronic
   rejected (n = 19; 12 males) status among peers from age 6 to 12. Both
   groups of adolescents reported similar increases in distress after being
   excluded in a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball), but adolescents
   with a history of chronic peer rejection showed higher activity in brain
   regions previously linked to the detection of, and the distress caused
   by, social exclusion. Specifically, compared with stably accepted
   adolescents, chronically rejected adolescents displayed: 1) higher
   activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) during social
   exclusion and 2) higher activity in the dACC and anterior prefrontal
   cortex when they were incidentally excluded in a social interaction in
   which they were overall included. These findings demonstrate that
   chronic childhood peer rejection is associated with heightened neural
   responses to social exclusion during adolescence, which has implications
   for understanding the processes through which peer rejection may lead to
   adverse effects on mental health over time.}},

Abstract = {{In human society, which is organized by social hierarchies, resources
   are usually allocated unequally and based on social status. In this
   study, we analyze how being endowed with different social statuses in a
   math competition affects the perception of fairness during asset
   allocation in a subsequent Ultimatum Game (UG). Behavioral data showed
   that when participants were in high status, they were more likely to
   reject unfair UG offers than in low status. This effect of social status
   correlated with activity in the right anterior insula (rAI) and with the
   functional connectivity between the rAI and a region in the anterior
   middle cingulate cortex, indicating that these two brain regions are
   crucial for integrating contextual factors and social norms during
   fairness perception. Additionally, there was an interaction between
   social status and UG offer fairness in the amygdala and thalamus,
   implicating the role of these regions in the modulation of social status
   on fairness perception. These results demonstrate the effect of social
   status on fairness perception and the potential neural underpinnings for
   this effect.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In daily life, interpersonal interactions are influenced by uncertainty
   about other people's intentions. Face-to-face (FF) interaction reduces
   such uncertainty by providing external visible cues such as facial
   expression or body gestures and facilitates shared intentionality to
   promote belief of cooperative decisions and actual cooperative behaviors
   in interaction. However, so far little is known about interpersonal
   brain synchronization between two people engaged in naturally occurring
   FF interactions. In this study, we combined an adapted ultimatum game
   with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning to
   investigate how FF interaction impacts interpersonal brain
   synchronization during economic exchange. Pairs of strangers interacted
   repeatedly either FF or face-blocked (FB), while their activation was
   simultaneously measured in the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ)
   and the control region, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC).
   Behaviorally, FF interactions increased shared intentionality between
   strangers, leading more positive belief of cooperative decisions and
   more actual gains in the game. FNIRS results indicated increased
   interpersonal brain synchronizations during FF interactions in rTPJ (but
   not in rDLPFC) with greater shared intentionality between partners.
   These results highlighted the importance of rTPJ in collaborative social
   interactions during FF economic exchange and warrant future research
   that combines FF interactions with fNIRS hyperscanning to study social
   brain disorders such as autism.}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneous imitation is assumed to underlie the acquisition of
   important skills by infants, including language and social interaction.
   In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to
   examine the neural basis of `spontaneously' driven imitation, which has
   not yet been fully investigated. Healthy participants were presented
   with movie clips of meaningless bimanual actions and instructed to
   observe and imitate them during an fMRI scan. The participants were
   subsequently shown the movie clips again and asked to evaluate the
   strength of their `urge to imitate' (Urge) for each action. We searched
   for cortical areas where the degree of activation positively correlated
   with Urge scores; significant positive correlations were observed in the
   right supplementary motor area (SMA) and bilateral midcingulate cortex
   (MCC) under the imitation condition. These areas were not explained by
   explicit reasons for imitation or the kinematic characteristics of the
   actions. Previous studies performed in monkeys and humans have
   implicated the SMA and MCC/caudal cingulate zone in voluntary actions.
   This study also confirmed the functional connectivity between Urge and
   imitation performance using a psychophysiological interaction analysis.
   Thus, our findings reveal the critical neural components that underlie
   spontaneous imitation and provide possible reasons why infants imitate
   spontaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Reproducibility of results is important in improving the robustness of
   conclusions drawn from research, particularly in functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). In this study, we aim to replicate a previous
   study on the neural correlates of face emotion processing above and
   below awareness level using an independent sample of youth with severe
   mood dysregulation (SMD) and healthy volunteers (HV). We collected fMRI
   data in 17 SMD and 20 HV, using an affective priming paradigm with
   masked (17 ms) and unmasked (187 ms) faces (angry, happy, neutral, blank
   oval). When processing masked and unmasked angry faces, SMD patients
   exhibited increased activation in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and
   superior temporal gyrus relative to HV. When processing masked and
   unmasked happy faces, SMD patients showed decreased activation in the
   insula, PHG and thalamus compared with HV. During masked face processing
   in general across emotions, youth with SMD showed greater ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation relative to HV. Perturbed
   activation in emotion processing areas (e.g. insula, PHG, superior
   temporal gyrus and thalamus) manifests as hyper-sensitivity toward
   negative emotions and hypo-sensitivity toward positive emotions may be
   important in the etiology and maintenance of irritability, aggression
   and depressive symptoms in SMD. vmPFC dysfunction may mediate
   over-reactivity to face emotions associated with irritability.}},

Abstract = {{During the transformative period of adolescence, social influence plays
   a prominent role in shaping young people's emerging social identities,
   and can impact their propensity to engage in prosocial or risky
   behaviors. In this study, we examine the neural correlates of social
   influence from both parents and peers, two important sources of
   influence. Nineteen adolescents (age 16-18 years) completed a social
   influence task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   scan. Social influence from both sources evoked activity in brain
   regions implicated in mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex, left
   temporoparietal junction, right temporoparietal junction), reward
   (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), and self-control (right ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex). These results suggest that mental state reasoning,
   social reward and self-control processes may help adolescents to
   evaluate others' perspectives and overcome the prepotent force of their
   own antecedent attitudes to shift their attitudes toward those of
   others. Findings suggest common neural networks involved in social
   influence from both parents and peers.}},

Abstract = {{Inner speech has been implicated in important aspects of normal and
   atypical cognition, including the development of auditory
   hallucinations. Studies to date have focused on covert speech elicited
   by simple word or sentence repetition, while ignoring richer and
   arguably more psychologically significant varieties of inner speech.
   This study compared neural activation for inner speech involving
   conversations ('dialogic inner speech') with single-speaker scenarios
   ('monologic inner speech'). Inner speech-related activation differences
   were then compared with activations relating to Theory-of-Mind (ToM)
   reasoning and visual perspective-taking in a conjunction design.
   Generation of dialogic (compared with monologic) scenarios was
   associated with a widespread bilateral network including left and right
   superior temporal gyri, precuneus, posterior cingulate and left inferior
   and medial frontal gyri. Activation associated with dialogic scenarios
   and ToM reasoning overlapped in areas of right posterior temporal cortex
   previously linked to mental state representation. Implications for
   understanding verbal cognition in typical and atypical populations are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Communication between the amygdala and other brain regions critically
   regulates sensitivity to threat, which has been associated with risk for
   mood and affective disorders. The extent to which these neural pathways
   are genetically determined or correlate with risk-related personality
   measures is not fully understood. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we evaluated independent and interactive effects of the
   5-HTTLPR genotype and neuroticism on amygdala functional connectivity
   during an emotional faces paradigm in 76 healthy individuals. Functional
   connectivity between left amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
   and between both amygdalae and a cluster including posterior cingulate
   cortex, precuneus and visual cortex was significantly increased in
   5-HTTLPR S' allele carriers relative to LALA individuals. Neuroticism
   was negatively correlated with functional connectivity between right
   amygdala and mPFC and visual cortex, and between both amygdalae and left
   lateral orbitofrontal (lOFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   (vlPFC). Notably, 5-HTTLPR moderated the association between neuroticism
   and functional connectivity between both amygdalae and left lOFC/vlPFC,
   such that S' carriers exhibited a more negative association relative to
   LALA individuals. These findings provide novel evidence for both
   independent and interactive effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype and neuroticism
   on amygdala communication, which may mediate effects on risk for mood

Abstract = {{Emotion and cognition are dynamically coupled to bodily arousal: the
   induction of anger, even unconsciously, can reprioritise neural and
   physiological resources toward action states that bias cognitive
   processes. Here we examine behavioural, neural and bodily effects of
   covert anger processing and its influence on cognition, indexed by
   lexical decision-making. While recording beat-to-beat blood pressure,
   the words ANGER or RELAX were presented subliminally just prior to rapid
   word/non-word reaction-time judgements of letter-strings. Subliminal
   ANGER primes delayed the time taken to reach rapid lexical decisions,
   relative to RELAX primes. However, individuals with high trait anger
   were speeded up by subliminal anger primes. ANGER primes increased
   systolic blood pressure and the magnitude of this increase predicted
   reaction time prolongation. Within the brain, ANGER trials evoked an
   enhancement of activity within dorsal pons and an attenuation of
   activity within visual occipitotemporal and attentional parietal
   cortices. Activity within periaqueductal grey matter, occipital and
   parietal regions increased linearly with evoked blood pressure changes,
   indicating neural substrates through which covert anger impairs semantic
   decisions, putatively through its expression as visceral arousal. The
   behavioural and physiological impact of anger states compromises the
   efficiency of cognitive processing through action-ready changes in
   autonomic response that skew regional neural activity.}},

   only of traits, but also of persons who exemplify these traits. We used
   repetition suppression, which is a rapid suppression of the neuroimaging
   signal upon repeated presentation of the same stimulus or core stimulus
   characteristics-in this case, the implied trait and person. Participants
   inferred familiar person's traits. At each trial, a critical (target)
   sentence described a behavior that implied a trait, and was preceded by
   a (prime) sentence that implied the same trait and portrayed the same
   person, the same trait but portrayed a different person or did not imply
   a trait and portrayed a different person. As predicted, we found partly
   overlapping repetition suppression areas in the ventral mPFC when
   persons and traits were repeated, indicating that not only traits but
   also familiar persons have a neural code in the ventral mPFC. We also
   found a negative correlation between activation when reading about a new
   person and participants' social network size, indicating that experience
   with larger social groups results in less recruitment of a person code.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a time of increased risk for the onset of psychological
   disorders associated with deficits in face emotion labeling. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine age-related
   differences in brain activation while adolescents and adults labeled the
   emotion on fearful, happy and angry faces of varying intensities {[}0\%
   (i.e. neutral), 50\%, 75\%, 100\%]. Adolescents and adults did not
   differ on accuracy to label emotions. In the superior temporal sulcus,
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus, adults show
   an inverted-U-shaped response to increasing intensities of fearful faces
   and a U-shaped response to increasing intensities of happy faces,
   whereas adolescents show the opposite patterns. In addition, adults, but
   not adolescents, show greater inferior occipital gyrus activation to
   negative (angry, fearful) vs positive (happy) emotions. In sum, when
   subjects classify subtly varying facial emotions, developmental
   differences manifest in several `ventral stream' brain regions. Charting
   the typical developmental course of the brain mechanisms of
   socioemotional processes, such as facial emotion labeling, is an
   important focus for developmental psychopathology research.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies of mindfulness training (MT) modulate anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula among other brain regions, which are
   important for attentional control, emotional regulation and
   interoception. Inspiratory breathing load (IBL) is an experimental
   approach to examine how an individual responds to an aversive stimulus.
   Military personnel are at increased risk for cognitive, emotional and
   physiological compromise as a consequence of prolonged exposure to
   stressful environments and, therefore, may benefit from MT. This study
   investigated whether MT modulates neural processing of interoceptive
   distress in infantry marines scheduled to undergo pre-deployment
   training and deployment to Afghanistan. Marines were divided into two
   groups: individuals who received training as usual (control) and
   individuals who received an additional 20-h mindfulness-based mind
   fitness training (MMFT). All subjects completed an IBL task during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and post-MMFT
   training. Marines who underwent MMFT relative to controls demonstrated a
   significant attenuation of right anterior insula and ACC during the
   experience of loaded breathing. These results support the hypothesis
   that MT changes brain activation such that individuals process more
   effectively an aversive interoceptive stimulus. Thus, MT may serve as a
   training technique to modulate the brain's response to negative
   interoceptive stimuli, which may help to improve resilience.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:Social distress, resulting from loss or threat to social
   relationships, shares similar psychological and neuronal processes with
   physical pain. Recent evidence demonstrated that social distress may
   have an impact on pain. The current study aimed to further assess the
   relationship between these 2 phenomena.Materials and Methods:Sixty
   healthy participants were randomly assigned to inclusion, noninclusion,
   or exclusion conditions of Cyberball, a virtual ball tossing game used
   to induce social distress. Pain and unpleasantness in response to
   noxious electrical stimuli were assessed before and after Cyberball
   manipulation. Psychological characteristics were evaluated by the
   Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire and the neuroticism
   scale of Big Five Inventory.Results:Significant correlations were found
   between social distress and pre-Cyberball unpleasantness thresholds:
   those who perceived the Cyberball task as more distressing demonstrated
   lower unpleasantness thresholds. Post-Cyberball manipulation pain
   intensity ratings, but not unpleasantness ratings, were lower in the
   inclusion condition. No associations were found between the
   psychological characteristic and the effects of Cyberball on pain or
   unpleasantness ratings.Discussion:The current study results indicate
   that participants' pre-Cyberball unpleasantness threshold is related to
   their responsiveness to social distress and that physical pain may be
   modulated by social events. Further studies are needed to clarify the
   clinical relevance of these results.}},

Abstract = {{ZNF804A is one of the most promising candidate genes for schizophrenia.
   Previous fMRI studies have repeatedly shown an association between SNP
   rs1344706 in this gene and the functional connectivity from the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) to the left hippocampal
   formation (lHF) during the N-back task. However, the rDLPFC-lHF
   functional connectivity included several subconnections and it is not
   known whether rs1344706 plays the same role in these subconnections.
   This study addressed that question using both fMRI and DTI data of 87
   subjects. First, we replicated the association between rs1344706 and the
   rDLPFC-lHF functional connectivity using our fMRI data from the N-back
   task. Second, we reconstructed fiber connections between rDLPFC and lHF
   using our DTI data, which included three subconnections: from lHF to
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), from PCC to anterior cingulated cortex
   (ACC), and from ACC to rDLPFC. We found that only the lHF-PCC tract
   showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in risk allele
   homozygotes. Finally, we analyzed the fMRI data (from the N-back task
   and the resting state). Both consistently showed relatively lower
   lHF-PCC functional connectivity in risk allele homozygotes. Taken
   together, the disconnectivity of the lHF-PCC tract seems to be a
   plausible intermediate phenotype that links rs1344706 and schizophrenia.

   in primary auditory areas, and how this relates to language modality and
   auditory deprivation.
   Here, we dissociated the effects of language modality and auditory
   deprivation on crossmodal plasticity in Heschl's gyrus as a whole, and
   in cytoarchitectonic region Te1.0 (likely to contain the core auditory
   cortex). Using fMRI, we measured the BOLD response to viewing sign
   language in congenitally or early deaf individuals with and without sign
   language knowledge, and in hearing controls.
   Results show that differences between hearing and deaf individuals are
   due to a reduction in activation caused by visual stimulation in the
   hearing group, which is more significant in Te1.0 than in Heschl's gyrus
   as a whole. Furthermore, differences between deaf and hearing groups are
   due to auditory deprivation, and there is no evidence that the modality
   of language used by deaf individuals contributes to crossmodal
   plasticity in Heschl's gyrus. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Certain groups (e.g., women, older adults, and the economically
   disadvantaged) are universally stigmatized. Numerous studies, however,
   have identified cross-cultural differences in the attitudes expressed
   toward stigmatized groups. These differences may potentially be due to
   existing cross-cultural dissimilarities in social status for some
   groups. The current study used fMRI to examine whether Chinese and
   Caucasian-American participants engage the same cognitive and affective
   mechanisms when perceiving stigmatized individuals with similarly low
   social status in both cultures (homeless individuals), but different
   cognitive and/or affective processes when evaluating stigmatized
   individuals whose status differs across cultures (older adults). Using a
   social neuroscience approach can provide unique insight into this
   question because the neural regions involved in cognitive and affective
   evaluations of stigmatized individuals have been well characterized.
   Results revealed that Chinese participants and Caucasian-American
   participants engaged similar patterns of negative affective processing
   associated with disgust (left anterior insula) when evaluating homeless
   individuals. Moreover, self-reported negative explicit attitudes toward
   homeless individuals were associated with increased activity in the
   insula. However, Chinese participants and Caucasian-American
   participants engaged increased activity in neural regions associated
   with status (ventral striatum) when they evaluated older adults.
   Moreover, self-reported attitudes toward older adults and ventral
   striatal activity were correlated with the extent to which participants
   reported being affiliated with their respective cultural traditions. (C)

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{464-472}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The neuronal processes underlying dance observation have been the focus
   of an increasing number of brain imaging studies over the past decade.
   However, the existing literature mainly dealt with effects of motor and
   visual expertise, whereas the neural and cognitive mechanisms that
   underlie the interpretation of dance choreographies remained unexplored.
   Hence, much attention has been given to the action observation network
   (AON) whereas the role of other potentially relevant neuro-cognitive
   mechanisms such as mentalizing (theory of mind) or language (narrative
   comprehension) in dance understanding is yet to be elucidated. We report
   the results of an fMRI study where the structural coherence of short
   contemporary dance choreographies was manipulated parametrically using
   the same taped movement material. Our participants were all trained
   dancers. The whole-brain analysis argues that the interpretation of
   structurally coherent dance phrases involves a subpart (superior
   parietal) of the AON as well as mentalizing regions in the dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex. An ROI analysis based on a similar study using
   linguisticmaterials (Pallier et al., 2011) suggests that structural
   processing in language and dance might share certain neural mechanisms.

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{A}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that face-sensitive brain regions, such as
   the fusiform face area (FFA) and anterior inferior temporal lobe (aIT),
   not only respond selectively to face stimuli, but also respond uniquely
   to individual faces. A common factor in the existing literature is that
   face stimuli in these experiments are highly familiar to participants,
   usually by design. We set out to investigate to what extent familiarity
   correlates with the emergence of face-specific information in
   face-sensitive regions by testing novel faces with only a single
   repetition. Our results, consistent with a familiarity hypothesis,
   demonstrate that the FFA and aIT show face-specific information only
   when participants demonstrate subsequent memory for those faces.
   Functionally-defined regions that are not believed to process faces
   holistically showed no face-specific information, regardless of
   subsequent memory. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of
   face-specific information in face-sensitive regions for stimuli that
   were not highly familiar. These results contribute to our understanding
   of how individuating information comes to be represented in
   face-sensitive regions and suggest that this process can take place even
   after a single repetition of a particular face. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Perceiving human faces constitutes a fundamental ability of the human
   mind, integrating a wealth of information essential for social
   interactions in everyday life. Neuroimaging studies have unveiled a
   distributed neural network consisting of multiple brain regions in both
   hemispheres. Whereas the individual regions in the face perception
   network and the right-hemispheric dominance for face processing have
   been subject to intensive research, the functional integration among
   these regions and hemispheres has received considerably less attention.
   Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for fMRI, we analyzed the effective
   connectivity between the core regions in the face perception network of
   healthy humans to unveil the mechanisms underlying both intra- and
   interhemispheric integration. Our results suggest that the
   right-hemispheric lateralization of the network is due to an asymmetric
   face-specific interhemispheric recruitment at an early processing stage
   - that is, at the level of the occipital face area (OFA) but not the
   fusiform face area (FFA). As a structural correlate, we found that OFA
   gray matter volume was correlated with this asymmetric interhemispheric
   recruitment. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that
   interhemispheric connection asymmetries were correlated with the
   strength of pupil constriction in response to faces, a measure with
   potential sensitivity to holistic (as opposed to feature-based)
   processing of faces. Overall, our findings thus provide a mechanistic
   description for lateralized processes in the core face perception
   network, point to a decisive role of interhemispheric integration at an
   early stage of face processing among bilateral OFA, and tentatively
   indicate a relation to individual variability in processing strategies
   for faces. These findings provide a promising avenue for systematic
   investigations of the potential role of interhemispheric integration in
   future studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The involvement of the human cerebellum in working memory has been well
   established in the last decade. However, the cerebro-cerebellar network
   for visual working memory is not as well defined. Our previous fMRI
   study showed superior and inferior cerebellar activations during a block
   design visual working memory task, but specific cerebellar contributions
   to cognitive processes in encoding, maintenance and retrieval have not
   yet been established. The current study examined cerebellar
   contributions to each of the components of visual working memory and
   presence of cerebellar hemispheric laterality was investigated. 40 young
   adults performed a Sternberg visual working memory task during fMRI
   scanning using a parametric paradigm. The contrast between high and low
   memory load during each phase was examined. We found that the most
   prominent activation was observed in vermal lobule VIIIb and bilateral
   lobule VI during encoding. Using a quantitative laterality index, we
   found that left-lateralized activation of lobule VIIIa was present in
   the encoding phase. In the maintenance phase, there was bilateral lobule
   VI and right-lateralized lobule VIIb activity. Changes in activation in
   right lobule VIIIa were present during the retrieval phase. The current
   results provide evidence that superior and inferior cerebellum
   contributes to visual working memory, with a tendency for
   left-lateralized activations in the inferior cerebellum during encoding
   and right-lateralized lobule VIIb activations during maintenance. The
   results of the study are in agreement with Baddeley's multi-component
   working memory model, but also suggest that stored visual
   representations are additionally supported by maintenance mechanisms
   that may employ verbal coding. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The neurobiological underpinnings of intermittent explosive disorder
   (IED) are traditionally linked to deficiencies in the serotonergic
   system. In this study, we investigated the effects of escitalopram, a
   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), on brain activation
   during face processing. We expected that escitalopram would reduce
   amygdala activity in IED and in addition, we explored the effect in
   other social-emotional-related brain regions. A total of 17 subjects
   with current IED and 14 healthy controls participated in a randomized,
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced fMRI face processing
   study. The analysis focused on the faces compared to a fixation baseline
   contrast, and a factorial model with Group as between-subject and Drug
   as within-subject factor was tested. Group x Drug interaction effects
   were found in the amygdala (small volume corrected) and the left
   temporal parietal junction (TPJ; whole-brain corrected). Escitalopram
   increased amygdala activation in controls, but surprisingly not in IED.
   However, the TPJ showed increased activity in IED on escitalopram
   compared with placebo. The TPJ is associated with social-cognitive
   processes, such as perspective taking and empathy. The TPJ findings
   suggest that SSRI administration may reduce aggressive tendencies
   towards other people by enhancing these social-cognitive processes.
   Future research should further elucidate the long-term effects of SSRIs
   on various social-emotional tasks in IED.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{From an evolutionary perspective, one should be more sensitive when
   outgroup members attack the ingroup but less so when ingroup or outgroup
   members fight among themselves. Indeed, previous behavioral and
   neuroimaging research demonstrated that people show greater sensitivity
   for the suffering of ingroup compared with outgroup members. However,
   the question still remains whether this is always the case regardless of
   who is the agent causing the harm. To examine the role of agency and
   group membership in perception of harm, 48 participants were scanned
   while viewing ingroup or outgroup perpetrators intentionally harming
   ingroup or outgroup members. Behavioral results showed greater moral
   sensitivity for ingroup versus outgroup victims, but only when the
   perpetrator was from the outgroup. In support of this finding, fMRI data
   showed greater activity in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) for ingroup
   victims when they were harmed by outgroup individuals. In addition,
   effective connectivity analyses documented an increased coupling between
   left OFC and left amygdala and insula for ingroup harm, when the
   perpetrator was from the outgroup. Together these results indicate that
   we are highly sensitive to harm perpetrated by outgroup members and that
   increased sensitivity for ingroup victims is dependent on who is the
   agent of the action.}},

   cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MEDICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Limited data available about the mechanisms of dysphagia and
   areas involving swallow after brain damage; accordingly it is hard to
   predict which cases are more likely to develop swallowing dysfunction
   based on the neuroimaging. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   relationship between brain lesions and dysphagia in a sample of acute
   conscious stroke patients. Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional
   study, 113 acute conscious stroke patients (69 male mean {[}standard
   deviation (SD)] age 64.37 {[}15.1]), participated in this study. Two
   neurologists and one radiologist localized brain lesions according to
   neuroimaging of the patients. Swallowing functions were assessed
   clinically by an expert speech pathologist with the Mann Assessment of
   Swallowing Ability (MASA). The association of brain region and
   swallowing problem was statistically evaluated using Chi-square test.
   Results: Mean (SD) MASA score for the dysphagic patients was 139.61
   (29.77). Swallowing problem was significantly more prevalent in the
   right primary sensory (P = 0.03), right insula (P = 0.005), and right
   internal capsule (P = 0.05). Conclusion: It may be concluded from these
   findings that the right hemisphere lesions associated with occurring
   dysphagia. Further studies using more advanced diagnostic tools on big
   samples particularly in a perspective structure are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence has indicated a potential connection between
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) signal and
   cognitive performance. However, the relationship between intrinsic
   neural activity and behavioral interference effect on cognitive control
   has been poorly understood. In the present study, seventy-eight healthy
   subjects underwent RS-fMRI and performed Multi-Source Interference Task
   (MSIT). The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF)
   was measured as an indicator of intrinsic brain activity. The difference
   in reaction times between interference and control conditions in MSIT
   was evaluated as interference effect. Then we examined the associations
   between fALFF and interference effect using partial correlation analysis
   controlling for age, gender and mean framewise displacement. The results
   demonstrated that fALFF values in orbital prefrontal cortex (OPFC) and
   right inferior frontal cortex (IFC) were negatively correlated with the
   interference effect in MSIT. The findings manifest that OPFC and right
   IFC may influence the processing efficiency of cognitive conflict and
   play a crucial role in cognitive control. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Detection of communicative signals is thought to facilitate knowledge
   acquisition early in life, but less is known about the role these
   signals play in adult learning or about the brain systems supporting
   sensitivity to communicative intent. The current study examined how
   ostensive gaze cues and communicative actions affect adult recognition
   memory and modulate neural activity as measured by fMRI. For both the
   behavioral and fMRI experiments, participants viewed a series of videos
   of an actress acting on one of two objects in front of her.
   Communicative context in the videos was manipulated in a 2 x 2 design in
   which the actress either had direct gaze (Gaze) or wore a visor (NoGaze)
   and either pointed at (Point) or reached for (Reach) one of the objects
   (target) in front of her. Participants then completed a recognition
   memory task with old (target and nontarget) objects and novel objects.
   Recognition memory for target objects in the Gaze conditions was greater
   than NoGaze, but no effects of gesture type were seen. Similarly, the
   fMRI video-viewing task revealed a significant effect of Gaze within
   right posterior STS (pSTS), but no significant effects of Gesture.
   Furthermore, pSTS sensitivity to Gaze conditions was related to greater
   memory for objects viewed in Gaze, as compared with NoGaze, conditions.
   Taken together, these results demonstrate that the ostensive,
   communicative signal of direct gaze preceding an object-directed action
   enhances recognition memory for attended items and modulates the pSTS
   response to object-directed actions. Thus, establishment of a
   communicative context through ostensive signals remains an important
   component of learning and memory into adulthood, and the pSTS may play a
   role in facilitating this type of social learning.}},

Abstract = {{The study of signed languages allows the dissociation of sensorimotor
   and cognitive neural components of the language signal. Here we
   investigated the neurocognitive processes underlying the monitoring of
   two phonological parameters of sign languages: handshape and location.
   Our goal was to determine if brain regions processing sensorimotor
   characteristics of different phonological parameters of sign languages
   were also involved in phonological processing, with their activity being
   modulated by the linguistic content of manual actions. We conducted an
   fMRI experiment using manual actions varying in phonological structure
   and semantics: (1) signs of a familiar sign language (British Sign
   Language), (2) signs of an unfamiliar sign language (Swedish Sign
   Language), and (3) invented nonsigns that violate the phonological rules
   of British Sign Language and Swedish Sign Language or consist of
   nonoccurring combinations of phonological parameters. Three groups of
   participants were tested: deaf native signers, deaf nonsigners, and
   hearing nonsigners. Results show that the linguistic processing of
   different phonological parameters of sign language is independent of the
   sensorimotor characteristics of the language signal. Handshape and
   location were processed by different perceptual and task-related brain
   networks but recruited the same language areas. The semantic content of
   the stimuli did not influence this process, but phonological structure
   did, with nonsigns being associated with longer RTs and stronger
   activations in an action observation network in all participants and in
   the supramarginal gyrus exclusively in deaf signers. These results
   suggest higher processing demands for stimuli that contravene the
   phonological rules of a signed language, independently of previous
   knowledge of signed languages. We suggest that the phonological
   characteristics of a language may arise as a consequence of more
   efficient neural processing for its perception and production.}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness characterized by distinct
   positive and negative symptoms and functional impairment. The anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) is a region of the brain's limbic system that is
   hypoactive during emotion processing in schizophrenia. Recent evidence
   suggests the hypoactive ACC in schizophrenia is due to negative (and not
   positive) symptoms. However, this finding has not been replicated and
   the functional significance of this relationship remains unclear. The
   present study examined the association between positive and negative
   symptoms, ACC activation to emotional images, and functional outcome in
   schizophrenia. Specifically, 16 schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder
   (SZ/SZAF) and 15 control (CON) participants underwent an fMRI scan while
   completing an emotional picture-rating task. SZ/SZAF participants also
   completed clinician-rated measures of positive and negative symptoms and
   functional abilities. SZ/SZAF participants with high negative symptoms
   had reduced ACC activation to pleasant images relative to those with low
   negative symptoms and CON, who did not differ. Furthermore, amongst all
   SZ/SZAF participants poorer social functioning was associated with
   decreased ACC activation to pleasant images. Finally, ACC activation
   partially mediated the relationship between negative symptoms and social
   dysfunction. These results provide evidence of the functional
   significance of the relationship between negative symptoms and ACC
   dysfunction in schizophrenia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

   present study, activation within the posterior, middle, and anterior
   partitions of the insula upon unpleasant electric stimulation was
   compared between subjects with a history of NSSI and healthy controls.
   Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated a
   sample of 30 subjects, 14 of them with a lifetime history of NSSI.
   Unpleasant electric stimulation to the dorsum of the non-dominant hand
   was performed at four levels of increasing intensity. Significantly
   increasing posterior insula activation, which is likely to reflect the
   somatosensory aspects of unpleasant haptic sensations, was found upon
   parametrically increasing electric stimulation in both groups. By
   contrast, activation of the anterior insula, rather related to the more
   affective aspects of distressing stimuli, was significantly modulated
   only in the control group, but not in subjects with NSSI. These findings
   may support present hypotheses of altered processing of the more
   affective aspects of unpleasant or distressing experiences in NSSI, as a
   putatively relevant factor for understanding the etiology of this
   behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD), which involves excessive anxiety and fear
   of negative evaluation, is accompanied by abnormalities in brain
   function. While social anxiety appears to be represented on a spectrum
   ranging from nonclinical behavior to clinical manifestation, neural
   alteration in nonclinical populations remains unclear. This study
   examined the relationship between psychological measures of social
   anxiety, mainly using the Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNES), and
   brain function (functional connectivity, degree centrality, and regional
   betweenness centrality). Results showed that FNES scores and functional
   connectivity of the parahippocampal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex and
   the betweenness centrality of the right parietal cortex were negatively
   correlated. These regions are altered in SAD patients, and each is
   associated with social cognition and emotional processing. The results
   supported the perspective that social anxiety occurs on a spectrum and
   indicated that the FNES is a useful means of detecting neural
   alterations that may relate to the social anxiety spectrum. In addition,
   the findings indicated that graph analysis was useful in investigating
   the neural underpinnings of SAD in addition to other psychiatric
   symptoms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Impulsivity is central to borderline personality disorder (BPD).
   Response inhibition, addressing the ability to suppress or stop actions,
   is one aspect of behavioral impulse control which is frequently used to
   assess impulsivity. BPD patients display deficits in response inhibition
   under stress condition or negative emotions. We assessed whether
   response inhibition and its neural underpinnings are impaired in BPD
   when tested in an emotionally neutral setting and when co-morbid
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is excluded. To this
   end, we studied response inhibition in unmedicated BPD patients and
   healthy controls (HC) in two independent samples using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging during Simon-, Go/nogo-, and Stopsignal
   tasks. BPD patients and HC did not differ significantly in their
   performance in the Go/nogo and the Stopsignal tasks. Response
   interference in the Simon task was increased in BPD patients in one
   sample, but this could not be replicated in the second sample. In both
   samples, no significant differences in brain activation patterns during
   any of the tasks were present while the neural impulse control network
   was robustly activated during the inhibition tasks in both groups. Our
   results provide evidence that under emotionally neutral conditions
   response inhibition is not impaired in patients with BPD without
   co-occurring ADHD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in mind and behavior are believed to reflect the
   functional variability of the human brain. Due to the lack of a
   large-scale longitudinal dataset, the full landscape of variability
   within and between individual functional connectomes is largely unknown.
   We collected 300 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rfMRI) datasets from 30 healthy participants who were scanned every
   three days for one month. With these data, both intra-and
   inter-individual variability of six common rfMRI metrics, as well as
   their test-retest reliability, were estimated across multiple spatial
   scales. Global metrics were more dynamic than local regional metrics.
   Cognitive components involving working memory, inhibition, attention,
   language and related neural networks exhibited high intra-individual
   variability. In contrast, inter-individual variability demonstrated a
   more complex picture across the multiple scales of metrics. Limbic,
   default, frontoparietal and visual networks and their related cognitive
   components were more differentiable than somatomotor and attention
   networks across the participants. Analyzing both intra-and
   inter-individual variability revealed a set of high-resolution maps on
   test-retest reliability of the multi-scale connectomic metrics. These
   findings represent the first collection of individual differences in
   multi-scale and multimetric characterization of the human functional
   connectomes in-vivo, serving as normal references for the field to guide
   the use of common functional metrics in rfMRI-based applications.}},

Abstract = {{Conduct disorder (CD) is characterized by a persistent pattern of
   antisocial behavior and aggression in childhood and adolescence.
   Previous task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) studies have revealed widespread brain regional
   abnormalities in adolescents with CD. However, whether the resting-state
   networks (RSNs) are altered in adolescents with CD remains unknown. In
   this study, resting-state fMRI data were first acquired from eighteen
   male adolescents with pure CD and eighteen age-and gender-matched
   typically developing (TD) individuals. Independent component analysis
   (ICA) was implemented to extract nine representative RSNs, and the
   generated RSNs were then compared to show the differences between the CD
   and TD groups. Interestingly, it was observed from the brain mapping
   results that compared with the TD group, the CD group manifested
   decreased functional connectivity in four representative RSNs: the
   anterior default mode network (left middle frontal gyrus), which is
   considered to be correlated with impaired social cognition, the
   somatosensory network (bilateral supplementary motor area and right
   postcentral gyrus), the lateral visual network (left superior occipital
   gyrus), and the medial visual network (right fusiform, left lingual
   gyrus and right calcarine), which are expected to be relevant to the
   perceptual systems responsible for perceptual dysfunction in male
   adolescents with CD. Importantly, the novel findings suggested that male
   adolescents with pure CD were identified to have dysfunctions in both
   low-level perceptual networks (the somatosensory network and visual
   network) and a high-order cognitive network (the default mode network).
   Revealing the changes in the functional connectivity of these RSNs
   enhances our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the
   modulation of emotion and social cognition and the regulation of
   perception in adolescents with CD.}},

   illnesses {[}schizophrenia (SZ), schizoaffective disorder (SAD), and
   bipolar I disorder with psychosis (BP)] and whether these deficits are
   shared with their first-degree non-psychotic relatives. A total of 1199
   subjects were assessed, including 220 SZ, 147 SAD, 180 psychotic BP, 150
   first-degree relatives of SZ, 126 SAD relatives, 134 BP relatives, and
   242 healthy controls (1). All subjects underwent structural MRI (sMRI)
   and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scanning. Joint-independent
   component analysis (jICA) was used to fuse sMRI gray matter and rs-fMRI
   amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations data to identify the
   relationship between the two modalities. jICA revealed two significantly
   fused components. The association between functional brain alteration in
   a prefrontal-striatal-thalamic-cerebellar network and structural
   abnormalities in the default mode network was found to be common across
   psychotic diagnoses and correlated with cognitive function, social
   function, and schizo-bipolar scale scores. The fused alteration in the
   temporal lobe was unique to SZ and SAD. The above effects were not seen
   in any relative group (including those with cluster-A personality).
   Using a multivariate-fused approach involving two widely used imaging
   markers, we demonstrate both shared and distinct biological traits
   across the psychosis spectrum. Furthermore, our results suggest that the
   above traits are psychosis biomarkers rather than endophenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Kinship terms have been found to be highly diverse across languages.
   Here we investigated the brain representation of kinship terms in two
   distinct populations, native Chinese and Caucasian English speakers,
   with a five-element kinship identification (FEKI) task. The neuroimaging
   results showed a common extensive frontal and parietal lobe brain
   activation pattern for different kinship levels for both Chinese and
   Caucasian English speakers. Furthermore, Chinese speakers had longer
   reaction times and elicited more fronto-parietal brain networks
   activation compared to English speakers in level three (e.g., uncle and
   nephew) and four (e.g., cousin), including an association between the
   middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobe, which might be
   associated with higher working memory, attention control, and social
   distance representation load in Chinese kinship system processing. These
   results contribute to our understanding of the representation of kinship
   terms in the two languages.}},

Title = {{Pleasant and Unpleasant Odors Influence Hedonic Evaluations of Human
   Faces: An Event-Related Potential Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Odors can alter hedonic evaluations of human faces, but the neural
   mechanisms of such effects are poorly understood. The present study
   aimed to analyze the neural underpinning of odor-induced changes in
   evaluations of human faces in an odor-priming paradigm, using
   event-related potentials (ERPs). Healthy, young participants (N = 20)
   rated neutral faces presented after a 3 s pulse of a pleasant odor
   (jasmine), unpleasant odor (methylmercaptan), or no odor control (clean
   air). Neutral faces presented in the pleasant odor condition were rated
   more pleasant than the same faces presented in the no-odor control
   condition, which in turn were rated more pleasant than faces in the
   unpleasant odor condition. Analysis of face-related potentials revealed
   four clusters of electrodes significantly affected by odor condition at
   specific time points during long latency epochs (600-950 ms). In the
   620-640 ms interval, two scalp-time clusters showed greater negative
   potential in the right parietal electrodes in response to faces in the
   pleasant odor condition, compared to those in the no-odor and unpleasant
   odor conditions. At 926 ms, face related potentials showed greater
   positivity in response to faces in the pleasant and unpleasant odor
   conditions at the left and right lateral frontal-temporal electrodes,
   respectively. Our data shows that odor-induced shifts in evaluations of
   faces were associated with amplitude changes in the late (>600) and
   ultra-late (>900 ms) latency epochs. The observed amplitude changes
   during the ultralate epoch are consistent with a left/right hemisphere
   bias towards pleasant/unpleasant odor effects. Odors alter evaluations
   of human faces, even when there is a temporal lag between presentation
   of odors and faces. Our results provide an initial understanding of the
   neural mechanisms underlying effects of odors on hedonic evaluations.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A growing body of work suggests that sensory processes may also
   contribute to affective experience. In this study, we performed a
   meta-analysis of affective experiences driven through visual, auditory,
   olfactory, gustatory, and somatosensory stimulus modalities including
   study contrasts that compared affective stimuli to matched neutral
   control stimuli. We found, first, that limbic and paralimbic regions,
   including the amygdala, anterior insula, pre-supplementary motor area,
   and portions of orbitofrontal cortex were consistently engaged across
   two or more modalities. Second, early sensory input regions in
   occipital, temporal, piriform, mid insular, and primary sensory cortex
   were frequently engaged during affective experiences driven by visual,
   auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and somatosensory inputs. A
   classification analysis demonstrated that the pattern of neural activity
   across a contrast map diagnosed the stimulus modality driving the
   affective experience. These findings suggest that affective experiences
   are constructed from activity that is distributed across limbic and
   paralimbic brain regions and also activity in sensory cortical regions.}},

   adult readers of four distinct and highly contrasting languages,
   Spanish, English, Hebrew, and Chinese, performed an identical semantic

   complementary analytic approaches demonstrate limited language
   variation, with speech-print convergence emerging as a common brain

   whether it is opaque or transparent, and regardless of the phonological

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is characterized by social deficits. Correctly monitoring
   own and others' performance is crucial for efficient social behavior.
   Deficits in monitoring own performance as reflected in reduced
   error-related negativity (rERN) amplitudes, have been demonstrated
   repeatedly in schizophrenia. A similar ERP component (observed ERN;
   oERN) is elicited when observing others' mistakes. However, possible
   deficits in monitoring others' performance have never been investigated
   in schizophrenia. The current ERP-study compared a group of
   schizophrenia patients (N=22) and healthy controls (N=21) while
   performing a Simon task and the social Simon task, enabling the
   investigation of own (rERN) and others' (oERN) performance monitoring.
   Patients showed slower reaction times, but comparable accuracy and
   compatibility effects in both tasks. As expected, patients' rERN
   amplitudes were reduced. Importantly however, oERN amplitudes were
   comparable between both groups. While monitoring own performance is
   compromised in schizophrenia, monitoring others' performance seems
   intact. This divergence between internal and external performance
   monitoring in patients is in line with studies showing normal
   neurophysiological responses to negative feedback. The presently found
   dissociation may improve our understanding of cognitive and neural
   mechanisms underlying monitoring of own and others' performance and may
   stimulate treatment development aimed at learning from external rather
   than internal error information in schizophrenia. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A topic of common interest to psychologists and philosophers is the
   spontaneous flow of thoughts when the individual is awake but not
   involved in cognitive demands. This argument, classically referred to as
   the ``stream of consciousness{''} of James, is now known in the
   psychological literature as `Mind-Wandering.' Although of great
   interest, this construct has been scarcely investigated so far. Diaz et
   al. (2013) created the Amsterdam Resting State Questionnaire (ARSQ),
   composed of 27 items, distributed in seven factors: discontinuity of
   mind, theory of mind (ToM), self, planning, sleepiness, comfort, and
   somatic awareness. The present study aims at: testing psychometric
   properties of the ARSQ in a sample of 670 Italian subjects; exploring
   the neural correlates of a subsample of participants (N = 28) divided
   into two groups on the basis of the scores obtained in the ToM factor.
   Results show a satisfactory reliability of the original factional
   structure in the Italian sample. In the subjects with a high mean in the
   ToM factor compared to low mean subjects, functional MRI revealed: a
   network (48 nodes) with higher functional connectivity (FC) with a
   dominance of the left hemisphere; an increased within lobe FC in frontal
   and insular lobes. In both neural and behavioral terms, our results
   support the idea that the mind, which does not rest even when explicitly
   asked to do so, has various and interesting mentalistic-like contents.}},

Title = {{BDNF Methylation and Maternal Brain Activity in a Violence-Related
   Sample}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{It is known that increased circulating glucocorticoids in the wake of
   excessive, chronic, repetitive stress increases anxiety and impairs
   Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) signaling. Recent studies of
   BDNF gene methylation in relation to maternal care have linked high BDNF
   methylation levels in the blood of adults to lower quality of received
   maternal care measured via self-report. Yet the specific mechanisms by
   which these phenomena occur remain to be established. The present study
   examines the link between methylation of the BDNF gene promoter region
   and patterns of neural activity that are associated with maternal
   response to stressful versus non-stressful child stimuli within a sample
   that includes mothers with interpersonal violence-related PTSD
   (IPV-PTSD). 46 mothers underwent fMRI. The contrast of neural activity
   when watching children-including their ownwas then correlated to BDNF
   methylation. Consistent with the existing literature, the present study
   found that maternal BDNF methylation was associated with higher levels
   of maternal anxiety and greater childhood exposure to domestic violence.
   fMRI results showed a positive correlation of BDNF methylation with
   maternal brain activity in the anterior cingulate (ACC), and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), regions generally credited with
   a regulatory function toward brain areas that are generating emotions.
   Furthermore we found a negative correlation of BDNF methylation with the
   activity of the right hippocampus. Since our stimuli focus on stressful
   parenting conditions, these data suggest that the correlation between
   vmPFC/ACC activity and BDNF methylation may be linked to mothers who are
   at a disadvantage with respect to emotion regulation when facing
   stressful parenting situations. Overall, this study provides evidence
   that epigenetic signatures of stress-related genes can be linked to
   functional brain regions regulating parenting stress, thus advancing our
   understanding of mothers at risk for stress-related psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Due to capacity limits on perception, conditions of high perceptual load
   lead to reduced processing of unattended stimuli (Lavie et al., 2014).
   Accumulating work demonstrates the effects of visual perceptual load on
   visual cortex responses, but the effects on auditory processing remain
   poorly understood. Here we establish the neural mechanisms underlying
   ``inattentional deafness{''}-the failure to perceive auditory stimuli
   under high visual perceptual load. Participants performed a visual
   search task of low (target dissimilar to nontarget items) or high
   (target similar to nontarget items) load. On a random subset (50\%) of
   trials, irrelevant tones were presented concurrently with the visual
   stimuli. Brain activity was recorded with magnetoencephalography, and
   time-locked responses to the visual search array and to the incidental
   presence of unattended tones were assessed. High, compared to low,
   perceptual load led to increased early visual evoked responses (within
   100 ms from onset). This was accompanied by reduced early (similar to
   100 ms from tone onset) auditory evoked activity in superior temporal
   sulcus and posterior middle temporal gyrus. A later suppression of the
   P3 ``awareness{''} response to the tones was also observed under high
   load. A behavioral experiment revealed reduced tone detection
   sensitivity under high visual load, indicating that the reduction in
   neural responses was indeed associated with reduced awareness of the
   sounds. These findings support a neural account of shared audiovisual
   resources, which, when depleted under load, leads to failures of sensory
   perception and awareness.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in popularity are a key aspect of status in virtually all
   human groups and shape social interactions within them. Little is known,
   however, about how we track and neurally represent others' popularity.
   We addressed this question in two real-world social networks using
   sociometric methods to quantify popularity. Each group member
   (perceiver) viewed faces of every other group member (target) while
   whole-brain functional MRI data were collected. Independent functional
   localizer tasks were used to identify brain systems supporting affective
   valuation (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, amygdala)
   and social cognition (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, precuneus,
   temporoparietal junction), respectively. During the face-viewing task,
   activity in both types of neural systems tracked targets' sociometric
   popularity, even when controlling for potential confounds. The target
   popularity-social cognition system relationship was mediated by
   valuation system activity, suggesting that observing popular individuals
   elicits value signals that facilitate understanding their mental states.
   The target popularity-valuation system relationship was strongest for
   popular perceivers, suggesting enhanced sensitivity to differences among
   other group members' popularity. Popular group members also demonstrated
   greater interpersonal sensitivity by more accurately predicting how
   their own personalities were perceived by other individuals in the
   social network. These data offer insights into the mechanisms by which
   status guides social behavior.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Establishing a role of the dorsal medial frontal cortex in the
   performance monitoring and cognitive control has been a challenge to
   neuroscientists for the past decade. In light of recent findings, the
   conflict monitoring hypothesis has been elaborated to an action outcome
   predictor theory. One of the findings that led to this re-evaluation was
   the fMRI study in which conflict-related brain activity was investigated
   in terms of the so-called time on task effect, i.e., a linear increase
   of the BOLD signal with longer response times. The aim of this study was
   to investigate brain regions involved in the processing of saccadic
   response conflict and to account for the time on task effect. A modified
   spatial cueing task was implemented in the event-related fMRI study with
   oculomotor responses. The results revealed several brain regions which
   show higher activity for incongruent trials in comparison to the
   congruent ones, including pre-supplementary motor area together with the
   frontal and parietal regions. Further analysis accounting for the effect
   of response time provided evidence that these brain activations were not
   sensitive to time on task but reflected purely the congruency effect.}},

Abstract = {{In the twenty-first century's biological culture, pleasure and desire
   seem to be widely reconceptualized as processes of the brain. The
   neurosciences of sex and money are two fields of crucial interest in
   this cerebralization of desire. On the basis of a cross-reading of
   neuroimaging studies of sexuality and of neuroeconomics, I analyze the
   specific notions of desire/pleasure at work in the neuroimaging
   experiments. What is lost, and what is claimed to be found, in the
   neurosciences of desire for sex and cash? With particular attention to
   notions of rewards, I argue that transfers of metaphors from
   neuroeconomics naturalize economized notions of sexual desire. Moreover,
   I argue that neuroeconomics and the neuroscience of sex essentialize
   desire as the drive of our behavior, and that this, in turn, relates to
   the neurosciences' re-invention of the social in the terms of a late
   capitalist society.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. Paroxysmal eyelid movements (PEM) are non-epileptic episodes
   characterized by eyelid closure, upturning of the eyes, and rapid eyelid
   flutter. The aim of this study was to report clinical and EEG data of
   patients with PEM and its relationship with visual sensitivity.
   Methods. We studied 26 patients with epilepsy (12 males and 14 females;
   mean age: 14.06.9 years) who presented PEM. The epilepsy was idiopathic
   generalized (eight cases), idiopathic focal (six cases), symptomatic
   focal (five cases), and reflex epilepsy (seven cases). PEM and blinking
   were analysed by video-EEG recordings at rest and during intermittent
   photic stimulation, pattern stimulation, and TV watching. Blink rate was
   evaluated during three different conditions: at rest, during a
   TV-viewing period, and at the occurrence of PEM. Analysis of variance
   (ANOVA) was used for statistical comparisons.
   Results. Repeated episodes of PEM were recorded in all patients. The
   frequency of PEM ranged from 8 to 12.5 Hz (average: 9.6 +/- 1.5). PEM
   were accompanied by a significant increase in blinking compared to the
   rest condition and TV watching (blink rate: 56.5 +/- 21.1 vs 25.0 +/-
   16.2 vs 11.3 +/- 11.8, respectively; p<0.0001). Photoparoxysmal EEG
   responses (measured as sensitivity to photic stimulation) were found in
   25 cases, associated with pattern sensitivity in 22; only one patient
   was sensitive to pattern but not photic stimulation. Visually-induced
   seizures were recorded in 20 cases, triggered by both stimuli (photic
   and pattern stimulation) in 11 patients; seizures were triggered by
   pattern stimulation (but not photic stimulation) in five, photic
   stimulation (but not pattern stimulation) in three, and TV watching (but
   not photic or pattern stimulation) in one. Epileptic eyelid myoclonia
   was noted in 17 patients.
   Conclusion. The coexistence of PEM, photoparoxysmal EEG responses,
   increased blinking, and epileptic eyelid myoclonia suggests an
   underlying dysfunction involving cortical-subcortical neural networks,
   according to the recent concept of system epilepsies. {[}Published with

Abstract = {{For a long time, treatment of schizophrenia has been essentially
   focussed on positive symptoms managing. Yet, even if these symptoms are
   the most noticeable, negative symptoms are more enduring, resistant to
   pharmacological treatment and associated with a worse prognosis. In the
   two last decades, attention has shift towards cognitive deficit, as this
   deficit is most robustly associated to functional outcome. But it
   appears that the modest improvement in cognition, obtained in
   schizophrenia through pharmacological treatment or, more purposely, by
   cognitive enhancement therapy, has only lead to limited amelioration of
   functional outcome. Authors have claimed that pure cognitive processes,
   such as those evaluated and trained in tots of these programs, may be
   too distant from real-life conditions, as the latter are largely based
   on social interactions. Consequently, the field of social cognition, at
   the interface of cognition and emotion, has emerged. In a first part of
   this article we examined the links, in schizophrenia, between negative
   symptoms, cognition and emotions from a therapeutic standpoint.
   Nonetheless, investigation of emotion in schizophrenia may also hold
   relevant premises for understanding the physiopathology of this
   disorder. In a second part, we propose to illustrate this research by
   relying on the heuristic value of an elementary marker of social
   cognition, facial affect recognition. Facial affect recognition has been
   repeatedly reported to be impaired in schizophrenia and some authors
   have argued that this deficit could constitute an endophenotype of the
   illness. We here examined how facial affect processing has been used to
   explore broader emotion dysfunction in schizophrenia, through
   behavioural and imaging studies. In particular, fMRI paradigms using
   facial affect have shown particular patterns of amygdala engagement in
   schizophrenia, suggesting an intact potential to elicit the limbic
   system which may however not be advantageous. Finally, we analysed
   facial affect processing on a cognitive-perceptual level, and the
   aptitude in schizophrenia to manipulate featural and configural
   information in faces. (C) L'Encephale, Paris, 2015. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is a tendency to use data from neuroscience, cognitive science and
   experimental psychology to rail against philosophical ethics. Recently,
   Joshua Greene has argued that deontological judgments tend to be
   supported by emotional responses to irrelevant features, whereas
   consequentialist judgments are more reliable because they tend to be
   supported by cognitive processes. In this article, I will analyse the
   evidence used by Greene to suggest a different kind of argument against
   deontology, which I will call the argument from self-defeating beliefs.
   The charge of this type of argument amounts to exposing a psychological
   nature of deontological judgements that is supposedly rejected by
   deontologists. I will argue that the alleged evidence is poorly
   understood, mixed and indeterminate, failing to endorse general
   conclusions about the psychological processes underlying deontological
   judgements.}},

Abstract = {{The Brief presentation of a complex scene entails that only a few
   objects can be selected, processed indepth, and stored in memory. Both
   low-level sensory salience and high-level context-related factors (e.g.,
   the conceptual match/mismatch between objects and scene context)
   contribute to this selection process, but how the interplay between
   these factors affects memory encoding is largely unexplored. Here,
   during fMRI we presented participants with pictures of everyday scenes.
   After a short retention interval, participants judged the position of a
   target object extracted from the initial scene. The target object could
   be either congruent or incongruent with the context of the scene, and
   could be located in a region of the image with maximal or minimal
   salience. Behaviourally, we found a reduced impact of saliency on
   visuospatial working memory performance when the target was
   out-of-context. Encoding-related fMRI results showed that
   context-congruent targets activated dorsoparietal regions, while
   context-incongruent targets de-activated the ventroparietal cortex.
   Saliency modulated activity both in dorsal and ventral regions, with
   larger context-related effects for salient targets. These findings
   demonstrate the joint contribution of knowledge-based and
   saliency-driven attention for memory encoding, highlighting a
   dissociation between dorsal and ventral parietal regions. (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{In anorexia nervosa, problems with social relationships contribute to
   illness, and improvements in social support are associated with
   recovery. Using the multiround trust game and 3T MRI, we compare neural
   responses in a social relationship in three groups of women: women with
   anorexia nervosa, women in long-term weight recovery from anorexia
   nervosa, and healthy comparison women. Surrogate markers related to
   social signals in the game were computed each round to assess whether
   the relationship was improving (benevolence) or deteriorating
   (malevolence) for each subject. Compared with healthy women, neural
   responses to benevolence were diminished in the precuneus and right
   angular gyrus in both currently-ill and weight-recovered subjects with
   anorexia, but neural responses to malevolence differed in the left
   fusiform only in currently-ill subjects. Next, using a whole-brain
   regression, we identified an office assessment, the positive
   personalizing bias, that was inversely correlated with neural activity
   in the occipital lobe, the precuneus and posterior cingulate, the
   bilateral temporoparietal junctions, and dorsal anterior cingulate,
   during benevolence for all groups of subjects. The positive
   personalizing bias is a self-report measure that assesses the degree
   with which a person attributes positive experiences to other people.
   These data suggest that problems in perceiving kindness may be a
   consistent trait related to the development of anorexia nervosa, whereas
   recognizing malevolence may be related to recovery. Future work on
   social brain function, in both healthy and psychiatric populations,
   should consider positive personalizing biases as a possible marker of
   neural differences related to kindness perception. (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Serotonin facilitates fear learning in animals. We therefore predicted
   that individual differences in the capacity to regulate serotonergic
   transmission in the human neural fear circuit would be inversely related
   to fear conditioning. The capacity to regulate serotonergic transmission
   was indexed by serotonin transporter availability measured with
   {[}C-11]-DASB positron emission tomography. Results indicate that lower
   serotonin transporter availability in the amygdala, insula and dorsal

   responses. Our finding supports serotonergic modulation of fear
   conditioning in humans and may aid in understanding susceptibility for
   developing anxiety conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

   however, influences of early language experience on later neural
   processing are unknown. We investigated whether maintenance of neural
   templates from early language experience influences subsequent language
   processing. Using fMRI, we scanned the following three groups performing
   a French phonological working memory (PWM) task: (1) monolingual French
   children; (2) children adopted from China before age 3 who discontinued
   Chinese and spoke only French; (3) Chinese-speaking children who learned
   French as a second language but maintained Chinese. Although all groups
   perform this task equally well, brain activation differs. French
   monolinguals activate typical PWM brain regions, while both
   Chinese-exposed groups also activate regions implicated in cognitive
   control, even the adoptees who were monolingual French speakers at
   testing. Early exposure to a language, and/or delayed exposure to a
   subsequent language, continues to influence the neural processing of
   subsequently learned language sounds years later even in highly
   proficient, early-exposed users.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research demonstrated structural overlap between reward and self
   processing, but the functional relationship that explains how self
   processing influences reward processing remains unclear. The present
   study used an experimentally constrained reflection task to investigate
   whether individuals' outcome evaluations in a gambling task are
   modulated by task-unrelated self- and other-reflection processes. The
   self- and other-reflection task contained descriptions of the self or
   others, and brain event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while 16
   normal adults performed a gambling task. The ERP analysis focused on the
   feedback-related negativity (FRN) component We found that the difference
   wave of FRN increased in the self-reflection condition compared with the
   other-reflection condition. The present findings provide direct evidence
   that self processing can influence reward processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{ObjectivesBehavioral deficits in the Theory of Mind (ToM) have been
   robustly demonstrated in bipolar disorder. These deficits may represent
   an intermediate phenotype of the disease. The aim of this study was: (i)
   to investigate alterations in neural ToM processing in euthymic patients
   with bipolar disorder, and (ii) to examine whether similar effects are
   present in unaffected relatives of patients with bipolar disorder
   suggesting that ToM functional activation may be, in part, due to
   genetic risk for the disease.
   MethodsA total of 24 euthymic patients with bipolar disorder, 21
   unaffected first-degree relatives, and 81 healthy controls completed a
   ToM task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   ResultsWe observed reduced bilateral activation of the temporoparietal
   junction (TPJ) and diminished functional fronto-temporoparietal
   connectivity in patients compared to controls. Relatives tended towards
   intermediate temporoparietal activity and functional coupling with
   medial prefrontal areas. There was also evidence for a potentially
   compensatory enhanced recruitment of the right middle temporal gyrus and
   stronger connectivity between this region and the medial prefrontal
   cortex in relatives.
   ConclusionsThese findings provide further evidence of altered neural ToM
   processing in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder. Further, our
   findings in relatives lend support to the idea that altered ToM
   processing may act as an intermediate phenotype of the disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder are linked to
   altered limbic morphology, dysregulated neuroendocrine function, and
   heightened amygdala responses to salient social cues. Oxytocin appears
   to be a potent modulator of amygdala reactivity and neuroendocrine
   responses to psychosocial stress. Given these stress regulatory effects,
   there is increasing interest in understanding the role of oxytocin in
   vulnerability to stress-related clinical disorders. The present study
   examines the impact of a common functional variant within the oxytocin
   receptor (OXTR) gene (rs2254298) on structure and function of the
   amygdala in a high-risk sample of urban, low-income, minority youth with
   a high incidence of early life stress (ELS). Compared to G/G
   homozygotes, youth carrying the OXTR A-allele showed increased amygdala
   volume, reduced behavioral performance, and heightened amygdala response
   during two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks that
   involved viewing socially-relevant face stimuli. Higher amygdala
   response was related to ELS in A-allele carriers but not G/G
   homozygotes. These findings underscore a series of relations among a
   common oxytocin system gene variant, ELS exposure, and structure and
   function of the amygdala in early life. Heightened amygdala response to
   salient social cues in OXTR A-allele carriers may elevate risk for
   emotional psychopathology by increasing amygdala involvement in
   disambiguating environmental cues, particularly for individuals with
   ELS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The neural basis of humour comprehension and humour appreciation: The

Abstract = {{Psychological well-being and social acumen benefit from the recognition
   of humourous intent and its enjoyment. The enjoyment of humour requires
   recognition, but humour recognition is not necessarily accompanied by
   humour enjoyment. Humour recognition is crucial during social
   interactions, while the associated enjoyment is less critical. Few
   neuroimaging studies have explicitly differentiated between the neural
   foundations of humour comprehension and humour appreciation. Among such
   studies, design limitations have obscured the specification of neural
   correlates to humour comprehension or appreciation. We implemented a
   trichotomous response option to address these design limitations.
   Twenty-four participants rated 120 comics (90 unaltered with humourous
   intent and 30 caption-altered without humourous intent) as either funny
   jokes (FJ), not funny jokes but intended to be funny (NFJ), or not
   intended to be funny or non-jokes (NJ). We defined humour comprehension
   by NFJ minus NJ and humour appreciation by FJ minus NFJ. We measured
   localized blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) neural responses with a 3T
   MRI scanner. We tested for BOLD responses in humour comprehension brain
   regions of interest (ROIs), humour appreciation ROIs, and across the
   whole-brain. We found significant NFJ-NJ BOLD responses in our humour
   comprehension ROIs and significant FJ-NFJ BOLD responses in select
   humour appreciation ROIs. One key finding is that comprehension accuracy
   levels correlated with humour-comprehension responses in the left
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ). This finding represents a novel and
   precise neural linkage to humour comprehension. A second key finding is
   that the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) was uniquely associated with
   humour-appreciation. The SFG response suggests that complex cognitive
   processing underlies humour appreciation and that current models of
   humour appreciation be revised. Finally, our research design provides an
   operational distinction between humour comprehension and appreciation
   and a sensitive measure of individual differences in humour
   comprehension accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the amygdala is often directly linked with fear and emotion,
   amygdala neurons are activated by a wide variety of emotional and
   non-emotional stimuli. Different subregions within the amygdala may be
   engaged preferentially by different aspects of emotional and
   non-emotional tasks. To test this hypothesis, we measured and compared
   the effects of novelty and fear on amygdala activity. We used
   high-resolution blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging and
   streamline tractography to subdivide the amygdala into three distinct
   functional subunits. We identified a laterobasal subregion connected
   with the visual cortex that responds generally to visual stimuli, a
   non-projecting region that responds to salient visual stimuli, and a
   centromedial subregion connected with the diencephalon that responds
   only when a visual stimulus predicts an aversive outcome. We provide
   anatomical and functional support for a model of amygdala function where
   information enters through the laterobasal subregion, is processed by
   intrinsic circuits in the interspersed tissue, and is then passed to the
   centromedial subregion, where activation leads to behavioral output.}},

Abstract = {{Shyness is a fundamental trait associated with social-emotional
   maladaptive behaviors, including many forms of psychopathology.
   Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that hyper-responsivity to social
   and emotional stimuli occurs in the frontal cortex and limbic system in
   shy individuals, but the relationship between shyness and brain-wide
   functional connectivity remains incompletely understood. Using
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we addressed this
   issue by exploring the relationship between regional functional
   connectivity strength (rFCS) and scores of shyness in a cohort of 61
   healthy young adults and controlling for the effects of social and trait
   anxiety scores. We observed that the rFCS of the insula positively
   correlated with shyness scores regardless of sex. Furthermore, we found
   that there were significant sex-by-shyness interactions in the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex and insula (two core nodes of the salience
   network) as well as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex: the rFCS
   values of these regions positively correlated with shyness scores in
   females but negatively correlated in males. Taken together, we provide
   evidence for intrinsic functional connectivity differences in

Abstract = {{Cognitive reappraisal recruits prefrontal and parietal cortical areas.
   Because of the near exclusive usage in past research of visual stimuli
   to elicit emotions, it is unknown whether the same neural substrates
   underlie the reappraisal of emotions induced through other sensory
   modalities. Here, participants reappraised their emotions in order to
   increase or decrease their emotional response to angry prosody, or
   maintained their attention to it in a control condition. Neural activity
   was monitored with fMRI, and connectivity was investigated by using
   psychophysiological interaction analyses. A right-sided network
   encompassing the superior temporal gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus
   and the inferior frontal gyrus was found to underlie the processing of
   angry prosody. During reappraisal to increase emotional response, the
   left superior frontal gyrus showed increased activity and became
   functionally coupled to right auditory cortices. During reappraisal to
   decrease emotional response, a network that included the medial frontal
   gyrus and posterior parietal areas showed increased activation and
   greater functional connectivity with bilateral auditory regions.
   Activations pertaining to this network were more extended on the right
   side of the brain. Although directionality cannot be inferred from PPI
   analyses, the findings suggest a similar frontoparietal network for the
   reappraisal of visually and auditorily induced negative emotions.}},

Abstract = {{The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in the capacity to
   accurately recognise facial expressions. The aim of the current study
   was to determine if anodal transcranial direct current stimulation
   (tDCS) targeting the right OFC in healthy adults would enhance facial
   expression recognition, compared with a sham condition. Across two
   counterbalanced sessions of tDCS (i.e. anodal and sham), 20
   undergraduate participants (18 female) completed a facial expression
   labelling task comprising angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad and
   neutral expressions, and a control (social judgement) task comprising
   the same expressions. Responses on the labelling task were scored for
   accuracy, median reaction time and overall efficiency (i.e. combined
   accuracy and reaction time). Anodal tDCS targeting the right OFC
   enhanced facial expression recognition, reflected in greater efficiency
   and speed of recognition across emotions, relative to the sham
   condition. In contrast, there was no effect of tDCS to responses on the
   control task. This is the first study to demonstrate that anodal tDCS
   targeting the right OFC boosts facial expression recognition. This
   finding provides a solid foundation for future research to examine the
   efficacy of this technique as a means to treat facial expression
   recognition deficits, particularly in individuals with OFC damage or

Abstract = {{To study emotional reactions to music, it is important to consider the
   temporal dynamics of both affective responses and underlying brain
   activity. Here, we investigated emotions induced by music using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a data-driven approach
   based on intersubject correlations (ISC). This method allowed us to
   identify moments in the music that produced similar brain activity (i.e.
   synchrony) among listeners under relatively natural listening
   conditions. Continuous ratings of subjective pleasantness and arousal
   elicited by the music were also obtained for the music outside of the
   scanner. Our results reveal synchronous activations in left amygdala,
   left insula and right caudate nucleus that were associated with higher
   arousal, whereas positive valence ratings correlated with decreases in
   amygdala and caudate activity. Additional analyses showed that
   synchronous amygdala responses were driven by energy-related features in
   the music such as root mean square and dissonance, while synchrony in
   insula was additionally sensitive to acoustic event density.
   Intersubject synchrony also occurred in the left nucleus accumbens, a
   region critically implicated in reward processing. Our study
   demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of an approach based on ISC
   to explore the temporal dynamics of music perception and emotion in
   naturalistic conditions.}},

   study aimed to determine which neural structures selectively increase

   this end, participants were scanned twice-either in a thirst or
   no-thirst state-while viewing pictures of beverages and chairs. As
   expected, thirst led to a selective increase in self-reported
   pleasantness and arousal by beverages. Increased responses to beverage
   when compared with chair stimuli were observed in the cingulate cortex,
   insular cortex and the amygdala in the thirst state, which were absent
   in the no-thirst condition. Enhancing the incentive value of
   need-relevant cues in a thirst state is a key mechanism for motivating
   drinking behavior. Overall, distributed regions of the motive circuitry,

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide S (NPS) and its receptor NPSR have captured attention
   in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. Here, a functional
   polymorphism in the NPSR1 gene has been linked to deviant cortico-limbic
   interactions in response to negative stimuli. While healthy T allele
   carriers exhibited increased amygdala and prefrontal cortex activity,
   panic disorder patients carrying the T risk allele displayed
   hypofrontality possibly reflecting insufficient prefrontal inhibition of
   limbic reactivity. In order to study multi-level effects of genotype and
   anxiety, prefrontal cortex activity during an emotional n-back task was
   measured in 66 volunteers genotyped for the NPSR1 rs324981 A/T variant
   (AA homozygotes vs. T allele carriers) by means of functional
   near-infrared spectroscopy. For a high working memory load (3-back), T
   allele carriers showed a signal increase to negative pictures in the
   dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex while AA homozygotes displayed
   a signal decrease. Since groups did not differ on skin conductance level
   and behavioral parameters, this effect in the risk group in line with
   results from fMRI studies is speculated to represent an adaptive
   mechanism to compensate for presumably increased subcortical activity
   driven by an overactive NPS system. However, anxiety sensitivity
   correlated negatively with prefrontal activity in T allele carriers
   possibly suggesting a decompensation of the adaptive compensatory
   upregulation.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the neural basis of individual variation in
   emotion regulation, specifically the ability to reappraise negative
   stimuli so as to down-regulate negative affect. Brain functions in young
   adults were measured with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging during
   three conditions: (i) attending to neutral pictures; (ii) attending to
   negative pictures and (iii) reappraising negative pictures.
   Resting-state functional connectivity was measured with amygdala and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) seed regions frequently
   associated with emotion regulation. Participants reported more negative
   affect after attending to negative than neutral pictures, and less
   negative affect following reappraisal. Both attending to negative vs
   neutral pictures and reappraising vs attending to negative pictures
   yielded widespread activations that were significantly right-lateralized
   for attending to negative pictures and left-lateralized for reappraising
   negative pictures. Across participants, more successful reappraisal
   correlated with less trait anxiety and more positive daily emotion,
   greater activation in medial and lateral prefrontal regions, and lesser
   resting-state functional connectivity between (a) right amygdala and
   both medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, and (b)
   bilateral DLPFC and posterior visual cortices. The ability to regulate
   emotion, a source of resilience or of risk for distress, appears to vary

Abstract = {{Delay of gratification (DG) is the ability to forgo immediate
   temptations in the service of obtaining larger, delayed rewards. An
   extensive body of behavioral research has revealed that DG ability in
   childhood is associated with a host of important outcomes throughout
   development, and that attentional focus away from temptations underlies
   this ability. In this study, we conducted a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study to identify the neural underpinnings of
   individual differences in DG among children. We observed a relationship
   between behavior during the classic DG task, a well-studied and
   ecologically valid measure, and functional connectivity during a
   modified version of this task in the scanner. Specifically, greater
   attentional focus away from temptations was associated with stronger
   functional coupling between the nucleus accumbens, a brain region that
   supports approach behavior, and several regions within prefrontal and
   parietal cortex that support self-control. These results shed light on
   the network interactions that contribute to DG and that account for
   individual differences in this capacity.}},

Title = {{Cannabis use in early adolescence: Evidence of amygdala hypersensitivity

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{63-70}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Cannabis use in adolescence may be characterized by differences in the
   neural basis of affective processing. In this study, we used an fMRI
   affective face processing task to compare a large group (n = 70) of
   14-year olds with a history of cannabis use to a group (n = 70) of
   never-using controls matched on numerous characteristics including IQ,
   SES, alcohol and cigarette use. The task contained short movies
   displaying angry and neutral faces. Results indicated that cannabis
   users had greater reactivity in the bilateral amygdalae to angry faces
   than neutral faces, an effect that was not observed in their abstinent
   peers. In contrast, activity levels in the cannabis users in cortical
   areas including the right temporal-parietal junction and bilateral
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex did not discriminate between the two face
   conditions, but did differ in controls. Results did not change after
   excluding subjects with any psychiatric symptomology. Given the high
   density of cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala, our findings suggest
   cannabis use in early adolescence is associated with hypersensitivity to
   signals of threat. Hypersensitivity to negative affect in adolescence
   may place the subject at-risk for mood disorders in adulthood. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{When choosing actions, humans have to balance carefully between
   different task demands. On the one hand, they should perform tasks
   repeatedly to avoid frequent and effortful switching between different
   tasks. On the other hand, subjects have to retain their flexibility to
   adapt to changes in external task demands such as switching away from an
   increasingly difficult task. Here, we developed a difficulty-based
   choice task to investigate how subjects voluntarily select task-sets in
   predictably changing environments. Subjects were free to choose 1 of the
   3 task-sets on a trial-by-trial basis, while the task difficulty changed
   dynamically over time. Subjects self-sequenced their behavior in this
   environment while we measured brain responses with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Using multivariate decoding, we found that
   task choices were encoded in the medial prefrontal cortex (dorso-medial
   prefrontal cortex, dmPFC, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dACC).
   The same regions were found to encode task difficulty, a major factor
   influencing choices. Importantly, the present paradigm allowed us to
   disentangle the neural code for task choices and task difficulty,
   ensuring that activation patterns in dmPFC/dACC independently encode
   these 2 factors. This finding provides new evidence for the importance
   of the dmPFC/dACC for task-selection and motivational functions in
   highly dynamic environments.}},

Abstract = {{Psychotic experiences (PEs) occur in the general population, especially
   in children and adolescents, and are associated with poor psychosocial
   outcomes, impaired cognition, and increased risk of transition to
   psychosis. It is unknown how the presence and persistence of PEs during
   early adulthood affects cognition and brain function. The current study
   assessed working memory as well as brain function and structure in 149
   individuals, with and without PEs, drawn from a population cohort.
   Observer-rated PEs were classified as persistent or transient on the
   basis of longitudinal assessments. Working memory was assessed using the
   n-back task during fMRI. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to
   characterize frontoparietal network configuration and voxel-based
   morphometry was utilized to examine gray matter. Those with persistent,
   but not transient, PEs performed worse on the n-back task, compared with
   controls, yet showed no significant differences in regional brain
   activation or brain structure. DCM analyses revealed greater emphasis on
   frontal connectivity within a frontoparietal network in those with PEs
   compared with controls. We propose that these findings portray an
   altered configuration of working memory function in the brain,
   potentially indicative of an adaptive response to atypical development
   associated with the manifestation of PEs.}},

Abstract = {{Although typically identified in early childhood, the social
   communication symptoms and adaptive behavior deficits that are
   characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) persist throughout the
   lifespan. Despite this persistence, even individuals without cooccurring
   intellectual disability show substantial heterogeneity in outcomes.
   Previous studies have found various behavioral assessments {[} such as
   intelligence quotient (IQ), early language ability, and baseline
   autistic traits and adaptive behavior scores] to be predictive of
   outcome, but most of the variance in functioning remains unexplained by
   such factors. In this study, we investigated to what extent functional
   brain connectivity measures obtained from resting-state functional
   connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) could predict the variance left unexplained
   by age and behavior (follow-up latency and baseline autistic traits and
   adaptive behavior scores) in two measures of outcome-adaptive behaviors
   and autistic traits at least 1 y postscan (mean follow-up latency = 2 y,
   10 mo). We found that connectivity involving the so-called salience
   network (SN), default-mode network (DMN), and frontoparietal task
   control network (FPTCN) was highly predictive of future autistic traits
   and the change in autistic traits and adaptive behavior over the same
   time period. Furthermore, functional connectivity involving the SN,
   which is predominantly composed of the anterior insula and the dorsal
   anterior cingulate, predicted reliable improvement in adaptive behaviors
   with 100\% sensitivity and 70.59\% precision. From rs-fcMRI data, our
   study successfully predicted heterogeneity in outcomes for individuals
   with ASD that was unaccounted for by simple behavioral metrics and
   provides unique evidence for networks underlying long-term symptom
   abatement.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has examined the effects of oxytocin (OT) and
   vasopressin (AVP) on human social behavior and brain function. However,
   most participants have been male, while previous research in our lab
   demonstrated sexually differentiated effects of OT and AVP on the neural
   response to reciprocated cooperation. Here we extend our previous work
   by significantly increasing the number of participants to enable the use
   of more stringent statistical thresholds that permit more precise
   localization of OT and AVP effects in the brain. In a double-blind,
   placebo-controlled study, 153 men and 151 women were randomized to
   receive 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU intranasal AVP or placebo.
   Afterwards, they were imaged with fMRI while playing an iterated
   Prisoner's Dilemma Game with same-sex partners. Sex differences were
   observed for effects of OT on the neural response to reciprocated
   cooperation, such that OT increased the caduate/putamen response among
   males, whereas it decreased this response among females. Thus, 24 IU OT
   may increase the reward or salience of positive social interactions
   among men, while decreasing their reward or salience among women.
   Similar sex differences were also observed for AVP effects within
   bilateral insula and right supramarginal gyrus when a more liberal
   statistical threshold was employed. While our findings support previous
   suggestions that exogenous nonapeptides may be effective treatments for
   disorders such as depression and autism spectrum disorder, they caution
   against uniformly extending such treatments to men and women alike.}},

Abstract = {{Although neuroimaging studies in adults demonstrate that cognitive
   reappraisal effectively down-regulates negative affect and results in
   increased prefrontal and decreased amygdala activity, very limited
   empirical data exist on the neural basis of cognitive reappraisal in
   children. This study aimed to pilot test a developmentally-appropriate
   guided cognitive reappraisal task in order to examine the effects of
   cognitive reappraisal on children's self-reports of affect and brain
   responses. Study 1 (N = 19, 4-10 years-old) found that children
   successfully employed guided cognitive reappraisal to decrease
   subjective ratings of negative affect, supporting the effectiveness of
   the guided cognitive reappraisal task. Study 2 (N = 15, ages 6-10
   years-old) investigated the neural responses to guided cognitive
   reappraisal and found that the neural responses showed increased
   activation in the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during the
   cognitive reappraisal condition compared to the no regulation condition.
   In addition, amygdala activity was positively correlated with
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex activation during cognitive reappraisal.
   Findings suggest that the neural networks supporting cognitive
   reappraisal in children involve similar brain regions but brain
   responses deviate from findings in adults. Our findings suggest that the
   neural networks supporting emotion regulation are still developing
   during middle childhood, and future research is necessary to delineate
   age-related development of the neural network involved in cognitive
   reappraisal.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The cognitive deficits of schizophrenia are largely
   resistant to current treatments and thus are a lifelong illness burden.
   The Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in
   Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) provides a
   reliable and valid assessment of cognition across major cognitive
   domains; however, the multimodal brain alterations specifically
   associated with MCCB in schizophrenia have not been examined.
   METHODS: The interrelationships between MCCB and the abnormalities seen
   in three types of neuroimaging-derived maps-fractional amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) from resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), gray matter (GM) density from
   structural MRI, and fractional anisotropy from diffusion MRI-were
   investigated by using multiset canonical correlation analysis in data
   from 47 schizophrenia patients treated with antipsychotic medications
   and 50 age-matched healthy control subjects.
   RESULTS: One multimodal component (canonical variant 8) was identified
   as both group differentiating and significantly correlated with the MCCB
   composite. It demonstrated 1) increased cognitive performance associated
   with higher fALFF (intensity of regional spontaneous brain activity) and
   higher GM volumes in thalamus, striatum, hippocampus, and the
   mid-occipital region, with co-occurring fractional anisotropy changes in
   superior longitudinal fascicules, anterior thalamic radiation, and
   forceps major; 2) higher fALFF but lower GM volume in dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex related to worse cognition in schizophrenia; and 3)
   distinct domains of MCCB might exhibit dissociable multimodal
   signatures, e.g., increased fALFF in inferior parietal lobule
   particularly correlated with decreased social cognition. Medication dose
   did not relate to these findings in schizophrenia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest linked functional and structural
   deficits in distributed cortico-striato-thalamic circuits may be closely
   related to MCCB-measured cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Sex differences in effective fronto-limbic connectivity during negative
   emotion processing}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{180-188}},

Abstract = {{Background: In view of the greater prevalence of depression and anxiety
   disorders in women than in men, functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) studies have examined sex-differences in brain activations during
   emotion processing. Comparatively, sex-differences in brain connectivity
   received little attention, despite evidence for important fronto-limbic
   connections during emotion processing across sexes. Here, we
   investigated sex-differences in fronto-limbic connectivity during
   negative emotion processing.
   Methods: Forty-six healthy individuals (25 women, 21 men) viewed
   negative, positive and neutral images during an fMRI session. Effective
   connectivity between significantly activated regions was examined using
   Granger causality and psychophysical interaction analyses. Sex steroid
   hormones and feminine-masculine traits were also measured.
   Results: Subjective ratings of negative emotional images were higher in
   women than in men. Across sexes, significant activations were observed
   in the dorso-medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the right amygdala.
   Granger connectivity from right amygdala was significantly greater than
   that from dmPFC during the `high negative' condition, an effect driven
   by men. Magnitude of this effect correlated negatively with highly
   negative image ratings and feminine traits and positively with
   testosterone levels.
   Discussion: These results highlight critical sex differences in brain
   connectivity during negative emotion processing and point to the fact
   that both biological (sex steroid hormones) and psychosocial (gender
   role and identity) variables contribute to them. As the dmPFC is
   involved in social cognition and action planning, and the amygdala in
   threat detection, the connectivity results suggest that compared to
   women, men have a more evaluative, rather than purely affective, brain
   response during negative emotion processing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

   may also play an important role in cognitive and emotional processes
   that facilitate drug use. We examined whether insular versus non-insular
   damage from ischemic stroke attenuated acute withdrawal from cigarette
   smoking and reduced the likelihood of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
   use during hospitalization.
   DesignData were derived from a longitudinal study with 3months'
   follow-up, beginning June 2013 and ending May 2014.
   SettingThree acute care hospitals in Rochester, NY, USA.
   ParticipantsOne-hundred and fifty-six current smokers hospitalized for
   acute ischemic stroke (38 with insular infarctions and 118 with
   non-insular infarctions, assessed by three neuroradiologists).
   MeasurementsThe Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (WSWS) and Minnesota
   Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS) were administered during
   hospitalization (a period of forced abstinence) to assess the frequency
   and severity of withdrawal symptoms. NRT use was also assessed during
   hospitalization.
   FindingsOn average, smokers with insular damage had a lower WSWS score
   during admission {[}mean=5.89, standard deviation (SD)=4.72] compared
   with those with non-insular damage (mean=9.20, SD=4.71; P<0.001)
   {[}covariate-adjusted difference in means of -3.12, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI)=-4.97, -1.27]. A similar difference was also noted when
   the MNWS was used (P=0.02). Furthermore, participants with insular
   lesions appeared to be less likely to use NRT during admission compared
   with those with non-insular lesions {[}odds ratio (OR)=0.72, 95\%
   CI=0.32, 1.64].
   ConclusionsCurrent smokers with damage to their insular cortex brain
   region appear to experience fewer and less severe tobacco withdrawal
   symptoms, and appear to be less likely to require nicotine replacement
   therapy during hospitalization, compared with smokers with non-insular
   damage. These findings support the potential role of the insular cortex
   in regulating withdrawal during abstinence, a motivator responsible for
   the maintenance of addictive behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{One common strategy to cope with the difficulties of daily life is
   suppression. Habitual users of suppression tend to suppress their
   feelings rather than expressing them. Although this strategy may reduce
   outward response to emotion, it is not thought to lessen induced
   negative affect. Moreover, it remains unclear whether people with high
   suppression scores can reduce negative affect through cognitive
   reappraisal. In the present study, twenty-nine healthy participants
   differing in suppression scores were directed to reappraise aversive
   stimuli during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results
   showed that higher suppression scores correlated with decreased response
   of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) during cognitive reappraisal.
   Further, high suppression scores related to enhanced negative affect to
   stimuli with greater negative affect correlating with decreased dmPFC
   response during cognitive reappraisal. This study suggests that people
   with high suppression scores experience difficulty in reducing negative
   affect through cognitive reappraisal and implicates neurobiological
   processes that may underlie this difficulty. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The loss of an only child is a negative life event and may potentially
   increase the risk of psychiatric disorders. However, the psychological
   consequences of the loss of an only child and the associated neural
   mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Degree centrality (DC), derived
   from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), was
   used to examine network communication in 22 older adults who lost their
   only child and 23 matched controls. The older adults who lost their only
   child exhibited an ineffective coping style. They also showed decreased
   distant and local DC in the precuneus and left inferior parietal lobule
   and decreased distant DC in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC). Furthermore, the decreased local and distant DC of these
   regions and the decreased DLPFC-precuneus connectivity strength were
   negatively correlated with negative coping scores in the loss group but
   not in the controls. Overall, the results suggested a model that the
   impaired neural network communication of brain hubs within the default
   mode network (DMN) and central executive network (CEN) were associated
   with a negative coping style in older adults who lost their only child.
   The decreased connectivity of the hubs can be identified as a neural
   risk factor that is related to future psychopathology. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Associative memory is considered to be resource-demanding, requiring
   individuals to learn individual items and the specific relationships
   between those items. Previous research has shown that prior studying of
   items aids in associative memory for pairs composed of those same items,
   as compared to pairs of items that have not been prelearned (e.g., Kilb
   \& Naveh-Benjamin, 2011). In the present study, we sought to elucidate
   the neural correlates mediating this memory facilitation. After being
   trained on individual items, participants were scanned while encoding
   item pairs composed of items from the pretrained phase
   (familiarized-item pairs) and pairs whose items had not been previously
   learned (unfamiliarized-item pairs). Consistent with previous findings,
   the overall subsequent recollection showed the engagement of bilateral
   parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and hippocampus, when compared to subsequent
   forgetting. However, a direct comparison between familiarizedand
   unfamiliarized-item pairs showed that subsequently recollected
   familiarized-item pairs were associated with decreased activity across
   much of the encoding network, including bilateral PHG, hippocampus,
   prefrontal cortex, and regions associated with item-specific processing
   within occipital cortex. Increased activity for familiarized-item pairs
   was found in a more limited set of regions, including bilateral parietal
   cortex, which has been associated with the formation of novel
   associations. Additionally, activity in the right parietal cortex
   correlated with associative memory success in the familiarized
   condition. Taken together, these results suggest that prior exposure to
   items can reduce the demands incurred on neural processing throughout
   the associative encoding network and can enhance associative memory
   performance by focusing resources within regions supporting the
   formation of associative links.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{32-43}},

Abstract = {{Affective mentalizing involves the integration of various social signals
   in order to infer the affective states of others. Previous neuroimaging
   studies have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex, the
   precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, and the temporo-parietal junction
   constitute the core affective mentalizing network. However, the relative
   contributions of these regions to affective mentalizing remain unclear.
   We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate which of
   these nodes are involved in the integration of two social signals:
   emotional tears and facial expressions. We assumed that this integration
   would produce a supra-additive effect, indicated by greater activity
   than the sum of the effects of the individual social signals. Female
   subjects rated the sadness of faces with either tears or tear-like
   circles, and either sad or neutral expressions. We observed the
   supra-additive effect in the medial prefrontal cortex and
   precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex but not in the temporo-parietal
   junction. These results indicate that the medial prefrontal cortex and
   precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex play an important role in
   integrating tears and facial expressions during affective mentalizing.

Abstract = {{Visiting the dentist is often accompanied by apprehension or anxiety.
   People, who suffer from specific dental phobia (a disproportional fear
   of dental) procedures show psychological and physiological symptoms
   which make dental treatments difficult or impossible. For such purposes,
   hypnosis is often used in dental practice as an alternative for a number
   of treatments adjuvant or instead of sedation or general anaesthetics,
   as medication is often associated with risks and side effects. This is
   the first study to address the effects of a brief dental hypnosis on the
   fear processing structures of the brain in dental phobics using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 12 dental phobics (DP;
   mean 34.9 years) and 12 healthy controls (CO; mean 33.2 years) were
   scanned with a 3 T MRI whole body-scanner observing brain activity
   changes after a brief hypnotic invervention. An fMRI event-related
   design symptom provocation task applying animated audio-visual
   pseudorandomized strong phobic stimuli was presented in order to
   maximize the fearful reactions during scanning. Control videos showed
   the use of familiar electronic household equipment.
   In DP group, main effects of fear condition were found in the left
   amygdala and bilaterally in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula
   and hippocampu < L). During hypnosis DP showed a significantly reduced
   activation in all of these areas. Reduced neural activity patterns were
   also found in the control group. No amygdala activation was detected in
   healthy subjects in the two experimental conditions. Compared to DP, CO
   showed less bilateral activation in the insula and ACC in the awake
   condition. Findings show that anxiety-provoking stimuli such as
   undergoing dental surgery, endodontic treatments or insufficient
   anaesthetics, can be effectively reduced under hypnosis. The present
   study gives scientific evidence that hypnosis is a powerful and
   successful method for inhibiting the reaction of the fear circuitry
   structures. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Psychological resilience refers to the ability to thrive in the face of
   risk and adversity, which is crucial for individuals' mental and
   physical health. However, its precise neural correlates are still
   largely unknown. Here we used resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to identify the brain regions underlying
   this construct by correlating individuals' psychological resilience
   scores with the regional homogeneity (ReHo) and then examined how these
   resilience-related regions predicted life satisfaction in a sample of
   healthy young adults. We found that the ReHo in the bilateral insula,
   right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right rostral ACC
   (rACC) negatively predicted individual differences in psychological
   resilience, revealing the critical role of the salience network (SN) in
   psychological resilience. Crucially, the ReHo in the dACC within the SN
   mediated the effects of psychological resilience on life satisfaction.
   In summary, these findings suggest that spontaneous activity of the
   human brain reflect the efficiency of psychological resilience and
   highlight the dACC within the SN as a neural substrate linking
   psychological resilience and life satisfaction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

   violence. Twenty-nine violent juvenile offenders and 28 age-matched

   showed significantly lower ReHo values in the right caudate, right
   medial prefrontal cortex, and left precuneus, and higher values in the
   right supramarginal gyrus than the controls. These regions had both high
   sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between the two groups
   suggesting that dysfunction in these regions can be used to correctly
   classify those individuals who are violent. Dysfunction in the right

Abstract = {{Previous studies have established a linkage between olfactory deficits
   and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. However, it is not known whether
   olfactory function is associated with hedonic traits in individuals with
   schizotypy. Seventeen individuals with schizotypy and 18 age- and
   sex-matched controls participated in this study. Hedonic traits were
   assessed with the Chapman Scales for Physical and Social Anhedonia (CSAS
   and CPAS). Olfactory function was assessed with the Sniffin' Stick Test
   (olfactory threshold, odour discrimination and odour identification).
   All participants undertook a structural imaging scan for grey matter
   volume measurements. Individuals with schizotypy had significantly
   higher CSAS and CPAS scores than healthy controls. They had normal
   olfactory function. Their odour identification ability was inversely
   correlated with physical and social anhedonia. The volume of the right
   parahippocampal gyrus was positively associated with odour
   identification ability, and negatively associated with physical and
   social anhedonia. Furthermore, mediation analysis suggested that odour
   identification ability influences anhedonia through its effect on the
   right parahippocampal gyrus. No such relationship was found in controls.
   These findings suggest that there is a relationship between odour
   identification and anhedonia in individuals with schizotypy, and the
   association may be mediated by parahippocampal gyrus volume. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is a condition marked by a disrupted brain functional
   network. In schizophrenia, the brain network is characterized by reduced
   distributed information processing efficiency; however, the correlation
   between information processing efficiency and the symptomatology of
   schizophrenia remains unclear. Few studies have examined path length
   efficiencies in schizophrenia. In this study, we examined small-world
   network metrics computed from resting state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging data collected from 49 patients with schizophrenia and
   28 healthy people. We calculated brain network efficiency using graph
   theoretical analysis of the networks of brain areas, as defined by the
   Automated Anatomical Labeling parcellation scheme, and investigated
   efficiency correlations by using the 5-factor model of psychopathology,
   which considers the various domains of schizophrenic symptoms and might
   also consider discrete pathogenetic processes. The global efficiency of
   the resting schizophrenic brains was lower than that of the healthy
   controls, but local efficiency did not differ between the groups. The
   severity of psychopathology, negative symptoms, and depression and
   anxiety symptoms were correlated with global efficiency in schizophrenic
   brains. The severity of psychopathology was correlated with increased
   network efficiency from short-range connections, but not networks from
   long-range connections. Our findings indicate that schizophrenic
   psychopathology is correlated with brain network information processing
   efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Humans attend to social cues in order to understand and predict others'
   behavior. Facial expressions and gaze direction provide valuable
   information to infer others' mental states and intentions. The present
   study examined the mechanism of gaze following in the context of
   participants' expectations about successive action steps of an observed
   actor. We embedded a gaze-cueing manipulation within an action scenario
   consisting of a sequence of naturalistic photographs. Gaze-induced
   orienting of attention (gaze following) was analyzed with respect to
   whether the gaze behavior of the observed actor was in line or not with
   the action-related expectations of participants (i.e., whether the actor
   gazed at an object that was congruent or incongruent with an overarching
   action goal). In Experiment 1, participants followed the gaze of the
   observed agent, though the gaze-cueing effect was larger when the actor
   looked at an action-congruent object relative to an incongruent object.
   Experiment 2 examined whether the pattern of effects observed in
   Experiment 1 was due to covert, rather than overt, attentional
   orienting, by requiring participants to maintain eye fixation throughout
   the sequence of critical photographs (corroborated by monitoring eye
   movements). The essential pattern of results of Experiment 1 was
   replicated, with the gazecueing effect being completely eliminated when
   the observed agent gazed at an action-incongruent object. Thus, our
   findings show that covert gaze following can be modulated by
   expectations that humans hold regarding successive steps of the action
   performed by an observed agent.}},

Abstract = {{The primate brain contains a set of face-selective areas, which are
   thought to extract the rich social information that faces provide, such
   as emotional state and personal identity. The nature of this information
   raises a fundamental question about these face-selective areas: Do they
   respond to a face purely because of its visual attributes, or because
   the face embodies a larger social agent? Here, we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether the macaque face patch
   system exhibits a whole-agent response above and beyond its responses to
   individually presented faces and bodies. We found a systematic
   development of whole-agent preference through the face patches, from
   subadditive integration of face and body responses in posterior face
   patches to superadditive integration in anterior face patches.
   Superadditivity was not observed for faces atop nonbody objects,
   implying categorical specificity of face-body interaction. Furthermore,
   superadditivity was robust to visual degradation of facial detail,
   suggesting whole-agent selectivity does not require prior face
   recognition. In contrast, even the body patches immediately adjacent to
   anterior face areas did not exhibit superadditivity. This asymmetry
   between face-and body-processing systems may explain why observers
   attribute bodies' social signals to faces, and not vice versa. The
   development of whole-agent selectivity from posterior to anterior face
   patches, in concert with the recently described development of natural
   motion selectivity from ventral to dorsal face patches, identifies a
   single face patch, AF (anterior fundus), as a likely link between the
   analysis of facial shape and semantic inferences about other agents.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the impact of depressive disorders, anxiety
   disorders and the comorbidity of these disorders on the regional
   electrophysiological features of brain activity. Sixty-four-channel
   event-related potentials (ERP) were acquired during a visual oddball
   task in patients with depressive disorder, patients with anxiety
   disorders, patients with comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders and
   healthy subjects. An fMRI-constrained source model was applied to ERP to
   identify different cortical activities in the patient and control
   groups. Comorbid patients showed an abnormal
   frontal-greater-than-parietal P3b topography in the right hemisphere and
   the highest P3a amplitude at frontal and central sites at the scalp
   midline. For P3b, depressed patients showed decreased right-lateralized
   activity in the precentral sulcus (PrCS) and posterior parietal cortex
   (PPC). Anxious patients demonstrated hyperactive prefrontal cortices
   (PFC). Comorbid patients presented decreased activity in the cingulate
   gyrus, right PrCS and right PPC and increased activity in the left PFC
   and left insular (INS). For P3a, hyperactive left PrCS was found in
   comorbid patients. Comorbid patients showed both anxiety-related and
   depression-related activity. A superimposition effect of depression and
   anxiety was identified with (1) aggravated hypo-function of the
   right-lateralized dorsal attention and salience networks and (2)
   complicated anxiety-related hyper-function of the left-lateralized
   ventral attention and salience networks.}},

Title = {{Spontaneous brain activity following fear reminder of fear conditioning
   by using resting-state functional MRI}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Although disrupting reconsolidation may be a promising approach to
   attenuate or erase the expression of fear memory, it is not clear how
   the neural state following fear reminder contribute to the following
   fear extinction. To address this question, we used resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to measure spontaneous
   neuronal activity and functional connectivity (RSFC) following fear
   reminder. Some brain regions such as dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC)
   and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed increased amplitude of
   LFF (ALFF) in the fear reminder group than the no reminder group
   following fear reminder. More importantly, there was much stronger
   functional connectivity between the amygdala and vmPFC in the fear
   reminder group than those in the no reminder group. These findings
   suggest that the strong functional connectivity between vmPFC and
   amygdala following a fear reminder could serve as a key role in the
   followed-up fear extinction stages, which may contribute to the erasing
   of fear memory.}},

   Mind}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Successful social interactions require both affect sharing (empathy) and
   understanding others' mental states (Theory of Mind, ToM). As these two
   functions have mostly been investigated in isolation, the specificity of
   the underlying neural networks and the relation of these networks to the
   respective behavioral indices could not be tested. Here, we present a
   novel fMRI paradigm (EmpaToM) that independently manipulates both
   empathy and ToM. Experiments 1a/b (N = 90) validated the task with
   established empathy and ToM paradigms on a behavioral and neural level.
   Experiment 2 (N = 178) employed the EmpaToM and revealed clearly
   separable neural networks including anterior insula for empathy and
   ventral temporoparietal junction for ToM. These distinct networks could
   be replicated in task-free resting state functional connectivity.
   Importantly, brain activity in these two networks specifically predicted
   the respective behavioral indices, that is, inter-individual differences
   in ToM related brain activity predicted inter-individual differences in
   ToM performance, but not empathic responding, and vice versa. Taken
   together, the validated EmpaToM allows separation of affective and
   cognitive routes to understanding others. It may thus benefit future
   clinical, developmental, and intervention studies on identifying
   selective impairments and improvement in specific components of social
   cognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The left amygdala: A shared substrate of alexithymia and empathy}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{20-32}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Alexithymia, a deficit in emotional self-awareness, and deficits in
   empathy, which encompasses the awareness of other's emotions, are
   related constructs that are both associated with a range of
   psychopathological disorders. Neuroimaging studies suggest that there is
   overlap between the neural bases of alexithymia and empathy, but no
   systematic comparison has been conducted so far. The aim of this
   structural magnetic resonance imaging study was to disentangle the
   overlap and differences between the morphological profiles of the
   cognitive and affective dimensions of alexithymia and empathy, and to
   find out to what extent these differ between women and men.
   High-resolution T1 anatomical images were obtained from 125 healthy
   right-handers (18-42 years), 70 women and 55 men. By means of
   voxel-based morphometry, region of interest (ROI) analyses were
   performed on gray matter volumes of several anatomically defined
   a-priori regions previously linked to alexithymia and empathy. Partial
   correlations were conducted within the female and male group using ROI
   parameter estimates as dependent variables and the cognitive and
   affective dimensions of alexithymia and empathy, respectively, as
   predictors, controlling for age. Results were considered significant if
   they survived Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The
   left amygdala was identified as a key substrate of both alexithymia and
   empathy. This association was characterized by an opposite pattern: The
   cognitive alexithymia dimension was linked to smaller, the two empathy
   dimensions to larger left amygdala volume. While sex-specific effects
   were not observed for empathy, they were evident for the affective
   alexithymia dimension: Men-but not women-with difficulty fantasizing had
   smaller gray matter volume in the middle cingulate cortex. Moreover,
   structural covariance patterns between the left amygdala and other
   emotion-related brain regions differed markedly between alexithymia and
   empathy. These differences may underlie the complex patterns of deficits
   in emotional self-and other-awareness observed across a range of
   psychopathological conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The literature on action observation revealed contradictory results

   research has shown that the posterior part of the medial prefrontal

   behaviour while action understanding research has revealed some mixed
   results concerning the role of the anterior part of the medial

   resolve this discrepancy in the literature by showing that different
   parts of the medial prefrontal cortex are active depending on whether an
   observed unusual behaviour is intentional or not. While the posterior
   medial prefrontal cortex is more active when we observe unusual
   accidental actions compared to unusual intentional actions, a more
   anterior part of the medial prefrontal cortex is more active when we
   observe unusual intentional actions compared to unusual accidental

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},

Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{An accurate judgment of the emotional state of others is a prerequisite
   for successful social interaction and hence survival. Thus, it is not
   surprising that we are highly skilled at recognizing the emotions of
   others. Here we aimed to examine the neuronal correlates of emotion
   recognition from gait. To this end we created highly controlled dynamic
   body-movement stimuli based on real human motion-capture data (Roether
   et al., 2009). These animated avatars displayed gait in four emotional
   (happy, angry, fearful, and sad) and speed-matched neutral styles. For
   each emotional gait and its equivalent neutral gait, avatars were
   displayed at five morphing levels between the two. Subjects underwent
   fMRI scanning while classifying the emotions and the emotional intensity
   levels expressed by the avatars.
   Our results revealed robust brain selectivity to emotional compared to
   neutral gait stimuli in brain regions which are involved in emotion and
   biological motion processing, such as the extrastriate body area (EBA),
   fusiform body area (FBA), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and the
   amygdala (AMG). Brain activity in the amygdala reflected emotional
   awareness: for visually identical stimuli it showed amplified stronger
   response when the stimulus was perceived as emotional. Notably, in
   avatars gradually morphed along an emotional expression axis there was a
   parametric correlation between amygdala activity and emotional
   intensity.
   This study extends the mapping of emotional decoding in the human brain
   to the domain of highly controlled dynamic biological motion. Our
   results highlight an extensive level of brain processing of emotional
   information related to body language, which relies mostly on body
   kinematics. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Maternal depression is associated with negative outcomes for
   offspring, including increased incidence of child psychopathology.
   Quality of mother child relationships can be compromised among
   affectively ill dyads, such as those characterized by maternal
   depression and child psychopathology, and negatively impact outcomes
   bidirectionally. Little is known about the neural mechanisms that may
   modulate depressed mothers responses to their psychiatrically ill
   children during middle childhood and adolescence, partially because of a
   need for ecologically valid personally relevant fMRI tasks that might
   most effectively elicit these neural mechanisms.
   Methods: The current project evaluated maternal response to child
   positive and negative affective video clips in 19 depressed mothers with
   psychiatrically ill offspring using a novel fMRI task.
   Results: The task elicited activation in the ventral striatum when
   mothers viewed positive clips and insula when mothers viewed negative
   clips of their own (versus unfamiliar) children. Both types of clips
   elicited activation in regions associated with affect regulation and
   sell related and social processing. Greater lifetime number of
   depressive episodes, comorbid anxiety, and poor mother child
   relationship quality all emerged as predictors of maternal response to
   child affect.
   Limitations: Findings may be specific to dyads with psychiatrically ill
   children.
   Conclusions: Altered neural response to child affect may be an important
   characteristic of chronic maternal depression and may impact
   mother-child relationships negatively. Existing interventions for
   depression may be improved by helping mothers respond to their
   children's affect more adaptively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},
Pages = {{114-121}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: A large number of previous neuroimaging studies have
   explored the functional alterations of post traumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD). However, abnormalities in the functional architecture of
   resting-state networks in PTSD were rarely elucidated.
   Methods: This study used independent component analysis to explore the
   resting state intranetwork and internetwork functional connectivity
   differences between 20 PTSD patients and 20 matched healthy controls
   (HCs).
   Results: Selective alterations of intranetwork and internetwork
   intrinsic functional connectivities were found in the PTSD patients.
   Compared with HCs, the PTSD patients exhibited significantly decreased
   network connectivity within the anterior default mode network, posterior
   default mode network (pDMN), salience network (SN), sensory motor
   network, and auditory network. Furthermore, the PTSD patients exhibited
   increased internetwork connectivity between SN and pDMN.
   Limitations: This study lacked recruitment of trauma exposed HCs, which
   limits our ability to determine whether the alterations are caused by
   PTSD or trauma exposure.
   Conclusion: The findings suggested that the PTSD patients exhibited
   abnormal functional connectivity at the brain network level. Notably,
   the enhanced internetwork connectivity between SN and pDMN in the PTSD
   patients may be associated with hyperarousal and heightened anxiety in
   PTSD. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Judgment of learning (JOL) plays a pivotal role in self-regulated
   learning. Although the JOLs are in general accurate, important
   deviations from memory performance are often reported, especially when
   the JOLs are made immediately after learning. Nevertheless, existing
   studies have not clearly dissociated the neural processes underlying
   subjective JOL and objective memory. In the present study, participants
   were asked to study a list of words that would be tested 1 day later.
   Immediately after learning an item, participants predicted how likely
   they would remember that item. Critically, the JOL was performed on only
   half of the studied items to avoid its contamination on subsequent
   memory. We found that during encoding, compared to items later judged as
   will be forgotten,{''} those judged as ``will be remembered{''} showed
   stronger activities in the default-mode network, including the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and posterior cingulate cortex, as
   well as weaker functional connectivity between the left dorsolateral PFC
   and the visual cortex. The exact opposite pattern was found when
   comparing items that were actually remembered with those that were later
   forgotten. These important neural dissociations between JOL and memory
   performance shed light on the neural mechanisms of human metamemory
   bias.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Several regions of the human brain respond more strongly to faces than
   to other visual stimuli, such as regions in the amygdala (AMG), superior
   temporal sulcus (STS), and the fusiform face area (FFA). It is unclear
   if these brain regions are similar in representing the configuration or
   natural appearance of face parts. We used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging of healthy adults who viewed natural or schematic faces with
   internal parts that were either normally configured or randomly
   rearranged. Response amplitudes were reduced in the AMG and STS when
   subjects viewed stimuli whose configuration of parts were digitally
   rearranged, suggesting that these regions represent the 1st order
   configuration of face parts. In contrast, response amplitudes in the FFA
   showed little modulation whether face parts were rearranged or if the
   natural face parts were replaced with lines. Instead, FFA responses were
   reduced only when both configural and part information were reduced,
   revealing an interaction between these factors, suggesting distinct
   representation of 1st order face configuration and parts in the AMG and
   STS vs. the FFA.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of face memory in humans and primates is well
   established, but little is known about the neurotransmitter systems
   involved in face recognition. We tested the hypothesis that face
   recognition is linked to dopamine (DA) activity in fusiform gyrus (FFG).
   DA availability was assessed by measuring D1 binding potential (BP)
   during rest using PET. We further assessed blood-oxygen-level-dependent
   (BOLD) signal change while subjects performed a face-recognition task
   during fMRI scanning. There was a strong association between D1 BP and
   BOLD activity in FFG, whereasD1BPin striatal and other extrastriatal
   regions were unrelated to neural activity in FFG. These results suggest
   that D1 BP locally modulates FFG function during face recognition.
   Observed relationships among D1 BP, BOLD activity, and face-recognition
   performance further suggest that D1 receptors place constraints on the
   responsiveness of FFG neurons.}},

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Impairments in emotion regulation are thought to have a key role in the
   pathogenesis of anxiety disorders, but the neurobiological underpinnings
   contributing to vulnerability remain poorly understood. It has been a
   long-held view that exaggerated fear is linked to hyperresponsivity of
   limbic brain areas and impaired recruitment of prefrontal control.
   However, increasing evidence suggests that prefrontal-cortical networks
   are hyperactive during threat processing in anxiety disorders. This
   study directly explored limbic-prefrontal neural response, connectivity
   and heart-rate variability (HRV) in patients with a severe anxiety
   disorder during incidental versus intentional emotion regulation. During
   3 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging, 18 participants with
   panic disorder and 18 healthy controls performed an emotion regulation
   task. They either viewed negative images naturally (Maintain), or they
   were instructed to intentionally downregulate negative affect using
   previously taught strategies of cognitive reappraisal (Reappraisal).
   Electrocardiograms were recorded throughout to provide a functional
   measure of regulation and emotional processing. Compared with controls,
   patients showed increased neural activation in limbic-prefrontal areas
   and reduced HRV during incidental emotion regulation (Maintain). During
   intentional regulation (Reappraisal), group differences were
   significantly attenuated. These findings emphasize patients' ability to
   regulate negative affect if provided with adaptive strategies. They also
   bring prefrontal hyperactivation forward as a potential mechanism of
   psychopathology in anxiety disorders. Although these results challenge
   models proposing impaired allocation of prefrontal resources as a key
   characteristic of anxiety disorders, they are in line with more recent
   neurobiological frameworks suggesting that prefrontal hyperactivation
   might reflect increased utilisation of maladaptive regulation strategies
   quintessential for anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The current study examined blood oxygen level-dependent signal

   individuals. Participants were faster to shoot armed Blacks than Whites,
   but faster in making don't shoot responses to unarmed Whites than
   Blacks. Brain activity differed to armed versus unarmed targets
   depending on target race, suggesting different mechanisms underlying
   threat versus safety decisions. Anterior cingulate cortex was

Abstract = {{Adults optimize perceptual judgements by integrating different types Of
   sensory information {[}1, 2]. This engages specialized neural circuits
   that fuse signals from the same {[}3-5] or different {[}6] modalities.
   Whereas young children can use sensory cues independently, adult-like
   precision gains from cue combination only emerge around ages 10 to 11
   years {[}7-9]. Why does it take so long to make best use of sensory
   information? Existing data cannot distinguish whether this (1) reflects
   surprisingly late changes in sensory processing (sensory integration
   mechanisms in the brain are still developing) or (2) depends on
   post-perceptual changes (integration in sensory cortex is adult-like,
   but higher-level decision processes do not access the information)
   {[}10]. We tested visual depth cue integration in the developing brain
   to distinguish these possibilities. We presented children aged 6-12
   years with displays depicting depth from binocular disparity and
   relative motion and made measurements using psychophysics, retinotopic
   mapping, and pattern classification fMRI. Older children (>10.5 years)
   showed clear evidence for sensory fusion in V3B, a visual area thought
   to integrate depth cues in the adult brain {[}3-5]. By contrast, in
   younger children (<10.5 years), there was no evidence for sensory fusion
   in any visual area. This significant age difference was paired with a
   shift in perceptual performance around ages 10 to 11 years and could not
   be explained by motion artifacts, visual attention, or signal quality
   differences. Thus, whereas many basic visual processes mature early in
   childhood {[}11, 12], the brain circuits that fuse cues take a very long
   time to develop.}},

Abstract = {{Dysfunction of the fronto-striato-thalamic circuit routing through the
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is thought to play the main role in the
   pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Repetitious
   stimulation of the OFC-ventral striatum (VS) projections in mice has
   been shown to increase the firing of the postsynaptic VS cells and the
   frequency of OCD-like symptoms. Moreover, increased functional
   connectivity (FC) between the OFC and the VS has been reported in
   patients with OCD. While FC is a synchronous, non-directed correlation,
   the directed influence between these brain regions remains unclear in
   patients with OCD. We obtained resting state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging scans from 37 non-medicated patients with OCD and 38
   matched healthy volunteers, and calculated bivariative voxel-wise
   Granger Causality (GC) to and from three striatal regions of interest
   (ROl) using a blind deconvolution procedure. Additionally, we conducted
   multivariative GC analysis to determine if the effect revealed by the
   bivariative voxel-wise GCA is mediated by another seed ROl. We found a
   significant hyper-influence of the OFC over the VS of subjects with OCD
   (p<.05, corrected). Multivariative GC analysis confirmed this effect
   (p<.05, corrected) and that it was not mediated by another brain area
   within the striatum. This is the first study investigating the directed
   influence of the fronto-striato-thalamic loop in non-medicated patients
   with OCD. We confirmed the hyperactive connection from the OFC to the VS
   that is consistent with previous animal studies. These findings provide
   evidence for the more detailed pathophysiology of OCD. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Altered frontoparietal network functional connectivity (FPN-fc) has been
   associated with neurocognitive dysfunction in individuals with (risk
   for) psychotic disorder. Cannabis use is associated with cognitive and
   FPN-fc alterations in healthy individuals, but it is not known whether
   cannabis exposure moderates the FPN-fc-cognition association. We studied
   FPN-fc in relation to psychosis risk, as well as the moderating effects
   of psychosis risk and cannabis use on the association between FPN-fc and
   (social) cognition. This was done by collecting resting-state fMRI scans
   and (social) cognitive test results from 63 patients with psychotic
   disorder, 73 unaffected siblings and 59 controls. Dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) seed-based correlation analyses were used to
   estimate FPN-fc group differences. Additionally, group x FPN-fc and
   cannabis x FPN-fc interactions in models of cognition were assessed with
   regression models. Results showed that DLPFC-fc with the left precuneus,
   right inferior parietal lobule, right middle temporal gyrus (MTG),
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) regions and right insula was decreased in
   patients compared to controls. Siblings had reduced DLPFC-fc with the
   right MTG, left middle frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, IFG
   regions, and right insula compared to controls, with an intermediate
   position between patients and controls for DLPFC-IFG/MTG and insula-fc.
   There were no significant FPN-fc x group or FPN-fc x cannabis
   interactions in models of cognition. Reduced DLPFC-insula-fc was
   associated with worse social cognition in the total sample. In
   conclusion, besides patient- and sibling-specific FPN-fc alterations,
   there was evidence for trait-related alterations. FPN-fc-cognition
   associations were not conditional on familial liability or cannabis use.
   Lower FPN-fc was associated with lower emotion processing in the total
   group. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The tendency toward impulsive behavior under emotional duress (negative
   and positive urgency) predicts a wide range of maladaptive risk-taking
   and behavioral disorders. However, it remains unclear how urgency
   relates to limbic system activity as induced from emotional provocation.
   This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the
   relationship between brain responses to visual emotional stimuli and
   urgency traits. Twenty-seven social drinkers (mean age = 25.2, 14 males)
   viewed negative (Neg), neutral (Neu), and positive (Pos) images during 6
   fMRI scans. Brain activation was extracted from a priori limbic regions
   previously identified in studies of emotional provocation. The right
   posterior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and left amygdala were activated in
   the {[}Neg>Neu] contrast, whereas the left posterior OFC was activated
   in the {[}Pos>Neu] contrast. Negative urgency was related to the right
   lateral OFC (r = 0.43, P = 0.03) and the left amygdala (r = 0.39, P =
   0.04) {[}Neg>Neu] activation. Negative urgency also mediated the
   relationship between {[}Neg>Neu] activation and general risk-taking
   (regression weights = 3.42 for right OFC and 2.75 for the left
   amygdala). Emotional cue-induced activation in right lateral OFC and
   left amygdala might relate to emotion-based risk-taking through negative

Abstract = {{Recent work suggests that biological motion perception is supported by
   interactions between posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and
   regions of the posterior lobe of the cerebellum. However, insufficient
   attention has been given to cerebellar contributions to most other
   social cognitive functions, including ones that rely upon the use of
   biological motion cues for making mental inferences. Here, using adapted
   Heider and Simmel stimuli in a passive-viewing paradigm, we present
   functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence detailing cerebellar
   contributions to animacy attribution processes in healthy adults. We
   found robust cerebellar activity associated with viewing animate versus
   random movement in hemispheric lobule VII bilaterally as well as in
   vermal and paravermal lobule IX. Stronger activity in left Crus I and
   lobule VI was associated with a greater tendency to describe the stimuli
   in social-affective versus motionrelated terms. Psychophysiological
   interaction analysis indicated preferential effective connectivity
   between right pSTS and left Crus II during the viewing of animate than
   random stimuli, controlling for individual variance in social

Abstract = {{The roles of the right and left anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) in
   conceptual knowledge are a source of debate between 4 conflicting
   accounts. Possible ATL specializations include: (1) Processing of verbal
   versus non-verbal inputs; (2) the involvement of word retrieval; and (3)
   the social content of the stimuli. Conversely, the ``hub-and-spoke{''}
   account holds that both ATLs form a bilateral functionally unified
   system. Using activation likelihood estimation (ALE) to compare the
   probability of left and right ATL activation, we analyzed 97 functional
   neuroimaging studies of conceptual knowledge, organized according to the
   predictions of the three specialized hypotheses. The primary result was
   that ATL activation was predominately bilateral and highly overlapping
   for all stimulus types. Secondary to this bilateral representation,
   there were subtle gradations both between and within the ATLs.
   Activations were more likely to be left lateralized when the input was a
   written word or when word retrieval was required. These data are best
   accommodated by a graded version of the hub-and-spoke account, whereby
   representation of conceptual knowledge is supported through bilateral
   yet graded connectivity between the ATLs and various modality-specific
   sensory, motor, and limbic cortices.}},

Abstract = {{The superior temporal sulcus (STS) is considered a hub for social
   perception and cognition, including the perception of faces and human
   motion, as well as understanding others' actions, mental states, and
   language. However, the functional organization of the STS remains
   debated: Is this broad region composed of multiple functionally distinct
   modules, each specialized for a different process, or are STS subregions
   multifunctional, contributing to multiple processes? Is the STS
   spatially organized, and if so, what are the dominant features of this
   organization? We address these questions by measuring STS responses to a
   range of social and linguistic stimuli in the same set of human
   participants, using fMRI. We find a number of STS subregions that
   respond selectively to certain types of social input, organized along a
   posterior-to-anterior axis. We also identify regions of overlapping
   response to multiple contrasts, including regions responsive to both
   language and theory of mind, faces and voices, and faces and biological
   motion. Thus, the human STS contains both relatively domain-specific
   areas, and regions that respond to multiple types of social information.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Here we adopt a novel strategy to investigate phonological assembly.
   Participants performed a visual lexical decision task in English in
   which the letters in words and letterstrings were delivered either
   sequentially (promoting phonological assembly) or simultaneously (not
   promoting phonological assembly). A region of interest analysis
   confirmed that regions previously associated with phonological assembly,
   in studies contrasting different word types (e.g. words versus
   pseudowords), were also identified using our novel task that controls
   for a number of confounding variables. Specifically, the left pars
   opercularis, the superior part of the ventral precentral gyrus and the
   supramarginal gyrus were all recruited more during sequential delivery
   than simultaneous delivery, even when various psycholinguistic
   characteristics of the stimuli were controlled. This suggests that
   sequential delivery of orthographic stimuli is a useful tool to explore
   how readers, with various levels of proficiency, use sublexical
   phonological processing during visual word recognition. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with increased reactivity to rewards

   used both a monetary and social incentive delay task among adults with
   remitted BD Type I (n = 24) and a healthy nonpsychiatric control group
   (HC; n = 25) using fMRI. Both whole-brain and region-of interest
   analyses revealed elevated reactivity to reward receipt in the striatum,
   a region implicated in incentive sensitivity, in the BD group. Post hoc
   analyses revealed that greater striatal reactivity to reward receipt,
   across monetary and social reward tasks, predicted decreased
   self-reported positive affect when anticipating subsequent rewards in
   the HC but not in the BD group. Results point toward elevated striatal
   reactivity to reward receipt as a potential neural mechanism of

Abstract = {{Although body ownership-i.e. the feeling that our bodies belong to
   us-modulates activity within the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), it
   is still unknown whether this modulation occurs within a somatotopically
   defined portion of S1. We induced an illusory feeling of ownership for
   another person's finger by asking participants to hold their palm
   against another person's palm and to stroke the two joined index fingers
   with the index and thumb of their other hand. This illusion (numbness
   illusion) does not occur if the stroking is performed asynchronously or
   by the other person. We combined this somatosensory paradigm with
   ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging finger mapping to
   study whether illusory body ownership modulates activity within
   different finger-specific areas of S1. The results revealed that the
   numbness illusion is associated with activity in Brodmann area (BA) 1
   within the representation of the finger stroking the other person's
   finger and in BA 2 contralateral to the stroked finger. These results
   show that changes in bodily experience modulate the activity within
   certain subregions of S1, with a different finger-topographical
   selectivity between the representations of the stroking and of the
   stroked hand, and reveal that the high degree of somatosensory
   specialization in S1 extends to bodily self-consciousness.}},

Abstract = {{Notwithstanding the significant role that human-robot interactions (HRI)
   will play in the near future, limited research has explored the neural
   correlates of feeling eerie in response to social robots. To address
   this empirical lacuna, the current investigation examined brain activity
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging while a group of
   participants (n = 26) viewed a series of human-human interactions (HHI)
   and HRI. Although brain sites constituting the mentalizing network were
   found to respond to both types of interactions, systematic neural
   variation across sites signaled diverging social-cognitive strategies
   during HHI and HRI processing. Specifically, HHI elicited increased
   activity in the left temporal-parietal junction indicative of
   situation-specific mental state attributions, whereas HRI recruited the
   precuneus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) suggestive of
   script-based social reasoning. Activity in the VMPFC also tracked
   feelings of eeriness towards HRI in a parametric manner, revealing a
   potential neural correlate for a phenomenon known as the uncanny valley.
   By demonstrating how understanding social interactions depends on the
   kind of agents involved, this study highlights pivotal sub-routes of
   impression formation and identifies prominent challenges in the use of
   humanoid robots.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder refers to a neurodevelopmental condition
   primarily characterized by deficits in social cognition and behavior.
   Subclinically, autistic features are supposed to be present in healthy
   humans and can be quantified using the Autism Quotient (AQ). Here, we
   investigated a potential relationship between AQ and neural correlates
   of social and monetary reward processing, using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging in young, healthy participants. In an incentive delay
   task with either monetary or social reward, reward anticipation elicited
   increased ventral striatal activation, which was more pronounced during
   monetary reward anticipation. Anticipation of social reward elicited
   activation in the default mode network (DMN), a network previously
   implicated in social processing. Social reward feedback was associated
   with bilateral amygdala and fusiform face area activation. The
   relationship between AQ and neural correlates of social reward
   processing varied in a gender-dependent manner. In women and, to a
   lesser extent in men, higher AQ was associated with increased posterior
   DMN activation during social reward anticipation. During feedback, we
   observed a negative correlation of AQ and right amygdala activation in
   men only. Our results suggest that social reward processing might
   constitute an endophenotype for autism-related traits in healthy humans
   that manifests in a gender-specific way.}},

Abstract = {{In humans, observation of others' behaviors increases corticospinal
   excitability (CSE), which is interpreted in the contexts of motor
   resonance and the ``mirror neuron system{''} (MNS). It has been
   suggested that observation of another individual's behavior manifests an
   embodied simulation of his/her mental state through the MNS. Thus, the
   MNS may involve understanding others' intentions of behaviors, thoughts,
   and emotions (i.e., social cognition), and may therefore exhibit a
   greater response when observing human-interactive behaviors that require
   a more varied and complex understanding of others. In the present study,
   transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the primary motor
   cortex of participants observing human-interactive behaviors between two
   individuals (c.f. one person reaching toward an object in another
   person's hand) and non-interactive individual behavior (c.f. one person
   reaching toward an object on a dish). We carefully controlled the
   kinematics of behaviors in these two conditions to exclude potential
   effects of MNS activity changes associated with kinematic differences
   between visual stimuli. Notably, motor evoked potentials, that reflect
   CSE, from the first dorsal interosseous muscle exhibited greater
   amplitude when the participants observed interactive behaviors than when
   they observed non-interactive behavior. These results provide
   neurophysiological evidence that the MNS is activated to a greater
   degree during observation of human-interactive behaviors that contain
   additional information about the individuals' mental states, supporting
   the view that the MNS plays a critical role in social cognition in
   humans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Extensive animal research has demonstrated the vulnerability
   of the brain to early life stress (ELS) with consequences for emotional
   development and mental health. However, the influence of moderate and
   common forms of stress on early human brain development is less
   well-understood and precisely characterized. To date, most work has
   focused on severe forms of stress, and/or on brain functioning years
   after stress exposure. Methods: In this report we focused on conflict
   between parents (interparental conflict), a common and relatively
   moderate form of ELS that is highly relevant for children's mental
   health outcomes. We used resting state functional connectivity MRI to
   examine the coordinated functioning of the infant brain (N = 23;
   6-12-months-of-age) in the context of interparental conflict. We focused
   on the default mode network (DMN) due to its well-characterized
   developmental trajectory and implications for mental health. We further
   examined DMN strength as a mediator between conflict and infants'
   negative emotionality. Results: Higher interparental conflict since
   birth was associated with infants showing stronger connectivity between
   two core DMN regions, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the
   anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC). PCC to amygdala connectivity
   was also increased. Stronger PCC-aMPFC connectivity mediated between
   higher conflict and higher negative infant emotionality. Conclusions:
   The developing DMN may be an important marker for effects of ELS with
   relevance for emotional development and subsequent mental health.
   Increasing understanding of the associations between common forms of
   family stress and emerging functional brain networks has potential to
   inform intervention efforts to improve mental health outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) in Parkinson's
   disease (PD) patients refers to the compulsive use of dopaminergic
   replacement therapy and has serious psycho-social consequences.
   Mechanisms underlying DDS are not clear although has been linked to
   dysfunctional brain reward networks.
   Methods: With fMRI, we investigate behavioral and neural response to
   drug-cues in six PD DDS patients and 12 PD control patients in both the
   ON and OFF medication state. Behavioral measures of liking, wanting and
   subjectively `feeling ON medication' were also collected.
   Results: Behaviorally, PD DDS patients feel less ON and want their drugs
   more at baseline compared to PD controls. Following drug-cue exposure,
   PD DDS patients feel significantly more ON medication, which correlates
   with significant increases in reward related regions.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that exposure to drug-cues
   increases the subjective feeling of being `ON' medication which
   corresponds to dysfunctional activation in reward related regions in PD
   DDS patients. These findings should be extended in future studies.
   Visual stimuli being sufficient to elicit behavioral response through
   neuroadaptations could have direct implications to the management of
   addictive behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive remediation training (CRT) for schizophrenia has been found to
   improve cognitive functioning and influence neural plasticity. However,
   with various training approaches and mixed findings, the mechanisms
   driving generalization of cognitive skills from CRT are unclear. In this
   meta-analysis of extant imaging studies examining CRT's effects, we
   sought to clarify whether varying approaches to CRT suggest common
   neural changes and whether such mechanisms are restorative or
   compensatory. We conducted a literature search to identify studies
   appropriate for inclusion in an activation likelihood estimation (ALE)
   meta-analysis. Our criteria required studies to consist of
   training-based interventions designed to improve patients' cognitive or
   social functioning, including generalization to untrained circumstances.
   Studies were also required to examine changes in pre- vs posttraining
   functional activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging or
   positron emission tomography. The literature search identified 162
   articles, 9 of which were appropriate for inclusion. ALE analyses
   comparing pre- and posttraining brain activation showed increased
   activity in the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), parietal
   cortex, insula, and the caudate and thalamus. Notably, activation
   associated with CRT in the left PFC and thalamus partially overlapped
   with previous meta-analytically identified areas associated with
   deficits in working memory, executive control, and facial emotion
   processing in schizophrenia. We conclude that CRT interventions from
   varying theoretic modalities elicit plasticity in areas that support
   cognitive and socioemotional processes in this early set of studies.
   While preliminary, these changes appear to be both restorative and
   compensatory, though thalamocortical areas previously associated with
   dysfunction may be common sources of plasticity for cognitive
   remediation in schizophrenia.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Deciphering the social meaning of facial displays is a highly complex
   neurological process. The M170, an event related field component of MEG
   recording, like its EEG counterpart N170, was repeatedly shown to be
   associated with structural encoding of faces. However, the scope of
   information encoded during the M170 time window is still being debated.
   We investigated the neuronal origin of facial processing of integrated
   social rank cues (SRCs) and emotional facial expressions (EFEs) during
   the M170 time interval. Participants viewed integrated facial displays
   of emotion (happy, angry, neutral) and SRCs (indicated by upward,
   downward, or straight head tilts). We found that the activity during the
   M170 time window is sensitive to both EFEs and SRCs. Specifically,
   highly prominent activation was observed in response to SRC connoting
   dominance as compared to submissive or egalitarian head cues.
   Interestingly, the processing of EFEs and SRCs appeared to rely on
   different circuitry. Our findings suggest that vertical head tilts are
   processed not only for their sheer structural variance, but as social
   information. Exploring the temporal unfolding and brain localization of
   non-verbal cues processing may assist in understanding the functioning
   of the social rank biobehavioral system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most frequent
   focal epilepsy and is often accompanied by deficits in social cognition
   including emotion recognition, theory of mind, and empathy. Consistent
   with the neuronal networks that are crucial for normal social-cognitive
   processing, these impairments have been associated with functional
   changes in fronto-temporal regions. However, although atrophy in
   unilateral MTLE also affects regions of the temporal and frontal lobes
   that underlie social cognition, little is known about the structural
   correlates of social-cognitive deficits in refractory MTLE. In the
   present study, a psychometrically validated empathy questionnaire was
   combined with whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate
   the relationship between self-reported affective and cognitive empathy
   and gray matter volume in 55 subjects (13 patients with right MTLE, 9
   patients with left MTLE, and 33 healthy controls). Consistent with the
   brain regions underlying social cognition, our results show that lower
   affective and cognitive empathy was associated with smaller volume in
   predominantly right fronto-limbic regions, including the right
   hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, fusiform gyrus, inferior
   temporal gyrus, dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, and in
   the bilateral midbrain. The only region that was associated with both
   affective and cognitive empathy was the right mesial temporal lobe.
   These findings indicate that patients with right MTLE are at increased
   risk for reduced empathy towards others' internal states and they shed
   new light on the structural correlates of impaired social cognition
   frequently accompanying refractory MTLE. In line with previous evidence
   from patients with neurodegenerative disease and stroke, the present
   study suggests that empathy depends upon the integrity of right
   fronto-limbic and brainstem regions and highlights the importance of the
   right mesial temporal lobe and midbrain structures for human empathy.

Abstract = {{Increased reports of impulsivity and aggression in male adolescents with
   Internet gaming might reflect their dysfunction in emotion regulation,
   particularly in suppression of negative emotions, which should affect
   the various stages of Internet gaming disorder. This study tested the
   hypothesis that adolescents with Internet gaming disorder would be more
   disturbed by the emotional interference and demonstrate compromised
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation during a Stroop
   Match-to-Sample task. In addition, functional connectivity analysis was
   conducted to examine the interplays between neural correlates involved
   in emotional processing and how they were altered in adolescents with
   Internet gaming disorder. The Internet gaming disorder group
   demonstrated weaker dACC activation and stronger insular activations to
   interfering angry facial stimuli compared with the healthy control
   group. Negative functional connectivity between stronger insular
   activation and weaker dorsolateral prefrontal activation correlated with
   higher cognitive impulsivity in adolescents with Internet gaming
   disorder. These findings provide evidence of the compromised prefrontal
   cognitive control over emotional interference in adolescents with
   Internet gaming disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The neural correlates of theory of mind (ToM) are typically studied
   using paradigms which require participants to draw explicit,
   task-related inferences (e.g., in the false belief task). In a natural
   setup, such as listening to stories, false belief mentalizing occurs
   incidentally as part of narrative processing. In our experiment,
   participants listened to auditorily presented stories with false belief
   passages (implicit false belief processing) and immediately after each
   story answered comprehension questions (explicit false belief
   processing), while neural responses were measured with functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). All stories included (among other
   situations) one false belief condition and one closely matched control
   condition. For the implicit ToM processing, we modeled the hemodynamic
   response during the false belief passages in the story and compared it
   to the hemodynamic response during the closely matched control passages.
   For implicit mentalizing, we found activation in typical ToM processing
   regions, that is the angular gyrus (AG), superior medial frontal gyrus
   (SmFG), precuneus (PCUN), middle temporal gyrus (MTG) as well as in the
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) billaterally. For explicit ToM, we only
   found AG activation. The conjunction analysis highlighted the left AG
   and MTG as well as the bilateral IFG as overlapping ToM processing
   regions for both implicit and explicit modes. Implicit ToM processing
   during listening to false belief passages, recruits the left SmFG and
   billateral PCUN in addition to the mentalizing network known form
   explicit processing tasks. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4231-4246, 2015. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Information processing can be biased toward behaviorally relevant and
   salient stimuli by top-down (goal-directed) and bottom-up
   (stimulus-driven) attentional control processes respectively. However,
   the neural basis underlying the integration of these processes is not
   well understood. We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) in humans to
   examine the brain mechanisms underlying the interaction between these
   two processes. We manipulated the cognitive load involved in top-down
   processing and stimulus surprise involved in bottom-up processing in a
   factorial design by combining a majority function task and an oddball
   paradigm. We found that high cognitive load and high surprise level were
   associated with prolonged reaction time compared to low cognitive load
   and low surprise level, with a synergistic interaction effect, which was
   accompanied by a greater deactivation of bilateral temporoparietal
   junction (TPJ). In addition, the TPJ displayed negative functional
   connectivity with right middle occipital gyrus, which is involved in
   bottom-up processing (modulated by the interaction effect), and the
   right frontal eye field (FEF), which is involved in top-down control.
   The enhanced negative functional connectivity between the TPJ and right
   FEF was accompanied by a larger behavioral interaction effect across
   subjects. Application of cathodal tDCS over the right TPJ eliminated the
   interaction effect. These results suggest that the TPJ plays a critical
   role in processing bottom-up information for top-down control of
   attention. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4317-4333, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children
   often persist into adulthood and can lead to severe antisocial behavior.
   However, to-date it remains unclear whether neuro-functional
   abnormalities cause ADHD, which in turn can then provide a marker of
   persistent ADHD. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), we measured blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
   signal changes in subjects during a reversal learning task in which
   choice of the correct stimulus led to a probabilistically determined
   monetary' reward or punishment. Participants were diagnosed with ADHD
   during their childhood (N=32) and were paired with age, gender, and
   education matched healthy controls (N=32). Reassessment of the ADHD
   group as adults resulted in a split between either persistent
   (persisters, N=17) or remitted ADHDs (remitters, N=15). All three groups
   showed significantly decreased activation in the medial prefrontal
   cortex (PFC) and the left striatum during punished correct responses,
   however only remitters and controls presented significant
   psycho-physiological interaction between these fronto-striatal reward
   and outcome valence networks. Comparing persisters to remitters and
   controls showed significantly inverted responses to punishment (P<0.05,
   family-wise error corrected) in left PFC region. Interestingly, the
   decreased activation shown after punishment was located in different
   areas of the PFC for remitters compared with controls, suggesting that
   remitters might have learned compensation strategies to overcome their
   ADHD symptoms. Thus, fMRI helps understanding the neuro-functional basis
   of ADHD related behavior differences and differentiates between
   persistent and remittent ADHD. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4648-4663, 2015. (c)

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by substantial social
   deficits. The notion that dysfunctions in neural circuits involved in
   sharing another's affect explain these deficits is appealing, but has
   received only modest experimental support. Here we evaluated a complex
   paradigm on the vicarious social pain of embarrassment to probe social
   deficits in ASD as to whether it is more potent than paradigms currently
   in use. To do so we acquired pupillometry and fMRI in young adults with
   ASD and matched healthy controls. During a simple vicarious physical
   pain task no differences emerged between groups in behavior,
   pupillometry, and neural activation of the anterior insula (AIC) and
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In contrast, processing complex
   vicarious social pain yielded reduced responses in ASD on all
   physiological measures of sharing another's affect. The reduced activity
   within the AIC was thereby explained by the severity of autistic
   symptoms in the social and affective domain. Additionally, behavioral
   responses lacked correspondence with the anterior cingulate and anterior
   insula cortex activity found in controls. Instead, behavioral responses
   in ASD were associated with hippocampal activity. The observed
   dissociation echoes the clinical observations that deficits in ASD are
   most pronounced in complex social situations and simple tasks may not
   probe the dysfunctions in neural pathways involved in sharing affect.
   Our results are highly relevant because individuals with ASD may have
   preserved abilities to share another's physical pain but still have
   problems with the vicarious representation of more complex emotions that
   matter in life. Hum Brain Mapp, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Many everyday activities, such as engaging in conversation or listening
   to a story, require us to sustain attention over a prolonged period of
   time while integrating and synthesizing complex episodic content into a
   coherent mental model. Humans are remarkably capable of navigating and
   keeping track of all the parallel social activities of everyday life
   even when confronted with interruptions or changes in the environment.
   However, the underlying cognitive and neurocognitive mechanisms of such
   long-term integration and profiling of information remain a challenge to
   neuroscience. While brain activity is generally traceable within the
   short time frame of working memory (milliseconds to seconds), these
   integrative processes last for minutes, hours or even days. Here we
   report two experiments on story comprehension. Experiment I establishes
   a cognitive dissociation between our comprehension of plot and
   incidental facts in narratives: when episodic material allows for
   long-term integration in a coherent plot, we recall fewer factual
   details. However, when plot formation is challenged, we pay more
   attention to incidental facts. Experiment II investigates the neural
   underpinnings of plot formation. Results suggest a central role for the
   brain's default mode network related to comprehension of coherent
   narratives while incoherent episodes rather activate the frontoparietal
   control network. Moreover, an analysis of cortical activity as a
   function of the cumulative integration of narrative material into a
   coherent story reveals to linear modulations of right hemisphere
   posterior temporal and parietal regions. Together these findings point
   to key neural mechanisms involved in the fundamental human capacity for
   cumulative plot formation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{171-183}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Associations linking a fearful experience to a member of a social group
   other than one's own (out-group) are more resistant to change than
   corresponding associations to a member of one's own (in-group) (Olsson
   et al., 2005; Kubota et al., 2012), providing a possible link to
   discriminative behavior. Using a fear conditioning paradigm, we
   investigated the neural activity underlying aversive learning biases
   towards in-group (White) and out-group (Black) members, and their
   predictive value for discriminatory interactive behavior towards novel
   virtual-members of the racial out-group (n=20). Our results indicate
   that activity in brain regions previously linked to conditioned fear and
   perception of individuals belonging to the racial out-groups, or
   otherwise stigmatized groups, jointly contribute to the expression of
   race-based biases in learning and behavior. In particular, we found that
   the amygdala and anterior insula (AI) played key roles in
   differentiating between in-group and outgroup faces both when the faces
   were paired with an aversive event (acquisition) and when no more shocks
   were administered (extinction). In addition, functional connectivity
   between the amygdala and the fusiform gyrus increased during perception
   of conditioned out-group faces. Moreover, we showed that brain activity
   in the fear-learning-bias network was related to participants'
   discriminatory interactions with novel out-group members on a later day.
   Our findings are the first to identify the neural mechanism of fear
   learning biases towards out-group members, and its relationship to
   interactive behavior. Our findings provide important clues towards
   understanding the mechanisms underlying biases between social groups.

Abstract = {{ObjectiveAbnormalities in structural and functional brain connectivity
   have been increasingly reported in patients with bipolar disorder (BD)
   by recent neuroimaging studies. However, relatively little is known
   about the changes in functional interaction between the cerebral
   hemispheres in BD. The present study aimed to examine the
   interhemispheric functional connectivity of the whole brain in patients
   with BD II during resting state.
   MethodTwenty-six patients with unmedicated BD II depression and 40
   normal controls underwent the resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. The functional connectivity between any pair of
   symmetrical interhemispheric voxels (i.e., functional homotopy) was
   measured by voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC).
   ResultsThe patients with BD II showed lower VMHC than normal controls in
   the medial prefrontal cortex and inferior temporal gyrus. No regions of
   increased VMHC were detected in patients. There were no significant
   correlations between the VMHC values in these regions and clinical
   severity of BD symptoms.
   ConclusionThese findings suggest substantial impairment of
   interhemispheric coordination in BD II.}},

Abstract = {{Olfaction plays an important role in mammals while aging causes
   olfactory dysfunction. Here the features of olfactory function in aging
   male rats were studied. We compared brain activity of regions involved
   in the perception (olfactory bulbs) and processing (cerebral cortex,
   hippocampus, hypothalamus) of sexually or socially significant odor
   stimulus with 11.7 T MR-scanner and odor perception using behavioral
   tests in 5-month old males with normal (Wistar rats) or accelerated
   senescence (D-galactose-treated Wistar rats (150 mg/kg/day, i.p., 12
   weeks) or OXYS rats with hereditary defined accelerated aging).
   D-galactose-treated Wistar males had altered BOLD-response in the
   centers processing socially significant odor information and changed
   patterns of the functional connectivity. We detected no significant
   changes in the olfactory function of OXYS males probably due to
   compensatory processes. In saline-treated Wistar rats, the correlation
   of BOLD-responses to both types of stimuli in the olfactory bulbs and
   cerebral cortex indicated changes in odor differentiation. Behavioral
   tests showed no significant differences between groups. However, the
   time of odor exploration increased in D-galactose-treated males
   indicating changes in odor recognition.
   Thus, we first revealed that in animal model of pharmacologically
   induced aging olfactory dysfunction occurred at the level of the centers
   processing socially significant odor information while the centers of
   odor perception (olfactory bulbs) remained unaffected. Alterations
   observed in Wistar rats chronically treated with saline evidenced the
   influence of long-term manipulations with experimental animals on
   olfactory function per se. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{294}},
Pages = {{111-122}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Emotional and social cognitive deficits were investigated in a group of
   24 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 24 healthy
   controls. Empathic and visual emotional responses were collected,
   analyzed and correlated to brain structural imaging data by means of:
   (i) a pictorial matching-to-sample task with facial and non-facial
   stimuli; (ii) self-reported questionnaires for cognitive and affective
   emotional components, and alexithymia; (iii) in-depth assessment of
   cognitive functions. Results indicated that visual processing of faces
   in MCI individuals did not benefit from fearful emotional content which
   in healthy controls facilitates stimulus' recognition (emotional
   enhancement effect). This implicit visuoemotional disorder was specific
   for the faces, did not generalize to other categories, and did not
   correlate to explicit measures of empathy. Thus, our main finding
   indicates that in MCI individuals, deficits in visual recognition of
   facial emotions may arise already in the earliest stages of
   memorization, during the visual encoding of facial emotions. Voxel-based
   morphometry revealed its association with atrophy in frontal and
   occipito-temporal regions, mostly involving the anterior medial
   prefrontal cortex (P < 0.05, multiple-comparison correction). Neural
   evidences were corroborated by clinical scores showing significant
   correlation between reduction of Emotion Enhancement Effect and deficits
   in frontal/executive functions. Crucially, the disorder did not appear
   to be related to the number of impaired cognitive domains (single or
   multiple-domain MCI) but rather to the involvement of frontal brain
   networks and frontal/executive functions. This suggests that in
   prodromal stages of dementia, frontal symptoms may represent a
   significant signal of emotional recognition disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The cerebellum plays important roles in sensori-motor and
   supramodal cognitive functions. Cellular, volumetric, and functional
   abnormalities of the cerebellum have been found in autism spectrum
   disorders (ASD), but no comprehensive investigation of
   cerebro-cerebellar connectivity in ASD is available.
   METHODS: We used resting-state functional connectivity magnetic
   resonance imaging in 56 children and adolescents (28 subjects with ASD,
   28 typically developing subjects) 8-17 years old. Partial and total
   correlation analyses were performed for unilateral regions of interest
   (ROIs), distinguished in two broad domains as sensorimotor
   (premotor/primary motor, somatosensory, superior temporal, and
   occipital) and supramodal (prefrontal, posterior parietal, and inferior
   and middle temporal).
   RESULTS: There were three main findings: 1) Total correlation analyses
   showed predominant cerebro-cerebellar functional overconnectivity in the
   ASD group; 2) partial correlation analyses that emphasized domain
   specificity (sensori-motor vs. supramodal) indicated a pattern of
   robustly increased connectivity in the ASD group (compared with the
   typically developing group) for sensori-motor ROIs but predominantly
   reduced connectivity for supramodal ROIs; and 3) this atypical pattern
   of connectivity was supported by significantly increased noncanonical
   connections (between sensori-motor cerebral and supramodal cerebellar
   ROIs and vice versa) in the ASD group.

Abstract = {{In the present study, we explored how Age of Acquisition (AoA) of L2
   affected brain structures in bilingual individuals. Thirty-six native
   English speakers who were bilingual were scanned with high resolution
   MM. After MM signal intensity inhomogeneity correction, we applied both
   voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and surface-based morphometry (SBM)
   approaches to the data. VBM analysis was performed using FSL's standard
   VBM processing pipeline. For the SBM analysis, we utilized a
   semi-automated sulci delineation procedure, registered the brains to an
   atlas, and extracted measures of twenty four pre-selected regions of
   interest. We addressed three questions: (1) Which areas are more
   susceptible to differences in AoA? (2) How do AoA, proficiency and
   current level of exposure work together in predicting structural
   differences in the brain? And (3) What is the direction of the effect of
   AoA on regional volumetric and surface measures? Both VBM and SBM
   results suggested that earlier second language exposure was associated
   with larger volumes in the right parietal cortex. Consistently, SBM
   showed that the cortical area of the right superior parietal lobule
   increased as AoA decreased. In contrast, in the right pars orbitalis of
   the inferior frontal gyrus, AoA, proficiency, and current level of
   exposure are equally important in accounting for the structural
   differences. We interpret our results in terms of current theory and
   research on the effects of L2 learning on brain structures and
   functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   anxiety disorder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{328-336}},

Abstract = {{Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with brain
   function and morphological alterations. This study investigated explicit
   verbal memory impairment in patients with GAD in terms of brain
   functional deficits in combination with morphologic changes.
   Methods: Seventeen patients with GAD and 17 healthy controls matched for
   age, sex, and education level underwent high-resolution TI-weighted MRI
   and fMR imaging at 3 T during explicit verbal memory tasks with
   emotionally neutral and anxiety-inducing words.
   Results: In response to the neutral words, the patients showed
   significantly lower activities in the regions of the hippocampus (Hip),
   middle cingulate gyms (MCG), putamen (Pu) and head of the caudate
   nucleus (HCd) compared with healthy controls. In response to the
   anxiety-inducing words, the patients showed significantly higher
   activities in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and precentral gyrus.
   However, they showed lower activities in the Hip, MCG, Pu and HCd. In
   addition, patients with GAD showed a significant reduction in gray
   matter volumes, especially in the regions of the Hip, midbrain,
   thalamus, insula and superior temporal gyms, compared with healthy
   controls.
   Limitations: This study examined a small sample sizes in each of the
   groups, and there was no consideration of a medication effect on brain
   activity and volume changes.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the association between
   brain functional deficits and morphometric alterations in an explicit
   verbal memocy task for patients with GAD. This finding is helpful for
   understanding explicit verbal memory impairment in connection with GAD
   symptoms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{414-425}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Following destruction or denervation of the primary visual cortex (V1)
   cortical blindness ensues. Affective blindsight refers to the uncanny
   ability of such patients to respond correctly, or above chance level, to
   visual emotional expressions presented to their blind fields. Fifteen
   years after its original discovery, affective blindsight still
   fascinates neuroscientists and philosophers alike, as it offers a unique
   window on the vestigial properties of our visual system that, though
   present in the intact brain, tend to be unnoticed or even actively
   inhibited by conscious processes. Here we review available studies on
   affective blindsight with the intent to clarify its functional
   properties, neural bases and theoretical implications. Evidence
   converges on the role of subcortical structures of old evolutionary
   origin such as the superior colliculus, the pulvinar and the amygdala in
   mediating affective blindsight and nonconscious perception of emotions.
   We conclude that approaching consciousness, and its absence, from the
   vantage point of emotion processing may uncover important relations
   between the two phenomena, as consciousness may have evolved as an
   evolutionary specialization to interact with others and become aware of
   their social and emotional expressions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: The Autonomy over Tobacco Scale (AUTOS), a 12-item
   self-administered questionnaire, was designed to measure autonomy in
   three correlated lower-order symptom domains: withdrawal, psychological
   dependence, and cue-induced craving. The factor structure of the AUTOS
   remains an open question; confirmatory analyses in adolescents supported
   the hierarchical structure, while exploratory analyses in adolescents
   and adults yield single-factor solutions. Here we seek to determine
   whether the hypothesized hierarchical structure is valid in adult
   smokers.
   Methods: The AUTOS was administered to two independent convenience
   samples of adult current smokers: a calibration sample recruited in the
   US for online studies, and a confirmation sample drawn from the
   prospective Nicotine Dependence in Teens study in Montreal. We tested
   competing hierarchical and single-factor models using the robust
   weighted least-squares (WLSMV) estimation method.
   Results: A single-factor model that allowed correlated error variances
   between theoretically related items fit well in the calibration sample
   (n = 434), chi(2)(SB)(52) = 165.71; chi(2)/df = 3.19; SRMR = 0.03; CFI =
   0.96; NNFI = 0.95; RMSEA = 0.07 (95\% Cl: 0.06, 0.08). Reliability of
   the single factor was high (omega(B) = 0.92) and construct validity was
   adequate. In the confirmation sample (n = 335), a similar model fit
   well:chi(2)(SB)(53) = 126.94; chi(2)/df = 2.44; SRMR = 0.04; CFI = 0.95;
   NNFI = 0.93; RMSEA = 0.07 (95\% Cl: 0.05, 0.08). Reliability of the
   single factor was again high (omega(B) = 0.92) and construct validity
   was adequate.
   Conclusion: The AUTOS is unidimensional in adult smokers. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Showing empathy is crucial for social functioning and empathy is related
   to group membership. The aim of the current study was to investigate the
   influence of experimentally generated groups on empathy for pain in a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. Thirty healthy
   participants underwent a minimal group paradigm to create two groups.
   While BOLD contrast was measured using fMRI, subjects were instructed to
   empathize with ingroup and outgroup members, who were depicted in a
   picture paradigm of painful and neutral situations. Behavioral measure
   of state empathy was measured using a visual analog scale. Furthermore,
   self-reported trait empathy measures were obtained. Repeated-measures
   ANOVAs were conducted for fMRI and behavioral data. In addition to a
   main effect of pain in painrelated areas, a main effect of group in
   areas belonging to the visual cortex was found. Although there was no
   ingroup bias for empathy ratings, subjects showed altered neural
   activation in regions of the right fusiform gyrus, the cerebellum, the
   hippocampal and amygdala region during the pain x group interaction.
   Activation in the preceding structures, revealed by the interaction of
   pain by group, suggests that activation in the pallidum might reflect
   specific empathy for pain-related regulation processes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Abnormal abstract thinking is a major cause of social dysfunction in
   patients with schizophrenia, but little is known about its neural basis.
   In this study, we aimed to determine the characteristic abstract
   thinking-related brain responses in patients using a task reflecting
   social situations. We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging
   while 16 patients with schizophrenia and 16 healthy controls performed a
   theme-identification task, in which various emotional pictures depicting
   social situations were presented. Compared with healthy controls, the
   patients showed significantly decreased activity in the left frontopolar
   and right orbitofrontal cortices during theme identification. Activity
   in these two regions correlated well in the controls, but not in
   patients. Instead, the patients exhibited a close correlation between
   activity in both sides of the frontopolar cortex, and a positive
   correlation between the right orbitofrontal cortex activity and degrees
   of theme identification. Reduced activity in the left frontopolar and
   right orbitofrontal cortices and the underlying aberrant connectivity
   may be implicated in the patients' deficits in abstract thinking. These
   newly identified features of the neural basis of abnormal abstract
   thinking are important as they have implications for the impaired social
   behavior of patients with schizophrenia during real-life situations. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the effect of hand action observation
   training, i.e., mirror neuron system (MNS) based training, on language
   function of aphasic patients after stroke. In addition, to reveal the
   tentative mechanism underlying this effect.
   Methods: Six aphasic patients after stroke, meeting the criteria,
   undergo 3 weeks' training protocol (30 min per day, 6 days per week).
   Among them, four patients accepted an ABA training design, i.e., they
   implemented Protocol A (hand action observation combined with
   repetition) in the first and third weeks and carried out Protocol B
   (static object observation combined with repetition) in the second week.
   Conversely, for the other two patients, BAB training design was adopted,
   i.e., patients took Protocol B in the first and third weeks and accepted
   Protocol A in the second week. Picture naming test, western aphasia
   battery (WAB) and Token Test were applied to evaluate the changes of
   language function before and after each week's training. Furthermore,
   two subjects (one aphasic patient and one healthy volunteer) attended a
   functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, by which we tried to reveal the
   mechanism underlying possible language function changes after training.
   Results: Compared with static object observation and repetition training
   (Protocol B), hand action observation and repetition training (Protocol
   A) effectively improved most aspects of the language function in all six
   patients, as demonstrated in the picture naming test, subtests of oral
   language and aphasia quotient (AQ) of WAB. In addition, the fMRI
   experiment showed that Protocol A induced more activations in the MNS of
   one patient and one healthy control when compared to Protocol B.
   Conclusion: The mirror neuron based therapy may facilitate the language
   recovery for aphasic patients and this, to some extent, provides a novel
   direction of rehabilitation for aphasia patients.}},

Title = {{The relation of general socio-emotional processing to parenting specific

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Socio-emotional information processing during everyday human
   interactions has been assumed to translate to social emotional
   information processing when parenting a child. Yet, few studies have
   examined whether this is indeed the case. This study aimed to improve on
   this by connecting the functional neuroimaging data when seeing
   socio-emotional interactions that are not parenting specific to observed
   maternal sensitivity. The current study considered 45 mothers of small
   children (12-42 months of age). It included healthy controls (HC) and
   mothers with interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress
   disorder (IPV-PTSD), as well as mothers without PTSD, both with and
   without IPV exposure. We found that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity correlated negatively
   with observed maternal sensitivity when mothers watched videos of
   menacing vs. prosocial adult male-female interactions. This relationship
   was independent of whether mothers were HC or had IPV-PTSD. We also
   found dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dIPFC) activity to be correlated
   negatively with maternal sensitivity when mothers watched any kind of
   arousing adult interactions. With regards to ACC and vmPFC activity, we
   interpret our results to mean that the ease of general emotional
   information integration translates to parenting specific behavior. Our
   dIPFC activity findings support the idea that the efficiency of top-down
   control of socio-emotional processing in non-parenting specific contexts
   may be predictive of parenting behavior.}},

Title = {{Adolescent development of context-dependent stimulus-reward association
   memory and its neural correlates}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Expression of learned stimulus-reward associations based on context is
   essential for regulation of behavior to meet situational demands.
   Contextual regulation improves during development, although the
   developmental progression of relevant neural and cognitive processes is
   not fully specified. We therefore measured neural correlates of
   flexible, contextual expression of stimulus-reward associations in
   pre/early-adolescent children (ages 9-13 years) and young adults (ages
   19-22 years). After reinforcement learning using standard parameters, a
   contextual reversal manipulation was used whereby contextual cues
   indicated that stimulus-reward associations were the same as previously
   reinforced for some trials (consistent trials) or were reversed on other
   trials (inconsistent trials). Subjects were thus required to respond
   according to original stimulus reward associations vs reversed
   associations based on trial specific contextual cues. Children and young
   adults did not differ in reinforcement learning or in relevant
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) correlates. In contrast,
   adults outperformed children during contextual reversal, with better
   performance specifically for inconsistent trials. fMRI signals
   corresponding to this selective advantage included greater activity in
   lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), hippocampus, and dorsal striatum for
   young adults relative to children. Flexible expression of
   stimulus-reward associations based on context thus improves via
   adolescent development, as does recruitment of brain regions involved in
   reward learning and contextual expression of memory.
   Highlights
   Early adolescent children and young adults were equivalent in
   reinforcement learning.
   Adults outperformed children in contextual expression of stimulus-reward
   associations.
   Adult advantages correlated with increased activity of relevant brain
   regions.
   Specific neurocognitive developmental changes support better contextual
   regulation.}},

Title = {{Processing ambiguity in a linguistic context: decision-making
   difficulties in non-aphasic patients with behavioral variant
   frontotemporal degeneration}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Some extent of ambiguity is ubiquitous in everyday conversations. For
   example, words have multiple meaning and very common pronouns, like
   ``he{''} and ``she{''} (anaphoric pronouns), have little meaning on
   their own and refer to a noun that has been previously introduced in the
   discourse. Ambiguity triggers a decision process that is not a
   subroutine of language processing but rather a more general domain
   resource. Therefore non-aphasic patients with limited decision-making
   capability can encounter severe limitation in language processing due to
   extra linguistic limitations. In the present study, we test patients
   with behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration (byFTD), focusing on
   anaphora as a paradigmatic example of ambiguity resolution in the
   linguistic domain. byFTD is characterized by gray matter (GM) atrophy in
   prefrontal cortex, but relative sparing of peri-Sylyian cortex. A group
   of patients with parietal disease due to corticobasal syndrome (CBS) was
   also tested here in order to investigate the specific role of prefrontal
   cortex in the task employed in the current study. Participants were
   presented with a pair of sentences in which the first sentence contained
   two nouns while the second contained a pronoun. In the experimental
   (ambiguous) condition, both nouns are plausible referents of the
   pronoun, thus requiring decision-making resources. The results revealed
   that byFTD patients are significantly less accurate than healthy seniors
   in identifying the correct referent of a pronoun in the ambiguous
   condition, although CBS patients were as accurate as healthy seniors.
   Imaging analyses related byFTD patients' performance to GM atrophy in
   yentromedial prefrontal cortex (ymPFC). These results suggest that byFTD
   patients have difficulties in decision processes that involve the
   resolution of an ambiguity.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR AUTISM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Theory-of-mind (ToM), the ability to infer people's thoughts
   and feelings, is a pivotal skill in effective social interactions.
   Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been found to have
   altered ToM skills, which significantly impacts the quality of their
   social interactions. Neuroimaging studies have reported altered
   activation of the ToM cortical network, especially in adults with
   autism, yet little is known about the brain responses underlying ToM in
   younger individuals with ASD. This functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying ToM in
   high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and matched typically
   developing (TD) peers.
   Methods: fMRI data were acquired from 13 participants with ASD and 13 TD
   control participants while they watched animations involving two
   ``interacting{''} geometrical shapes.
   Results: Participants with ASD showed significantly reduced activation,
   relative to TD controls, in regions considered part of the ToM network,
   the mirror network, and the cerebellum. Functional connectivity analyses
   revealed underconnectivity between frontal and posterior regions during
   task performance in the ASD participants.
   Conclusions: Overall, the findings of this study reveal disruptions in
   the brain circuitry underlying ToM in ASD at multiple levels, including
   decreased activation and decreased functional connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Discourse comprehension processes attempt to produce an elaborate and
   well-connected representation in the reader's mind. A common network of
   regions including the angular gyrus, posterior cingulate, and dorsal
   frontal cortex appears to be involved in constructing coherent
   representations in a variety of tasks including social cognition tasks,
   narrative comprehension, and expository text comprehension. Reading
   strategies that require the construction of explicit inferences are used
   in the present research to examine how this coherence network interacts
   with other brain regions. A psychophysiological interaction analysis was
   used to examine regions showing changed functional connectivity with
   this coherence network when participants were engaged in either a
   non-inferencing reading strategy, paraphrasing, or a strategy requiring
   coherence-building inferences, self-explanation. Results of the analysis
   show that the coherence network increases in functional connectivity
   with a cognitive control network that may be specialized for the
   manipulation of semantic representations and the construction of new
   relations among these representations.}},

Title = {{A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study to Investigate the Utility

Abstract = {{Pain-related anxiety and fear are associated with increased difficulties
   in attention, increased awareness of pain, impaired disengagement from
   pain, and can moderate the effects of attentional coping attempts.
   Accurately assessing the direct impact of pain-related anxiety and fear
   on pain behavior has proved difficult. Studies have demonstrated no or
   limited influence of pain-related fear and anxiety on behavior but this
   may be due to inherent problems with the scales used. Neuroimaging has
   improved the understanding of neural processes underlying the factors
   that influence pain perception. This study aimed to establish if a
   Picture and Imagination Task (PIT), largely developed from the
   Photographs of Daily Activity (PHODA) assessment tool, could help
   explore how people living with chronic pain process information about
   daily activities. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to compare brain responses in
   patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSKP) (n = 15) and healthy
   controls (n = 15). Subjects were asked to imagine how they would feel
   mentally and physically if asked to perform daily activities illustrated
   in PIT. The results found that a number of regions involved in pain
   processing saw increased BOLD activation in patients compared with
   controls when undertaking the task and included the insula, anterior
   cingulate cortex, thalamus and inferior and superior parietal cortices.
   Similarly, increased BOLD responses in patients compared to controls in
   the frontal pole, paracingulate and the supplementary motor cortex may
   be suggestive of a memory component to the responses The amygdala,
   orbitofrontal cortex, substantia nigra/ventral tegmentum, putamen,
   thalamus, pallidum, inferior parietal (supramarginal and angular gyrus)
   and cingulate cortex were also seen to have greater differences in BOLD
   signal changes in patients compared with controls and many of these
   regions are also associated with general phobic responses. Therefore, we
   suggest that PIT is a useful task to explore pain-and movement-related
   anxiety and fear in fMRI studies. Regions in the Default Mode Network
   remained active or were less deactivated during the PIT task in patients
   with CMSKP compared to healthy controls supporting the contention that
   the DMN is abnormal in patients with CMSKP.}},

Abstract = {{The role of neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental
   area (VTA) of the midbrain in contributing to the elicitation of reward
   prediction errors during appetitive learning has been well established.
   Less is known about the differential contribution of these midbrain
   regions to appetitive versus aversive learning, especially in humans.
   Here we scanned human participants with high-resolution fMRI focused on
   the SN and VTA while they participated in a sequential Pavlovian
   conditioning paradigm involving an appetitive outcome (a pleasant
   juice), as well as an aversive outcome (an unpleasant bitter and salty
   flavor). We found a degree of regional specialization within the SN:
   Whereas a region of ventromedial SN correlated with a temporal
   difference reward prediction error during appetitive Pavlovian learning,
   a dorsolateral area correlated instead with an aversive expected value
   signal in response to the most distal cue, and to a reward prediction
   error in response to the most proximal cue to the aversive outcome.
   Furthermore, participants' affective reactions to both the appetitive
   and aversive conditioned stimuli more than 1 year after the fMRI
   experiment was conducted correlated with activation in the ventromedial
   and dorsolateral SN obtained during the experiment, respectively. These
   findings suggest that, whereas the human ventromedial SN contributes to
   long-term learning about rewards, the dorsolateral SN may be
   particularly important for long-term learning in aversive contexts.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{``Truth{''} has been used as a baseline condition in several functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of deception. However, like
   deception, telling the truth is an inherently social construct, which
   requires consideration of another person's mental state, a phenomenon
   known as Theory of Mind. Using a novel ecological paradigm, we examined
   blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) responses during social and
   simple truth telling. Participants (n = 27) were randomly divided into
   two competing teams. Post-competition, each participant was scanned
   while evaluating performances from in-group and out-group members.
   Participants were asked to be honest and were told that their
   evaluations would be made public. We found increased BOLD responses in
   the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior insula and precuneus
   when participants were asked to tell social truths compared to simple
   truths about another person. At the behavioral level, participants were
   slower at responding to social compared to simple questions about
   another person. These findings suggest that telling the truth is a
   nuanced cognitive operation that is dependent on the degree of
   mentalizing. Importantly, we show that the cortical regions engaged by
   truth telling show a distinct pattern when the task requires social
   reasoning.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{While earlier Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) studies have mostly focused
   on modulating specific brain regions or signals, new developments in
   pattern classification of brain states are enabling real-time decoding
   and modulation of an entire functional network. The present study
   proposes a new method for real-time pattern classification and
   neurofeedback of brain states from electroencephalographic (EEG)
   signals. It involves the creation of a fused classification model based
   on the method of Common Spatial Patterns (CSPs) from data of several
   healthy individuals. The subject-independent model is then used to
   classify EEG data in real-time and provide feedback to new individuals.
   In a series of offline experiments involving training and testing of the
   classifier with individual data from 27 healthy subjects, a mean
   classification accuracy of 75.30\% was achieved, demonstrating that the
   classification system at hand can reliably decode two types of imagery
   used in our experiments, i.e., happy emotional imagery and motor
   imagery. In a subsequent experiment it is shown that the classifier can
   be used to provide neurofeedback to new subjects, and that these
   subjects learn to ``match{''} their brain pattern to that of the fused
   classification model in a few days of neurofeedback training. This
   finding can have important implications for future studies on
   neurofeedback and its clinical applications on neuropsychiatric
   disorders.}},

   moral psychology. To address this issue, the authors used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record hemodynamic activity in 306
   incarcerated male adults, stratified into regular cocaine users (n = 87)
   and a matched sample of non-cocaine users (n = 87), while viewing
   pictures that did or did not depict immoral actions and determining
   whether each depicted scenario occurred indoors or outdoors. Consistent
   with expectations, cocaine users showed abnormal neural activity in
   several frontostriatial regions during implicit moral picture processing
   compared to their non-cocaine using peers. This included reduced
   moral/non-moral picture discrimination in the vACC, vmPFC, IOFC, and
   left vSTR. Additionally, psychopathy was negatively correlated with
   activity in an overlapping region of the ACC and right lateralized vSTR.
   These results suggest that regular cocaine abuse may be associated with
   affective deficits which can impact relatively high-level processes like
   moral cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that individual differences in emotion control are
   associated with frontoparietal-limbic networks and linked to emotional
   traits and executive functions. In a first attempt to directly target
   the link between emotional traits and executive functions using
   resting-state fMRI analysis, 43 healthy adults completed a test battery
   including executive tasks and emotional trait self-assessments that were
   subjected to a principal component analysis. Of the three factors
   detected, two explained 40.4\% of the variance and were further
   investigated. Both factors suggest a relation between emotional traits
   and executive functions. Specifically, the first factor consisted of
   measures related to inhibitory control and negative affect, and the
   second factor was related to reward and positive affect. To investigate
   whether this interplay between emotional traits and executive functions
   is reflected in neural connectivity, we used resting-state fMRI to
   explore the functional connectivity of the amygdala as a starting point,
   and progressed to other seed-based analyses based on the initial
   findings. We found that the first factor predicted the strength of
   connectivity between brain regions known to be involved in the cognitive
   control of emotion, including the amygdala and the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, whereas the second factor predicted the strength of
   connectivity between brain regions known to be involved in reward and
   attention, including the amygdala, the caudate and the thalamus. These
   findings suggest that individual differences in the ability to inhibit
   negative affect are mediated by prefrontal-limbic pathways, while the
   ability to be positive and use rewarding information is mediated by a
   network that includes the amygdala and thalamostriatal regions. (C) 2015

Title = {{Temporal unpredictability of a stimulus sequence and the processing of
   neutral and emotional stimuli}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{214-224}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Most experimental settings in cognitive neuroscience present a
   temporally structured stimulus sequence, i.e., stimuli may occur at
   either constant and predictable or variable and less predictable
   inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs). This experimental feature has been
   shown to affect behavior and activation of various cerebral structures
   such as the parietal cortex and the amygdala. Studies employing explicit
   or implicit cues to manipulate predictability of events have shown that
   unpredictability particularly accentuates the response to events of
   negative valence. The present study investigates whether the effects of
   unpredictability are similarly affected by the emotional content of
   stimuli when unpredictability is induced simply by the temporal
   structure of a stimulus sequence, i.e., by variable as compared to
   constant ISIs.
   In an fMRI study, we applied three choice-reaction-time tasks with
   stimuli of different social-emotional content. Subjects (N = 30) were
   asked to identify the gender in angry and happy faces, or the shape of
   geometric figures. Tasks were performed with variable and constant ISIs.
   During the identification of shapes, variable ISIs increased activation
   in widespread areas comprising the amygdala and fron to-parietal
   regions. Conversely, variable ISIs during gender identification resulted
   in a decrease of activation in a small region near the intraparietal
   sulcus.
   Our findings reveal that variability in the temporal stimulus structure
   of an experimental setting affects cerebral activation depending on task
   demands. They suggest that the processing of emotional stimuli of
   different valence is not much affected by the decision of employing a
   constant or a variable temporal stimulus structure, at least in the
   context of implicit emotion processing tasks. In contrast, temporal
   structure diversely affects the processing of neutral non-social
   compared to emotional stimuli, emphasizing the relevance of considering
   this experimental feature in studies which aim at differentiating
   social-emotional from cognitive processing in general, and more
   particularly, aim at identifying circumscribed alterations of social
   cognition in mental disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{In managing our way through interpersonal conflict, anger might be
   crucial in determining whether the dispute escalates to aggressive
   behaviors or resolves cooperatively. The Ultimatum Game (UG) is a social
   decision-making paradigm that provides a framework for studying
   interpersonal conflict over division of monetary resources. Unfair
   monetary UG-offers elicit anger and while accepting them engages
   regulatory processes, rejecting them is regarded as an aggressive
   retribution. Ventro-medial prefrontal-cortex (vmPFC) activity has been
   shown to relate to idiosyncratic tendencies in accepting unfair offers
   possibly through its role in emotion regulation. Nevertheless, standard
   UG paradigms lack fundamental aspects of real-life social interactions
   in which one reacts to other people in a response contingent fashion. To
   uncover the neural substrates underlying the tendency to accept
   anger-infused ultimatum offers during dynamic social interactions, we
   incorporated on-line verbal negotiations with an obnoxious partner in a
   repeated-UG during fMRI scanning. We hypothesized that vmPFC activity
   will differentiate between individuals with high or low monetary gains
   accumulated throughout the game and reflect a divergence in the
   associated emotional experience. We found that as individuals gained
   more money, they reported less anger but also more positive feelings and
   had slower sympathetic response. In addition, high-gain individuals had
   increased vmPFC activity, but also decreased brainstem activity, which
   possibly reflected the locus coeruleus. During the more angering unfair
   offers, these individuals had increased dorsal-posterior Insula (dpI)
   activity which functionally coupled to the medial-thalamus (mT).
   Finally, both vmPFC activity and dpI-mT connectivity contributed to
   increased gain, possibly by modulating the ongoing subjective emotional
   experience. These ecologically valid findings point towards a neural
   mechanism that might nurture pro-social interactions by modulating an
   individual's dynamic emotional experience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Empathy for pain activates brain areas partially overlapping with those
   underpinning the first-hand experience of pain. It remains unclear,
   however, whether such shared activations imply that pain empathy engages
   similar neural functions as first-hand pain experiences. To overcome the
   limitations of previous neuroimaging research, we pursued a conceptually
   novel approach: we used the phenomenon of placebo analgesia to
   experimentally reduce the first-hand experience of pain, and assessed
   whether this results in a concomitant reduction of empathy for pain. We
   first carried out a functional MRI experiment (n = 102) that yielded
   results in the expected direction: participants experiencing placebo
   analgesia also reported decreased empathy for pain, and this was
   associated with reduced engagement of anterior insular and mid-cingulate
   cortex: that is, areas previously associated with shared activations in
   pain and empathy for pain. In a second step, we used a
   psychopharmacological manipulation (n = 50) to determine whether these
   effects can be blocked via an opioid antagonist. The administration of
   the opioid antagonist naltrexone blocked placebo analgesia and also
   resulted in a corresponding ``normalization{''} of empathy for pain.
   Taken together, these findings suggest that pain empathy may be
   associated with neural responses and neurotransmitter activity engaged
   during first-hand pain, and thus might indeed be grounded in our own
   pain experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we investigated
   whether a culturally defined context modulates the neurocognitive
   processing of artworks. We presented subjects with paintings from the
   Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, and labeled them as being
   either from the MoMA or from an adult education center. Irrespective of
   aesthetic appreciation, we found higher neural activation in the left
   precuneus, superior and inferior parietal cortex for the MoMA condition
   compared to the control label condition. When taking the aesthetic
   preference for a painting into account, the MoMA condition elicited
   higher involvement of right precuneus, bilateral anterior cingulate

Title = {{Chemosensory anxiety cues moderate the experience of social exclusion -
   an fMRI investigation with Cyberball}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that the experience of stress can be
   communicated between individuals via chemosensory cues. Little is known,
   however, about the impact of these cues on neurophysiological responses
   during a socially threatening situation. In the current investigation we
   implemented a widely used paradigm to study social exclusion Cyberball
   to examine whether chemosensory cues signaling anxiety modulate the
   neuronal effects of ostracism. In a double-blind, within-subjects
   design, 24 healthy, normosmic participants were presented with
   chemosensory cues of anxiety (or control samples) and completed the
   Cyberball task while in a 31 fMRI scanner. Axillary sweat collected from
   male students awaiting an oral examination served as the anxiety cues
   while the chemosensory control stimuli consisted of sweat collected from
   the same individuals participating in an ergometer training session. The
   neuroimaging data revealed that under the control chemosensory
   condition, exclusion from Cyberball was associated with significantly
   higher orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex activity,
   which is consistent with previous studies in the field. However, when
   participants were primed with the anxiety sweat, the activity in these
   regions was not observed. Further, under exposure to anxiety cues during
   ostracism the participants showed deactivations in brain regions
   involved in memory (hippocampus), social cognition (middle temporal
   gyrus, superior temporal gyrus) and processing of salience (inferior
   frontal gyrus). These results suggest that successful communication of
   anxiety via the chemosensory domain may moderate the experience of
   social exclusion. It is possible that the anxiety signals make it easier
   for the individuals to detach from the group, pointing to the
   communicative role of chemosensory anxiety cues in enhancing adjustment
   mechanisms in light of a distressing situation.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to examine the functional networks related to the
   extrapyramidal system using a temporal oscillation signal correlation
   analysis method based on critical nodes in the substantia nigra (SN),
   red nucleus (RN) and dentate nucleus (DN). Nineteen healthy subjects
   underwent resting-state fMRI and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI).
   For the brain network analysis, the SN, RN and DN were positioned on
   susceptibility weighted images and used as seeds for temporal
   correlations analyzed via BOLD data. T-tests were performed for the
   correlation coefficients of each seed. We demonstrated that the SN, RN
   and DN were functionally connected to each other, and, in general, their
   connectivity maps overlapped in a series of subcortical extrapyramidal
   structures and regions of cerebral cortices. A Granger causality
   analysis indicated that the effective connectivity graphs within
   extrapyramidal structures mainly exhibited a spacial up-down pattern for
   the positive and negative influences, respectively. Our findings suggest
   that extensive regions involved in the extrapyramidal system constituted
   a relatively exclusive network via spatial-temporal correlation signals
   that analogously corresponded to the anatomical structures. The
   investigation of extrapyramidal system networks may have potential
   clinical implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Empathy-the capacity to understand and resonate with the experiences of
   others-can depend on the ability to predict when others are likely to
   receive rewards. However, although a plethora of research has examined
   the neural basis of predictions about the likelihood of receiving
   rewards ourselves, very little is known about the mechanisms that
   underpin variability in vicarious reward prediction. Human neuroimaging
   and nonhuman primate studies suggest that a subregion of the anterior
   cingulate cortex in the gyrus (ACCg) is engaged when others receive
   rewards. Does the ACCg show specialization for processing predictions
   about others' rewards and not one's own and does this specialization
   vary with empathic abilities? We examined hemodynamic responses in the
   human brain time-locked to cues that were predictive of a high or low
   probability of a reward either for the subject themselves or another
   person. We found that the ACCg robustly signaled the likelihood of a
   reward being delivered to another. In addition, ACCg response
   significantly covaried with trait emotion contagion, a necessary
   foundation for empathizing with other individuals. In individuals high
   in emotion contagion, the ACCg was specialized for processing others'
   rewards exclusively, but for those low in emotion contagion, this region
   also responded to information about the subject's own rewards. Our
   results are the first to show that the ACCg signals probabilistic
   predictions about rewards for other people and that the substantial
   individual variability in the degree to which the ACCg is specialized
   for processing others' rewards is related to trait empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Visual aided augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) consists
   of books or technologies that contain visual symbols to supplement
   spoken language. A common observation concerning some forms of aided AAC
   is that message preparation can be frustratingly slow. We explored the
   uses of fMRI to examine the neural correlates of visual search for line
   drawings on AAC displays in 18 college students under two experimental
   conditions. Under one condition, the location of the icons remained
   stable and participants were able to learn the spatial layout of the
   display. Under the other condition, constant shuffling of the locations
   of the icons prevented participants from learning the layout, impeding
   rapid search. Brain activation was contrasted under these conditions.
   Rapid search in the stable display was associated with greater
   activation of cortical and subcortical regions associated with memory,
   motor learning, and dorsal visual pathways compared to the search in the
   unpredictable display. Rapid search for line drawings on stable AAC
   displays involves not just the conceptual knowledge of the symbol
   meaning but also the integration of motor, memory, and visual-spatial
   knowledge about the display layout. Further research must study
   individuals who use AAC, as well as the functional effect of
   interventions that promote knowledge about array layout.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The current study aimed to elucidate the role of
   preparatory cognitive control in decision making and its neural
   correlates using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). To this
   effect, by employing a series of new cognitive tasks, we assessed the
   role of preparatory cognitive control in monetary (risky) decision
   making.
   Methods: The participants had to decide between a risky and a safe
   gamble based on their chance of winning (high or low). In the 2-phase
   gambling task (similar to Cambridge gambling task), the chance and the
   gamble were presented at the same time (i.e. in a single phase), but in
   a new 3-phase gambling task, the chance is presented before the gamble.
   The tasks ended with a feedback phase.
   Results: In the 3-phase task, holding the chance in memory to guide
   their decision enabled the participants to have more control on their
   risk taking behaviors as shown by activation in a network of brain areas
   involved in the control and conflict, including dorsal Anterior
   Cingulate Cortex (dACC), indexed by faster reaction times and better
   performance in the gambling task, and the temporal lobe, which has a
   role in holding contextual information.
   Discussion: Holding information in memory to guide decision presumably
   enables the participants to have more control on their risk taking
   behaviors. The conflict and uncertainty resulting from this risky
   decision was indexed by the activation of dACC, known to be activated in
   conflict and cognitive control.}},

Abstract = {{In adults, patterns of neural activation associated with perhaps the
   most basic language skill-overt object naming-are extensively modulated
   by the psycholinguistic and visual complexity of the stimuli. Do
   children's brains react similarly when confronted with increasing
   processing demands, or they solve this problem in a different way? Here
   we scanned 37 children aged 7-13 and 19 young adults who performed a
   well-normed picture-naming task with 3 levels of difficulty. While
   neural organization for naming was largely similar in childhood and
   adulthood, adults had greater activation in all naming conditions over
   inferior temporal gyri and superior temporal gyri/supramarginal gyri.
   Manipulating naming complexity affected adults and children quite
   differently: neural activation, especially over the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, showed complexity-dependent increases in adults, but
   complexity-dependent decreases in children. These represent
   fundamentally different responses to the linguistic and conceptual
   challenges of a simple naming task that makes no demands on literacy or
   metalinguistics. We discuss how these neural differences might result
   from different cognitive strategies used by adults and children during
   lexical retrieval/production as well as developmental changes in brain
   structure and functional connectivity.}},

   data set (N = 1000). Cortical regions specialized for the same
   components were strongly coupled, suggesting that components function as
   partially isolated networks. Functionally flexible regions participated
   in multiple components to different degrees. This heterogeneous
   selectivity was predicted by the connectivity between flexible and
   specialized regions. Functionally flexible regions might support binding
   or integrating specialized brain networks that, in turn, contribute to
   the ability to execute multiple and varied tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Accents provide information about the speaker's geographical,
   socio-economic, and ethnic background. Research in applied psychology
   and sociolinguistics suggests that we generally prefer our own accent to
   other varieties of our native language and attribute more positive
   traits to it. Despite the widespread influence of accents on social
   interactions, educational and work settings the neural underpinnings of
   this social bias toward our own accent and, what may drive this bias,
   are unexplored. We measured brain activity while participants from two
   different geographical backgrounds listened passively to 3 English
   accent types embedded in an adaptation design. Cerebral activity in
   several regions, including bilateral amygdalae, revealed a significant
   interaction between the participants' own accent and the accent they
   listened to: while repetition of own accents elicited an enhanced neural
   response, repetition of the other group's accent resulted in reduced
   responses classically associated with adaptation. Our findings suggest
   that increased social relevance of, or greater emotional sensitivity to
   in-group accents, may underlie the own-accent bias. Our results provide
   a neural marker for the bias associated with accents, and show, for the
   first time, that the neural response to speech is partly shaped by the
   geographical background of the listener.}},

Abstract = {{Engaging social working memory (SWM) during effortful social cognition
   has been associated with neural activation in two neurocognitive
   systems: the medial frontoparietal system and the lateral frontoparietal
   system. However, the respective roles played by these systems in SWM
   remain unknown. Results from this study demonstrate that only the medial
   frontoparietal system supports the social cognitive demands managed in
   SWM. In contrast, the lateral frontoparietal system supports the
   non-social cognitive demands that are needed for task performance, but
   that are independent of the social cognitive computations. Moreover,
   parametric increases in the medial frontoparietal system, but not the
   lateral frontoparietal system, in response to SWM load predicted
   performance on a challenging measure of perspective-taking. Thus, the
   medial frontoparietal system may uniquely support social cognitive
   processes in working memory and the working memory demands afforded by
   effortful social cognition, such as the need to track another person's
   perspective in mind.}},

Abstract = {{People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often have difficulty
   comprehending social situations in the complex, dynamic contexts
   encountered in the real world. To study the social brain under
   conditions which approximate naturalistic situations, we measured brain
   activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants
   watched a full-length episode of the sitcom The Office. Having
   quantified the degree of social awkwardness at each moment of the
   episode, as judged by an independent sample of controls, we found that
   both individuals with ASD and control participants showed reliable
   activation of several brain regions commonly associated with social
   perception and cognition (e.g. those comprising the `mentalizing
   network') during the more awkward moments. However, individuals with ASD
   showed less activity than controls in a region near right
   temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ) extending into the posterior end of the
   right superior temporal sulcus (RSTS). Further analyses suggested that,
   despite the free-form nature of the experimental design, this group
   difference was specific to this RTPJ/RSTS area of the mentalizing
   network; other regions of interest showed similar activity across groups
   with respect to both location and magnitude. These findings add support
   to a body of evidence suggesting that RTPJ/RSTS plays a special role in
   social processes across modalities and may function atypically in
   individuals with ASD navigating the social world.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being one of the healthiest developmental periods, morbidity and
   mortality rates increase dramatically during adolescence, largely due to
   preventable, risky behaviors. Heightened reward sensitivity, coupled
   with ineffective cognitive control, has been proposed to underlie
   adolescents' risk taking. In this study, we test whether reward
   sensitivity can be redirected to promote safe behavior. Adolescents
   completed a risk-taking task in the presence of their mother and alone
   during fMRI. Adolescents demonstrated reduced risk-taking behavior when
   their mothers were present compared with alone, which was associated
   with greater recruitment of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)
   when making safe decisions, decreased activation in the ventral striatum
   following risky decisions and greater functional coupling between the
   ventral striatum and VLPFC when making safe decisions. Importantly, the
   very same neural circuitry (i.e. ventral striatum) that has been linked
   to greater risk-taking can also be redirected toward thoughtful, more
   deliberative and safe decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Despite moral prohibitions on hurting other humans, some social contexts
   allow for harmful actions such as killing of others. One example is
   warfare, where killing enemy soldiers is seen as morally justified. Yet,
   the neural underpinnings distinguishing between justified and
   unjustified killing are largely unknown. To improve understanding of the
   neural processes involved in justified and unjustified killing,
   participants had to imagine being the perpetrator whilst watching
   `first-person perspective' animated videos where they shot enemy
   soldiers ('justified violence') and innocent civilians ('unjustified
   violence'). When participants imagined themselves shooting civilians
   compared with soldiers, greater activation was found in the lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Regression analysis revealed that the more
   guilt participants felt about shooting civilians, the greater the
   response in the lateral OFC. Effective connectivity analyses further
   revealed an increased coupling between lateral OFC and the
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ) when shooting civilians. The results show
   that the neural mechanisms typically implicated with harming others,
   such as the OFC, become less active when the violence against a
   particular group is seen as justified. This study therefore provides
   unique insight into how normal individuals can become aggressors in
   specific situations.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the developmental trajectories of neural circuits implicated
   in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are largely unknown. Here, we
   specifically focused on age-related changes in the functional circuitry
   of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), a key hub underlying
   social-cognitive processes known to be impaired in ASD. Using a
   cross-sectional approach, we analysed resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from children, adolescents and
   adults available through the autism brain imaging data exchange
   repository {[}n = 106 with ASD and n = 109 typical controls (TC), ages
   7-30 years]. The observed age-related changes of pSTS intrinsic
   functional connectivity (iFC) suggest that no single developmental
   pattern characterizes ASD. Instead, pSTS circuitry displayed a complex
   developmental picture, with some functional circuits showing patterns
   consistent with atypical development in ASD relative to TC (pSTS-iFC
   with fusiform gyrus and angular gyrus) and others showing delayed
   maturation (pSTS-iFC with regions of the action perception network).
   Distinct developmental trajectories in different functional circuits in
   ASD likely reflect differential age-related changes in the
   socio-cognitive processes they underlie. Increasing insight on these
   mechanisms is a critical step in the development of age-specific
   interventions in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala and the parietal cortex play a key role in the neural
   representation of personal space. Although the concept of personal space
   is clinically very relevant for borderline personality disorder (BPD),
   especially in affective contexts, it has not been investigated thus far
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this fMRI study,
   25 female BPD patients and 25 healthy women were exposed to photos of
   angry, disgusted and neutral facial expressions. All stimuli were once
   shown as still photos, and once were zoomed-in in order to simulate
   intrusion into one's own personal space. Approaching faces generally
   provoked activation of the amygdala and the somatosensory cortex. BPD
   patients showed an increased activation within both regions, but only
   toward approaching disgusted faces. Their amygdala activation in this
   specific condition positively correlated with self-disgust scores.
   Moreover, the clinical group indicated an enhanced personal distance
   preference, which was associated with parietal activation. The present
   study revealed altered personal space processing of BPD patients,
   especially in situations that relate to social contexts involving
   disgust. Future studies should focus on the temporal stability of
   personal space processing during the natural course of BPD as well as
   during therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Neurobiological and behavioral findings suggest that psychosis is
   associated with corticolimbic hyperactivity during the processing of
   emotional salience. This has not been widely studied in the early stages
   of psychosis, and the impact of these abnormalities on psychotic
   symptoms and global functioning is unknown. We sought to address this
   issue in 18 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), 18 individuals
   at ultra high risk of psychosis (UHR) and 22 healthy controls (HCs).
   Corticolimbic response and subjective ratings to emotional and neutral
   scenes were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The
   clinical and functional impact of corticolimbic abnormalities was
   assessed with regression analyses. The FEP and UHR groups reported
   increased subjective emotional arousal to neutral scenes compared with
   HCs. Across groups, emotional vs neutral scenes elicited activation in
   the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus/anterior
   insula and amygdala. Although FEP and UHR participants showed reduced
   activation in these regions when viewing emotional scenes compared with
   controls, this was driven by increased activation to neutral scenes.
   Corticolimbic hyperactivity to neutral scenes predicted higher levels of
   positive symptoms and poorer levels of functioning. These results
   indicate that disruption of emotional brain systems may represent an
   important biological substrate for the pathophysiology of early
   psychosis and UHR states.}},

Title = {{Neurocognitive bases of emotion regulation development in adolescence}},
Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{11-25}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Emotion regulation is the ability to recruit processes to influence
   emotion generation. In recent years there has been mounting interest in
   how emotions are regulated at behavioural and neural levels, as well as
   in the relevance of emotional dysregulation to psychopathology. During
   adolescence, brain regions involved in affect generation and regulation,
   including the limbic system and prefrontal cortex, undergo protracted
   structural and functional development. Adolescence is also a time of
   increasing vulnerability to internalising and externalising
   psychopathologies associated with poor emotion regulation, including
   depression, anxiety and antisocial behaviour. It is therefore of
   particular interest to understand how emotion regulation develops over
   this time, and how this relates to ongoing brain development. However,
   to date relatively little research has addressed these questions
   directly. This review will discuss existing research in these areas in
   both typical adolescence and in adolescent psychopathology, and will
   highlight opportunities for future research. In particular, it is
   important to consider the social context in which adolescent emotion
   regulation develops. It is possible that while adolescence may be a time
   of vulnerability to emotional dysregulation, scaffolding the development
   of emotion regulation during this time may be a fruitful preventative
   target for psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{The present fMRI study examined whether upper-limb action classes
   differing in their motor goal are encoded by different PPC sectors.
   Action observation was used as a proxy for action execution. Subjects
   viewed actors performing object-related (e.g., grasping),
   skin-displacing (e.g., rubbing the skin), and interpersonal upper limb
   actions (e.g., pushing someone). Observation of the three action classes
   activated a three-level network including occipito-temporal, parietal,
   and premotor cortex. The parietal region common to observing all three
   action classes was located dorsally to the left intraparietal sulcus
   (DIPSM/DIPSA border). Regions specific for observing an action class
   were obtained by combining the interaction between observing action
   classes and stimulus types with exclusive masking for observing the
   other classes, while for regions considered preferentially active for a
   class the interaction was exclusively masked with the regions common to
   all observed actions. Left putative human anterior intraparietal was
   specific for observing manipulative actions, and left parietal operculum
   including putative human SII region, specific for observing
   skin-displacing actions. Control experiments demonstrated that this
   latter activation depended on seeing the skin being moved and not simply
   on seeing touch. Psychophysiological interactions showed that the two
   specific parietal regions had similar connectivities. Finally, observing
   interpersonal actions preferentially activated a dorsal sector of left
   DIPSA, possibly the homologue of ventral intraparietal coding the
   impingement of the target person's body into the peripersonal space of
   the actor. These results support the importance of segregation according
   to the action class as principle of posterior parietal cortex
   organization for action observation and by implication for action
   execution. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3950-3958}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Advances in the neuroscientific understanding of bodily autonomic
   awareness, or interoception, have led to the hypothesis that human trait
   anxiety sensitivity (AS)-the fear of bodily autonomic arousal-is
   primarily mediated by the anterior insular cortex. Despite broad appeal,
   few experimental studies have comprehensively addressed this hypothesis.
   We recruited 55 individuals exhibiting a range of AS and assessed them
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during aversive fear
   conditioning. For each participant, three primary measures of interest
   were derived: a trait Anxiety Sensitivity Index score; an in-scanner
   rating of elevated bodily anxiety sensations during fear conditioning;
   and a corresponding estimate of whole-brain functional activation to the
   conditioned versus nonconditioned stimuli. Using a voxel-wise mediation
   analysis framework, we formally tested for `neural mediators' of the
   predicted association between trait AS score and in-scanner anxiety
   sensations during fear conditioning. Contrary to the anterior insular
   hypothesis, no evidence of significant mediation was observed for this
   brain region, which was instead linked to perceived anxiety sensations
   independently from AS. Evidence for significant mediation was obtained
   for the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex-a finding that we argue is more
   consistent with the hypothesized role of human cingulofrontal cortex in
   conscious threat appraisal processes, including threat-overestimation.
   This study offers an important neurobiological validation of the AS
   construct and identifies a specific neural substrate that may underlie
   high AS clinical phenotypes, including but not limited to panic
   disorder. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Journal = {{HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Resonance with the inner states of another social actor is regarded as a
   hallmark of emotional closeness. Nevertheless, sensitivity to potential
   incongruities between one's own and an intimate partner's subjective
   experience is reportedly also important for close relationship quality.
   Here, we tested whether perceivers show greater neurobehavioral
   responsiveness to a spouse's positive (rather than negative)
   context-incongruent emotions, and whether this effect is influenced by
   the perceiver's satisfaction with the relationship. Thus, we used fMRI
   to scan older long-term married female perceivers while they judged
   either their spouse's or a stranger's affect, based on incongruent
   nonverbal and verbal cues. The verbal cues were selected to evoke
   strongly polarized affective responses. Higher perceiver marital
   satisfaction predicted greater neural processing of the spouse's (rather
   than the strangers) nonverbal cues. Nevertheless, across all perceivers,
   greater neural processing of a spouse's (rather than a stranger's)
   nonverbal behavior was reliably observed only when the behavior was
   positive and the context was negative. The spouse's positive (rather
   than negative) nonverbal behavior evoked greater activity in putative
   mirror neuron areas, such as the bilateral inferior parietal lobule
   (IPL). This effect was related to a stronger inhibitory influence of
   cognitive control areas on mirror system activity in response to a
   spouse's negative nonverbal cues, an effect that strengthened with
   increasing perceiver marital satisfaction. Our valence-asymmetric
   findings imply that neurobehavioral responsiveness to a close other's
   emotions may depend, at least partly, on cognitive control resources,
   which are used to support the perceiver's interpersonal goals (here,
   goals that are relevant to relationship stability). (C) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Introduction: Genome-wide association studies identify rs11136000 in the
   CLU gene, which codes for Apolipoprotein J/Clusterin, as a significant
   risk variant for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms by
   which this variant confers susceptibility remain relatively unknown.
   Methods: Eighty-five healthy Caucasian participants underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging during a working memory (WM) task and were
   genotyped for CLU rs11136000/APOE loci.
   Results: Here we show that young individuals with the CLU rs11136000
   risk variant (C) have higher activation levels in memory-related
   prefrontal and limbic areas during a WMtask. We also found subtle
   reductions in gray matter in the right hippocampal formation in carriers
   of the risk variant.
   Discussion: We suggest that this pattern of multimodal imaging results
   may reflect incipient structural differences and inefficient functional
   activation. This study supports accumulating evidence suggesting that
   genetic risk for AD affects the neural networks associated with memory
   in healthy individuals. (C) 2015 The Alzheimer's Association. Published

Abstract = {{The human motor system is active not only when actions are performed but
   also when they are observed. Experimenters often manipulate aspects of
   the action or context to examine factors that influence this
   ``mirror{''} response. However, little is known about the role of the
   observer's own top-down intentions and motivation. In this exploratory
   study, we investigated whether observers are able to exert conscious
   control over their mirror response, when they are explicitly instructed
   to either increase or decrease mirroring. Transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) was used to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in a
   thumb abductor muscle as participants (n = 13) watched a video of a hand
   squeezing a rubber ball. The size of these MEPs, relative to the size of
   MEPs elicited during fixation cross observation, was taken as an index
   of mirroring. In an initial block of trials, participants were
   instructed to merely observe the actions presented. After the first
   block, the concept of mirroring was explained to the participants, and
   in the second and third blocks participants were instructed to either
   increase or decrease their mirror response. We did not instruct them
   about how to achieve this increase or decrease. Our results showed no
   difference in either facilitation or absolute motor excitability (i.e.,
   nonnormalized MEP size) between the three blocks, indicating that
   individuals do not seem to be able to exert control over motor
   excitability during action observation, at least in the absence of a
   specific and maintained strategy.}},

Title = {{Expressive suppression and neural responsiveness to nonverbal affective
   cues}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{321-330}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Optimal social functioning occasionally requires concealment of one's
   emotions in order to meet one's immediate goals and environmental
   demands. However, because emotions serve an important communicative
   function, their habitual suppression disrupts the flow of social
   exchanges and, thus, incurs significant interpersonal costs. Evidence is
   accruing that the disruption in social interactions, linked to habitual
   expressive suppression use, stems not only from intrapersonal, but also
   from interpersonal causes, since the suppressors' restricted affective
   displays reportedly inhibit their interlocutors' emotionally expressive
   behaviors. However, expressive suppression use is not known to lead to
   clinically significant social impairments. One explanation may be that
   over the lifespan, individuals who habitually suppress their emotions
   come to compensate for their interlocutors' restrained expressive
   behaviors by developing an increased sensitivity to nonverbal affective
   cues. To probe this issue, the present study used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan healthy older women while they viewed
   silent videos of a male social target displaying nonverbal emotional
   behavior, together with a brief verbal description of the accompanying
   context, and then judged the target's affect. As predicted, perceivers
   who reported greater habitual use of expressive suppression showed
   increased neural processing of nonverbal affective cues. This effect
   appeared to be coordinated in a top-down manner via cognitive control.
   Greater neural processing of nonverbal cues among perceivers who
   habitually suppress their emotions was linked to increased ventral
   striatum activity, suggestive of increased reward value/personal
   relevance ascribed to emotionally expressive nonverbal behaviors. These
   findings thus provide neural evidence broadly consistent with the
   hypothesized link between habitual use of expressive suppression and
   compensatory development of increased responsiveness to nonverbal
   affective cues, while also suggesting one explanation for the
   suppressors' poorer cognitive performance in social situations.
   Moreover, our results point to a potential neural mechanism supporting
   the development and perpetuation of expressive suppression as an emotion
   regulation strategy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: To understand the interplay between affective social
   information processing and its influence on mental states we
   investigated changes in functional connectivity (FC) patterns after
   audio exposure to emotional biographic narratives. Methods: While lying
   in the 7T MR scanner, 23 male participants listened to narratives of
   early childhood experiences of three persons, each having either a
   secure, dismissing, or preoccupied attachment representation. Directly
   after having listened to each of the prototypical narratives,
   participants underwent a 10-minute resting-state fMRI scan. To study
   changes in FC patterns between experimental conditions, three post-task
   conditions were compared to a baseline condition. Specific local
   alterations, as well as differences in connectivity patterns between
   distributed brain regions, were quantified using Network-based
   statistics (NBS) and graph metrics. Results: Using NBS, a nine-region
   subnetwork showing reduced FC after having listened to the dismissing
   narrative was identified. Of this subnetwork, only the left
   Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) exhibited a decrease in the nodal graph
   metrics degree and strength exclusively after listening to the
   dismissing narrative. No other region showed post-task changes in nodal
   metrics. A post hoc analysis of dynamic characteristics of FC of the
   left SMA showed a significant decrease in the dismissing condition when
   compared with the other conditions in the first three minutes of the
   scan, but faded away in the two subsequent intervals the differences.
   Conclusions: Nodal metrics and NBS converge on reduced connectivity
   measures exclusively in left SMA in the dismissing condition, which may
   specifically reflect ongoing network changes underlying prolonged
   emotional reactivity to attachment-related processing.}},

Abstract = {{Research on (hand-)writing has revealed that Exner's area subserves

   We report on a patient with a lesion affecting Broca's and Exner's area
   suffering from severe peripheral agraphia for letters but not for Arabic
   digits. Analogous to semantic (magnitude) information in numbers, we
   developed a specifically tailored writing training: additional mental
   imagery based semantic information was attached to letters. The training
   resulted in significant improvements. Imaging data revealed stronger
   fronto-parietal network activity including perilesional activation
   around Exner's area and precuneus for writing letters to dictation than
   for writing letters corresponding to their mental image expressions.
   Follow-up testing showed not only stable training effects but also an
   activation shift into the left angular gyrus.
   Results document neuronal correlates of a successful intervention by
   attaching additional meanings to letters in order to retrieve their
   grapho-motor patterns. These findings contribute to understanding the

   once after a placebo intake, in balanced order. Images of alcoholic
   drinks, soft drinks, or neutral objects were shown while participants'
   neural activity was recorded through fMRI. Moreover, participants'
   attentional focus was manipulated using a task which required them to
   process the central images of interest (focus alcohol condition) or a
   center unattended task (focus not on alcohol condition).
   ResultsResults indicated that an explicit judgment on beverage-related
   cues increased activation in the prefrontal area compared with the
   judgment of neutral objects. By comparison with that of task-irrelevant
   neutral cues, the processing of task-irrelevant alcohol-related cues
   increased the activation in a large network of cerebral areas including
   visual and temporal regions, the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex,
   the posterior cingulate cortex, and the putamen. Moreover, in the
   condition with focus not on alcohol, the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
   was particularly activated by the presentation of (task-irrelevant)
   alcohol-related cues compared to task-irrelevant soft-drink-related
   cues.
   ConclusionsThe VTA was especially involved in the automatic processing
   of alcohol-related cues in young heavy drinkers. Low dose of alcohol did
   not modulate the neural substrates involved in the processing of salient
   alcohol-related cues.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Behavioral inhibition (BI) is an early developing trait
   associated with cautiousness and development of clinical depression and
   anxiety. Little is known about the neural basis of BI and its predictive
   importance concerning risk for internalizing disorders. We looked at
   functional connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) and salience
   network (SN), given their respective roles in self-relational and threat
   processing, in the risk for internalizing disorders, with an emphasis on
   determining the functional significance of these networks for BI.
   Method: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan, during
   the resting state, children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age who
   were either at high familial risk (HR; n = 16) or low familial risk (LR;
   n = 18) for developing clinical depression and/or anxiety. Whole-brain
   DMN and SN functional connectivity were estimated for each participant
   and compared across groups. We also compared the LR and HR groups on
   levels of BI and anxiety, and incorporated these data into follow-up
   neurobehavioral correlation analyses.
   Results: The HR group, relative to the LR group, showed significantly
   decreased DMN connectivity with the ventral striatum and bilateral
   sensorimotor cortices. Within the HR group, trait BI increased as DMN
   connectivity with the ventral striatum and sensorimotor cortex
   decreased. The HR and LR groups did not differ with respect to SN
   connectivity.
   Conclusion: Our findings show, in the risk for internalizing disorders,
   a negative functional relation between brain regions supporting
   self-relational processes and reward prediction. These findings
   represent a potential neural substrate for behavioral inhibition in the
   risk for clinical depression and anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: With the wide and rapid expansion of computers and
   smartphones, Internet use has become an essential part of life and an
   important tool that serves various purposes. Despite the advantages of
   Internet use, psychological and behavioral problems, including Internet
   addiction, have been reported. In response to growing concern,
   researchers have focused on the characteristics of Internet addicts.
   However, relatively little is known about the behavioral and neural
   mechanisms that underlie Internet addiction, especially with respect to
   risky decision making, which is an important domain frequently reported
   in other types of addictions.
   Method: To examine the neural characteristics of decision making in
   Internet addicts, Internet addicts and healthy controls were scanned
   while they performed a financial decision-making task.
   Results: Relative to healthy controls, Internet addicts showed (1) more
   frequent risky decision making; (2) greater activation in the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex and the left caudate nucleus, which are brain
   regions involved in conflict monitoring and reward, respectively; and
   (3) less activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, an area
   associated with cognitive control/regulation.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that risky decision making may be an
   important behavioral characteristic of Internet addiction and that
   altered brain function in regions associated with conflict monitoring,
   reward and cognitive control/regulation might be critical biological
   risk factors for Internet addiction.}},

Abstract = {{Intersubject correlation (ISC) analysis of functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data provides insight into how continuous streams of
   sensory stimulation are processed by groups of observers. Although
   edited movies are frequently used as stimuli in ISC studies, there has
   been little direct examination of the effect of edits on the resulting
   ISC maps. In this study we showed 16 observers two audiovisual movie
   versions of the same dance. In one experimental condition there was a
   continuous view from a single camera (Unedited condition) and in the
   other condition there were views from different cameras (Edited
   condition) that provided close up views of the feet or face and upper
   body. We computed ISC maps for each condition, as well as created a map
   that showed the difference between the conditions. The results from the
   Unedited and Edited maps largely overlapped in the occipital and
   temporal cortices, although more voxels were found for the Edited map.
   The difference map revealed greater ISC for the Edited condition in the
   Postcentral Gyrus, Lingual Gyms, Precentral Gyms and Medial Frontal
   Gyrus, while the Unedited condition showed greater ISC in only the
   Superior Temporal Gyrus. These findings suggest that the visual changes
   associated with editing provide a source of correlation in maps obtained
   from edited film, and highlight the utility of using maps to evaluate
   the difference in ISC between conditions. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{637-643}},

Abstract = {{It is often difficult to distinguish strangers' permanent facial shapes
   from their transient facial expressions, for example, whether they are
   scowling or have narrow-set eyes. Overinterpretation of ambiguous cues
   may contribute to the rapid character judgments we make about others.
   Someone with narrow eyes might be judged untrustworthy, because of
   strong associations between facial anger and threat. To test this
   hypothesis, we investigated the trait judgments made by individuals with
   severe alexithymia, associated with impaired recognition of facial
   emotion. Consistent with the hypothesis, alexithymic participants
   demonstrated reduced interrater consistency when judging the character
   traits of unfamiliar faces, and the presence of subtle emotions.
   Nevertheless, where alexithymics perceived, or misperceived, emotion
   cues, the character traits inferred thereafter were broadly typical. The
   finding that individuals with developmental deficits of emotion
   recognition exhibit atypical attribution of character traits, confirms
   the hypothesis that emotion-recognition mechanisms play a causal role in
   character judgments.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Deficits in facial emotion perception in schizophrenia may
   be a marker of disorder liability. Previous functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating these deficits have been
   limited by task demands that may recruit other impaired cognitive
   processes in schizophrenia.
   Methods: We used a family study design along with a passive viewing task
   during fMRI to investigate brain activation abnormalities underlying
   facial emotion perception in schizophrenia and examine whether such
   abnormalities are associated with the genetic liability to the disorder.
   Twenty-eight schizophrenia patients, 27 nonpsychotic relatives, and 27
   community controls passively viewed images of facial emotions during an
   fMRI scan.
   Results: Analyses revealed hypoactivation in face processing areas for
   both patients and relatives compared to controls, and hyperactivation in
   relatives compared to both patients and controls for frontal regions
   implicated in emotion processing.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that activation abnormalities during facial
   emotion perception are manifestations of the genetic liability to
   schizophrenia, and may be accompanied by compensatory mechanisms in
   relatives. Studying mechanisms in nonpsychotic relatives is a valuable
   way to examine effects of the unexpressed genetic liability to
   schizophrenia on the brain and behaviour. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The involvement of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systemin
   schizophrenia is suggested by postmortem studies and the common use of
   GABA receptor-potentiating agents in treatment. In a recent study, we
   used a benzodiazepine challenge to demonstrate abnormal GABAergic
   function during processing of negative visual stimuli in schizophrenia.
   This study extended this investigation by mapping GABAergic mechanisms
   associated with face processing and social appraisal in schizophrenia
   using a benzodiazepine challenge. Fourteen stable, medicated
   schizophrenia/schizoaffective patients (SZ) and 13 healthy controls (HC)
   underwent functional MRI using the blood oxygenation level-dependent
   (BOLD) technique while they performed the Socio-emotional Preference
   Task (SePT) on emotional face stimuli ({''}Do you like this face?{''}).
   Participants received single-blinded intravenous saline and lorazepam
   (LRZ) in two separate sessions separated by 1-3 weeks. Both SZ and HC
   recruited medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate during the SePT,
   relative to gender identification. A significant drug by group
   interaction was observed in the medial occipital cortex, such that SZ
   showed increased BOLD signal to LRZ challenge, while HC showed an
   expected decrease of signal; the interaction did not vary by task. The
   altered BOLD response to LRZ challenge in SZ was significantly
   correlated with increased negative affect across multiple measures. The
   altered response to LRZ challenge suggests that abnormal face processing
   and negative affect in SZ are associated with altered GABAergic function
   in the visual cortex, underscoring the role of impaired visual
   processing in socio-emotional deficits in schizophrenia. (C) 2015

Title = {{Neural correlates of valence generalization in an affective conditioning

Abstract = {{In case of uncertainty, predictions that are based on prior, similar
   experiences guide our decision by processes of generalization.
   Over-generalization of negative information has been identified as an
   important feature of several psychopathologies, including anxiety
   disorders and depression, and might underlie biased interpretation of
   ambiguous information.
   Here, we investigated the neural correlates of valence generalization to
   ambiguous stimuli using a translational affective conditioning task
   during fMRI. Twenty-five healthy individuals participated in a
   conditioning procedure with (1) an initial acquisition phase, where
   participants learned the positive and negative valence of two different
   tones (reference tones) through their responses and subsequent feedback
   and (2) a test phase, where participants were presented with the
   previously learned reference tones and three additional tones with
   intermediate frequency to the learned reference tones. By recording the
   responses to these intermediate stimuli we were able to assess the
   participantsi interpretation of ambiguous tones as either positive or
   negative.
   Behavioral results revealed a graded response pattern to the three
   intermediate tones, which was mirrored on the neural level. More
   specifically, parametric analyses OF BOLD responses to all five tones
   revealed a linear effect in bilateral anterior insula and SMA with
   lowest activation to the negative reference tone and highest activation
   to the positive negative tone. In addition, a cluster in the SMA showed
   a reverse-quadratic response, i.e., the strongest response for the most
   ambiguous tone. These findings suggest overlapping regions in the
   salience network that mediate valence generalization and decision-making
   under ambiguity, potentially underlying biased ambiguous cue
   interpretation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{292}},
Pages = {{252-258}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that regulatory mode orientation can affect
   many human behaviors, such as risk-taking, counterfactual thinking and
   economic decision making. However, little is known about how regulatory
   mode affects delay discounting. To address this question, we used
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to
   investigate whether regulatory mode orientations can be represented by
   functional connectivity and the influence of two-regulatory modes
   (assessment and locomotion) on delay discounting. The behavioral results
   showed that delay discounting was negatively correlated with assessment
   scores but positively correlated with locomotion scores. Neuroimaging
   results indicated that the functional connectivity between lateral
   prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was
   negatively correlated with assessment scores but positively correlated
   with locomotion scores. Furthermore, mediation analysis showed that the
   effect of regulatory mode on delay discounting is mediated by LPFC-vmPFC
   functional connectivity. These results suggested that people's
   regulatory mode orientation could predict delay discounting, which is
   mediated by LPFC-vmPFC functional connectivity. Therefore, the present
   study extends our perspective on regulatory mode and provides neural
   mechanism for understanding the link between regulatory mode and delay
   discounting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reciprocation of trust exchanges is central to the development of
   interpersonal relationships and societal well-being. Understanding how
   humans make pro-social and self-centered decisions in dyadic
   interactions and how to predict these choices has been an area of great
   interest in social neuroscience. A functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) based technology with potential clinical application is the study
   of resting state brain connectivity. We tested if resting state
   connectivity may predict choice behavior in a social context.
   Twenty-nine healthy adults underwent resting state fMRI before
   performing the Trust Game, a two person monetary exchange game. We
   assessed the ability of patterns of resting-state functional brain
   organization, demographic characteristics and a measure of moral
   development, the Defining Issues Test (DIT-2), to predict individuals'
   decisions to reciprocate money during the Trust Game. Subjects
   reciprocated in 74.9\% of the trials. Independent component analysis
   identified canonical resting-state networks. Increased functional
   connectivity between the salience (bilateral insula/anterior cingulate)
   and central executive (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/ posterior
   parietal cortex) networks significantly predicted the choice to
   reciprocate pro-social behavior (R-2= 0.20, p = 0.015). Stepwise linear
   regression analysis showed that functional connectivity between these
   two networks (p = 0.002), age (p = 0.007) and DIT-2 personal interest
   schema score (p = 0.032) significantly predicted reciprocity behavior
   (R-2 = 0.498, p = 0.001). Intrinsic functional connectivity between
   neural networks in conjunction with other individual characteristics may
   be a valuable tool for predicting performance during social
   interactions. Future replication and temporal extension of these
   findings may bolster the understanding of decision making in clinical,
   financial and marketing settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{When gaze opens the channel for communication: Integrative role of IFG
   and MPFC}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{63-69}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in the field of cognitive neuroscience have revealed
   that direct gaze modulates activity in cortical and subcortical key
   regions of the `social brain network', including the inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG) and the anterior rostral medial prefrontal cortex (arMPFC).
   However, very little is known about how direct gaze is processed during
   live interaction with a real partner. Here, for the first time we used
   an experimental setup allowing the participant inside an MRI scanner to
   interact face-to-face with a partner located in the scanner room.
   Depending on condition, the participant and the partner were instructed
   either to look at each other in the eyes or to direct their gaze away
   from the other. As control conditions, participants gazed at their own
   eyes, reflected in a mirror, or gazed at a picture of the partner's
   eyes. Results revealed that direct gaze by the partner was associated
   with activity in areas involved in production and comprehension of
   language and action, including the IFG, the premotor cortex (PM), and
   the supplementary motor area (SMA). Activations in these areas were
   observed regardless of the participant's gaze behavior. In contrast,
   increased activity in arMPFC, an area involved in inference of other
   mental states during social interaction and communication, was only
   observed when the participant reciprocated the partner's direct gaze so
   as to establish mutual gaze. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI)
   analysis revealed effective connectivity between the IFG and the arMPFC
   during mutual gaze. This suggests that, within a larger network
   concerned with the processing of social gaze, mutual gaze with a real
   partner is established by an increased coupling between areas involved
   in the detection of communicative intentions, language, and social
   interaction. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. This is an

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Stroop paradigms are commonly used as an index of attention deficits and
   a tool for investigating functions of the frontal lobes and other
   associated structures. Here we investigated the correlation between
   resting-state functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) measures {[}degree
   centrality (DC)/fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations
   (fALFFs)] and Stroop interference. We examined this relationship in the
   brains of 958 healthy young adults. DC reflects the number of
   instantaneous functional connections between a region and the rest of
   the brain within the entire connectivity matrix of the brain
   (connectome), and thus how much of the node influences the entire brain
   areas, while fALFF is an indicator of the intensity of regional brain
   spontaneous activity. Reduced Stroop interference was associated with
   larger DC in the left lateral prefrontal cortex, left IFJ, and left
   inferior parietal lobule as well as larger fALFF in the areas of the
   dorsal attention network and the precuneus. These findings suggest that
   Stroop performance is reflected in resting state functional properties
   of these areas and the network. In addition, default brain activity of
   the dorsal attention network and precuneus as well as higher cognitive
   processes represented there, and default stronger global influence of
   the areas critical in executive functioning underlie better Stroop
   performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While being in the center of attention and exposed to other's
   evaluations humans are prone to experience embarrassment. To
   characterize the neural underpinnings of such aversive moments, we
   induced genuine experiences of embarrassment during person-group
   interactions in a functional neuroimaging study. Using a mock-up
   scenario with three confederates, we examined how the presence of an
   audience affected physiological and neural responses and the reported
   emotional experiences of failures and achievements. The results
   indicated that publicity induced activations in mentalizing areas and
   failures led to activations in arousal processing systems. Mentalizing
   activity as well as attention towards the audience were increased in
   socially anxious participants. The converging integration of information
   from mentalizing areas and arousal processing systems within the ventral
   anterior insula and amygdala forms the neural pathways of embarrassment.
   Targeting these neural markers of embarrassment in the (para-)limbic
   system provides new perspectives for developing treatment strategies for
   social anxiety disorders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Role of the right inferior frontal gyrus in turn-based cooperation and

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{17-23}},

Abstract = {{Interpersonal interaction can be classified into two types: concurrent
   and turn-based interaction, requiring synchronized body-movement and
   complementary behaviors across persons, respectively. To examine the
   neural mechanism of turn-based interaction, we simultaneously measured
   paired participants activations in their bilateral inferior frontal
   gyrus (IFG) and the bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in a
   turn-taking game using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Pairs of
   participants were assigned to either one of two roles (game builder and
   the partner) in the game. The builder's task was to make a copy of a
   target disk-pattern by placing disks on a monitor, while the partner's
   task was to aid the builder in his/her goal (cooperation condition) or
   to obstruct it (competition condition). The builder always took the
   initial move and the partner followed. The NIRS data demonstrated an
   interaction of role (builder vs. partner) by task-type (cooperation vs.
   competition) in the right IFG. The builder in the cooperation condition
   showed higher activation than the cooperator, but the same builder in
   the competition condition showed lower activation than in the
   cooperation condition. The activations in the competitor-builder pairs
   showed positive correlation between their right IFG, but the activations
   in the cooperator-builder pairs did not. These results suggest that the
   builder's activation in the right IFG is reduced/increased in the
   context of interacting with a cooperative/competitive partner. Also, the
   competitor may actively trace the builder's disk manipulation, leading
   to deeper mind-set synchronization in the competition condition, while
   the cooperator may passively follow the builder's move, leading to
   shallower mind-set synchronization in the cooperation condition. (c)

Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},

Pages = {{24-31}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Until now, Machiavellianism has mainly been studied in personality and
   social psychological framework, and little attention has been paid to
   the underlying cognitive and neural equipment. In light of recent
   findings, Machiavellian social skills are not limited to emotion
   regulation and ``cold-mindedness{''} as many authors have recently
   stated, but linked to specific cognitive abilities. Although
   Machiavellians appear to have a relatively poor mindreading ability and
   emotional intelligence, they can efficiently exploit others which is
   likely to come from their flexible problem solving processes in changing
   environmental circumstances. The author proposed that Machiavellians
   have specialized cognitive domains of decision making, such as
   monitoring others' behavior, task orientation, reward seeking,
   inhibition of cooperative feelings, and choosing victims. He related the
   relevant aspects of cognitive functions to their neurological
   substrates, and argued why they make Machiavellians so successful in
   interpersonal relationships. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The amygdala reveals enhanced reactivity to fearful eye whites, even
   when they are backwardly masked by a neutral face and therefore
   processed with limited visual awareness. In our fMRI study, we
   investigated whether this effect is indeed associated with fear
   detection within the eyes of the neutral face mask, or more generally,
   with reactivity to any salient increase in eye white area. In addition,
   we examined whether a single dose of intranasal oxytocin would modulate
   amygdala responses to masked fearful eye whites via a double-blind,
   placebo-controlled pharmacological protocol. We found that increased
   amygdala responses to salient changes within a face's eye region
   occurred specifically for masked fearful eyes but not for similar
   increases in white area as induced by nonsocial control stimuli.
   Administration of oxytocin attenuated amygdala responses to masked
   fearful eye whites. Our results suggest that the amygdala is
   particularly tuned to potential threat signals from the eye region. The
   dampening effects of oxytocin on early amygdala reactivity may reflect
   reduced vigilance for facial threat cues at a preconscious level. Future
   studies may investigate whether this early modulation accounts for the
   beneficial effects of oxytocin on social cognition in anxiety-related
   disorders, as suggested by previous studies.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of gratitude}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Gratitude is an important aspect of human sociality, and is valued by
   religions and moral philosophies. It has been established that gratitude
   leads to benefits for both mental health and interpersonal
   relationships. It is thus important to elucidate the neurobiological
   correlates of gratitude, which are only now beginning to be
   investigated. To this end, we conducted an experiment during which we
   induced gratitude in participants while they underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. We hypothesized that gratitude ratings would
   correlate with activity in brain regions associated with moral
   cognition, value judgment and theory of mind. The stimuli used to elicit
   gratitude were drawn from stories of survivors of the Holocaust, as many
   survivors report being sheltered by strangers or receiving lifesaving
   food and clothing, and having strong feelings of gratitude for such
   gifts. The participants were asked to place themselves in the context of
   the Holocaust and imagine what their own experience would feel like if
   they received such gifts. For each gift, they rated how grateful they
   felt. The results revealed that ratings of gratitude correlated with
   brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal
   cortex, in support of our hypotheses. The results provide a window into
   the brain circuitry for moral cognition and positive emotion that
   accompanies the experience of benefitting from the goodwill of others.}},

Title = {{Amygdala and cingulate structure is associated with stereotype on

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{Sex-role egalitarianism (SRE) is the belief that the sex of an
   individual should not influence the perception of his or her rights,
   abilities, obligations, and opportunities. Thus, low SRE reflects a more
   conservative stereotypical view on sex-role. Here we investigated
   anatomical correlates of individual differences in SRE in the present
   study. We used voxel-based morphometry, a questionnaire to determine an
   individual's SRE and associated psychological measures, and determined
   the association of SRE with gray matter structures and their cognitive
   nature in healthy individuals (375 men and 306 women; age, 20.6 +/- 1.8
   years). We demonstrated that higher SRE was associated with smaller
   regional gray matter density (rGMD) in the anterior part of the
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and higher rGMD in the right amygdala.
   Post-hoc analyses revealed psychological measures characterized by
   contentious interpersonal orientations, such as contentious achievement
   motivation, were associated with lower SRE and higher rGMD in the
   anterior part of PCC. Depressive tendencies were associated with lower
   SRE and higher rGMD in the right amygdala. These findings suggest that
   variations in stereotype on sex role have roots in the limbic brain
   structures linked to contentious interpersonal orientation (cingulate)
   and negative mood (amygdala).}},

Abstract = {{Background: In some fields of fMRI data analysis, using correct methods
   for dealing with noise is crucial for achieving meaningful results. This
   paper provides a quantitative assessment of the effects of different
   preprocessing and noise filtering strategies on psychophysiological
   interactions (PPI) methods for analyzing fMRI data where noise
   management has not yet been established.
   Methods: Both real and simulated fMRI data were used to assess these
   effects. Four regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen for the PPI
   analysis on the basis of their engagement during two tasks. PPI analysis
   was performed for 32 different preprocessing and analysis settings,
   which included data filtering with REfROICOR or no such filtering;
   different filtering of the ROI ``seed{''} signal with a nuisance
   data-driven time series; and the involvement of these data-driven time
   series in the subsequent PPI GLM analysis. The extent of the
   statistically significant results was quantified at the group level
   using simple descriptive statistics. Simulated data were generated to
   assess statistical improvement of different filtering strategies.
   Results: We observed that different approaches for dealing with noise in
   PPI analysis yield differing results in real data. In simulated data, we
   found RETROICOR, seed signal filtering and the addition of data-driven
   covariates to the PPI design matrix significantly improves results.
   Conclusions: We recommend the use of RETROICOR, and data-driven
   filtering of the whole data, or alternatively, seed signal filtering
   with data-driven signals and the addition of data-driven covariates to
   the PPI design matrix. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Persecutory delusions are a clinically important symptom in
   schizophrenia associated with social avoidance and increased violence.
   Few studies have investigated the neurobiology of persecutory delusions,
   which is a prerequisite for developing novel treatments. The aim of this
   two-paradigm functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study is to
   characterize social ``real world{''} and linguistic threat brain
   activations linked to persecutory delusions in schizophrenia (n = 26)
   using instructed-fear/safety and emotional word paradigms.
   Instructed-fear/safety activations correlated to persecutory delusion
   severity demonstrated significant increased lateral orbitofrontal cortex
   and visual association cortex activations for the instructed-fear vs.
   safety and instructed-fear vs. baseline contrasts; decreased lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex and ventral occipital-temporal cortex activations
   were observed for the instructed-safety stimuli vs. baseline contrast.
   The salience network also showed divergent fear and safety cued
   activations correlated to persecutory delusions. Emotional word paradigm
   analyses showed positive correlations between persecutory delusion
   severity and left-lateralized linguistic and hippocampal-parahippocampal
   activations for the threat vs. neutral word contrast. Visual word form
   area activations correlated positively with persecutory delusions for
   both threat and neutral word vs. baseline contrasts. This study links
   persecutory delusions to enhanced neural processing of threatening
   stimuli and decreased processing of safety cues, and helps elucidate
   systems-level activations associated with persecutory delusions in
   schizophrenia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Brain activation during visual working memory correlates with behavioral
   mobility performance in older adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{Functional mobility and cognitive function often decline with age. We
   previously found that functional mobility as measured by the Timed Up
   and Go Test (TUG) was associated with cognitive performance for
   visually-encoded (i.e., for location and face) working memory (WM) in
   older adults. This suggests a common neural basis between TUG and visual
   WM. To elucidate this relationship further, the present study aimed to
   examine the neural basis for the WM-mobility association. In accordance
   with the well-known neural compensation model in aging, we hypothesized
   that ``attentional{''} brain activation for easy WM would increase in
   participants with lower mobility. The data from 32 healthy older adults
   were analyzed, including brain activation during easy WM tasks via
   functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and mobility performance
   via both TUG and a simple walking test. WM performance was significantly
   correlated with TUG but not with simple walking. Some prefrontal brain
   activations during WM were negatively correlated with TUG performance,
   while positive correlations were found in subcortical structures
   including the thalamus, putamen and cerebellum. Moreover, activation of
   the subcortical regions was significantly correlated with WM
   performance, with less activation for lower WM performers. These results
   indicate that older adults with lower mobility used more cortical
   (frontal) and fewer subcortical resources for easy WM tasks. To date,
   the frontal compensation has been proposed separately in the motor and
   cognitive domains, which have been assumed to compensate for dysfunction
   of the other brain areas; however, such dysfunction was less clear in
   previous studies. The present study observed such dysfunction as
   degraded activation associated with lower performance, which was found
   in the subcortical regions. We conclude that a common dysfunction
   compensation activation pattern is likely the neural basis for the
   association between visual WM and functional mobility.}},

Abstract = {{Regions in human lateral and ventral occipitotemporal cortices (OTC)
   respond selectively to pictures of the human body and its parts. What
   are the organizational principles underlying body part responses in
   these regions? Here we used representational similarity analysis (RSA)
   of fMRI data to test multiple possible organizational principles: shape
   similarity, physical proximity, cortical homunculus proximity, and
   semantic similarity. Participants viewed pictures of whole persons,
   chairs, and eight body parts (hands, arms, legs, feet, chests, waists,
   upper faces, and lower faces). The similarity of multivoxel activity
   patterns for all body part pairs was established in whole
   person-selective OTC regions. The resulting neural similarity matrices
   were then compared with similarity matrices capturing the hypothesized
   organizational principles. Results showed that the semantic similarity
   model best captured the neural similarity of body parts in lateral and
   ventral OTC, which followed an organization in three clusters: (1) body
   parts used as action effectors (hands, feet, arms, and legs), (2)
   noneffector body parts (chests and waists), and (3) face parts (upper
   and lower faces). Whole-brain RSA revealed, in addition to OTC, regions
   in parietal and frontal cortex in which neural similarity was related to
   semantic similarity. In contrast, neural similarity in occipital cortex
   was best predicted by shape similarity models. We suggest that the
   semantic organization of body parts in high-level visual cortex relates
   to the different functions associated with the three body part clusters,
   reflecting the unique processing and connectivity demands associated
   with the different types of information (e.g., action, social) different
   body parts (e.g., limbs, faces) convey.}},

Abstract = {{The pervasive tendency to discount the value of future rewards varies
   considerably across individuals and has important implications for
   health and well-being. Here, we used fMRI with human participants to
   examine whether an individual's neural representation of an imagined
   primary reward predicts the degree to which the value of delayed
   monetary payments is discounted. Because future rewards can never be
   experienced at the time of choice, imagining or simulating the benefits
   of a future reward may play a critical role in decisions between
   alternatives with either immediate or delayed benefits. We found that
   enhanced ventromedial prefrontal cortex response during imagined primary
   reward receipt was correlated with reduced discounting in a separate
   monetary intertemporal choice task. Furthermore, activity in enhanced
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex during reward imagination predicted
   temporal discounting behavior both between- and within-individual
   decision makers with 62\% and 73\% mean balanced accuracy, respectively.
   These results suggest that the quality of reward imagination may impact
   the degree to which future outcomes are discounted.}},

Abstract = {{The social welfare provided by cooperation depends on the enforcement of
   social norms. Determining blameworthiness and assigning a deserved
   punishment are two cognitive cornerstones of norm enforcement. Although
   prior work has implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in
   norm-based judgments, the relative contribution of this region to
   blameworthiness and punishment decisions remains poorly understood.
   Here, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and
   fMRI to determine the specific role of DLPFC function in
   norm-enforcement behavior. DLPFC rTMS reduced punishment for wrongful
   acts without affecting blameworthiness ratings, and fMRI revealed
   punishment-selective DLPFC recruitment, suggesting that these two facets
   of norm-based decision making are neurobiologically dissociable.
   Finally, we show that DLPFC rTMS affects punishment decision making by
   altering the integration of information about culpability and harm.
   Together, these findings reveal a selective, causal role for DLPFC in
   norm enforcement: representational integration of the distinct
   information streams used to make punishment decisions.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{A growing body of literature has suggested that intranasal oxytocin (OT)
   or other systemic routes of administration can alter prosocial behavior,
   presumably by directly activating OT sensitive neural circuits in the
   brain. Yet there is no clear evidence that OT given peripherally can
   cross the blood-brain barrier at levels sufficient to engage the OT
   receptor. To address this issue we examined changes in blood oxygen
   level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity in response to peripheral OT
   injections (0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 mg/kg) during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) in awake rats imaged at 7.0 T. These data were compared
   to OT (1 mu g/5 mu l) given directly to the brain via the lateral
   cerebroventricle. Using a 3D annotated MRI atlas of the rat brain
   segmented into 171 brain areas and computational analysis, we
   reconstructed the distributed integrated neural circuits identified with
   BOLD fMRI following central and peripheral OT. Both routes of
   administration caused significant changes in BOLD signal within the
   first 10 min of administration. As expected, central OT activated a
   majority of brain areas known to express a high density of OT receptors,
   e.g., lateral septum, subiculum, shell of the accumbens, bed nucleus of
   the stria terminalis. This profile of activation was not matched by
   peripheral OT. The change in BOLD signal to peripheral OT did not show
   any discernible dose-response. Interestingly, peripheral OT affected all
   subdivisions of the olfactory bulb, in addition to the cerebellum and
   several brainstem areas relevant to the autonomic nervous system,
   including the solitary tract nucleus. The results from this imaging
   study do not support a direct central action of peripheral OT on the
   brain. Instead, the patterns of brain activity suggest that peripheral
   OT may interact at the level of the olfactory bulb and through sensory
   afferents from the autonomic nervous system to influence brain activity.}},

Abstract = {{The study objective was to examine neural correlates of a specific
   component of human caregiving: maternal mental state talk, reflecting a
   mother's proclivity to attribute mental states and intentionality to her
   infant. Using a potent, ecologically relevant stimulus of infant cry
   during fMRI, we tested hypotheses that postpartum neural response to the
   cry of ``own{''} versus a standard ``other{''} infant in the right
   frontoinsular cortex (RFIC) and subcortical limbic network would be
   associated with independent observations of maternal mental state talk.
   The sample comprised 76 urban-living, low socioeconomic mothers (82\%
   African American) and their 4-month-old infants. Before the fMRI scan,
   mothers were filmed in face-to-face interaction with their infant, and
   maternal behaviors were coded by trained researchers unaware of all
   other information about the participants. The results showed higher
   functional activity in the RFIC to own versus other infant cry at the
   group level. In addition, RFIC and bilateral subcortical neural activity
   (e.g., thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, putamen) was associated
   positively with maternal mental state talk but not with more global
   aspects of observed caregiving. These findings held when accounting for
   perceptual and contextual covariates, such as maternal felt distress,
   urge to help, depression severity, and recognition of own infant cry.
   Our results highlight the need to focus on specific components of
   caregiving to advance understanding of the maternal brain. Future work
   will examine the predictive utility of this neural marker for
   mother-child function.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{While there is emerging evidence from behavioral studies that visual
   attention skills are impaired in dyslexia, the corresponding neural
   mechanism (i.e., deficits in the dorsal visual region) needs further
   investigation. We used resting state fMRI to explore the functional
   connectivity (FC) patterns of the left intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and
   the visual word form area (VWFA) in dyslexic children (N = 21, age mean
   = 12) and age-matched controls (N = 26, age mean = 12). The results
   showed that the left IPS and the VWFA were functionally connected to
   each other in both groups and that both were functionally connected to
   left middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Importantly, we observed significant
   group differences in FC between the left IPS and the left MFG and
   between the VWFA and the left MFG. In addition, the strengths of the
   identified FCs were significantly correlated with the score of fluent
   reading, which required obvious eye movement and visual attention
   processing, but not with the lexical decision score. We conclude that
   dyslexics have deficits in the network composed of the prefrontal,
   dorsal visual and ventral visual regions and may have a lack of
   modulation from the left MFG to the dorsal and ventral visual regions.}},

Abstract = {{Adult attachment style (AAS) is a personality trait that affects social
   cognition. Behavioral data suggest that AAS influences mentalizing
   proficiency, i.e. the ability to predict and explain people's behavior
   with reference to mental states, but the neural correlates are unknown.
   We here tested how the AAS dimensions ``avoidance'' (AV) and ``anxiety''
   (ANX) modulate neural correlates of mentalizing. We measured brain
   activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 164
   healthy subjects during an interactive mentalizing paradigm (Prisoner's
   Dilemma Game). AAS was assessed with the Relationship Scales
   Questionnaire, including the subscales AV and ANX. Our task elicited a
   strong activation of the mentalizing network, including bilateral
   precuneus, (anterior, middle, and posterior) cingulate cortices,
   temporal poles, inferior frontal gyri (IFG), temporoparietal junctions,
   superior medial frontal gyri as well as right medial orbital frontal
   gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and
   amygdala. We found that AV is positively and ANX negatively correlated
   with task-associated neural activity in the right amygdala, MFG,
   midcingulate cortex, and superior parietal lobule, and in bilateral IFG.
   These data suggest that avoidantly attached adults activate brain areas
   implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive control to a larger
   extent than anxiously attached individuals during mentalizing. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Moral judgment often requires making difficult tradeoffs (e.g., is it
   appropriate to torture to save the lives of innocents at risk?).
   Previous research suggests that both emotional appraisals and more
   deliberative utilitarian appraisals influence such judgments and that
   these appraisals often conflict. However, it is unclear how these
   different types of appraisals are represented in the brain, or how they
   are integrated into an overall moral judgment. We addressed these
   questions using an fMRI paradigm in which human subjects provide
   separate emotional and utilitarian appraisals for different potential
   actions, and then make difficult moral judgments constructed from
   combinations of these actions. We found that anterior cingulate, insula,
   and superior temporal gyrus correlated with emotional appraisals,
   whereas temporoparietal junction and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   correlated with utilitarian appraisals. Overall moral value judgments
   were represented in an anterior portion of the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex. Critically, the pattern of responses and functional interactions
   between these three sets of regions are consistent with a model in which
   emotional and utilitarian appraisals are computed independently and in
   parallel, and passed to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex where they
   are integrated into an overall moral value judgment.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{The human brain consists of a network of regions that are engaged when
   one observes the movements of others. Observing unexpected movements, as
   defined by the context, often elicits greater activity, particularly in
   the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). This implies that
   observers use contextual information to form expectations about an
   agents goal and subsequent movements. The current study sought to
   identify regions that support the formation of these context-dependent
   expectations, with the pSTS being one candidate, given the consistent
   contextual modulation of its activity. We presented participants with
   fictitious individuals who had emotion-dependent food preferences, and
   instructed participants to indicate which food they expected each
   individual to choose based on the individual's current emotional state.
   Each individual's preference and emotional state therefore created a
   context that informed the observer's expectation of the individual's
   choice. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to assess if these
   different contexts could be discriminated in the pSTS and elsewhere in
   the brain. No evidence for context discrimination was found in the pSTS.
   Context discrimination was found instead a network of other brain
   regions including the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC),
   bilateral parietal cortex, left middle temporal gyrus (L MTG) and left
   anterior temporal lobe (L ATL), which have been previously associated
   with context processing, and semantic and memory retrieval. All
   together, these regions possibly support the formation of context
   dependent expectations of an agent's goal.}},

Title = {{Effects of social sustainability signaling on neural valuation signals
   and taste-experience of food products}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 8}},
Abstract = {{Value-based decision making occurs when individuals choose between
   different alternatives and place a value on each alternative and its
   attributes. Marketing actions frequently manipulate product attributes,
   by adding, e.g., health claims on the packaging. A previous imaging
   study found that an emblem for organic products increased willingness to
   pay (WTP) and activity in the ventral striatum (VS). The current study
   investigated neural and behavioral processes underlying the influence of
   Fair Trade (FT I) labeling on food valuation and choice. Sustainability
   is an important product attribute for many consumers, with FT signals
   being one way to highlight ethically sustainable production. Forty
   participants valuated products in combination with an FT emblem or no
   emblem and stated their WTP in a bidding task while in an MRI scanner.
   After that, participants tasted objectively identical chocolates,
   presented either as ``FT{''} or as ``conventionally produced{''}. In the
   fMRI task, WTP was significantly higher for FT products. FT labeling
   increased activity in regions important for reward-processing and
   salience, that is, in the VS, anterior and posterior cingulate, as well
   as superior frontal gyrus. Subjective value, that is, WTP was correlated
   with activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). We find
   that the anterior cingulate, VS and superior frontal gyrus exhibit task
   related increases in functional connectivity to the vmPFC when an FT
   product was evaluated. Effective connectivity analyses revealed a highly
   probable directed modulation of the vmPFC by those three regions,
   suggesting a network which alters valuation processes. We also found a
   significant taste-placebo effect, with higher experienced taste
   pleasantness and intensity for FT labeled chocolates. Our results reveal
   a possible neural mechanism underlying valuation processes of certified
   food products. The results are important in light of understanding
   current marketing trends as well as designing future interventions that
   aim at positively influencing food choice.}},

Title = {{Physical attractiveness and sex as modulatory factors of empathic brain
   responses to pain}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{Empathy is a process that comprises affective sharing, imagining, and
   understanding the emotions and mental states of others. The brain
   structures involved in empathy for physical pain include the anterior
   insula (Al), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). High empathy may
   lead people to undertake pro social behavior. It is important to
   understand how this process can be changed, and what factors these
   empathic responses depend on. Physical attractiveness is a major social
   and evolutional cue, playing a role in the formation of interpersonal
   evaluation. The aim of the study was to determine how attractiveness
   affects the level of empathy both in relation to self-rated behavior and
   in terms of activation of specific empathy-related brain regions.
   Twenty-seven subjects (14 female and 13 male) were studied using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method while they were
   watching short video scenes involving physically more and less
   attractive men and women who exhibited pain responses. In the absence of
   behavioral effects in compassion ratings, we observed stronger
   activation in empathic brain structures (ACC; Al) for less attractive
   men and for attractive women than for attractive men. Evolutionary
   psychology studies suggest that beauty is valued more highly in females
   than males, which might lead observers to empathize more strongly with
   the attractive woman than the men. Attractive mens' faces are typically
   associated with enhanced masculine facial characteristics and are
   considered to possess fewer desirable personality traits compared with
   feminized faces. This could explain why more empathy was shown to less
   attractive men. In conclusion, the study showed that the attractiveness
   and sex of a model are important modulators of empathy for pain.}},

Abstract = {{Non-verbal communication is the basis of animal interactions. In dyadic
   leader follower interactions, leaders master the ability to carve their
   motor behaviour in order to `signal' their future actions and internal
   plans while these signals influence the behaviour of follower partners,
   who automatically tend to imitate the leader even in complementary
   interactions. Despite their usefulness, signalling and imitation have a
   biomechanical cost, and it is unclear how this cost benefits trade-off
   is managed during repetitive dyadic interactions that present learnable
   regularities. We studied signalling and imitation dynamics (indexed by
   movement kinematics) in pairs of leaders and followers during a
   repetitive, rule-based, joint action. Trial-by-trial Bayesian model
   comparison was used to evaluate the relation between signalling,
   imitation and pair performance. The different models incorporate
   different hypotheses concerning the factors (past interactions versus
   online movements) influencing the leader's signalling (or follower's
   imitation) kinematics. This approach showed that (i) leaders' signalling
   strategy improves future couple performance, (ii) leaders used the
   history of past interactions to shape their signalling, (iii) followers'
   imitative behaviour is more strongly affected by the online movement of
   the leader. This study elucidates the ways online sensorimotor
   communication help individuals align their task representations and
   ultimately improves joint action performance.}},

   witnessing a violent conflict}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{As observers we excel in decoding the emotional signals telling us that
   a social interaction is turning violent. The neural substrate and its
   modulation by personality traits remain ill understood. We performed an
   fMRI experiment in which participants watched videos displaying a
   violent conflict between two people. Observers' attention was directed
   to either the aggressor or the victim. Focusing on the aggressor (vs.
   focusing on the victim) activated the superior temporal sulcus (STS),
   extra-striate body area (EBA), occipital poles and centro-medial
   amygdala (CMA). Stronger instantaneous connectivity occurred between
   these and the EBA, insula, and the red nucleus. When focusing on the
   victim, basolateral amygdala (BLA) activation was related to trait
   empathy and showed increased connectivity with the insula and red
   nucleus. STS activation was associated with trait aggression and
   increased connectivity with the hypothalamus. The findings reveal that
   focusing on the aggressor of a violent conflict triggers more activation
   in categorical (EBA) and emotion (CMA, STS) areas. This is associated
   with increased instantaneous connectivity among emotion areas
   (CMA-insula) and between categorical and emotion (EBA-STS) areas. When
   the focus is on the victim, personality traits (aggression/empathy)
   modulate activity in emotion areas (respectively STS and postcentral
   gyrus/BLA), along with connectivity in the emotional diencephalon
   (hypothalamus) and early visual areas (occipital pole).}},

Abstract = {{Social emotions such as empathy or compassion greatly facilitate our
   interactions with others. Despite the importance of social emotions,
   scientific studies have only recently revealed functional neural
   plasticity associated with the training of such emotions. Using the
   framework of two antagonistic neural systems, the threat and social
   disconnection system on the one hand, and the reward and social
   connection system on the other, this article describes how training
   compassion and empathy can change the functioning of these systems in a
   targeted manner. Whereas excessive empathic sharing of suffering can
   increase negative feelings and activations in the insula and anterior
   cingulate cortex (corresponding to the threat and social disconnection
   system), compassion training can strengthen positive affect and neural
   activations in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and striatum
   (corresponding to the reward and social connection system). These
   neuroimaging findings are complemented by results from behavioral
   studies showing that compassion is linked to helping and forgiveness
   behavior, whereas empathic distress not only decreases helping behavior,
   but is even associated with increased aggressive behavior. Taken
   together, these data provide encouraging evidence for the plasticity of
   adaptive social emotions with wide-ranging implications for basic
   science and applied settings.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{`Getting a joke' always requires resolving an apparent incongruity, but
   the particular cognitive operations called upon vary depending on the
   nature of the joke itself. Previous research has identified the primary
   neural correlates of the cognitive and affective processes called upon
   to respond to humor generally, but little work has been done on the
   substrates underlying the distinct cognitive operations required to
   comprehend particular joke types. This study explored the neural
   correlates of the cognitive processes required to successfully
   comprehend three joke types: bridging-inference jokes (BJs),
   exaggeration jokes (EJs), and ambiguity jokes (AJs). For all joke types,
   the left dIPFC appeared to support common cognitive mechanisms, such as
   script-shifting, while the vACC was associated with affective
   appreciation. The temporo-parietal lobe (TPJ and MTG) was associated
   with BJs, suggesting involvement of these regions with `theory of mind'
   processing. The fronto-parietal lobe (IPL and IFG) was associated with
   both EJs and AJs, suggesting that it supports executive control
   processes such as retrieval from episodic memory, self-awareness, and
   language-based decoding. The social-affective appreciation of verbal
   jokes was associated with activity in the orbitofrontal cortex,
   amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus. These results allow a more precise
   account of the neural processes required to support the particular
   cognitive operations required for the understanding of different types
   of humor.}},

   fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 2}},
Abstract = {{A positive view of oneself is important for a healthy lifestyle.
   Self-protection mechanisms such as suppressing negative self-related
   information help us to maintain a positive view of ourselves. This is of
   special relevance when, for instance, a negative test result threatens
   our positive self-view. To date, it is not clear which brain areas
   support self-protective mechanisms under self-threat. In the present
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study the participants (N =
   46) received a (negative vs. positive) performance test feedback before
   entering the scanner. In the scanner, the participants were instructed
   to ascribe personality traits either to themselves or to a famous other.
   Our results showed that participants responded slower to negative
   self-related traits compared to positive self-related traits. High
   self-esteem individuals responded slower to negative traits compared to
   low self-esteem individuals following a self-threat. This indicates that
   high self-esteem individuals engage more in self-enhancing strategies
   after a threat by inhibiting negative self-related information more
   successfully than low self-esteem individuals. This behavioral pattern
   was mirrored in the fMRI data as dACC correlated positively with trait
   self-esteem. Generally, ACC activation was attenuated under threat when
   participants evaluated self-relevant traits and even more for negative
   self-related traits. We also found that activation in the ACC was
   negatively correlated with response times, indicating that greater
   activation of the ACC is linked to better access (faster response) to
   positive self-related traits and to impaired access (slower response) to
   negative self-related traits. These results confirm the ACC function as
   important in managing threatened self-worth but indicate differences in
   trait self-esteem levels. The fMRI analyses also revealed a decrease in
   activation within the left Hippocampus and the right thalamus under
   threat. This indicates that a down-regulation of activation in these
   regions might also serve as coping mechanism in dealing with
   self-threat.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of parent-child HPA axis coregulation}},
Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},
Pages = {{25-32}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Parents and children have been found to show coordination or
   coregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This
   coordination may be reflected in adolescents' neural activation to
   parent stimuli, particularly in regions of the brain associated with
   social information processing.
   This study reports on 22 adolescents (13 males, mean age 17 years),
   recruited from a longitudinal study to participate in a functional MRI
   (fMRI) scanning protocol. Approximately 1.5 years before the scan, these
   same adolescents participated in a family conflict discussion in the lab
   with both parents, and all three family members provided samples of
   salivary cortisol five times, before and after the discussion.
   Multilevel models found positive cross-sectional and time-lagged
   associations between parents' and youth cortisol. Empirical Bayes (EB)
   coefficients, extracted from these models to reflect the strength of the
   relationship between parent and adolescent cortisol, were tested in
   conjunction with adolescents' neural activation to video clips of their
   parents taken from the conflict discussion. For both mothers and
   fathers, youth who showed stronger cortisol coregulation with each
   parent (both in cross-sectional and time-lagged analyses) showed more
   activation to that same parent in posteromedial regions (precuneus,
   posterior cingulate, and retrosplenial cortex) that have been linked
   with social cognition, e.g. mentalizing about others' emotions. Youths'
   adrenocortical coregulation with their parents may be reflected in their
   neural processing of stimuli featuring those same parents. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Based on studies in rodents, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is
   considered a key site for experience-dependent neural plasticity
   underlying the acquisition of conditioned fear responses. In humans,
   very few studies exist of subjects with selective amygdala lesions and
   those studies have only implicated the amygdala more broadly leaving the
   role of amygdala sub-regions underexplored. We tested a rare sample of
   subjects (N = 4) with unprecedented focal bilateral BLA lesions due to a
   genetic condition called Urbach-Wiethe disease. In a classical delay
   fear conditioning experiment, these subjects showed impaired acquisition
   of conditioned fear relative to a group of matched control subjects (N =
   10) as measured by fear-potentiation of the defensive eye-blink startle
   reflex. After the experiment, the BLA-damaged cases showed normal
   declarative memory of the conditioned association. Our findings provide
   new evidence that the human BLA is essential to drive fast classically
   conditioned defensive reflexes.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse aspects of physical, affective and cognitive health relate to
   social integration, reflecting engagement in social activities and
   identification with diverse roles within a social network. However, the
   mechanisms by which social integration interacts with the brain are
   unclear. In healthy adults (N = 155), we tested the links between social
   integration and measures of white matter microstructure using diffusion
   tensor imaging. Across the brain, there was a predominantly positive
   association between a measure of white matter integrity, fractional
   anisotropy (FA), and social network diversity. This association was
   particularly strong in a region near the anterior corpus callosum and
   driven by a negative association with the radial component of the
   diffusion signal. This callosal region contained projections between
   bilateral prefrontal cortices, as well as cingulum and corticostriatal
   pathways. FA within this region was weakly associated with circulating
   levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), but IL-6 did
   not mediate the social network and FA relationship. Finally, variation
   in FA indirectly mediated the relationship between social network
   diversity and intrinsic functional connectivity of medial
   corticostriatal pathways. These findings suggest that social integration
   relates to myelin integrity in humans, which may help explain the
   diverse aspects of health affected by social networks.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Mood disorders are characterized by impaired emotion regulation
   abilities, reflected in alterations in frontolimbic brain functioning
   during regulation. However, little is known about differences in brain
   function when comparing regulatory strategies. Reappraisal and emotional
   acceptance are effective in downregulating negative affect, and are
   components of effective depression psychotherapies. Investigating neural
   mechanisms of reappraisal vs emotional acceptance in remitted major
   depressive disorder (rMDD) may yield novel mechanistic insights into
   depression risk and prevention. Thirty-seven individuals (18 rMDD, 19
   controls) were assessed during a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   task requiring reappraisal, emotional acceptance or no explicit
   regulation while viewing sad images. Lower negative affect was reported
   following reappraisal than acceptance, and was lower following
   acceptance than no explicit regulation. In controls, the acceptance >
   reappraisal contrast revealed greater activation in left insular cortex
   and right prefrontal gyrus, and less activation in several other
   prefrontal regions. Compared with controls, the rMDD group had greater
   paracingulate and right midfrontal gyrus (BA 8) activation during
   reappraisal relative to acceptance. Compared with reappraisal,
   acceptance is associated with activation in regions linked to somatic
   and emotion awareness, although this activation is associated with less
   reduction in negative affect. Additionally, a history of MDD moderated
   these effects.}},

Abstract = {{Humans show stronger empathy for in-group compared with out-group
   members' suffering and help in-group members more than out-group
   members. Moreover, the in-group bias in empathy and parochial altruism
   tend to be more salient in collectivistic than individualistic cultures.
   This work tested the hypothesis that modifying self-construals, which
   differentiate between collectivistic and individualistic cultural
   orientations, affects in-group bias in empathy for perceived own-race vs
   other-race pain. By scanning adults using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we found stronger neural activities in the mid-cingulate, left
   insula and supplementary motor area (SMA) in response to racial in-group
   compared with out-group members' pain after participants had been primed
   with interdependent self-construals. However, the racial in-group bias
   in neural responses to others' pain in the left SMA, mid-cingulate
   cortex and insula was significantly reduced by priming independent
   self-construals. Our findings suggest that shifting an individual's
   self-construal leads to changes of his/her racial in-group bias in
   neural responses to others' suffering.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperation and free riding are among the most frequently observed
   behaviors in human social decision-making. In social interactions, the
   effects of strategic decision processes have been consistently reported
   in iterative cooperation decisions. However, the neural activity
   immediately after new information is presented, the time at which
   strategy learning potentially starts has not yet been investigated with
   high temporal resolution. Here, we implemented an iterative, binary
   public goods game that simulates cooperation/free riding behavior. We
   applied the multi-feature pattern analysis method by using a support
   vector machine and the unique combinatorial performance measure, and
   identified neural features from the single-trial, event-related spectral
   perturbation at the result-presentation of the current round that
   predict participants' decisions to cooperate or free ride in the
   subsequent round. We found that neural oscillations in centroparietal
   and temporal regions showed the highest predictive power through 10-fold
   cross-validation; these predicted the participants' next decisions,
   which were independent of the neural responses during their own
   preceding choices. We suggest that the spatial distribution and
   time-frequency information of the selected features represent covert
   motivations to free ride or cooperate in the next round and are
   separately processed in parallel with information regarding the
   preceding results.}},

Abstract = {{In this functional neuroimaging study, we investigated neural
   activations during the process of learning to gain monetary rewards and
   to avoid monetary loss, and how these activations are modulated by
   individual differences in reward and punishment sensitivity. Healthy
   young volunteers performed a reinforcement learning task where they
   chose one of two fractal stimuli associated with monetary gain (reward
   trials) or avoidance of monetary loss (avoidance trials). Trait
   sensitivity to reward and punishment was assessed using the behavioral
   inhibition/ activation scales (BIS/BAS). Functional neuroimaging results
   showed activation of the striatum during the anticipation and reception
   periods of reward trials. During avoidance trials, activation of the
   dorsal striatum and prefrontal regions was found. As expected,
   individual differences in reward sensitivity were positively associated
   with activation in the left and right ventral striatum during reward
   reception. Individual differences in sensitivity to punishment were
   negatively associated with activation in the left dorsal striatum during
   avoidance anticipation and also with activation in the right lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex during receiving monetary loss. These results
   suggest that learning to attain reward and learning to avoid loss are
   dependent on separable sets of neural regions whose activity is
   modulated by trait sensitivity to reward or punishment.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is characterized by an increase in risk-taking and
   reward-seeking behaviors. In other populations, increased risk taking
   has been associated with tighter coupling between cortisol production
   and ventral striatum (VS) activation during reward anticipation; this
   relation has not yet been examined, however, as a function of adolescent
   development. This study examined the influence of pubertal development
   on the association between diurnal cortisol production and VS activity
   during reward anticipation. Pre- and post-menarcheal girls collected
   diurnal cortisol and completed an functional magnetic resonance
   imaging-based monetary incentive delay task, from which we extracted
   estimates of VS activity during the anticipation of reward, anticipation
   of loss and anticipation of non-incentive neutral trials.
   Post-menarcheal girls showed greater coupling between the cortisol
   awakening response and VS activation during anticipation of reward and
   loss than did their pre-menarcheal counterparts. Post-menarcheal girls
   did not differ from pre-menarcheal girls in their cortisol-VS coupling
   during anticipation of neutral trials, suggesting that puberty-related
   changes in cortisol-VS coupling are specific to affective stimuli.
   Interestingly, behavioral responses during the task indicate that
   post-menarcheal girls are faster to engage with affective stimuli than
   are pre-menarcheal girls. Thus, post-menarcheal girls exhibit
   neurobiological and behavioral patterns that have been associated with
   risk taking and that may underlie the dramatic increase in risk-taking

Abstract = {{We tested two competing models for the brain basis of emotion, the basic
   emotion theory and the conceptual act theory of emotion, using
   resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging
   (rs-fcMRI). The basic emotion view hypothesizes that anger, sadness,
   fear, disgust and happiness each arise from a brain network that is
   innate, anatomically constrained and homologous in other animals. The
   conceptual act theory of emotion hypothesizes that an instance of
   emotion is a brain state constructed from the interaction of
   domain-general, core systems within the brain such as the salience,
   default mode and frontoparietal control networks. Using peak coordinates
   derived from a meta-analysis of task-evoked emotion fMRI studies, we
   generated a set of whole-brain rs-fcMRI `discovery' maps for each
   emotion category and examined the spatial overlap in their conjunctions.
   Instead of discovering a specific network for each emotion category,
   variance in the discovery maps was accounted for by the known
   domain-general network. Furthermore, the salience network is observed as
   part of every emotion category. These results indicate that specific
   networks for each emotion do not exist within the intrinsic architecture
   of the human brain and instead support the conceptual act theory of
   emotion.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala is a highly interconnected region of the brain that is
   critically important to emotional processing and affective networks.
   Previous studies have shown that the response of the amygdala to
   emotionally arousing stimuli can be modulated by sex hormones. Because
   oral contraceptive pills dramatically lower circulating sex hormone
   levels with potent analogs of those hormones, we performed a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging experiment to measure amygdala reactivity in
   response to emotional stimuli in women using oral contraceptives, and
   compared their amygdala reactivity with that of naturally cycling women.
   Here, we show that women who use oral contraceptive pills have
   significantly decreased bilateral amygdala reactivity in response to
   negatively valenced, emotionally arousing stimuli compared with
   naturally cycling women. We suggest that by modulating amygdala
   reactivity, oral contraceptive pills may influence behaviors that have
   previously been shown to be amygdala dependent-in particular, emotional
   memory.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that the association between oxytocin receptor
   polymorphism (OXTR rs53576) and emotion-related behavioral/psychological
   tendencies differs between individuals from East Asian and Western
   cultures. What remains unresolved is which specific dimension of
   cultural orientations interacts with OXTR rs53576 to shape these
   tendencies and whether such gene x culture interactions occurs at both
   behavioral and neural level. This study investigated whether and how
   OXTR rs53576 interacts with interdependence-a key dimension of cultural
   orientations that distinguish between East Asian and Western cultures-to
   affect human empathy that underlies altruistic motivation and prosocial
   behavior. Experiment 1 measured interdependence, empathy trait and OXTR
   rs53576 genotypes of 1536 Chinese participants. Hierarchical regression
   analyses revealed a stronger association between interdependence and
   empathy trait in G allele carriers compared with A/A homozygotes of OXTR
   rs53576. Experiment 2 measured neural responses to others' suffering by
   scanning A/A and G/G homozygous of OXTR rs53576 using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed
   stronger associations between interdependence and empathic neural
   responses in the insula, amygdala and superior temporal gyrus in G/G
   compared with A/A carriers. Our results provide the first evidence for
   gene x culture interactions on empathy at both behavioral tendency and
   underlying brain activity.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation research has primarily focused on techniques that
   attenuate or modulate the impact of emotional stimuli. Recent evidence
   suggests that this mode regulation can be problematic in the context of
   regulation of emotion elicited by the suffering of others, resulting in
   reduced emotional connectedness. Here, we investigated the effects of an
   alternative emotion regulation technique based on the up-regulation of
   positive affect via Compassion-meditation on experiential and neural
   affective responses to depictions of individuals in distress, and
   compared these with the established emotion regulation strategy of
   Reappraisal. Using fMRI, we scanned 15 expert practitioners of
   Compassion-meditation either passively viewing, or using
   Compassion-meditation or Reappraisal to modulate their emotional
   reactions to film clips depicting people in distress. Both strategies
   effectively, but differentially regulated experienced affect, with
   Compassion primarily increasing positive and Reappraisal primarily
   decreasing negative affect. Imaging results showed that Compassion,
   relative to both passive-viewing and Reappraisal increased activation in
   regions involved in affiliation, positive affect and reward processing
   including ventral striatum and medial orbitfrontal cortex. This network
   was shown to be active prior to stimulus presentation, suggesting that
   the regulatory mechanism of Compassion is the stimulus-independent
   endogenous generation of positive affect.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Healthy aging is associated with a decline in visuospatial
   working memory. The nature of the changes leading to this decline in
   response of the eye and/or hand is still under debate. This study aims
   to establish whether impairments observed in performance on cognitive
   tasks are due to actual cognitive effects or are caused by motor-related
   eye-hand coordination.
   Methods. We implemented a computerized version of the Corsi span task.
   The eye and touch responses of healthy young and older adults were
   recorded to a series of remembered targets on a screen.
   Results. Results revealed differences in fixation strategies between the
   young and the old with increasing cognitive demand, which resulted in
   higher error rates in the older group. We observed increasing reaction
   times and durations between fixations and touches to targets, with
   increasing memory load and delays in both the eye and the hand in the
   older adults.
   Discussion. Our results show that older adults have difficulty
   maintaining a ``preparatory set{''} for durations longer than 5 s and
   with increases in memory load. Attentional differences cannot account
   for our results, and differences in age groups appear to be principally
   memory related. Older adults reveal poorer eye-hand coordination, which
   is further confounded by increasing delay and complexity.}},

Title = {{Altered resting perfusion and functional connectivity of default mode
   network in youth with autism spectrum disorder}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neuroimaging studies can shed light on the neurobiological
   underpinnings of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Studies of the resting
   brain have shown both altered baseline metabolism from PET/SPECT and
   altered functional connectivity (FC) of intrinsic brain networks based
   on resting-state fMRI. To date, however, no study has investigated these
   two physiological parameters of resting brain function jointly, or
   explored the relationship between these measures and ASD symptom
   severity. Methods: Here, we used pseudo-continuous arterial spin
   labeling with 3D background-suppressed GRASE to assess resting cerebral
   blood flow (CBF) and FC in 17 youth with ASD and 22 matched typically
   developing (TD) children. Results: A pattern of altered resting
   perfusion was found in ASD versus TD children including frontotemporal
   hyperperfusion and hypoperfusion in the dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex. We found increased local FC in the anterior module of the
   default mode network (DMN) accompanied by decreased CBF in the same
   area. In our cohort, both alterations were associated with greater
   social impairments as assessed with the Social Responsiveness Scale
   (SRS-total T scores). While FC was correlated with CBF in TD children,
   this association between FC and baseline perfusion was disrupted in
   children with ASD. Furthermore, there was reduced long-range FC between
   anterior and posterior modules of the DMN in children with ASD.
   Conclusion: Taken together, the findings of this study - the first to
   jointly assess resting CBF and FC in ASD - highlight new avenues for
   identifying novel imaging markers of ASD symptomatology.}},

Title = {{Two spatiotemporally distinct value systems shape reward-based learning
   in the human brain}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Avoiding repeated mistakes and learning to reinforce rewarding decisions
   is critical for human survival and adaptive actions. Yet, the neural
   underpinnings of the value systems that encode different
   decision-outcomes remain elusive. Here coupling single-trial
   electro-encephalography with simultaneously acquired functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, we uncover the spatiotemporal dynamics of two
   separate but interacting value systems encoding decision-outcomes.
   Consistent with a role in regulating alertness and switching behaviours,
   an early system is activated only by negative outcomes and engages
   arousal-related and motor-preparatory brain structures. Consistent with
   a role in reward-based learning, a later system differentially
   suppresses or activates regions of the human reward network in response
   to negative and positive outcomes, respectively. Following negative
   outcomes, the early system interacts and downregulates the late system,
   through a thalamic interaction with the ventral striatum. Critically,
   the strength of this coupling predicts participants' switching behaviour
   and avoidance learning, directly implicating the thalamostriatal pathway
   in reward-based learning.}},

Title = {{Left perirhinal cortex codes for similarity in meaning between written
   words: Comparison with auditory word input}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{4-16}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Left perirhinal cortex has been previously implicated in associative
   coding. According to a recent experiment, the similarity of perirhinal
   fMRI response patterns to written concrete words is higher for words
   which are more similar in their meaning. If left perirhinal cortex
   functions as an amodal semantic hub, one would predict that this
   semantic similarity effect would extend to the spoken modality. We
   conducted an event-related fMRI experiment and evaluated whether a same
   semantic similarity effect could be obtained for spoken as for written
   words. Twenty healthy subjects performed a property verification task in
   either the written or the spoken modality. Words corresponded to
   concrete animate entities for which extensive feature generation was
   available from more than 1000 subjects. From these feature generation
   data, a concept-feature matrix was derived which formed the basis of a
   cosine similarity matrix between the entities reflecting their
   similarity in meaning (called the ``semantic cossimilarity matrix{''}).
   Independently, we calculated a cosine similarity matrix between the left
   perirhinal fMRI activity patterns evoked by the words (called the ``fMRI
   cossimilarity matrix{''}). Next, the similarity was determined between
   the semantic cossimilarity matrix and the fMRI cossimilarity matrix.
   This was done for written and spoken words pooled, for written words
   only, for spoken words only, as well as for crossmodal pairs. Only for
   written words did the fMRI cossimilarity matrix correlate with the
   semantic cossimilarity matrix. Contrary to our prediction, we did not
   find any such effect for auditory word input nor did we find cross-modal
   effects in perirhinal cortex between written and auditory words. Our
   findings situate the contribution of left perirhinal cortex to word
   processing at the top of the visual processing pathway, rather than at
   an amodal stage where visual and auditory word processing pathways have
   already converged. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A job interview in the MRI scanner: How does indirectness affect

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{79-91}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In using language, people not only exchange information, but also
   navigate their social world - for example, they can express themselves
   indirectly to avoid losing face. In this functional magnetic resonance
   imaging study, we investigated the neural correlates of interpreting
   face-saving indirect replies, in a situation where participants only
   overheard the replies as part of a conversation between two other
   people, as well as in a situation where the participants were directly
   addressed themselves. We created a fictional job interview context where
   indirect replies serve as a natural communicative strategy to attenuate
   one's shortcomings, and asked fMRI participants to either pose scripted
   questions and receive answers from three putative job candidates
   (addressee condition) or to listen to someone else interview the same
   candidates (overhearer condition). In both cases, the need to evaluate
   the candidate ensured that participants had an active interest in
   comprehending the replies. Relative to direct replies, face-saving
   indirect replies increased activation in medial prefrontal cortex,
   bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), bilateral inferior frontal
   gyrus and bilateral middle temporal gyrus, in active overhearers and
   active addressees alike, with similar effect size, and comparable to
   findings obtained in an earlier passive listening study (Basnakova et
   al., 2014). In contrast, indirectness effects in bilateral anterior
   insula and pregenual ACC, two regions implicated in emotional salience
   and empathy, were reliably stronger in addressees than in active
   overhearers. Our findings indicate that understanding face-saving
   indirect language requires additional cognitive perspective-taking and
   other discourse-relevant cognitive processing, to a comparable extent in
   active overhearers and addressees. Furthermore, they indicate that
   face-saving indirect language draws upon affective systems more in
   addressees than in overhearers, presumably because the addressee is the
   one being managed by a face-saving reply. In all, face-saving
   indirectness provides a window on the cognitive as well as
   affect-related neural systems involved in human communication. (C) 2015

Title = {{When semantics aids phonology: A processing advantage for iconic word
   forms in aphasia}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{264-275}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Iconicity is the non-arbitrary relation between properties of a
   phonological form and semantic content (e.g. ``moo{''}, ``splash{''}).
   It is a common feature of both spoken and signed languages, and recent
   evidence shows that iconic forms confer an advantage during word
   learning. We explored whether iconic forms conferred a processing
   advantage for 13 individuals with aphasia following left-hemisphere
   stroke. Iconic and control words were compared in four different tasks:
   repetition, reading aloud, auditory lexical decision and visual lexical
   decision. An advantage for iconic words was seen for some individuals in
   all tasks, with consistent group effects emerging in reading aloud and
   auditory lexical decision. Both these tasks rely on mapping between
   semantics and phonology. We conclude that iconicity aids spoken word
   processing for individuals with aphasia. This advantage is due to a
   stronger connection between semantic information and phonological forms.

Journal = {{CEREBRAL CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The placement and development of the visual word form area (VWFA) have
   commonly been assumed to depend, in part, on its connections with
   language regions. In this study, we specifically examined the effects of
   auditory speech experience deprivation in shaping the VWFA by
   investigating its location distribution, activation strength, and
   functional connectivity pattern in congenitally deaf participants. We
   found that the location and activation strength of the VWFA in
   congenitally deaf participants were highly comparable with those of
   hearing controls. Furthermore, while the congenitally deaf group showed
   reduced resting-state functional connectivity between the VWFA and the
   auditory speech area in the left anterior superior temporal gyrus, its
   intrinsic functional connectivity pattern between the VWFA and a
   fronto-parietal network was similar to that of hearing controls. Taken
   together, these results suggest that auditory speech experience has
   consequences for aspects of the word form-speech sound correspondence
   network, but that such experience does not significantly modulate the
   VWFA's placement or response strength. This is consistent with the view
   that the role of the VWFA might be to provide a representation that is
   suitable for mapping visual word forms onto language-specific gestures
   without the need to construct an aural representation.}},

Abstract = {{This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined
   experiencing and imagining gentle arm and palm touch to determine
   whether these processes activate overlapping or distinct brain regions.
   Although past research shows brain responses to experiencing and viewing
   touch, this study investigates neural processing of touch absent of
   visual stimulation. C-tactile (CT) nerves, present in hairy skin,
   respond specifically to caress-like touch. CT-targeted touch activates
   ``social brain{''} regions including insula, right posterior superior
   temporal sulcus, amygdala, temporal poles, and orbitofrontal cortex
   (McGlone et al. 2012). We addressed whether activations reflect sensory
   input-driven mechanisms, cognitive-based mechanisms, or both. We
   identified a functional dissociation between insula regions. Posterior
   insula responded during experienced touch. Anterior insula responded
   during both experienced and imagined touch. To isolate
   stimulus-independent mechanisms recruited during physical experience of
   CT-targeted touch, we identified regions active to experiencing and
   imagining such touch. These included amygdala and temporal pole. We
   posit that the dissociation of insula function suggests posterior and
   anterior insula involvement in distinct yet interacting processes:
   coding physical stimulation and affective interpretation of touch.
   Regions active during experiencing and imagining CT-targeted touch are
   associated with social processes indicating that imagining touch
   conjures affective aspects of experiencing such touch.}},

Abstract = {{Research links the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with a number of
   social cognitive processes that involve reflecting on oneself and other
   people. Here, we investigated how mPFC might support the ability to
   recollect information about oneself and others relating to previous
   experiences. Participants judged whether they had previously related
   stimuli conceptually to themselves or someone else, or whether they or
   another agent had performed actions. We uncovered a functional
   distinction between dorsal and ventral mPFC subregions based on
   information retrieved from episodic long-term memory. The dorsal mPFC
   was generally activated when participants attempted to retrieve social
   information about themselves and others, regardless of whether this
   information concerned the conceptual or agentic self or other. In
   contrast, a role was discerned for ventral mPFC during conceptual but
   not agentic self-referential recollection, indicating specific
   involvement in retrieving memories related to self-concept rather than
   bodily self. A subsequent recognition test for new items that had been
   presented during the recollection task found that conceptual and agentic
   recollection attempts resulted in differential incidental encoding of
   new information. Thus, we reveal converging fMRI and behavioral evidence
   for distinct neurocognitive forms of self-referential recollection,
   highlighting that conceptual and bodily aspects of self-reflection can
   be dissociated.}},

Abstract = {{The superior temporal sulcus (STS) in the human and monkey is sensitive
   to the motion of complex forms such as facial and bodily actions. We
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore
   network-level explanations for how the form and motion information in
   dynamic facial expressions might be combined in the human STS. Ventral
   occipitotemporal areas selective for facial form were localized in
   occipital and fusiform face areas (OFA and FFA), and motion sensitivity
   was localized in the more dorsal temporal area V5. We then tested
   various connectivity models that modeled communication between the
   ventral form and dorsal motion pathways. We show that facial form
   information modulated transmission of motion information from V5 to the
   STS, and that this face-selective modulation likely originated in OFA.
   This finding shows that form-selective motion sensitivity in the STS can
   be explained in terms of modulation of gain control on information flow
   in the motion pathway, and provides a substantial constraint for
   theories of the perception of faces and biological motion.}},

Abstract = {{Altered neural processing of social signals such as angry facial
   expressions has been associated with increased aggressive behavior, but
   evidence for this relationship in healthy persons using ecologically
   valid experimental designs is lacking. We presented socially relevant
   videos of facial expressions in a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) version of the well-established Taylor Aggression Paradigm and
   investigated 41 healthy male participants, of whom 32 were included in
   the analysis. In each round of this competitive reaction time task,
   participants observed their opponent while he selected a punishment
   level for him, bearing either a neutral or angry facial expression.
   Afterward, participants in turn selected a punishment level for their
   opponent. Across participants, reactivity of the medial orbitofrontal
   cortex (OFC) to angry facial expressions was negatively related to
   aggressive behavior. Within participants and across trials, activity in
   the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was positively related to aggressive
   behavior specifically in response to angry expressions. Moreover, we
   found an effect of angry expressions on neural activity patterns during
   later stages of the task, demonstrating that the effect of angry
   expressions on neural reactivity is more than just a short-lived,
   stimulus-driven response. Our results underscore the importance of OFC
   and ACC for the shaping of socially adaptive responses to provocation.}},

Abstract = {{Performing a task alone or together with another agent can produce
   different outcomes. The current study used event-related functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural
   underpinnings when participants performed a Go/Nogo task alone or
   complementarily with another co-actor (unseen), whom was believed to be
   another human or a computer. During both complementary tasks, reaction
   time data suggested that participants integrated the potential action of
   their co-actor in their own action planning. Compared to the
   single-actor task, increased parietal and precentral activity during
   complementary tasks as shown in the fMRI data further suggested
   representation of the co-actor's response. The superior frontal gyrus of
   the medial prefrontal cortex was differentially activated in the human
   co-actor condition compared to the computer co-actor condition. The
   medial prefrontal cortex, involved thinking about the beliefs and
   intentions of other people, possibly reflects a social-cognitive aspect
   or self-other discrimination during the joint task when believing a
   biological co-actor is present. Our results suggest that action
   co-representation can occur even offline with any agent type given a
   priori information that they are co-acting; however, additional regions
   are recruited when participants believe they are task-sharing with
   another human.}},

Abstract = {{The last two decades have marked tremendous progress in our ability to
   prevent and intervene early in psychiatric illnesses. The interventions
   described in this article range from established, empirically-supported
   treatments to creative interventions early in their development and
   deployment. Some of these interventions are low-technology programs
   delivered in social settings (such as schools), and some rely on
   sophisticated emerging technologies such as neuroimaging. This article
   reviews 4 preventative interventions: 1) The use of structural brain
   imaging to identify children at risk for familial depression who are
   most likely to benefit from preventative cognitive behavioral therapy,
   2) The Good Behavior Game, a school based program that, when implemented
   in 1st grade classrooms, cut the incidence of substance use disorders in
   students in half when those students were 19 years old, 3) The SPARX
   video game, which has the potential to be an accessible, appealing, and
   cost-effective treatment for the thousands of teens affected by mild to
   moderate depressive disorders, and 4) Intensive psychosocial treatments
   which can reduce the progression from the ultra high risk state to the
   first episode psychosis by 50\% over 12 months. All of these
   interventions have tremendous potential to reduce the suffering and
   disability caused by psychiatric illness to both children and adults.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This study examined whether the grouping of people into meaningful
   social scenes (e.g., two people having a chat) impacts the basic
   perceptual analysis of each partaking individual. To explore this issue,
   we measured neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) while participants sex-categorized congruent as well as
   incongruent person dyads (i.e., two people interacting in a plausible or
   implausible manner). Incongruent person dyads elicited enhanced neural
   processing in several high-level visual areas dedicated to face and body
   encoding and in the posterior middle temporal gyrus compared to
   congruent person dyads. Incongruent and congruent person scenes were
   also successfully differentiated by a linear multivariate pattern
   classifier in the right fusiform body area and the left extrastriate
   body area. Finally, increases in the person scenes' meaningfulness as
   judged by independent observers was accompanied by enhanced activity in
   the bilateral posterior insula. These findings demonstrate that the
   processing of person scenes goes beyond a mere stimulus-bound encoding
   of their partaking agents, suggesting that changes in relations between
   agents affect their representation in category-selective regions of the
   visual cortex and beyond. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{21-34}},

Abstract = {{Forming and updating impressions about others is critical in everyday
   life and engages portions of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC),
   the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the amygdala. Some of these
   activations are attributed to ``mentalizing{''} functions necessary to
   represent people's mental states, such as beliefs or desires.
   Evolutionary psychology and developmental studies, however, suggest that
   interpersonal inferences can also be obtained through the aid of deontic
   heuristics, which dictate what must (or must not) be done in given
   circumstances. We used fMRI and asked 18 participants to predict whether
   unknown characters would follow their desires or obey external rules.
   Participants had no means, at the beginning, to make accurate
   predictions, but slowly learned (throughout the experiment) each
   character's behavioral profile. We isolated brain regions whose activity
   changed during the experiment, as a neural signature of impression
   updating: whereas dMPFC was progressively more involved in predicting
   characters' behavior in relation to their desires, the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala were progressively more recruited
   in predicting rule-based behavior. Our data provide evidence of a neural
   dissociation between deontic inference and theory-of-mind (TOM), and
   support a differentiation of orbital and dorsal prefrontal cortex in
   terms of low- and high-level social cognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Distinct neural processes are engaged in the modulation of mimicry by
   social group-membership and emotional expressions}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{49-67}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{People often spontaneously engage in copying each other's postures and
   mannerisms, a phenomenon referred to as behavioral mimicry. Social
   psychology experiments indicate that mimicry denotes an implicit
   affiliative signal flexibly regulated in response to social
   requirements. Yet, the mediating processes and neural underpinnings of
   such regulation are largely unexplored. The present functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) study examined mimicry regulation by combining
   an automatic imitation task with facial stimuli, varied on two
   social-affective dimensions: emotional expression (angry vs happy) and
   ethnic group membership (in- vs out-group). Behavioral data revealed
   increased mimicry when happy and when out-group faces were shown.
   Imaging results revealed that mimicry regulation in response to happy
   faces was associated with increased activation in the right
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), right dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC),
   and right superior parietal lobule (SPL). Mimicry regulation in response
   to out-group faces was related to increased activation in the left
   ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL),
   bilateral anterior insula, and mid-cingulate cortex (MCC). We suggest
   that mimicry in response to happy and to out-group faces is driven by
   distinct affiliative goals, and that mimicry regulation to attain these
   goals is mediated by distinct neuro-cognitive processes. Higher mimicry
   in response to happy faces seems to denote reciprocation of an
   affiliative signal. Higher mimicry in response to out-group faces,
   reflects an appeasement attempt towards an interaction partner perceived
   as threatening (an interpretation supported by implicit measures showing
   that out-group members are more strongly associated with threat). Our
   findings show that subtle social cues can result in the implicit
   regulation of mimicry. This regulation serves to achieve distinct
   affiliative goals, is mediated by different regulatory processes, and
   relies on distinct parts of an overarching network of task-related brain
   areas. Our findings shed new light on the neural mechanisms underlying
   the interplay between implicit action control and social cognition. (C)

Title = {{Racial bias in neural response to others' pain is reduced with
   other-race contact}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{68-78}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Observing the pain of others has been shown to elicit greater activation
   in sensory and emotional areas of the brain suggested to represent a
   neural marker of empathy. This modulation of brain responses to others'
   pain is dependent on the race of the observed person, such that
   observing own-race people in pain is associated with greater activity in
   the anterior cingulate and bilateral insula cortices compared to
   other-race people. Importantly, it is not known how this racial bias to
   pain in other-race individuals might change over time in new immigrants
   or might depend on the level and quality of contact with people of the
   other-race. We investigated these issues by recruiting Chinese students
   who had first arrived in Australia within the past 6 months to 5 years
   and assessing their level of contact with other races across different
   social contexts using comprehensive rating scales. During fMRI,
   participants observed videos of own-race/other-race individuals, as well
   as own-group/other-group individuals, receiving painful or non-painful
   touch. The typical racial bias in neural responses to observed pain was
   evident, whereby activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was
   greater for pain in own-race compared to other-race people. Crucially,
   activation in the anterior cingulate to pain in other races increased
   significantly with the level of contact participants reported with
   people of the other race. Importantly, this correlation did not depend
   on the closeness of contact or personal relationships, but simply on the
   overall level of experience with people of the other race in their
   every-day environment. Racial bias in neural responses to others pain,
   as a neural marker of empathy, therefore changes with experience in new
   immigrants at least within 5 years of arrival in the new society and,
   crucially, depends on the level of contact with people of the other race
   in every-day life contexts. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Distinct neural networks underlying empathy for pleasant and unpleasant
   touch}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{79-89}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In spite of considerable progress in the understanding of the neural
   mechanisms underlying the experience of empathy, the majority of
   previous investigations have focused on how we share negative affective
   states (and in particular pain) of others, whereas only few studies have
   targeted empathy for positive emotions. This bias has precluded
   addressing one of the central tenets of the shared representations
   account of empathy, which is that different networks should be engaged
   when empathizing with emotions that are represented on different neural
   levels. The aim of the present study was to overcome this limitation and
   to test whether empathy for pleasant and unpleasant affective touch is
   underpinned by different neural networks. To this end we used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with two independent replication
   experiments (N = 18, N = 32), and a novel paradigm enabling the joint
   investigation of first-hand and vicarious responses to pleasant and
   unpleasant affect induced via visuo-tactile stimulation. This revealed
   that empathy is subserved by distinct neural networks, with those
   regions recruited in the first-hand experience of positive or negative
   affective states also being specifically recruited when empathizing with
   these respective states in others. More specifically, the first-hand and
   vicarious experience of pleasant touch commonly recruited medial
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), while unpleasant touch was associated with
   shared activation in the right fronto-insular cortex. The observation
   that specifically tailored subsystems of the human brain are engaged to
   share positive versus negative touch of others brings fresh evidence to
   one of the major goals of the social neuroscience of empathy: to
   identify which specific aspects of the affective states of others are
   shared, and what role this plays in enabling the understanding of the
   emotions of others. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CORTEX}},

Volume = {{70}},
Pages = {{90-100}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Studies on the neural bases of action perception have largely focused on
   the perception of individual actions. Little is known about perception
   of joint actions where two or more individuals coordinate their actions
   based on a shared intention. In this fMRI study we asked whether
   observing situations where two individuals act on a shared intention
   elicits a different neural response than observing situations where
   individuals act on their independent parallel intentions. We compared
   the neural response to perceptually identical yet intentionally
   ambiguous actions observed in varying contexts. A dialog between two
   individuals conveyed either a shared intention or two independent
   parallel intentions. The dialogs were followed by an identical video
   clip where the two individuals performed certain actions. In one task
   condition participants tracked the intentions of the actors, in the
   other, they monitored moving colored dots placed on the same videos. We
   found that in the intention task versus the color task, observing joint
   actions based on shared intentions activated the temporal poles,
   precuneus, and the ventral striatum compared to observing interactions
   based on parallel intentions. Precuneus and the temporal poles are
   thought to support mental state reasoning, the latter with a more
   specific role in retrieving memories associated with social scripts.
   Activation in the ventral striatum, an area involved in reward
   processing, likely indicates a hedonistic response to observed shared
   intentional relations similarly to those experienced when personally
   sharing mental states with others. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Humans sometimes share with others whom they may never meet or know, in
   violation of the dictates of pure self-interest. Research has not
   established which neuropsychological mechanisms support lending
   decisions, nor whether their influence extends to markets involving
   significant financial incentives. In two studies, we found that neural
   affective mechanisms influence the success of requests for microloans.
   In a large Internet database of microloan requests (N = 13,500), we
   found that positive affective features of photographs promoted the
   success of those requests. We then established that neural activity
   (i.e., in the nucleus accumbens) and self-reported positive arousal in a
   neuroimaging sample (N = 28) predicted the success of loan requests on
   the Internet, above and beyond the effects of the neuroimaging sample's
   own choices (i.e., to lend or not). These findings suggest that
   elicitation of positive arousal can promote the success of loan
   requests, both in the laboratory and on the Internet. They also
   highlight affective neuroscience's potential to probe neuropsychological
   mechanisms that drive microlending, enhance the effectiveness of loan
   requests, and forecast market-level behavior.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundProcesses of phasic fear responses to threatening stimuli are
   thought to be distinct from sustained, anticipatory anxiety toward an
   unpredicted, potential threat. There is evidence for dissociable neural
   correlates of phasic fear and sustained anxiety. Whereas increased
   amygdala activity has been associated with phasic fear, sustained
   anxiety has been linked with activation of the bed nucleus of stria
   terminalis (BNST), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the insula. So
   far, only a few studies have focused on the dissociation of neural
   processes related to both phasic and sustained fear in specific phobia.
   We suggested that first, conditions of phasic and sustained fear would
   involve different neural networks and, second, that overall neural
   activity would be enhanced in a sample of phobic compared to nonphobic
   participants.
   MethodsPictures of spiders and neutral stimuli under conditions of
   either predicted (phasic) or unpredicted (sustained) fear were presented
   to 28 subjects with spider phobia and 28 nonphobic control subjects
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning.
   ResultsPhobic patients revealed significantly higher amygdala activation
   than controls under conditions of phasic fear. Sustained fear processing
   was significantly related to activation in the insula and ACC, and
   phobic patients showed a stronger activation than controls of the BNST
   and the right ACC under conditions of sustained fear. Functional
   connectivity analysis revealed enhanced connectivity of the BNST and the
   amygdala in phobic subjects.
   ConclusionsOur findings support the idea of distinct neural correlates
   of phasic and sustained fear processes. Increased neural activity and
   functional connectivity in these networks might be crucial for the
   development and maintenance of anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Intranasal oxytocin (OT) can modulate social-emotional functioning and
   related brain activity in humans. Consequently, OT has been discussed as
   a potential treatment for psychiatric disorders involving social
   behavioral deficits. However, OT effects are often heterogeneous across
   individuals. Here we explore individual differences in OT effects on the
   neural response to social cooperation as a function of the rs53576
   polymorphism of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). Previously, we
   conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which healthy men
   and women were randomized to treatment with intranasal OT or placebo.
   Afterwards, they were imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging
   while playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with same-sex
   partners. Within the left ventral caudate nucleus, intranasal OT
   treatment increased activation to reciprocated cooperation in men, but
   tended to decrease activation in women. Here, we show that these sex
   differences in OT effects are specific to individuals with the rs53576
   GG genotype, and are not found for other genotypes (rs53576 AA/AG).
   Thus, OT may increase the reward or salience of positive social
   interactions for male GG homozygotes, while decreasing those processes
   for female GG homozygotes. These results suggest that rs53576 genotype
   is an important variable to consider in future investigations of the
   clinical efficacy of intranasal OT treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Humans display individual variability in cooperative behavior. While an
   ever-growing body of research has investigated the neural correlates of
   task-specific cooperation, the mechanisms by which
   situation-independent, stable differences in cooperation render behavior
   consistent across a wide range of situations remain elusive. Addressing
   this issue, we show that the individual tendency to behave in a
   prosocial or individualistic manner can be predicted from the functional
   resting-state connectome. More specifically, connections of the
   cinguloopercular network which supports goal-directed behavior encode
   cooperative tendency. Effects of virtual lesions to this network on the
   efficacy of information exchange throughout the brain corroborate our
   findings. These results shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying
   individualists' and prosocials' habitual social decisions by showing
   that reliance on the cinguloopercular task-control network predicts
   stable cooperative behavior. Based on this evidence, we provide a
   unifying framework for the interpretation of functional imaging and
   behavioral studies of cooperative behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Abnormal Resting-State Connectivity at Functional MRI in Women with
   Premenstrual Syndrome}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a series of cycling and relapsing
   physical, emotion and behavior syndromes that occur in the luteal phase
   and resolve soon after the onset of menses. Although PMS is widely
   recognized, its neural mechanism is still unclear.
   Design
   To address this question, we measured brain activity for women with PMS
   and women without PMS (control group) using resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). In addition, the participants
   should complete the emotion scales (Beck Anxiety Inventory, BAI; Beck
   Depression Inventory, BDI, before the scanning) as well as the stress
   perception scale (Visual analog scale for stress, VAS, before and after
   the scanning).
   Results
   The results showed that compared with the control group, the PMS group
   had decreased connectivity in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and
   theparahippocampalgyrus (PHG), as well as increased connectivity in the
   left medial/superior temporal gyri (MTG/STG) and pre-centralgyrus within
   the default mode network (DMN); in addition, the PMS group had higher
   anxiety and depression scale scores, together with lower stress
   perception scores. Finally, there were significantly positive
   correlations between the stress perception scores and functional
   connectivity in the MFG and cuneus. The BDI scores in the PMS group were
   correlated negatively with the functional connectivity in the MFG and
   precuneus and correlated positively with the functional connectivity in
   the MTG.
   Conclusion
   These findings suggest that compared with normal women, women with PMS
   displayed abnormal stress sensitivity, which was reflected in the
   decreased and increased functional connectivity within the DMN, blunted
   stress perception and higher depression.}},

Title = {{Making Large-Scale Networks from fMRI Data}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Pairwise correlations are currently a popular way to estimate a
   large-scale network (> 1000 nodes) from functional magnetic resonance
   imaging data. However, this approach generally results in a poor
   representation of the true underlying network. The reason is that
   pairwise correlations cannot distinguish between direct and indirect
   connectivity. As a result, pairwise correlation networks can lead to
   fallacious conclusions; for example, one may conclude that a network is
   a small-world when it is not. In a simulation study and an application
   to resting-state fMRI data, we compare the performance of pairwise
   correlations in large-scale networks (2000 nodes) against three other
   methods that are designed to filter out indirect connections. Recovery
   methods are evaluated in four simulated network topologies (small world
   or not, scale-free or not) in scenarios where the number of observations
   is very small compared to the number of nodes. Simulations clearly show
   that pairwise correlation networks are fragmented into separate
   unconnected components with excessive connectedness within components.
   This often leads to erroneous estimates of network metrics, like
   small-world structures or low betweenness centrality, and produces too
   many low-degree nodes. We conclude that using partial correlations,
   informed by a sparseness penalty, results in more accurate networks and
   corresponding metrics than pairwise correlation networks. However, even
   with these methods, the presence of hubs in the generating network can
   be problematic if the number of observations is too small. Additionally,
   we show for resting-state fMRI that partial correlations are more robust
   than correlations to different parcellation sets and to different
   lengths of time-series.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Trust is multi-dimensional because it can be characterized by subjective
   trust, trust antecedent, and behavioral trust. Previous research has
   investigated functional brain responses to subjective trust (e.g., a
   judgment of trustworthiness) or behavioral trust (e.g., decisions to
   trust) in perfect information, where all relevant information is
   available to all participants. In contrast, we conducted a novel
   examination of the patterns of functional brain activity to a trust
   antecedent, specifically truth telling, in asymmetric information, where
   one individual has more information than others, with the effect of
   varying risk propensity. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and recruited 13 adults, who played the Communication Game, where
   they served as the ``Sender{''} and chose either truth telling (true
   advice) or lie telling (false advice) regarding the best payment
   allocation for their partner. Our behavioral results revealed that
   subjects with recreational high risk tended to choose true advice.
   Moreover, fMRI results yielded that the choices of true advice were
   associated with increased cortical activation in the anterior rostral
   medial and frontopolar prefrontal cortices, middle frontal cortex,
   temporoparietal junction, and precuneus. Furthermore, when we
   specifically evaluated a role of the bilateral amygdala as the region of
   interest (ROI), decreased amygdala response was associated with high
   risk propensity, regardless of truth telling or lying. In conclusion,
   our results have implications for how differential functions of the
   cortical areas may contribute to the neural processing of truth telling.}},

Abstract = {{Orientation is a fundamental mental function that processes the
   relations between the behaving self to space (places), time (events),
   and person (people). Behavioral and neuroimaging studies have hinted at
   interrelations between processing of these three domains. To unravel the
   neurocognitive basis of orientation, we used high-resolution 7T
   functional MRI as 16 subjects compared their subjective distance to
   different places, events, or people. Analysis at the individual-subject
   level revealed cortical activation related to orientation in space,
   time, and person in a precisely localized set of structures in the
   precuneus, inferior parietal, and medial frontal cortex. Comparison of
   orientation domains revealed a consistent order of cortical activity
   inside the precuneus and inferior parietal lobes, with space orientation
   activating posterior regions, followed anteriorly by person and then
   time. Core regions at the precuneus and inferior parietal lobe were
   activated for multiple orientation domains, suggesting also common
   processing for orientation across domains. The medial prefrontal cortex
   showed a posterior activation for time and anterior for person. Finally,
   the default-mode network, identified in a separate resting-state scan,
   was active for all orientation domains and overlapped mostly with
   person-orientation regions. These findings suggest that mental
   orientation in space, time, and person is managed by a specific brain
   system with a highly ordered internal organization, closely related to
   the default-mode network.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental evidence of contagious yawning has only been documented in
   four mammalian species. Here, we report the results from two separate
   experimental studies designed to investigate the presence of contagious
   yawning in a social parrot, the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). In
   Study 1, birds were paired in adjacent cages with and without visual
   barriers, and the temporal association of yawning was assessed between
   visual conditions. In Study 2, the same birds were exposed to video
   stimuli of both conspecific yawns and control behavior, and yawning
   frequency was compared between conditions. Results from both studies
   demonstrate that yawning is contagious. To date, this is the first
   experimental evidence of contagious yawning in a non-mammalian species.
   We propose that future research could use budgerigars to explore
   questions related to basic forms of empathic processing.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purposeConverging research in patients with multiple
   sclerosis (MS) has shown increased rates of alexithymia and disturbances
   in social cognition, including empathy and theory of mind. Moral
   judgment is one of the most complex spheres of human cognition, relying
   on intricate neural circuits related to many other affective, social,
   cognitive and behavioral processes.
   MethodsRelapsing-remitting MS patients (n=38) and age-, gender- and
   education-matched controls (n=38) completed a measure of alexithymia
   (Toronto Alexithymia Scale), a measure of empathy (Interpersonal
   Reactivity Index) and a series of moral dilemmas, for which measures of
   moral permissibility, emotional reactivity and moral relativity (the
   perception of how one's moral attitudes compare to the attitudes of the
   rest of the people) were derived.
   ResultsRelative to controls, patients exhibited decreased levels of
   other-oriented empathy {[}empathic concern (P<0.01) and fantasy
   (P<0.01)], increased levels of self-oriented personal distress (P<0.01),
   as well as higher rates of alexithymia (P<0.001). Moral permissibility
   was significantly reduced in patients with MS (P=0.038), who also showed
   higher levels of emotional reactivity (P<0.01). Additionally, a
   significantly higher number of patients than controls considered that
   respondents would deliver similar judgments to the same moral scenarios
   (P<0.001).
   DiscussionUnderstanding such complex interactions between individual
   dispositions and moral cognition has the potential to contribute to the
   development of better assessment and intervention strategies for MS
   patients, enhancing quality of life by achieving better social
   participation.}},

Abstract = {{Although hippocampus unequivocally supports explicit/declarative memory,
   fewer findings have demonstrated its role in implicit expressions of
   memory. We tested for hippocampal contributions to an implicit
   expression of configural/relational memory for complex scenes using
   eye-movement tracking during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) scanning. Participants studied scenes and were later tested using
   scenes that resembled study scenes in their overall feature
   configuration but comprised different elements. These configurally
   similar scenes were used to limit explicit memory, and were intermixed
   with new scenes that did not resemble studied scenes. Scene
   configuration memory was expressed through eye movements reflecting
   exploration overlap (EO), which is the viewing of the same scene
   locations at both study and test. EO reliably discriminated similar
   study-test scene pairs from study-new scene pairs, was reliably greater
   for similarity-based recognition hits than for misses, and correlated
   with hippocampal fMRI activity. In contrast, subjects could not reliably
   discriminate similar from new scenes by overt judgments, although
   ratings of familiarity were slightly higher for similar than new scenes.
   Hippocampal fMRI correlates of this weak explicit memory were distinct
   from EO-related activity. These findings collectively suggest that EO
   was an implicit expression of scene configuration memory associated with
   hippocampal activity. Visual exploration can therefore reflect implicit
   hippocampal-related memory processing that can be observed in
   eye-movement behavior during naturalistic scene viewing. (c) 2015 Wiley

Title = {{Speech acquisition predicts regions of enhanced cortical response to

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{285-292}},

Abstract = {{A continuum of phenotypes makes up the autism spectrum (AS). In
   particular, individuals show large differences in language acquisition,
   ranging from precocious speech to severe speech onset delay. However,
   the neurological origin of this heterogeneity remains unknown. Here, we
   sought to determine whether AS individuals differing in speech
   acquisition show different cortical responses to auditory stimulation
   and morphometric brain differences. Whole-brain activity following
   exposure to non-social sounds was investigated. Individuals in the AS
   were classified according to the presence or absence of Speech Onset
   Delay (AS-SOD and AS-NoSOD, respectively) and were compared with
   IQ-matched typically developing individuals (TYP). AS-NoSOD participants
   displayed greater task-related activity than TYP in the inferior frontal
   gyrus and pen-auditory middle and superior temporal gyri, which are
   associated with language processing. Conversely, the AS-SOD group only
   showed enhanced activity in the vicinity of the auditory cortex. We
   detected no differences in brain structure between groups. This is the
   first study to demonstrate the existence of differences in functional
   brain activity between AS individuals divided according to their pattern
   of speech development. These findings support the
   Trigger-threshold-target model and indicate that the occurrence of
   speech onset delay in AS individuals depends on the location of cortical
   functional reallocation, which favors perception in AS-SOD and language
   in AS-NoSOD. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Abstract = {{Variations of the A mu-opioid receptor gene OPRM1 have been shown to
   modulate pain perception with some evidence pointing towards a
   modulation of not only physical but also ``psychological pain{''}. In
   line with suggestions of a common neural network involved in the
   processing of physical pain and negative and distressing stimuli, like
   social rejection as a psychologically harmful event, we examined the
   influence of the A118G polymorphism on the neural processing of physical
   and non-physical pain. Using fMRI, we investigated a sample of 23
   females with the more frequent AA genotype, and eight females with the
   relatively rare but more pain-sensitive AG genotype during electrical
   stimulation to the dorsum of the non-dominant hand. Non-physical pain
   was investigated using Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game, to induce
   experiences of non-self-dependent social rejection. A Go/NoGo task with
   an increased risk of self-dependent erroneous performance was used as a
   control task to investigate the effects of negative feedback as a more
   cognitive form of distress. Relative to A118G homozygous A-allele
   carriers, G-allele carriers showed significantly increased activation of
   the supplementary motor area/superior frontal gyrus and the precentral
   gyrus during electrical stimulation. Increased activation of the
   secondary sensorimotor cortex (SII) was found during social exclusion
   and during negative feedback. We demonstrate that brain regions
   particularly related to the somatosensory component of pain processing
   are modulated by variations in OPRM1. Influences were evident for both
   physical and psychological pain processing supporting the assumption of
   shared neural pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) has been suggested as a prognostic
   biomarker for neuronal alterations resulting from conditions such as
   traumatic brain injury (TBI), neurodegenerative disease, or cardiac
   arrest. To validate serum NSE (sNSE) as a brain-specific biomarker, we
   related it to functional brain imaging data in 38 healthy adults to
   create a physiological framework for future studies in neuropsychiatric
   diseases. sNSE was measured by monoclonal two-site immunoluminometric
   assays, and functional connectivity was investigated with resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI). To identify neural hubs
   most essentially related to sNSE, we applied graph theory approaches,
   namely, the new data-driven and parameter-free approach, eigenvector
   centrality mapping. sNSE and eigenvector centrality were negatively
   correlated in the female cerebellum, without any effects in male
   subjects. In cerebellar cortex, NSE expression was significantly higher
   than whole-brain expression as investigated in the whole brain and whole
   genome-wide atlas of the Allen Institute for Brain Sciences (Seattle,
   WA). Our study shows a specific linkage between the neuronal marker
   protein, sNSE, and cerebellar connectivity as measured with rfMRI in the
   female human brain, although this finding shall be proven in future
   studies including more subjects. Results suggest that the inclusion of
   sNSE in the analysis of imaging data is a useful approach to obtain
   more-specific information on the neuronal mechanisms that underlie
   functional connectivity at rest. Establishing such a baseline
   resting-state pattern that is tied to a neuronal serum marker opens new
   perspectives in the characterization of neuropsychiatric disorders as
   disconnective syndromes or nexopathies, in particular, resulting from
   TBI, neurodegenerative disease, or cardiac arrest, in the future.}},

   associated to earlier peak of the duration-MMN (r=-.63). In contrast,
   the amplitude of the duration-MMN was not related to Glx. There was no

Abstract = {{Objective: The network hubs, characterized by the large number of
   connections to other regions, play important roles in the proper and
   effective transfer of information. Previous functional neuroimaging
   studies have demonstrated that patients with social anxiety disorder
   (SAD) have aberrant functional connectivity. The changing pattern in
   functional network hubs in SAD, however, remains incompletely
   understood.
   Methods: Twenty SAD patients and 20 matched healthy controls were
   recruited. Resting-state fMRI data were obtained using a
   gradient-recalled echo-planar imaging sequence. Whole-brain voxel-wise
   functional networks were constructed by measuring the temporal
   correlations of each pair of brain voxels and then hubs were identified
   by using the graph theory method. Specifically, a functional
   connectivity strength (FCS) map was computed in each subject and the
   regions with higher FCS value were considered as functional network
   hubs.
   Results: Compared with healthy controls, SAD patients showed
   significantly decreased FCS in the bilateral precuneus and significantly
   increased FCS in the right fusiform gyrus. Furthermore, a significantly
   negative correlation was observed between the FCS value in the precuneus
   and the illness duration.
   Conclusion: The present study demonstrated for the first time that
   disrupted cortical hubs existed in patients with SAD during resting
   state.
   Significance: These findings may provide novel insight into
   understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying SAD. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Unfair treatment may evoke more negative emotions in individuals scoring
   higher on neuroticism, thereby possibly impacting their decision-making
   in these situations. To investigate the neural basis of social
   decision-making in these individuals, we examined interpersonal
   reactions to unfairness in the Ultimatum Game (UG). We measured brain
   activation with fMRI in 120 participants selected based on their
   neuroticism score, while they made decisions to accept or reject
   proposals that were either fair or unfair. The anterior insula and
   anterior cingulate cortex were more activated during the processing of
   unfair offers, consistent with prior UG studies. Furthermore, we found
   more activation in parietal and temporal regions for the two most common
   decisions (fair accept and unfair reject), involving areas related to
   perceptual decision-making. Conversely, during the decision to accept
   unfair offers, individuals recruited more frontal regions previously
   associated with decision-making and the implementation of reappraisal in
   the UG. High compared to low neurotic individuals did not show
   differential activation patterns during the proposal of unfair offers;
   however, they did show lower activation in the right dorsal striatum
   (putamen) during the acceptance of unfair offers. This brain region has
   been involved in the formation of stimulus-action-reward associations
   and motivation/arousal. In conclusion, the findings suggest that both
   high and low neurotic individuals recruit brain regions signaling social
   norm violations in response to unfair offers. However, when it comes to
   decision-making, it seems that neural circuitry related to reward and
   motivation is altered in individuals scoring higher on neuroticism, when
   accepting an unfair offer.}},

Abstract = {{Disrupted empathic processing is a core feature of psychopathy.
   Neuroimaging data have suggested that individuals with high levels of
   psychopathic traits show atypical responses to others' pain in a network
   of brain regions typically recruited during empathic processing
   (anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and mid- and anterior
   cingulate cortex). Here, we investigated whether neural responses to
   others' pain vary with psychopathic traits within the general population
   in a similar manner to that found in individuals at the extreme end of
   the continuum. As predicted, variation in psychopathic traits was
   associated with variation in neural responses to others' pain in the
   network of brain regions typically engaged during empathic processing.
   Consistent with previous research, our findings indicated the presence
   of suppressor effects in the association of levels of the
   affective-interpersonal and lifestyle-antisocial dimensions of
   psychopathy with neural responses to others' pain. That is, after
   controlling for the influence of the other dimension, higher
   affective-interpersonal psychopathic traits were associated with reduced
   neural responses to others' pain, whilst higher lifestyle-antisocial
   psychopathic traits were associated with increased neural responses to
   others' pain. Our findings provide further evidence that atypical
   function in this network might represent neural markers of disrupted
   emotional and empathic processing; that the two dimensions of
   psychopathy might tap into distinct underlying vulnerabilities; and,
   most importantly, that the relationships observed at the extreme end of
   the psychopathy spectrum apply to the nonclinical distribution of these
   traits, providing further evidence for continuities in the mechanisms
   underlying psychopathic traits across the general population.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important social identities that children learn to
   define themselves and others by is sex, becoming a salient social
   category by early childhood. Although older children begin to show
   greater flexibility in their gendered behaviors and attitudes, gender
   rigidity intensifies again around the time of puberty. In the current
   study, we assessed behavioral and neural biases to sex across a wide age
   group. Ninety-three youth (ages 7-17 years) provided behavioral rating
   of same-and opposite-sex attitudes, and 52 youth (ages 4-18 years)
   under-went an fMRI scan as they matched the emotion of same-and
   opposite-sex faces. We demonstrate significant age-related behavioral
   biases of sex that are mediated by differential amygdala response to
   opposite-sex relative to same-sex faces in children, an effect that
   completely attenuates by the teenage years. Moreover, we find a second
   peak in amygdala sensitivity to opposite-sex faces around the time of
   puberty. Thus, the amygdala codes for developmentally dependent and
   motivationally relevant social identification across development.}},

Abstract = {{Working memory develops slowly: Even by age 8, children are able to
   maintain only half the number of items that adults can remember. Neural
   substrates that support performance on working memory tasks also have a
   slow developmental trajectory and typically activate to a lesser extent
   in children, relative to adults. Little is known about why younger
   participants elicit less neural activation. This may be due to
   maturational differences, differences in behavioral performance, or
   both. Here we investigate the neural correlates of working memory
   capacity in children (ages 5-8) and adults using a visual working memory
   task with parametrically increasing loads (from one to four items) using
   fMRI. This task allowed us to estimate working memory capacity limit for
   each group. We found that both age groups increased the activation of
   frontoparietal networks with increasing working memory loads, until
   working memory capacity was reached. Because children's working memory
   capacity limit was half of that for adults, the plateau occurred at
   lower loads for children. Had a parametric increase in load not been
   used, this would have given an impression of less activation overall and
   less load-dependent activation for children relative to adults. Our
   findings suggest that young children and adults recruit similar
   frontoparietal networks at working memory loads that do not exceed
   capacity and highlight the need to consider behavioral performance
   differences when interpreting developmental differences in neural
   activation.}},

   altered connectivity in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was especially found to be of interest in the
   resting state functional connectivity analysis. Recently, more attention
   has turned to the internal functional connectivity within the DMN.
   However, the internal connection patterns within the DMN remain unclear
   at the initial onset of MDD.
   Methods: Resting-state fMRI was performed on 38 first-episode,
   treatment-naive MDD patients along with 38 matched healthy controls.
   Seed-based analysis was used to define the DMN and then a
   region-to-region connectivity analysis was performed to inspect the
   functional connectivity within the DMN. Spearman's rank correlation
   analysis was performed between significantly abnormal connectivities in
   MDD patients and clinical measurements.
   Results: Decreased region-to-region connectivities within DMN were found
   between the PCC and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), between PCC
   and the right inferior parietal gyrus/angular, as well as between the
   left thalamus and cerebellar tonsil. No significant increase in
   connectivity was found. Moreover, functional connectivity between the
   left thalamus and cerebellar tonsil revealed a marginal significant
   negative correlation with clinical Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
   (HDRS) scores. Limitations: Noteworthiness in morbidity, a high risk of
   mortality, and a high rate of medical service utilization of MDD make
   the current results uncertain to apply to the more complicated
   situations.
   Conclusions: Each region within DMN may have a specific, individual
   functional role. The reason to identify the pathological mechanism of
   MDD may not lie in the abnormal DMN functional connectivity, but rather
   in the abnormal functional connectivity within DMN. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Many previous behavioral inhibition studies have employed the classic
   Stroop and reverse-Stroop paradigm. Although an experimental
   dissociation has been demonstrated between Stroop interference (SI) and
   reverse-Stroop interference (RI), the mechanisms that underlie these
   phenomena remain unclear. In this study, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the functional mechanisms of SI and
   RI. We identified the brain regions activated by the Stroop word-color
   matching task using four tests: the Stroop control test (Test 1), Stroop
   test (Test 2), reverse-Stroop control test (Test 3), and reverse-Stroop
   test (Test 4). Neuroimaging results revealed that SI elicited activation
   in the bilateral middle frontal gyrus (BA9). In contrast, a number of
   other regions, including the bilateral middle frontal gyrus (BA 9 and
   BA10), medial frontal gyrus (BA 8), and cingulate gyrus (BA6 and BA 32)
   exhibited significant activation during RI. Our results indicate that
   there is a dissociation between the types of interference and brain
   activation. These findings suggest that SI and RI interference can be
   attributable to different neural mechanisms. It also suggests that the
   prefrontal cortex and the cingulate cortex are differentially sensitive
   to various types of interference, and that the reverse-Stroop task may
   be more useful than the Stroop task for evaluating interference control
   in psychiatric patients with frontal dysfunction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Panic disorder has been associated with dysfunctional neuropsychological
   dimensions, including anxiety sensitivity. Brain-imaging studies of the
   neural correlates of emotional processing have identified a network of
   structures that constitute the neural circuitry for emotions. The
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and
   insula, which are part of this network, are also involved in the
   processing of threat-related stimuli. The aim of the study was to
   investigate if neural activity in response to emotional stimuli in the
   cortico-limbic network is associated to anxiety sensitivity in panic
   disorder. In a sample of 18 outpatients with panic disorder, we studied
   neural correlates of implicit emotional processing of facial affect
   expressions with a face-matching paradigm; correlational analyses were
   performed between brain activations and anxiety sensitivity. The
   correlational analyses performed showed a positive correlation between
   anxiety sensitivity and brain activity during emotional processing in
   regions encompassing the PFC. ACC and insula. Our data seem to confirm
   that anxiety sensitivity is an important component of panic disorder.
   Accordingly, the neural underpinnings of anxiety sensitivity could be an
   interesting focus for treatment and further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The ability to recognize, understand and interpret other's actions and
   emotions has been linked to the mirror system or
   action-observation-network (AON). Although variations in these abilities
   are prevalent in the neuro-typical population, persons diagnosed with
   autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have deficits in the social domain and
   exhibit alterations in this neural network.
   Method
   Here, we examined functional network properties of the AON using graph
   theory measures and region-to-region functional connectivity analyses of
   resting-state fMRI-data from adolescents and young adults with ASD and
   typical controls (TC).
   Results
   Overall, our graph theory analyses provided convergent evidence that the
   network integrity of the AON is altered in ASD, and that reductions in
   network efficiency relate to reductions in overall network density
   (i.e., decreased overall connection strength). Compared to TC,
   individuals with ASD showed significant reductions in network efficiency
   and increased shortest path lengths and centrality. Importantly, when
   adjusting for overall differences in network density between ASD and TC
   groups, participants with ASD continued to display reductions in network
   integrity, suggesting that also network-level organizational properties
   of the AON are altered in ASD.
   Conclusion
   While differences in empirical connectivity contributed to reductions in
   network integrity, graph theoretical analyses provided indications that
   also changes in the high-level network organization reduced integrity of
   the AON.}},

   functional connectivity maps}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{A posteriori model validation for the temporal order of neural directed
   functional connectivity maps is rare. This is striking because models
   that require sequential independence among residuals are regularly
   implemented. The aim of the current study was (a) to apply to directed
   functional connectivity maps of functional magnetic resonance imaging
   data an a posteriori model validation procedure (i.e., white noise tests
   of one-step-ahead prediction errors combined with decision criteria for
   revising the maps based upon Lagrange Multiplier tests), and (b) to
   demonstrate how the procedure applies to single-subject simulated,
   single-subject task-related, and multi-subject resting state data.
   Directed functional connectivity was determined by the unified
   structural equation model family of approaches in order to map
   contemporaneous and first order lagged connections among brain regions
   at the group- and individual-levels while incorporating external input,
   then white noise tests were run. Findings revealed that the validation
   procedure successfully detected unmodeled sequential dependencies among
   residuals and recovered higher order (greater than one) simulated
   connections, and that the procedure can accommodate task-related input.
   Findings also revealed that lags greater than one were present in
   resting state data: With a group-level network that contained only
   contemporaneous and first order connections, 44\% of subjects required
   second order, individual-level connections in order to obtain maps with
   white noise residuals. Results have broad methodological relevance
   (e.g., temporal validation is necessary after directed functional
   connectivity analyses because the presence of unmodeled higher order
   sequential dependencies may bias parameter estimates) and substantive
   implications (e.g., higher order lags may be common in resting state
   data).}},

Abstract = {{Although the Internet is an important tool in our daily life, the

   study set out with the aim of assessing the cognitive control of
   affective events in Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and has examined the
   influence of IGD on neural activities with regard to swear words in
   young adolescents. We demonstrated the differences between adolescents
   with IGD and healthy control adolescents (HC) with respect to swear,
   negative and neutral word conditions. Swear words induced more
   activation in regions related to social interaction and emotional
   processing such as the superior temporal sulcus, right temporoparietal
   junction and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) when compared with negative
   words. In this study, adolescents with IGD exhibited reduced activation
   in the right OFC related to cognitive control and in the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) related to social rejection during the swear
   word condition. In addition, adolescents with IGD were negatively
   correlated with activity in the right amygdala toward swear words,
   indicating the important role of the amygdala in the control of
   aggression in adolescents with IGD. These findings enhance our
   understanding of social-emotional perception in adolescents with IGD.}},

Title = {{Do intuitive and deliberate judgments rely on two distinct neural
   systems? A case study in face processing}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Arguably the most influential models of human decision-making today are
   based on the assumption that two separable systems intuition and
   deliberation underlie the judgments that people make. Our recent work is
   among the first to present neural evidence contrary to the predictions
   of these dual-systems accounts. We measured brain activations using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants were
   specifically instructed to either intuitively or deliberately judge the
   authenticity of emotional facial expressions. Results from three
   different analyses revealed both common brain networks of activation
   across decision mode and differential activations as a function of
   strategy adherence. We take our results to contradict popular
   dual-systems accounts that propose a clear-cut dichotomy of the

Abstract = {{Background: The symptoms and pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD)
   are complicated and an accurate diagnosis of PD is difficult,
   particularly in early-stage. Because functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) is non-invasive and is characterized by the integration
   of different brain areas in terms of functional connectivity (FC), fMRI
   has been widely used in PD research. Non-motor symptom (NMS) features
   are also frequently present in PD before the onset of classical motor
   symptoms with pain as the primary NMS. Considering that PD could affect
   the pain process at multiple levels, we hypothesized that pain is one of
   the earliest symptoms in PD and investigated whether FC of the pain
   network was disrupted in PD without pain. To better understand the
   pathogenesis of pain in PD, we combined resting state and
   pain-stimuli-induced task state fMRI to identify alterations in FC
   related to pain in PD.
   Methods: Fourteen early drug-naive PD without pain and 17 age- and
   sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated in our testing task. We
   used independent component analysis to select seven functional networks
   related to PD and pain. We focused on abnormalities in FC and in
   functional network connectivity (FNC) in PD compared with HC during the
   task (51 degrees C heat pain stimuli) and at rest.
   Results: Compared with HC, PD showed decreased FC in putamen within
   basal ganglia network (BGN) in task state and decreased FC in putamen of
   salience network (SN) and mid-cingulate cortex of sensorimotor network
   in rest state. FNC between the BGN and the SN are reduced during both
   states in PD compared with HC. In addition, right frontoparietal network
   (RFPN), which is considered as a bridge between the SN and default-mode
   network, was significantly disturbed during the task.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that BGN plays a role in the
   pathological mechanisms of pain underlying PD, and RFPN likely
   contributes greatly to harmonization between intrinsic brain activity
   and external stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Men, like the male of many animal species, use gifts to build
   satisfactory relationships with a desired woman. From the woman's
   perspective, all gifts are not always equally rewarding; the reward
   value of a gift depends on two factors: (1) the giver and (2) the type
   of the gift (the gift's social meaning). In this study, we investigated
   how these two factors interactively determine the reward value of a
   gift. Specifically, we examined how the neural processing for
   understanding a gift's social meaning is modulated by preferences for
   the giver. We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study in which a female participant was asked to judge a gift from a
   male she was acquainted with in real life. We examined the interactive
   effects between (1) the female participant's attitude toward the male
   acquaintance (liked vs. uninteresting) and (2) the type of the gift
   (romantic {[}e.g., bouquet, earrings, and perfumes] vs. non-romantic
   {[}e.g., pencils, memo pad, and moneybox]). We found that preference for
   an acquaintance selectively modulated activity in the anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC) in response to romantic gifts, compared to non-romantic
   gifts. In contrast, if the woman was indifferent toward an acquaintance,
   no activity modulation was observed in this area for the same gifts. In
   addition, the ACC showed functional connectivity with the supplementary
   motor area/dorsal ACC (SMA/dACC), an area within the dorsal mediofrontal
   cortex, suggesting that it integrates action monitoring and emotional
   and cognitive processing in decision-making. These results suggest that
   attitude toward an opposite sex member has a modulatory role in
   recognizing the social meaning of material goods-preference for the
   member is a powerful modulator of social reward processing.}},

Title = {{Is the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Necessary for Theory of Mind?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Successful social interaction relies on the ability to attribute mental
   states to other people. Previous functional neuroimaging studies have
   shown that this process, described as Theory of Mind (ToM) or
   mentalization, is reliably associated with activation of the medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, this study presents a novel and
   surprising finding that provides new insight into the role of the mPFC
   in mentalization tasks.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Twenty healthy individuals were recruited from a wide range of ages and
   social backgrounds. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) while viewing a well-established ToM visual paradigm
   involving moving triangles. Functional MRI data were analyzed using a
   classical general linear model. No activation was detected in the medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during movement patterns that typically elicit
   ToM. However, increased activity was observed in the right middle
   occipital gyrus, right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), left middle
   occipital gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus. No correlation was
   found between participants' age and BOLD response.
   Conclusions/Significance
   In contrast with previous neuroimaging research, our findings support
   the notion that mPFC function is not critical for reasoning about the
   mental states of others; furthermore, our data indicate that the right
   TPJ and right inferior frontal gyrus are able to perform mentalization
   without any contributions from the mPFC.}},

Title = {{Body language in the brain: constructing meaning from expressive
   movement}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{This fMRI study investigated neural systems that interpret body language
   the meaningful emotive expressions conveyed by body movement.
   Participants watched videos of performers engaged in modern dance or
   pantomime that conveyed specific themes such as hope, agony, lust, or
   exhaustion. We tested whether the meaning of an effectively laden
   performance was decoded in localized brain substrates as a distinct
   property of action separable from other superficial features, such as
   choreography, kinematics, performer, and low-level visual stimuli. A
   repetition suppression (RS) procedure was used to identify brain regions
   that decoded the meaningful affective state of a performer, as evidenced
   by decreased activity when emotive themes were repeated in successive
   performances. Because the theme was the only feature repeated across
   video clips that were otherwise entirely different, the occurrence of RS
   identified brain substrates that differentially coded the specific
   meaning of expressive performances. RS was observed bilaterally,
   extending anteriorly along middle and superior temporal gyri into
   temporal pole, medially into insula, rostrally into inferior
   orbitofrontal cortex, and caudally into hippocampus and amygdale.
   Behavioral data on a separate task indicated that interpreting themes
   from modern dance was more difficult than interpreting pantomime; a
   result that was also reflected in the fMRI data. There was greater RS in
   left hemisphere, suggesting that the more abstract metaphors used to
   express themes in dance compared to pantomime posed a greater challenge
   to brain substrates directly involved in decoding those themes. We
   propose that the meaning-sensitive temporal-orbitofrontal regions
   observed here comprise a superordinate functional module of a known
   hierarchical action observation network (AON), which is critical to the
   construction of meaning from expressive movement. The findings are
   discussed with respect to a predictive coding model of action
   understanding.}},

Title = {{Brief learning induces a memory bias for arousing-negative words: an
   fMRI study in high and low trait anxious persons}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 21}},
Abstract = {{Persons suffering from anxiety disorders display facilitated processing
   of arousing and negative stimuli, such as negative words. This memory
   bias is reflected in better recall and increased amygdala activity in
   response to such stimuli. However, individual learning histories were
   not considered in most studies, a concern that we meet here. Thirty-four
   female persons (half with high-, half with low trait anxiety)
   participated in a criterion-based associative word-learning paradigm, in
   which neutral pseudowords were paired with aversive or neutral pictures,
   which should lead to a valence change for the negatively paired
   pseudowords. After learning, pseudowords were tested with fMRI to
   investigate differential brain activation of the amygdala evoked by the
   newly acquired valence. Explicit and implicit memory was assessed
   directly after training and in three follow-ups at 4-day intervals. The
   behavioral results demonstrate that associative word-learning leads to
   an explicit (but no implicit) memory bias for negatively linked
   pseudowords, relative to neutral ones, which confirms earlier studies.
   Bilateral amygdala activation underlines the behavioral effect: Higher
   trait anxiety is correlated with stronger amygdala activation for
   negatively linked pseudowords than for neutrally linked ones. Most
   interestingly, this effect is also present for negatively paired
   pseudowords that participants could not remember well. Moreover,
   neutrally paired pseudowords evoked higher amygdala reactivity than
   completely novel ones in highly anxious persons, which can be taken as
   evidence for generalization. These findings demonstrate that few
   wordlearning trials generate a memory bias for emotional stimuli,
   indexed both behaviorally and neurophysiologically. Importantly, the
   typical memory bias for emotional stimuli and the generalization to
   neutral ones is larger in high anxious persons.}},

Abstract = {{Face perception models propose that different facial attributes are
   processed by anatomically distinct neural pathways that partially
   overlap. Whether these attributes interact functionally is an open
   question. Our goal was to determine if there are interactions between
   age and ethnicity processing and, if so, at what temporal epoch these
   interactions are evident. We monitored event-related potentials on
   electroencephalography while subjects categorized faces by age or
   ethnicity in two conditions: a baseline in which the other of these two
   properties not being categorized was held constant and an interference
   condition in which it also varied, as modelled after the Garner
   interference paradigm. We found that, when participants were
   categorizing faces by age, variations in ethnicity increased the
   amplitude of the right face-selective N170 component. When subjects were
   categorizing faces by ethnicity, variations in age did not alter the
   N170. We concluded that there is an asymmetric pattern of influence
   between age and ethnicity on early face-specific stages of visual
   processing, which has parallels with behavioural evidence of asymmetric
   interactions between identity and expression processing of faces.}},

Abstract = {{Vitality form is a term that describes the style with which motor
   actions are performed (e.g., rude, gentle, etc.). They represent one
   characterizing element of conscious and unconscious bodily
   communication. Despite their importance in interpersonal behavior,
   vitality forms have been, until now, virtually neglected in
   neuroscience. Here, using the functional MRI (fMRI) technique, we
   investigated the neural correlates of vitality forms in three different
   tasks: action observation, imagination, and execution. Conjunction
   analysis showed that, in all three tasks, there is a common, consistent
   activation of the dorsocentral sector of the insula. In addition, a
   common activation of the parietofrontal network, typically active during
   arm movements production, planning, and observation, was also found. We
   conclude that the dorsocentral part of the insula is a key element of
   the system that modulates the cortical motor activity, allowing
   individuals to express their internal states through action vitality
   forms. Recent monkey anatomical data show that the dorsocentral sector
   of the insula is, indeed, connected with the cortical circuit involved
   in the control of arm movements.}},

Title = {{Variation in the Williams syndrome GTF2I gene and anxiety proneness
   interactively affect prefrontal cortical response to aversive stimuli}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},

Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 18}},
Abstract = {{Characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying the heritability of
   complex behavioral traits such as human anxiety remains a challenging
   endeavor for behavioral neuroscience. Copy-number variation (CNV) in the
   general transcription factor gene, GTF2I, located in the 7q11.23
   chromosomal region that is hemideleted in Williams syndrome and
   duplicated in the 7q11.23 duplication syndrome (Dup7), is associated
   with gene-dose-dependent anxiety in mouse models and in both Williams
   syndrome and Dup7. Because of this recent preclinical and clinical
   identification of a genetic influence on anxiety, we examined whether
   sequence variation in GTF2I, specifically the single-nucleotide
   polymorphism rs2527367, interacts with trait and state anxiety to
   collectively impact neural response to anxiety-laden social stimuli. Two
   hundred and sixty healthy adults completed the Tridimensional
   Personality Questionnaire Harm Avoidance (HA) subscale, a trait measure
   of anxiety proneness, and underwent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) while matching aversive (fearful or angry) facial
   identity. We found an interaction between GTF2I allelic variations and
   HA that affects brain response: in individuals homozygous for the major
   allele, there was no correlation between HA and whole-brain response to
   aversive cues, whereas in heterozygotes and individuals homozygous for
   the minor allele, there was a positive correlation between HA sub-scores
   and a selective dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) responsivity
   during the processing of aversive stimuli. These results demonstrate
   that sequence variation in the GTF2I gene influences the relationship
   between trait anxiety and brain response to aversive social cues in
   healthy individuals, supporting a role for this neurogenetic mechanism
   in anxiety.}},

   oddball tasks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{251}},
Pages = {{56-61}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study investigates the modulatory effect of stimulus
   sequence on neural responses to novel stimuli. A group of 34 healthy
   volunteers underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
   while performing a three-stimulus visual oddball task, involving
   randomly presented frequent stimuli and two types of infrequent stimuli
   targets and distractors.
   New method: We developed a modified categorization of rare stimuli that
   incorporated the type of preceding rare stimulus, and analyzed the
   event-related functional data according to this sequence categorization;
   specifically, we explored hemodynamic response modulation associated
   with increasing rare-to-rare stimulus interval.
   Results: For two consecutive targets, a modulation of brain function was
   evident throughout posterior midline and lateral temporal cortex, while
   responses to targets preceded by distractors were modulated in a widely
   distributed fronto-parietal system. As for distractors that follow
   targets, brain function was modulated throughout a set of posterior
   brain structures. For two successive distractors, however, no
   significant modulation was observed, which is consistent with previous
   studies and our primary hypothesis.
   Comparison with existing methods: The addition of the aforementioned
   technique extends the possibilities of conventional oddball task
   analysis, enabling researchers to explore the effects of the whole range
   of rare stimuli intervals.
   Conclusion: This methodology can be applied to study a wide range of
   associated cognitive mechanisms, such as decision making, expectancy and
   attention. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Individual differences in local gray matter density are associated with
   differences in affective and cognitive empathy}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{305-310}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{The understanding of empathy from a neuroscientific perspective has
   recently developed quickly, with numerous functional MRI studies
   associating different brain regions with different components of
   empathy. A recent meta-analysis across 40 fMRI studies revealed that
   affective empathy is most often associated with increased activity in
   the insula, whereas cognitive empathy is most often associated with
   activity in the midcingulate cortex and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex (MCC/dmPFC). To date, however, it remains unclear whether
   individual differences in brain morphometry in these regions underlie
   different dispositions in affective and cognitive empathy. In order to
   test this hypothesis, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to examine
   the extent to which gray matter density predicts scores from an
   established empathy measure (Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective
   Empathy; QCAE). One hundred and seventy-six participants completed the
   QCAE and underwent MRI in order to acquire a high-resolution,
   three-dimensional T1-weighted structural scans. A factor analysis of the
   questionnaire scores revealed two distinct factors of empathy, affective
   and cognitive, which confirmed the validity of the QCAE. VBM results
   revealed gray matter density differences associated with the distinct
   components of empathy. Higher scores on affective empathy were
   associated with greater gray matter density in the insula cortex and
   higher scores of cognitive empathy were associated with greater gray
   matter density in the MCC/dmPFC. Taken together, these results provide
   validation for empathy being a multi-component construct, suggesting
   that affective and cognitive empathy are differentially represented in
   brain morphometry as well as providing convergent evidence for empathy
   being represented by different neural and structural correlates. (C)

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Working memory (WM) impairments may contribute to the profound
   behavioural manifestations in children with autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD). However, previous behavioural results are discrepant as are the
   few functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results collected in
   adults and adolescents with ASD. Here we investigate the precise
   temporal dynamics of WM-related brain activity using
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 20 children with ASD and matched
   controls during an n-back WM task across different load levels (1-back
   vs 2-back). Although behavioural results were similar between ASD and
   typically developing (TD) children, the between-group comparison
   performed on functional brain activity showed atypical WM-related brain
   processes in children with ASD compared with TD children. These atypical
   responses were observed in the ASD group from 200 to 600 ms post
   stimulus in both the low- (1-back) and high- (2-back) memory load
   conditions. During the 1-back condition, children with ASD showed
   reduced WM-related activations in the right hippocampus and the
   cingulate gyrus compared with TD children who showed more activation in
   the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and the insulae. In the 2-back
   condition, children with ASD showed less activity in the left insula and
   midcingulate gyrus and more activity in the left precuneus than TD
   children. In addition, reduced activity in the anterior cingulate cortex
   was correlated with symptom severity in children with ASD. Thus, this
   MEG study identified the precise timing and sources of atypical
   WM-related activity in frontal, temporal and parietal regions in
   children with ASD. The potential impacts of such atypicalities on social
   deficits of autism are discussed.}},

Title = {{Co-lateralized bilingual mechanisms for reading in single and dual
   language contexts: evidence from visual half-field processing of action
   words in proficient bilinguals}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{When reading, proficient bilinguals seem to engage the same cognitive
   circuits regardless of the language in use. Yet, whether or not such
   ``bilingual{''} mechanisms would be lateralized in the same way in
   distinct single or dual language contexts is a question for debate. To
   fill this gap, we tested 18 highly proficient Polish (L1) -English (L2)
   childhood bilinguals whose task was to read aloud one of the two
   laterally presented action verbs, one stimulus per visual half field.
   While in the single-language blocks only L1 or L2 words were shown, in
   the subsequent mixed-language blocks words from both languages were
   concurrently displayed. All stimuli were presented for 217 ms followed
   by masks in which letters were replaced with hash marks. Since in
   non-simultaneous bilinguals the control of language, skilled actions
   (including reading), and representations of action concepts are
   typically left lateralized, the vast majority of our participants showed
   the expected, significant right visual field advantage for L1 and L2,
   both for accuracy and response times. The observed effects were
   nevertheless associated with substantial variability in the strength of
   the lateralization of the mechanisms involved. Moreover, although it
   could be predicted that participants' performance should be better in a
   single-language context, accuracy was significantly higher and response
   times were significantly shorter in a dual-language context,
   irrespective of the language tested. Finally, for both accuracy and
   response times, there were significant positive correlations between the
   laterality indices (Lls) of both languages independent of the context,
   with a significantly greater left-sided advantage for L1 vs. L2 in the
   mixed-language blocks, based on Lls calculated for response times. Thus,
   despite similar representations of the two languages in the bilingual
   brain, these results also point to the functional separation of L1 and
   L2 in the dual-language context.}},

Abstract = {{This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the
   brain regions underlying language task performance in adult second
   language (L2) learners. Specifically, we identified brain regions where
   the level of activation was associated with L2 fluency levels. Thirty
   Japanese-speaking adults participated in the study. All participants
   were L2 learners of English and had achieved varying levels of fluency,
   as determined by a standardized L2 English proficiency test, the Versant
   English Test (Pearson Education Inc., 2011). When participants performed
   the oral sentence building task from the production tasks administered,
   the dorsal part of the left inferior frontal gyrus (dIFG) showed
   activation patterns that differed depending on the L2 fluency levels:
   The more fluent the participants were, the more dIFG activation
   decreased. This decreased activation of the dIFG might reflect the
   increased automaticity of a syntactic building process. In contrast,
   when participants performed an oral story comprehension task, the left
   posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) showed increased activation
   with higher fluency levels. This suggests that the learners with higher
   L2 fluency were actively engaged in post-syntactic integration
   processing supported by the left pSTG. These data imply that L2 fluency
   predicts neural resource allocation during language comprehension tasks
   as well as in production tasks. This study sheds light on the neural
   underpinnings of L2 learning by identifying the brain regions recruited
   during different language tasks across different modalities (production
   vs. comprehension). (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. on

Abstract = {{Context plays a pivotal role in many decision-making scenarios,
   including social interactions wherein the identities and strategies of
   other decision makers often shape our behaviors. However, the neural
   mechanisms for tracking such contextual information are poorly
   understood. Here, we investigated how opponent identity affects human
   reinforcement learning during a simulated competitive game against two
   independent computerized opponents. We found that strategies of
   participants were affected preferentially by the outcomes of the
   previous interactions with the same opponent. In addition, reinforcement
   signals from the previous trial were less discriminable throughout the
   brain after the opponent changed, compared with when the same opponent
   was repeated. These opponent-selective reinforcement signals were
   particularly robust in right rostral anterior cingulate and right
   lingual regions, where opponent-selective reinforcement signals
   correlated with a behavioral measure of opponent-selective reinforcement
   learning. Therefore, when choices involve multiple contextual frames,
   such as different opponents in a game, decision making and its neural
   correlates are influenced by multithreaded histories of reinforcement.
   Overall, our findings are consistent with the availability of temporally
   overlapping, context-specific reinforcement signals.}},

Abstract = {{Important decisions are often made under stressful circumstances that
   might compromise self-regulatory behavior. Yet the neural mechanisms by
   which stress influences self-control choices are unclear. We
   investigated these mechanisms in human participants who faced
   self-control dilemmas over food reward while undergoing fMRI following
   stress. We found that stress increased the influence of immediately
   rewarding taste attributes on choice and reduced self-control. This
   choice pattern was accompanied by increased functional connectivity
   between ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala and striatal
   regions encoding tastiness. Furthermore, stress was associated with
   reduced connectivity between the vmPFC and dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex regions linked to self-control success. Notably, alterations in
   connectivity pathways could be dissociated by their differential
   relationships with cortisol and perceived stress. Our results indicate
   that stress may compromise self-control decisions by both enhancing the
   impact of immediately rewarding attributes and reducing the efficacy of
   regions promoting behaviors that are consistent with long-term goals.}},

Title = {{Cerebral Correlates of Abnormal Emotion Conflict Processing in Euthymic
   Bipolar Patients: A Functional MRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Patients with bipolar disorder experience cognitive and emotional
   impairment that may persist even during the euthymic state of the
   disease. These persistent symptoms in bipolar patients (BP) may be
   characterized by disturbances of emotion regulation and related
   fronto-limbic brain circuitry. The present study aims to investigate the
   modulation of fronto-limbic activity and connectivity in BP by the
   processing of emotional conflict.
   Methods
   Fourteen euthymic BP and 13 matched healthy subjects (HS) underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a
   word-face emotional Stroop task designed to dissociate the
   monitoring/generation of emotional conflict from its resolution.
   Functional connectivity was determined by means of psychophysiological
   interaction (PPI) approach.
   Results
   Relative to HS, BP were slower to process incongruent stimuli,
   reflecting higher amount of behavioral interference during emotional
   Stroop. Furthermore, BP showed decreased activation of the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during the monitoring and a lack
   of bilateral amygdala deactivation during the resolution of the
   emotional conflict. In addition, during conflict monitoring, BP showed
   abnormal positive connectivity between the right DLPFC and several
   regions of the default mode network.
   Conclusions
   Overall, our results highlighted dysfunctional processing of the emotion
   conflict in euthymic BP that may be subtended by abnormal activity and
   connectivity of the DLPFC during the conflict monitoring, which, in
   turn, leads to failure of amygdala deactivation during the resolution of
   the conflict. Emotional dysregulation in BP may be underpinned by a lack
   of top-down cognitive control and a difficulty to focus on the task due
   to persistent self-oriented attention.}},

   processing}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Recent behavioral evidence suggests that dogs, like humans and monkeys,
   are capable of visual face recognition. But do dogs also exhibit
   specialized cortical face regions similar to humans and monkeys? Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in six dogs trained to
   remain motionless during scanning without restraint or sedation, we
   found a region in the canine temporal lobe that responded significantly
   more to movies of human faces than to movies of everyday objects. Next,
   using a new stimulus set to investigate face selectivity in this
   predefined candidate dog face area, we found that this region responded
   similarly to images of human faces and dog faces, yet significantly more
   to both human and dog faces than to images of objects. Such face
   selectivity was not found in dog primary visual cortex. Taken together,
   these findings: (1) provide the first evidence for a face-selective
   region in the temporal cortex of dogs, which cannot be explained by
   simple low-level visual feature extraction; (2) reveal that neural
   machinery dedicated to face processing is not unique to primates; and
   (3) may help explain dogs' exquisite sensitivity to human social cues.}},

Title = {{Four broad temperament dimensions: description, convergent validation
   correlations, and comparison with the Big Five}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{A new temperament construct based on recent brain physiology literature
   has been investigated using the Fisher Temperament Inventory (FTI). Four
   collections of behaviors emerged, each associated with a specific neural
   system: the dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, and estrogen/oxytocin
   system. These four temperament suites have been designated: (1)
   Curious/Energetic, (2) Cautious/Social Norm Compliant, (3)
   Analytical/Tough-minded, and (4) Prosocial/Empathetic temperament
   dimensions. Two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
   have suggested that the FTI can measure the influence of these neural
   systems. In this paper, to further the behavioral validation and
   characterization of the four proposed temperament dimensions, we
   measured correlations with five variables: (1) gender; (2) level of
   education; (3) religious preference; (4) political orientation; (5) the
   degree to which an individual regards sex as essential to a successful
   relationship. Subjects were 39,913 anonymous members of a US Internet
   dating site and 70,000+ members in six other countries. Correlations
   with the five variables characterize the FTI and are consistent with
   mechanisms using the proposed neuromodulators. We also report on an
   analysis between the FTI and the NEO-Five Factor Inventory, using a
   college sample (n = 215), which showed convergent validity. The results
   provide novel correlates not available in other questionnaires:
   religiosity, political orientation, and attitudes about sex in a
   relationship. Also, an Eigen analysis replicated the four clusters of
   co-varying items. The FTI, with its broad systems and non-pathologic
   factors complements existing personality questionnaires. It provides an
   index of some brain systems that contribute to temperament, and may be
   useful in psychotherapy, business, medicine, and the legal community.}},

Abstract = {{Screaming is arguably one of the most relevant communication signals for
   survival in humans. Despite their practical relevance and their
   theoretical significance as innate {[}1] and virtually universal {[}2,
   3] vocalizations, what makes screams a unique signal and how they are
   processed is not known. Here, we use acoustic analyses, psychophysical
   experiments, and neuroimaging to isolate those features that confer to
   screams their alarming nature, and we track their processing in the
   human brain. Using the modulation power spectrum (MPS {[}4, 5]), a
   recently developed, neurally informed characterization of sounds, we
   demonstrate that human screams cluster within restricted portion of the
   acoustic space (between similar to 30 and 150 Hz modulation rates) that
   corresponds to a well-known perceptual attribute, roughness. In contrast
   to the received view that roughness is irrelevant for communication
   {[}6], our data reveal that the acoustic space occupied by the rough
   vocal regime is segregated from other signals, including speech, a
   pre-requisite to avoid false alarms in normal vocal communication. We
   show that roughness is present in natural alarm signals as well as in
   artificial alarms and that the presence of roughness in sounds boosts
   their detection in various tasks. Using fMRI, we show that acoustic
   roughness engages subcortical structures critical to rapidly appraise
   danger. Altogether, these data demonstrate that screams occupy a
   privileged acoustic niche that, being separated from other communication
   signals, ensures their biological and ultimately social efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit impairment in
   reciprocal social interactions, including play, which can manifest as
   failure to show social preference or discrimination between social and
   nonsocial stimuli. To explore mechanisms underlying these deficits, we
   collected salivary cortisol from 42 children 8-12 years with ASD or
   typical development during a playground interaction with a confederate
   child. Participants underwent functional MRI during a prisoner's dilemma
   game requiring cooperation or defection with a human (confederate) or
   computer partner. Search region of interest analyses were based on
   previous research (e.g. insula, amygdala, temporal parietal
   junction-TPJ). There were significant group differences in neural
   activation based on partner and response pattern. When playing with a
   human partner, children with ASD showed limited engagement of a social
   salience brain circuit during defection. Reduced insula activation
   during defection in the ASD children relative to TD children, regardless
   of partner type, was also a prominent finding. Insula and TPJ BOLD
   during defection was also associated with stress responsivity and
   behavior in the ASD group under playground conditions. Children with ASD
   engage social salience networks less than TD children during conditions
   of social salience, supporting a fundamental disturbance of social
   engagement.}},

Abstract = {{Dysfunctional processing of reward and punishment may play an important
   role in depression. However, functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) studies have shown heterogeneous results for reward processing in
   fronto-striatal regions. We examined neural responsivity associated with
   the processing of reward and loss during anticipation and receipt of
   incentives and related prediction error (PE) signalling in depressed
   individuals. Thirty medication-free depressed persons and 28 healthy
   controls performed an fMRI reward paradigm. Regions of interest analyses
   focused on neural responses during anticipation and receipt of gains and
   losses and related PE-signals. Additionally, we assessed the
   relationship between neural responsivity during gain/loss processing and
   hedonic capacity. When compared with healthy controls, depressed
   individuals showed reduced fronto-striatal activity during anticipation
   of gains and losses. The groups did not significantly differ in response
   to reward and loss outcomes. In depressed individuals, activity
   increases in the orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens during
   reward anticipation were associated with hedonic capacity. Depressed
   individuals showed an absence of reward-related PEs but encoded
   loss-related PEs in the ventral striatum. Depression seems to be linked
   to blunted responsivity in fronto-striatal regions associated with
   limited motivational responses for rewards and losses. Alterations in PE
   encoding might mirror blunted reward-and enhanced loss-related
   associative learning in depression.}},

Abstract = {{Food is an innate reward stimulus related to energy homeostasis and
   survival, whereas money is considered a more general reward stimulus
   that gains a rewarding value through learning experiences. Although the
   underlying neural processing for both modalities of reward has been
   investigated independently from one another, a more detailed
   investigation of neural similarities and/or differences between food and
   monetary reward is still missing. Here, we investigated the neural
   processing of food compared with monetary-related rewards in 27 healthy,
   normal-weight women using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We
   developed a task distinguishing between the anticipation and the receipt
   of either abstract food or monetary reward. Both tasks activated the
   ventral striatum during the expectation of a reward. Compared with
   money, greater food-related activations were observed in prefrontal,
   parietal and central midline structures during the anticipation and
   lateral orbitofrontal cortex (IOFC) during the receipt of food reward.
   Furthermore, during the receipt of food reward, brain activation in the
   secondary taste cortex was positively related to the body mass index.
   These results indicate that food-dependent activations encompass to a
   greater extent brain regions involved in self-control and
   self-reflection during the anticipation and phylogenetically older parts
   of the IOFC during the receipt of reward.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have investigated how attentional control is affected by
   transient affective states while taking individual differences in
   affective traits into consideration. In this study, participants
   completed a color-word Stroop task immediately after undergoing a
   positive, neutral or negative affective context manipulation (ACM).
   Behavioral performance was unaffected by any ACM considered in
   isolation. For individuals high in trait negative affect (NA),
   performance was impaired by the negative but not the positive or neutral
   ACM. Neuroimaging results indicate that activity in primarily top-down
   control regions of the brain (inferior frontal gyrus and dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex) was suppressed in the presence of emotional arousal
   (both negative and positive ACMs). This effect appears to have been
   exacerbated or offset by co-occurring activity in other top-down control
   regions (parietal) and emotion processing regions (orbitofrontal cortex,
   amygdala and nucleus accumbens) as a function of the valence of state
   affect (positive or negative) and trait affect (trait NA or trait PA).
   Neuroimaging results are consistent with behavioral findings. In
   combination, they indicate both additive and interactive influences of
   trait and state affect on top-down control of attention.}},

Abstract = {{Powerful speeches can captivate audiences, whereas weaker speeches fail
   to engage their listeners. What is happening in the brains of a
   captivated audience? Here, we assess audience-wide functional brain
   dynamics during listening to speeches of varying rhetorical quality. The
   speeches were given by German politicians and evaluated as rhetorically
   powerful or weak. Listening to each of the speeches induced similar
   neural response time courses, as measured by inter-subject correlation
   analysis, in widespread brain regions involved in spoken language
   processing. Crucially, alignment of the time course across listeners was
   stronger for rhetorically powerful speeches, especially for bilateral
   regions of the superior temporal gyri and medial prefrontal cortex.
   Thus, during powerful speeches, listeners as a group are more coupled to
   each other, suggesting that powerful speeches are more potent in taking
   control of the listeners' brain responses. Weaker speeches were
   processed more heterogeneously, although they still prompted
   substantially correlated responses. These patterns of coupled neural
   responses bear resemblance to metaphors of resonance, which are often
   invoked in discussions of speech impact, and contribute to the
   literature on auditory attention under natural circumstances. Overall,
   this approach opens up possibilities for research on the neural
   mechanisms mediating the reception of entertaining or persuasive
   messages.}},

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{Previous work has provided preliminary indication of sex-related
   functional asymmetry of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in
   social and emotional functions and complex decision-making. Findings
   have been inconsistent, and based on small numbers of patients. Given
   the rarity of these neurological cases, replicable results across
   studies are important to build evidence for sex-related functional
   asymmetry of the vmPFC. Here we used a sample of sixteen neurological
   patients with unilateral damage to the left or right vmPFC and examined
   differences between men and women on a task that probed decision-making
   under risk or decision-making under ambiguity. We found that men with
   right-hemisphere vmPFC damage and women with left-hemisphere vmPFC
   damage demonstrated significantly reduced aversion to risk and
   ambiguity. Men with damage to the left vmPFC and women with damage to
   the right vmPFC showed aversion to risk and ambiguity comparable to
   participants with left or right-sided brain damage outside the vmPFC,
   and to comparison participants without brain damage. Our results add to
   previous findings of sex-related functional asymmetry of the vmPFC in
   decision-making. Our study also replicates findings of no observable
   behavioral differences between men and women without neurological damage
   on tests of decision-making. This pattern of neurobiological divergence
   but behavioral convergence between men and women may reflect a complex
   interplay of neuroendocrine, developmental, and psychosocial factors.

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{When the message of a speaker goes beyond the literal or logical meaning
   of the sentences used, a pragmatic inference is required to understand
   the complete meaning of an utterance. Here we study one example of
   pragmatic inference, called scalar implicature. Such an inference is
   required when a weaker term ``some{''} is used in a sentence like ``Some
   of the students passed the exam{''} because the speaker presumably had a
   reason not to use a stronger term like ``all{''}. We investigated the
   comprehension of scalar implicatures in a group of 17 non-aphasic
   patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD) in
   order to test the contribution of non-linguistic decision-making ability
   and the role of prefrontal cortex in supporting the computation of
   pragmatic inferences. The results of two experiments point to a deficit
   in producing alternative interpretations beyond a logical reading. bvFTD
   patients thus prefer the narrowly literal or logical interpretation of a
   scalar term when they must generate a possible alternative
   interpretation by themselves, but patients prefer a pragmatic reading
   when offered a choice between the logical and the pragmatic
   interpretation of the same sentence. An imaging analysis links bvFTD
   patients' spontaneous tendency toward a narrowly logical interpretation
   with atrophy in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Our findings are
   consistent with the pragmatic tolerance hypothesis, which proposes that
   difficulty generating alternative interpretations of an utterance,
   rather than a frank inability to compute an inference, affects the
   comprehension of a scalar term. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   Predicts Social Difficulties in Boys with Autism Spectrum Disorder}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The posterior right temporo-parietal junction (pRTPJ) is a key brain
   region representing other's mental status. Despite reports of atypical
   activation at pRTPJ during mentalizing in individuals with autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD), the intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of
   the pRTPJ remains under-investigated. We examined whether boys with ASD
   show altered resting-state iFC of the pRTPJ, and whether atypical iFC of
   the pRTPJ is associated with social deficits in ASD in a sample of 40
   boys with high-functioning ASD (aged 9-17 years, mean age, 12.38 +/-
   2.17; mean IQ, 105.60 +/- 16.06) and 42 typically developing (TD) boys
   (aged 9-17 years, mean age, 11.64 +/- 2.71; mean IQ, 111.29 +/- 13.45).
   Both groups received resting-state fMRI assessment after imaging data
   quality control for in-scanner head motion and spatial coverage.
   Seed-based approach was used to investigate iFC of the pRTPJ. TD and ASD
   boys demonstrated a resting-state pRTPJ iFC pattern comparable to the
   known spatial involvement of the default-mode network. Boys with ASD
   showed pRTPJ hyperconnectivity relative to TD boys in the right ventral
   occipito-temporal cortex. This atypically increased iFC in the ASD group
   was positively correlated with social deficits assessed by the Chinese
   version of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Social
   Responsive Scale. Our findings provide empirical support for functional
   dysconnectivity, that is, atypical functional integration among brain
   regions, as an integral component of the atypical neurobiology of ASD.

Abstract = {{Although previous research has revealed a number of social, cognitive
   and neural components of Machiavellians' decision making processes, less
   attention has been given to the neural correlates of the high Mach (HM)
   and low Mach (LM) people's responses to situations involving risks and
   costs imposed by others in interpersonal relationships. In the present
   study, we used an fMRI technique to examine individuals as they played
   the Trust game in fair and unfair situations. Our results revealed that
   the social environment involving opportunities for exploiting others may
   be more demanding for Machiavellians who showed elevated brain
   activities in the fair condition (where the partner made a cooperative
   initiation) but not in the unfair condition. Regarding the specific
   activated brain areas in the fair condition, the HM's anterior
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was responding, which is likely
   to be involved in the inhibition of the prepotent social-emotional
   response to the partner's cooperative initiative. Furthermore, we found
   increased activity in the HM subjects' inferior frontal gyrus (IFG),
   compared to LMs, that plays a crucial role in the evaluation of the
   signals associated with the others' social behavior, especially when the
   player faces a cooperative partner. Alternatively, although
   Machiavellians are regarded as poor mind readers, inferior frontal gyrus
   may be effective in anticipating their partner's subsequent decisions in
   the social dilemma situation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Two experiments investigated the network involved in the visual
   perception of walking. Video clips of forward and backward walk (real
   walk direction) were shown either as recorded, or reversed in time
   (rendering). In Experiment 1 (identification task), participants were
   asked to indicate whether or not the stimulus was time-reversed. In
   Experiment 2 (free-viewing), participants viewed the video clips
   passively. Identification accuracy was good with the more familiar
   scene, that is, when the visual walk was in the direction of the facing
   orientation, and at chance level in the opposite case. In both
   experiments, the temporo-occipital junction (TOJ) was activated more
   strongly by unfamiliar than familiar scenes. Only in Experiment 1
   intraparietal, superior temporal, and inferior temporal regions were
   also activated. TOJ activation signals the detection in unfamiliar
   scenes of a mismatch between facing orientation and visual movement
   direction. We argue that TOJ response to a mismatch prevents the further
   processing of the visual input required to identify temporal inversions.
   When no mismatch is detected (familiar stimuli), TOJ would, instead, be
   involved in the kinematic analysis that makes such identification
   possible. The study demonstrates that unfamiliar walking movements are
   detected earlier than so far assumed along the visual movement
   processing stream.}},

   EEG and fMRI study}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{76-92}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Although behavioral studies have consistently reported the spacing
   effect in learning, its cognitive and neural mechanisms are still not
   clearly elucidated. According to the storage/retrieval strength
   framework proposed by Bjork (1999; Bjork \& Bjork, 1992), which was
   built on the study-phase retrieval hypothesis and the deficient
   processing hypothesis, the spacing effect is achieved by reducing
   memomtary retrieval strength during subsequent repetitions and thus
   enhancing storage strength. The present study tested this hypothesis
   with parallel fMRI and EEG. Participants were asked to study 180 words
   that were repeated three times, with half of the words having an
   inter-repetition-lag of 1-3 words (i.e., massed learning) and the other
   half an inter-repetition-lag of 25-35 words (i.e., spaced learning). An
   unexpected recognition test was administered 24 h after learning.
   Consistent with Bjork's hypothesis, the EEG data suggested that spaced
   learning was associated with weaker retrieval strength, as indicated by
   a reduced familiarity effect in frontal N400. Meanwhile, spaced learning
   effectively enhanced the encoding process and thus led to stronger
   storage strength, as indicated by greater fMRI responses during learning
   in brain regions whose activities were associated with subsequent
   memory. Interestingly, no direct association was found between
   repetition priming and episodic memory. These results furthered our
   understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the spacing effect.

Abstract = {{Irritability is an aspect of the negative affectivity domain of
   temperament, but in severe and dysregulated forms is a symptom of a
   range of psychopathologies. Better understanding of the neural
   underpinnings of irritability, outside the context of specific
   disorders, can help to understand normative variation but also
   characterize its clinical salience in psychopathology diagnosis. This
   study assessed brain activation during reward and frustration, domains
   of behavioral deficits in childhood irritability. Children (age 6-9)
   presenting in mental health clinics for extreme and impairing
   irritability (n = 26) were compared to healthy children (n = 28). Using
   developmentally sensitive methods, neural activation was measured via a
   negative mood induction paradigm during fMRI scanning. The clinical
   group displayed more activation of the anterior cingulate and middle
   frontal gyrus during reward, but less activation during frustration,
   than healthy comparison children. The opposite pattern was found in the
   posterior cingulate. Further, in clinical subjects, parent report of
   irritability was dimensionally related to decreased activation of the
   anterior cingulate and striatum during frustration. The results of this
   study indicate neural dysfunction within brain regions related to reward
   processing, error monitoring, and emotion regulation underlying
   clinically impairing irritability. Results are discussed in the context
   of a growing field of neuroimaging research investigating irritable
   children. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an

Title = {{Increased Functional Connectivity Between Subcortical and Cortical
   Resting-State Networks in Autism Spectrum Disorder}},
Journal = {{JAMA PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit
   severe difficulties in social interaction, motor coordination,
   behavioral flexibility, and atypical sensory processing, with
   considerable interindividual variability. This heterogeneous set of
   symptoms recently led to investigating the presence of abnormalities in
   the interaction across large-scale brain networks. To date, studies have
   focused either on constrained sets of brain regions or whole-brain
   analysis, rather than focusing on the interaction between brain
   networks.
   OBJECTIVES To compare the intrinsic functional connectivity between
   brain networks in a large sample of individuals with ASD and typically
   developing control subjects and to estimate to what extent group
   differences would predict autistic traits and reflect different
   developmental trajectories.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We studied 166 male individuals (mean
   age, 17.6 years; age range, 7-50 years) diagnosed as having DSM-IV-TR
   autism or Asperger syndrome and 193 typical developing male individuals
   (mean age, 16.9 years; age range, 6.5-39.4 years) using resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants were matched
   for age, IQ, head motion, and eye status (open or closed) in the MRI
   scanner. We analyzed data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange
   (ABIDE), an aggregated MRI data set from 17 centers, made public in
   August 2012.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We estimated correlations between time
   courses of brain networks extracted using a data-driven method
   (independent component analysis). Subsequently, we associated estimates
   of interaction strength between networks with age and autistic traits
   indexed by the Social Responsiveness Scale.
   RESULTS Relative to typically developing control participants,
   individuals with ASD showed increased functional connectivity between
   primary sensory networks and subcortical networks (thalamus and basal
   ganglia) (all t >= 3.13, P < .001 corrected). The strength of such
   connections was associated with the severity of autistic traits in the
   ASD group (all r >= 0.21, P < .0067 corrected). In addition,
   subcortico-cortical interaction decreased with age in the entire sample
   (all r <= -0.09, P < .012 corrected), although this association was
   significant only in typically developing participants (all r <= -0.13, P
   < .009 corrected).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results showing ASD-related impairment in
   the interaction between primary sensory cortices and subcortical regions
   suggest that the sensory processes they subserve abnormally influence
   brain information processing in individuals with ASD. This might
   contribute to the occurrence of hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity and
   of difficulties in top-down regulation of behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examines the relationship between social influence and
   recommendation decisions among adolescents in the new media environment.
   Participants completed the App Recommendation Task a task that captures
   neural processes associated with making recommendations to others, with
   and without information about peer recommendations of the type commonly
   available online. The results demonstrate that increased activity in the
   striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in response to peer recommendations is
   significantly correlated with participants changing their
   recommendations to be consistent with this feedback within subjects.
   Furthermore, individual differences in activation of the temporoparietal
   junction during feedback that peer recommendations varied from those of
   the participant correlated with individual differences in susceptibility
   to influence on recommendation decisions between subjects. These brain
   regions have previously been implicated in social influence and the
   concept of being a ``successful idea salesperson,{''} respectively.
   Together, they highlight a potential combination of internal preference
   shifts and consideration of the mental states of others in
   recommendation environments that include peer opinions.}},

Abstract = {{Sex-a marker of biological and social individual differences-matters for
   drug use, particularly for cigarette smoking, which is the leading cause
   of preventable death in the United States. More men than women smoke,
   but women are less likely than men to quit. Resting state brain
   function, or intrinsic brain activity that occurs in the absence of a
   goal-directed task, is important for understanding cigarette smoking, as
   it has been shown to differentiate between smokers and nonsmokers. But,
   it is unclear whether and how sex influences the link between resting
   state brain function and smoking behavior. In this study, the authors
   demonstrate that sex is indeed associated with resting state
   connectivity in cigarette smokers, and that sex moderates the link
   between resting state connectivity and self-reported nicotine
   dependence. Using functional MRI and behavioral data from 50 adult daily
   smokers (23 women), the authors found that women had greater
   connectivity than men within the default mode network, and that
   increased connectivity within the reward network was related to
   increased nicotine tolerance in women but to decreased nicotine
   tolerance in men. Findings highlight the importance of sex-related
   individual differences reflected in resting state connectivity for
   understanding the etiology and treatment of substance use problems.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveA novel hypothesis of object recognition asserts that multiple
   regions are engaged in processing an object type, and that cerebral
   regions participate in processing multiple types of objects. In
   particular, for high-level expert processing, it proposes shared rather
   than dedicated resources for word and face perception, and predicts that
   prosopagnosic subjects would have minor deficits in visual word
   processing, and alexic subjects would have subtle impairments in face
   perception. In this study, we evaluated whether prosopagnosic subjects
   had deficits in processing either the word content or the style of
   visual text.
   MethodsEleven prosopagnosic subjects, 6 with unilateral right lesions
   and 5 with bilateral lesions, participated. In the first study, we
   evaluated their word length effect in reading single words. In the
   second study, we assessed their time and accuracy for sorting text by
   word content independent of style, and for sorting text by handwriting
   or font style independent of word content.
   ResultsOnly subjects with bilateral lesions showed mildly elevated word
   length effects. Subjects were not slowed in sorting text by word
   content, but were nearly uniformly impaired in accuracy for sorting text
   by style.
   InterpretationOur results show that prosopagnosic subjects are impaired
   not only in face recognition but also in perceiving stylistic aspects of
   text. This supports a modified version of the many-to-many hypothesis
   that incorporates hemispheric specialization for processing different
   aspects of visual text. Ann Neurol 2015;78:258-271}},

Abstract = {{Within the Big 5 model of personality, Agreeableness is a
   trait-dimension associated with the tendency to behave prosocially;
   highly agreeable people tend to be highly cooperative and altruistic.
   This study was designed to test for associations between Agreeableness
   and the way people decide the cause of another person's emotional
   reaction (emotion attribution). Behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) data
   were collected while participants (n = 72) performed an emotional
   attribution task. During the emotion attribution task, participants
   decided which of two social-emotional scenes they believed caused
   another person's emotional reaction. Converging evidence indicated that
   highly agreeable people tend to make emotional attribution decisions
   more quickly and exhibit greater temporoparietal junction activity
   during emotion attribution decisions, compared to low agreeable people.

Abstract = {{Noninvasive stimulation can alter the function of brain networks,
   although the duration of neuroplastic changes are uncertain and likely
   vary for different networks and stimulation parameters. We have
   previously shown that multiple-day repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation can influence targeted hippocampal-cortical networks,
   producing increased functional MRI connectivity of these networks and
   concomitant improvements in memory that outlast stimulation by
   approximate to 24 h. Here, we present new analyses showing that
   multiple-day targeted stimulation of hippocampal-cortical networks
   produces even longer-lasting enhancement. The ability to learn novel,
   arbitrary face-word pairings improved over five consecutive daily
   stimulation sessions, and this improvement remained robust at follow-up
   testing performed an average of 15 days later. Furthermore, stimulation
   increased functional MRI connectivity of the targeted portion of the
   hippocampus with distributed regions of the posterior
   hippocampal-cortical network, and these changes in connectivity remained
   robust at follow-up testing. Neuroplastic changes of
   hippocampal-cortical networks caused by multiple-day noninvasive
   stimulation therefore persist for extended periods. These findings have
   implications for the design of multiple-day stimulation experiments and
   for the development of stimulation-based interventions for memory
   disorders. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to attribute mental states to others, or mentalizing, is
   posited to involve specific subnetworks within the overall default mode
   network (DMN), but this question needs clarification. To determine which
   default mode (DM) subnetworks are engaged by mentalizing processes, we
   assessed task-related recruitment of DM subnetworks. Spatial independent
   component analysis (sICA) applied to fMRI data using relatively
   high-order model (75 components). Healthy participants (n=53, ages
   17-60) performed two fMRI tasks: an interactive game involving
   mentalizing (Domino), a semantic memory task (SORT), and a resting state
   fMRI scan. sICA of the two tasks split the DMN into 10 subnetworks
   located in three core regions: medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; five
   subnetworks), posterior cingulate/precuneus (PCC/PrC; three
   subnetworks), and bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Mentalizing
   events increased recruitment in five of 10 DM subnetworks, located in
   all three core DMN regions. In addition, three of these five DM
   subnetworks, one dmPFC subnetwork, one PCC/PrC subnetwork, and the right
   TPJ subnetwork, showed reduced recruitment by semantic memory task
   events. The opposing modulation by the two tasks suggests that these
   three DM subnetworks are specifically engaged in mentalizing. Our
   findings, therefore, suggest the unique involvement of mentalizing
   processes in only three of 10 DM subnetworks, and support the importance
   of the dmPFC, PCC/PrC, and right TPJ in mentalizing as described in
   prior studies. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3047-3063, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{The ability to adaptively inhibit responses to tempting/distracting
   stimuli in the pursuit of goals is an essential set of skills necessary
   for adult competence and wellbeing. These inhibitory capacities develop
   throughout childhood, with growing evidence of important maturational
   changes occurring in adolescence. There also has been intense interest
   in the role of social adversity on the development of executive
   function, including inhibitory control. We hypothesized that the onset
   of adolescence could be a time of particular opportunity/vulnerability
   in the development of inhibition due to the large degree of maturational
   changes in neural systems involved in regulatory control. We
   investigated this hypothesis in a longitudinal study of adolescents by
   examining the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on the maturation of
   inhibition and concurrent brain function. Furthermore, we examined
   gender as a potential moderator of this relationship, given evidence of
   gender-specificity in the developmental pathways of inhibition as well
   as sex differences in adolescent development. Results reveal that lower
   SES is associated with worse behavioral inhibition over time and a
   concurrent increase in anterior cingulate (ACC) activation, but only in
   girls. We also found that lower SES girls exhibited decreased ACC
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) coupling over time. Our findings
   suggest that female adolescents with lower SES appear to develop less
   efficient inhibitory processing in dlPFC, requiring greater and
   relatively unsuccessful compensatory recruitment of ACC. In summary, the
   present study provides a novel window into the neural mechanisms by
   which the influence of SES on inhibition may be transmitted during
   adolescence. Hum Brain Mapp 36:3194-3203, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Current neurocircuitry models of anxiety disorders posit a
   lack of inhibitory tone in the amygdala during acquisition of Pavlovian
   fear responses and deficient encoding of extinction responses in
   amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex circuits. Competition between these
   two responses often results in a return of fear, limiting control over
   anxiety. However, one hypothesis holds that a pharmacologic strategy
   aimed at reducing amygdala activity while simultaneously augmenting
   medial prefrontal cortex function could facilitate the extinction of
   conditioned fear.
   METHODS: Key among the endogenous inhibitors of amygdala activity in
   response to social fear signals is the hypothalamic peptide oxytocin. To
   address the question whether oxytocin can strengthen Pavlovian
   extinction beyond its role in controlling social fear, we conducted a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment with 62 healthy male
   participants in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
   placebo-controlled design. Specifically, subjects were exposed to a
   Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm before receiving an intranasal dose
   (24 IU) of synthetic oxytocin or placebo.
   RESULTS: Oxytocin, when administered intranasally after Pavlovian fear
   conditioning, was found to increase electrodermal responses and
   prefrontal cortex signals to conditioned fear in the early phase of
   extinction and to enhance the decline of skin conductance responses in
   the late phase of extinction. Oxytocin also evoked an unspecific
   inhibition of amygdalar responses in both phases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings identify oxytocin as a
   differentially acting modulator of neural hubs involved in Pavlovian
   extinction. This specific profile of oxytocin action may open up new
   avenues for enhancing extinction-based therapies for anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{While neuroscience research has tremendously advanced our knowledge
   about the neural mechanisms of individual learning, i.e. through
   trial-and-error, it is only recently that neuroscientists have begun to
   study observational learning, and thus little is known about its neural
   mechanisms. One limitation is that observational learning has been
   addressed under unconstrained experimental conditions, not compatible
   with neuronal recordings. This study examined observational learning in
   macaque monkeys under the constraining conditions of behavioral
   neurophysiology. Two animals sat in primate chairs facing each other,
   with their head fixed. A touch screen was placed face up between the
   chairs at arm's reach, and the monkeys were trained on an abstract
   visuomotor associative task. In one experiment, the monkeys alternated
   the roles of ``actor{''} and ``observer{''}. The actor learned to
   associate visual cues with reaching targets, while the observer
   ``watched{''} freely. Then, the observer was given the same cue-target
   associations just performed by the actor, or had to learn new, not
   previously observed ones. The results show that learning performance is
   better after observation. In experiment 2, one monkey learned from a
   human actor who performed the task with errors only, or with successes
   only in separate blocks. The monkey's gain in performance was higher
   after observation of errors than after successes. The findings suggest
   that observational learning can occur even under highly constraining
   conditions, and open the way for investigating the neuronal correlates
   of social learning using the methods of behavioral neurophysiology. (C)

Abstract = {{Mental imagery of one's body moving through space is important for
   imagining changing visuospatial perspectives, as well as for determining
   how we might appear to other people. Previous neuroimaging research has
   implicated the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) in this process. It is
   unclear, however, how neural activity in the TPJ relates to the rotation
   perspectives from which mental spatial transformation (MST) of one's own
   body can take place, i.e. from an egocentric or an allocentric
   perspective. It is also unclear whether TPJ involvement in MST is
   self-specific orwhether the TPJ may also be involved in MST of other
   human bodies. The aim of the current study was to disentangle neural
   processes involved in egocentric versus allocentric MSTs of human bodies
   representing self and other. We measured functional brain activity of
   healthy participants while they performed egocentric and allocentric
   MSTs in relation to whole-body photographs of themselves and a same-sex
   stranger. Findings indicated higher blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   response in bilateral TPJ during egocentric versus allocentric MST.
   Moreover, BOLD response in the TPJ during egocentric MST correlated
   positively with self-report scores indicating how awkward participants
   felt while viewing whole-body photos of themselves. These findings
   considerably advance our understanding of TPJ involvement in MST and its
   interplay with self-awareness. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{The interference effect in arithmetic fact solving: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{92-101}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Some multiplication facts share common digits with other, previously
   learned facts, and as a result, different problems are associated with
   different levels of interference. The detrimental effect of interference
   in arithmetic facts knowledge has been recently highlighted in
   behavioral studies, in children as well as in adults, both in typical
   and atypical development. The present study investigated the brain
   regions involved in the interference effect when solving multiplication
   problems. Twenty healthy adults carried out a multiplication task in an
   MRI scanner. The event-related design comprised problems whose
   interference level and problem size were manipulated in a 2 x 2
   factorial design. After each trial, individuals were requested to
   indicate whether they solved the trial by retrieving the answer from
   long-term memory. This allowed us to examine which brain areas were
   sensitive to the interference effect and problem size effect as well as
   the retrieval strategy. The results highlighted two specific regions:
   the left angular gyrus was more activated for low interfering than for
   high interfering problems, and the right intraparietal sulcus was more
   activated for large problems than for small problems. In both regions,
   brain activity was not modulated by the other effect. These results
   suggest that the left angular gyrus is sensitive to the level of
   interference of the multiplication problems, whereas previously this
   region was thought to be more activated by small problems or by
   retrieval strategy. Here, in a design manipulating interference and
   problem size, while controlling for retrieval strategy, we showed that
   it rather reflects an automatic mapping between the problem and the
   answer stored in long-term memory. The right intraparietal sulcus was
   modulated by the problem size effect, which supports the idea that the
   problem size effect comes from the higher overlap between magnitude of
   the answers of large problems compared to small ones. Importantly,
   neither effects can be reduced to a strategy effect since they were
   present when analyzing only retrieval trials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies of children with anxiety disorders are limited, and
   no study has examined children who are at increased risk for developing
   anxiety disorders based on parental anxiety. The objective of this study
   was to examine the function of frontal and limbic brain regions using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in children at risk for
   anxiety disorders. Study participants included high-risk children (n=20)
   who had at least one parent with a primary diagnosis of social anxiety
   disorder and normal-risk control children (n=19). Using fMRl, we
   measured the blood oxygenation level dependent response while high-risk
   and normal-risk children were exposed to different emotional facial
   stimuli. We found greater activation of frontal, temporal and limbic
   regions in high-risk children relative to normal-risk children during
   the presentation of emotional stimuli (angry and happy). These regions
   included the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, hippocampus and
   insula. Our within-group analysis revealed similar patterns of
   hyperactivity in high-risk children with and without current anxiety
   symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate
   functional alterations in emotion-processing brain regions in children
   who are at risk for anxiety disorders based on parental anxiety. These
   findings are consistent with previous fMRI studies of pediatric anxiety
   and behaviorally inhibited children, and they contribute to our
   understanding of the neural correlates of risk for anxiety disorders.

Abstract = {{Social hierarchy is an ubiquitous principle of social organization
   across animal species. Although some progress has been made in our
   understanding of how humans infer hierarchical identity, the
   neuroanatomical basis for perceiving key social dimensions of others
   remains unexplored. Here, we combined event-related potentials and
   structural MRI to reveal the neuroanatomical substrates of early status
   recognition. Wedesigned a covertly simulated hierarchical setting in
   which participants performed a task either with a superior or with an
   inferior player. Participants showed higher amplitude in the N170
   component when presented with a picture of a superior player compared
   with an inferior player. Crucially, the magnitude of this effect
   correlated with brain morphology of the posterior cingulate cortex,
   superior temporal gyrus, insula, fusiform gyrus, and caudate nucleus. We
   conclude that early recognition of social hierarchies relies on the
   structural properties of a network involved in the automatic recognition
   of social identity.}},

Title = {{Cluster imaging of multi-brain networks (CIMBN): a general framework for
   hyperscanning and modeling a group of interacting brains}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Studying the neural basis of human social interactions is a key topic in
   the field of social neuroscience. Brain imaging studies in this field
   usually focus on the neural correlates of the social interactions
   between two participants. However, as the participant number further
   increases, even by a small amount, great difficulties raise. One
   challenge is how to concurrently scan all the interacting brains with
   high ecological validity, especially for a large number of participants.
   The other challenge is how to effectively model the complex group
   interaction behaviors emerging from the intricate neural information
   exchange among a group of socially organized people. Confronting these
   challenges, we propose a new approach called ``Cluster Imaging of
   Multi-brain Networks{''} (CIMBN). CIMBN consists of two parts. The first
   part is a cluster imaging technique with high ecological validity based
   on multiple functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems. Using
   this technique, we can easily extend the simultaneous imaging capacity
   of social neuroscience studies up to dozens of participants. The second
   part of CIMBN is a multi-brain network (MBN) modeling method based on
   graph theory. By taking each brain as a network node and the
   relationship between any two brains as a network edge, one can construct
   a network model for a group of interacting brains. The emergent group
   social behaviors can then be studied using the network's properties,
   such as its topological structure and information exchange efficiency.
   Although there is still much work to do, as a general framework for
   hyperscanning and modeling a group of interacting brains, CIMBN can
   provide new insights into the neural correlates of group social
   interactions, and advance social neuroscience and social psychology.}},

Title = {{A voxelwise approach to determine consensus regions-of-interest for the
   study of brain network plasticity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROANATOMY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 28}},
Abstract = {{Despite exciting advances in the functional imaging of the brain, it
   remains a challenge to define regions of interest (ROIs) that do not
   require investigator supervision and permit examination of change in
   networks over time (or plasticity). Plasticity is most readily examined
   by maintaining ROIs constant via seed-based and anatomical-atlas based
   techniques, but these approaches are not data-driven, requiring
   definition based on prior experience (e.g., choice of seed-region,
   anatomical landmarks). These approaches are limiting especially when
   functional connectivity may evolve over time in areas that are finer
   than known anatomical landmarks or in areas outside predetermined seeded
   regions. An ideal method would permit investigators to study network
   plasticity due to learning, maturation effects, or clinical recovery via
   multiple time point data that can be compared to one another in the same
   ROI while also preserving the voxel-level data in those ROIs at each
   time point. Data-driven approaches (e.g., whole-brain voxelwise
   approaches) ameliorate concerns regarding investigator bias, but the
   fundamental problem of comparing the results between distinct data sets
   remains. In this paper we propose an approach, aggregate-initialized
   label propagation (AILP), which allows for data at separate time points
   to be compared for examining developmental processes resulting in
   network change (plasticity). To do so, we use a whole-brain modularity
   approach to parcellate the brain into anatomically constrained
   functional modules at separate time points and then apply the AILP
   algorithm to form a consensus set of ROIs for examining change over
   time. To demonstrate its utility, we make use of a known dataset of
   individuals with traumatic brain injury sampled at two time points
   during the first year of recovery and show how the AILP procedure can be
   applied to select regions of interest to be used in a graph theoretical
   analysis of plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{A discrete-time random process is described, which can generate bursty
   sequences of events. A Bernoulli process, where the probability of an
   event occurring at time t is given by a fixed probability x, is modified
   to include a memory effect where the event probability is increased
   proportionally to the number of events that occurred within a given
   amount of time preceding t. For small values of x the interevent time
   distribution follows a power law with exponent -2 -x. We consider a
   dynamic network where each node forms, and breaks connections according
   to this process. The value of x for each node depends on the fitness
   distribution,.(x), from which it is drawn; we find exact solutions for
   the expectation of the degree distribution for a variety of possible
   fitness distributions, and for both cases where the memory effect either
   is, or is not present. This work can potentially lead to methods to
   uncover hidden fitness distributions from fast changing, temporal
   network data, such as online social communications and fMRI scans.}},

Title = {{Abnormal Social Reward Responses in Anorexia Nervosa: An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) display impaired social
   interactions, implicated in the development and prognosis of the
   disorder. Importantly, social behavior is modulated by reward-based
   processes, and dysfunctional at-brain-level reward responses have been
   involved in AN neurobiological models. However, no prior evidence exists
   of whether these neural alterations would be equally present in social
   contexts. In this study, we conducted a cross-sectional social-judgment
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 20
   restrictive-subtype AN patients and 20 matched healthy controls. Brain
   activity during acceptance and rejection was investigated and correlated
   with severity measures (Eating Disorder Inventory -EDI-2) and with
   personality traits of interest known to modulate social behavior (The
   Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire).
   Patients showed hypoactivation of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   (DMPFC) during social acceptance and hyperactivation of visual areas
   during social rejection. Ventral striatum activation during rejection
   was positively correlated in patients with clinical severity scores.
   During acceptance, activation of the frontal opercula-anterior insula
   and dorsomedial/dorsolateral prefrontal cortices was differentially
   associated with reward sensitivity between groups. These results suggest
   an abnormal motivational drive for social stimuli, and involve
   overlapping social cognition and reward systems leading to a disruption
   of adaptive responses in the processing of social reward. The specific
   association of reward-related regions with clinical and psychometric
   measures suggests the putative involvement of reward structures in the
   maintenance of pathological behaviors in AN.}},

   Study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{Bilingual speakers may select between two languages either on demand
   (forced language selection) or on their own volition (free language
   selection). However, the neural substrates underlying free and forced
   language selection may differ. While the neural substrates underlying
   forced language selection have been well-explored with language
   switching paradigms, those underlying free language selection have
   remained unclear. Using a modified digit-naming switching paradigm, we
   addressed the neural substrates underlying free language selection by
   contrasting free language switching with forced language switching. For
   a digit-pair trial, Chinese-English bilinguals named each digit in
   Chinese or English either on demand under forced language selection
   condition or on their own volition under free language selection
   condition. The results revealed activation in the frontoparietal regions
   that mediate volition of language selection. Furthermore, a comparison
   of free and forced language switching demonstrated differences in the
   patterns of brain activation. Additionally, free language switching
   showed reduced switching costs as compared to forced language switching.
   These findings suggest differences between the mechanism(s) underlying
   free and forced language switching. As such, the current study suggests
   interactivity between control of volition and control of language
   switching in free language selection, providing insights into a model of
   bilingual language control.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a neurocomputational model of altruistic choice and test it
   using behavioral and fMRI data from a task in which subjects make
   choices between real monetary prizes for themselves and another. We show
   that a multi-attribute drift-diffusion model, in which choice results
   from accumulation of a relative value signal that linearly weights
   payoffs for self and other, captures key patterns of choice, reaction
   time, and neural response in ventral striatum, temporoparietal junction,
   and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The model generates several novel
   insights into the nature of altruism. It explains when and why generous
   choices are slower or faster than selfish choices, and why they produce
   greater response in TPJ and vmPFC, without invoking competition between
   automatic and deliberative processes or reward value for generosity. It
   also predicts that when one's own payoffs are valued more than others',
   some generous acts may reflect mistakes rather than genuinely pro-social
   preferences.}},

Title = {{Decoding illusory self-location from activity in the human hippocampus}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Decades of research have demonstrated a role for the hippocampus in
   spatial navigation and episodic and spatial memory. However, empirical
   evidence linking hippocampal activity to the perceptual experience of
   being physically located at a particular place in the environment is
   lacking. In this study, we used a multisensory out-of-body illusion to
   perceptually `teleport' six healthy participants between two different
   locations in the scanner room during high-resolution functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). The participants were fitted with
   MRI-compatible head-mounted displays that changed their first-person
   visual perspective to that of a pair of cameras placed in one of two
   corners of the scanner room. To elicit the illusion of being physically
   located in this position, we delivered synchronous visuo-tactile
   stimulation in the form of an object moving toward the cameras coupled
   with touches applied to the participant's chest. Asynchronous
   visuo-tactile stimulation did not induce the illusion and served as a
   control condition. We found that illusory self-location could be
   successfully decoded from patterns of activity in the hippocampus in all
   of the participants in the synchronous (P < 0.05) but not in the
   asynchronous condition (P> 0.05). At the group-level, the decoding
   accuracy was significantly higher in the synchronous than in the
   asynchronous condition (P = 0.012). These findings associate hippocampal
   activity with the perceived location of the bodily self in space, which
   suggests that the human hippocampus is involved not only in spatial
   navigation and memory but also in the construction of our sense of
   bodily self-location.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions represent one of the most salient cues in our
   environment. They communicate the affective state and intent of an
   individual and, if interpreted correctly, adaptively influence the
   behavior of others in return. Processing of such affective stimuli is
   known to require reciprocal signaling between central viscerosensory
   brain regions and peripheral-autonomic body systems, culminating in
   accurate emotion discrimination. Despite emerging links between sleep
   and affective regulation, the impact of sleep loss on the discrimination
   of complex social emotions within and between the CNS and PNS remains
   unknown. Here, we demonstrate in humans that sleep deprivation impairs
   both viscerosensory brain ( anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex,
   amygdala) and autonomic-cardiac discrimination of threatening from
   affiliative facial cues. Moreover, sleep deprivation significantly
   degrades the normally reciprocal associations between these central and
   peripheral emotion-signaling systems, most prominent at the level of
   cardiac-amygdala coupling. In addition, REM sleep physiology across the
   sleep-rested night significantly predicts the next-day success of
   emotional discrimination within this viscerosensory network across
   individuals, suggesting a role for REM sleep in affective brain
   recalibration. Together, these findings establish that sleep deprivation
   compromises the faithful signaling of, and the ``embodied{''}
   reciprocity between, viscerosensory brain and peripheral autonomic body
   processing of complex social signals. Such impairments hold ecological
   relevance in professional contexts in which the need for accurate
   interpretation of social cues is paramount yet insufficient sleep is
   pervasive.}},

Abstract = {{Across species, including non-human primates, rodents, and humans,
   prosocial behavior, the act of helping others, is preferentially
   provided to members of one's own group. Whereas a particularly
   ubiquitous example of this is kinship, whereby humans and animals expend
   greater resources and take more risks for their own kin, in-group
   prosocial behavior has been demonstrated among diverse shared social
   groups, including race and culture. In the current study, we made group
   membership salient by recruiting Chinese and American participants to
   engage in a prosocial decision-making task during fMRI with an American
   and Chinese confederate. We found across all participants that donations
   to the in-group relative to out-group was associated with increased
   activation in the ventral striatum. Moreover, participants with a
   greater sense of group identity and Chinese participants relative to
   American participants, showed heightened activation in self-control
   (VLPFC, ACC) and mentalizing (TPJ, DMPFC) regions when contributing to
   the out-group relative to in-group. Our findings provide novel evidence
   about the neural mechanisms involved in intergroup prosocial behavior.

Title = {{Developmental sex differences in resting state functional connectivity
   of amygdala sub-regions}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{235-244}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{During adolescence, considerable social and biological changes occur
   that interact with functional brain maturation, some of which are
   sex-specific. The amygdala is one brain area that has displayed sexual
   dimorphism, specifically in socio-affective (superficial amygdala
   {[}SFA]), stress (centromedial amygdala {[}CMA]), and learning and
   memory (basolateral amygdala {[}BLA]) processing. The amygdala has also
   been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders which display sex-specific
   features, most prominently observed during adolescence. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study examined the
   interaction of age and sex on resting state functional connectivity
   (RSFC) of amygdala sub-regions, BLA and SFA, in a sample of healthy
   adolescents between the ages 10 and 16 years (n = 122, 71 boys).
   Whole-brain, voxel-wise partial correlation analyses were conducted to
   determine RSFC of bilateral BLA and SFA seed regions, created using the
   Eickhoff-Zilles maximum probability maps based on cytoarchitectonic
   mapping and FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool
   (FIRST). Monte Carlo simulation was implemented to correct for multiple
   comparisons (threshold of 53 contiguous voxels with a z-value >= 2.25).
   Results indicated that with increasing age, there was a corresponding
   decrease in RSFC between both amygdala sub-regions and parieto-occipital
   cortices, with a concurrent increase in RSFC with medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC). Specifically, boys and girls demonstrated increased
   coupling of mPFC and left and right SFA with age, respectively; however,
   neither sex showed increased connectivity between mPFC and BLA, which
   could indicate relative immaturity of fronto-limbic networks that is
   similar across sex. A dissociation in connectivity between BLA- and
   SFA-parieto-occipital RSFC emerged, in which girls had weaker negative
   RSFC between SFA and parieto-occipital regions and boys had weaker
   negative RSFC of BLA and parieto-occipital regions with increased age,
   both standing in contrast to adult patterns of amygdala sub-regional
   RSFC. The present findings suggest relative immaturity of amygdala
   sub-regional RSFC with parieto-occipital cortices during adolescence,
   with unique patterns in both sexes that may support memory and
   socio-affective processing in boys and girls, respectively.
   Understanding the underlying normative functional architecture of brain
   networks associated with the amygdala during adolescence may better
   inform future research of the neural features associated with increased
   risk for internalizing psychopathology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Perceived life stress exposure modulates reward-related medial

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{180}},
Pages = {{104-111}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often precipitated by
   life stress and growing evidence suggests that stress induced
   alterations in reward processing may contribute to such risk. However,
   no human imaging studies have examined how recent life stress exposure
   modulates the neural systems that underlie reward processing in
   depressed and healthy individuals.
   Methods: In this proof-of-concept study, 12 MDD and 10 psychiatrically
   healthy individuals were interviewed using the Life Events arid
   Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) to assess their perceived levels of recent
   acute and chronic life stress exposure. Additionally, each participant
   performed a monetary incentive delay task under baseline (no stress) and
   stress (social evaluative) conditions during functional MRL
   Results: Across groups, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation to
   reward feedback was greater during acute stress versus no-stress
   conditions in individuals with greater perceived stressor severity.
   Under acute stress, depressed individuals showed a positive correlation
   between perceived stressor severity levels and reward-related mPFC
   activation (r=0.79, p=0.004), whereas no effect was found in healthy
   controls. Moreover, for depressed (but not healthy) individuals, the
   correlations between the stress (r=0.79) and no-stress (r=0.48)
   conditions were significantly different. Finally, reMtive to controls,
   depressed participants showed significantly reduced mPFC gray matter,
   but functional findings remained robust while accounting for structural
   differences.
   Limitation: Small sample size, which warrants replication.
   Conclusion: Depressed individuals experiencing greater recent life
   stress recruited the mPFC more under stress when processing rewards. Our
   results represent an initial step toward elucidating mechanisms
   underlying stress sensitization and recurrence in depression. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The goal of cognitive neuroscience is to integrate cognitive models with
   knowledge about underlying neural machinery. This significant challenge
   was explored in relation to word reading, where sophisticated
   computational-cognitive models exist but have made limited contact with
   neural data. Using distortion-corrected functional MRI and dynamic
   causal modeling, we investigated the interactions between brain regions
   dedicated to orthographic, semantic, and phonological processing while
   participants read words aloud. We found that the lateral anterior
   temporal lobe exhibited increased activation when participants read
   words with irregular spellings. This area is implicated in semantic
   processing but has not previously been considered part of the reading
   network. We also found meaningful individual differences in the
   activation of this region: Activity was predicted by an independent
   measure of the degree to which participants use semantic knowledge to
   read. These characteristics are predicted by the connectionist Triangle
   Model of reading and indicate a key role for semantic knowledge in
   reading aloud. Premotor regions associated with phonological processing
   displayed the reverse characteristics. Changes in the functional
   connectivity of the reading network during irregular word reading also
   were consistent with semantic recruitment. These data support the view
   that reading aloud is underpinned by the joint operation of two neural
   pathways. They reveal that (i) the ATL is an important element of the
   ventral semantic pathway and (ii) the division of labor between the two
   routes varies according to both the properties of the words being read
   and individual differences in the degree to which participants rely on
   each route.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that multisensory stimuli can contribute to
   attention control. Here we investigate whether irrelevant audio visual
   stimuli can affect the processing of subsequent visual targets, in the
   absence of any direct bottom up signals generated by low-level sensory
   changes and any goal-related associations between the multisensory
   stimuli and the visual targets. Each trial included two pictures
   (cat/dog), one in each visual hemifield, and a central sound that was
   semantically congruent with one of the two pictures (i.e., either
   ``meow{''} or ``woof{''} sound). These irrelevant audio visual stimuli
   were followed by a visual target that appeared either where the
   congruent or the incongruent picture had been presented (valid/invalid
   trials). The visual target was a Gabor patch requiring an orientation
   discrimination judgment, allowing us to uncouple the visual task from
   the audio visual stimuli. Behaviourally we found lower performance for
   invalid than valid trials, but only when the task demands were high
   (Gabor target presented together with a Gabor distractor vs. Gabor
   target alone). The fMRI analyses revealed greater activity for invalid
   than for valid trials in the dorsal and the ventral fronto-parietal
   attention networks. The dorsal network was recruited irrespective of
   task demands, while the ventral network was recruited only when task
   demands were high and target discrimination required additional top down
   control. We propose that crossmodal semantic congruence generates a
   processing bias associated with the location of congruent picture, and
   that the presentation of the visual target on the opposite side required
   updating these processing priorities. We relate the activation of the
   attention networks to these updating operations. We conclude that the
   fronto-parietal networks mediate the influence of crossmodal semantic
   congruence on visuo-spatial processing, even in the absence of any
   low-level sensory cue and any goal-driven task associations.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals' reading skills are critical for their educational
   development, but variation in reading skills is known to be large. The
   present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   examine the role of spontaneous brain activity at rest in individual
   differences in reading skills in a large sample of participants (N =
   263). Specifically, we correlated individuals' word-reading skill with
   their fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) of the
   whole brain at rest and found that the fALFFs of both the bilateral
   precentral gyrus (PCG) and superior temporal plane (STP) were positively
   associated with reading skills. The fALFF-reading association observed
   in these two regions remained after controlling for general cognitive
   abilities and in-scanner head motion. A cross-validation confirmed that
   the individual differences in word-reading skills were reliably
   correlated with the fALFF values of the bilateral PCG and STP. A
   follow-up task-based fMRI experiment revealed that the readingrelated
   regions overlapped with regions showing a higher response to sentences
   than to pseudo-sentences (strings of pseudo-words), suggesting the
   resting-state brain activity partly captures the characteristics of
   task-based brain activity. In short, our study provides one of the first
   pieces of evidence that links spontaneous brain activity to reading
   behavior and offers an easy-to-access neural marker for evaluating
   reading skill. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Most current studies investigating semantic memory have focused on
   associative (ringemerald) or taxonomic relations (bird-sparrow). Little
   is known about the question of how causal relations (virus-epidemic) are
   stored and accessed in semantic memory. The goal of this study was to
   examine the processing of causally related, general associatively
   related and hierarchically related word pairs when participants were
   required to evaluate whether pairs of words were related in any way. The
   ERP data showed that the N400 amplitude (200-500ms) elicited by
   unrelated related words was more negative than all related words.
   Furthermore, the late frontal distributed negativity (500-700ms)
   elicited by causally related words was smaller than hierarchically
   related words, but not for general associated words. These results
   suggested the processing of causal relations and hierarchical relations
   in semantic memory recruited different degrees of cognitive resources,
   especially for role binding.}},

Title = {{Reconfiguration of the Brain Functional Network Associated with Visual
   Task Demands}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the topological properties
   of resting-state brain functional networks are modulated through task
   performances. However, the reconfiguration of functional networks
   associated with distinct degrees of task demands is not well understood.
   In the present study, we acquired fMRI data from 18 healthy adult
   volunteers during resting-state (RS) and two visual tasks (i.e., visual
   stimulus watching, VSW; and visual stimulus decision, VSD).
   Subsequently, we constructed the functional brain networks associated
   with these three conditions and analyzed the changes in the topological
   properties (e.g., network efficiency, wiring-cost, modularity, and
   robustness) among them. Although the small-world attributes were
   preserved qualitatively across the functional networks of the three
   conditions, changes in the topological properties were also observed.
   Compared with the resting-state, the functional networks associated with
   the visual tasks exhibited significantly increased network efficiency
   and wiring-cost, but decreased modularity and network robustness. The
   changes in the task-related topological properties were modulated
   according to the task complexity (i.e., from RS to VSW and VSD).
   Moreover, at the regional level, we observed that the increased nodal
   efficiencies in the visual and working memory regions were positively
   associated with the increase in task complexity. Together, these results
   suggest that the increased efficiency of the functional brain network
   and higher wiring-cost were observed to afford the demands of visual
   tasks. These observations provide further insights into the mechanisms
   underlying the reconfiguration of the brain network during task
   performance.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{376-390}},

Abstract = {{The ``mere ownership effect{''} refers to individuals' tendency to
   evaluate objects they own more favorably than comparable objects they do
   not own. There are numerous behavioral demonstrations of the mere
   ownership effect, but the neural mechanisms underlying the expression of
   this self-positivity bias during the evaluation of self-associated
   objects have not been identified. The present study aimed to identify
   the neurobiological expression of the mere ownership effect and to
   assess the potential influence of motivational context. During fMRI
   scanning, participants made evaluations of objects after ownership had
   been assigned under the presence or absence of self-esteem threat. In
   the absence of threat, the mere ownership effect was associated with
   brain regions implicated in processing personal/affective significance
   and valence (ventromedial prefrontal cortex {[}vMPFC], ventral anterior
   cingulate cortex {[}vACC], and medial orbitofrontal cortex {[}mOFC]). In
   contrast, in the presence of threat, the mere ownership effect was
   associated with brain regions implicated in selective/inhibitory
   cognitive control processes (inferior frontal gyrus {[}IFG], middle
   frontal gyrus {[}MFG], and lateral orbitofrontal cortex {[}lOFC]). These
   findings indicate that depending on motivational context, different
   neural mechanisms (and thus likely different psychological processes)
   support the behavioral expression of self-positivity bias directed
   toward objects that are associated with the self.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced awareness of illness is a well-known phenomenon that has been
   understudied in remitted patients with bipolar disorder. In particular,
   the relationship between reduced awareness and executive dysfunction is
   an intriguing question that has yet to be resolved. The aim of the
   current study is to analyze the link between reduced awareness, brain
   dysfunction, and concomitant cognitive-behavioral disturbances from a
   neurocognitive perspective. In previous studies, we demonstrated the
   role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the unawareness of
   distinct pathologies that exhibit overlapping symptoms in the context of
   overlapping circuit-specific dysfunction. Given the clinical importance
   of the results obtained, the present study considers six aware and four
   unaware remitted bipolar disorder patients. Cingulate functionality was
   assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging while patients
   performed a go/no-go task. Patients were also studied on an overall
   cognitive task battery and with behavioral assessment of mood changes in
   terms of apathy and disinhibited behavior. Unaware patients showed
   frontoparietal hypo-perfusion, with a significant reduction of
   task-sensitive activity in the bilateral superior and middle frontal
   gyrus, putamen, insular, and ACCs.}},

Number = {{2-3, SI}},
Pages = {{118-133}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Mirror-touch synesthesia (MTS) is the conscious experience of tactile
   sensations induced by seeing someone else touched. This paper considers
   two different, although not mutually exclusive, theoretical explanations
   and, in the final section, considers the relation between MTS and other
   forms of synesthesia and also other kinds of vicarious perception (e.g.,
   contagious yawning). The Threshold Theory explains MTS in terms of
   hyper-activity within a mirror system for touch and/or pain. This offers
   a good account for some of the evidence (e.g., from fMRI) but fails to
   explain the whole pattern (e.g., structural brain differences outside of
   this system; performance on some tests of social cognition). The
   Self-Other Theory explains MTS in terms of disturbances in the ability
   to distinguish the self from others. This can be construed in terms of
   over-extension of the bodily self in to others, or as difficulties in
   the control of body-based self-other representations. In this account,
   MTS is a symptom of a broader cognitive profile. We suggest this meets
   the criteria for synesthesia, despite the proximal causal mechanisms
   remaining largely unknown, and that the tendency to localize vicarious
   sensory experiences distinguishes it from other kinds of seemingly
   related phenomena (e.g., non-localized affective responses to observing
   pain).}},

Abstract = {{Autism is marked by impairments in social reciprocity and communication,
   along with restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. Prior
   studies have separately investigated social processing and executive
   function in autism, but little is known about the brain mechanisms of
   cognitive control for both emotional and nonemotional stimuli. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify differences in
   neurocircuitry between individuals with high functioning autism (HFA)
   and neurotypical controls during two versions of a go/no-go task:
   emotional (fear and happy faces) and nonemotional (English letters).
   During the letter task, HFA participants showed hypoactivation in the
   ventral prefrontal cortex. During the emotion task, happy faces elicited
   activation in the ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens and anterior
   amygdala in neurotypical, but not HFA, participants. Response inhibition
   for fear faces compared with happy faces recruited occipitotemporal
   regions in HFA, but not neurotypical, participants. In a direct contrast
   of emotional no-go and letter no-go blocks, HFA participants showed
   hyperactivation in extrastriate cortex and fusiform gyrus. Accuracy for
   emotional no-go trials was negatively correlated with activation in
   fusiform gyrus in the HFA group. These results indicate that autism is
   associated with abnormal processing in socioemotional brain networks,
   and support the theory that autism is marked by a social motivational
   deficit. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Parental criticism can have positive and negative effects on children's
   and adolescents' behavior; yet, it is unclear how youth react to,
   understand and process parental criticism. We proposed that youth would
   engage three sets of neural processes in response to parental criticism
   including the following: (i) activating emotional reactions, (ii)
   regulating those reactions and (iii) social cognitive processing (e.g.
   understanding the parent's mental state). To examine neural processes
   associated with both emotional and social processing of parental
   criticism in personally relevant and ecologically valid social contexts,
   typically developing youth were scanned while they listened to their
   mother providing critical, praising and neutral statements. In response
   to maternal criticism, youth showed increased brain activity in
   affective networks (e.g. subcortical-limbic regions including lentiform
   nucleus and posterior insula), but decreased activity in cognitive
   control networks (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudal
   anterior cingulate cortex) and social cognitive networks (e.g.
   temporoparietal junction and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus).
   These results suggest that youth may respond to maternal criticism with
   increased emotional reactivity but decreased cognitive control and
   social cognitive processing. A better understanding of children's
   responses to parental criticism may provide insights into the ways that
   parental feedback can be modified to be more helpful to behavior and
   development in youth.}},

Abstract = {{Attention bias modification (ABM) procedures typically reduce anxiety
   symptoms, yet little is known about the neural changes associated with
   this behavioral treatment. Healthy adults with high social anxiety
   symptoms (n = 53) were randomized to receive either active or placebo
   ABM. Unlike placebo ABM, active ABM aimed to train individuals'
   attention away from threat. Using the dot-probe task, threat-related
   attention bias was measured during magnetic resonance imaging before and
   after acute and extended training over 4 weeks. A subset of participants
   completed all procedures (n = 30, 15 per group). Group differences in
   neural activation were identified using standard analyses. Linear
   regression tested predictive factors of symptom reduction (i.e.,
   training group, baseline indices of threat bias). The active and placebo
   groups exhibited different patterns of right and left amygdala
   activation with training. Across all participants irrespective of group,
   individuals with greater left amygdala activation in the threat-bias
   contrast prior to training exhibited greater symptom reduction. After
   accounting for baseline amygdala activation, greater symptom reduction
   was associated with assignment to the active training group. Greater
   left amygdala activation at baseline predicted reductions in social
   anxiety symptoms following ABM. Further research is needed to clarify
   brain-behavior mechanisms associated with ABM training.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies using the social-exclusion paradigm Cyberball
   indicate increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right
   insula activity as a function of exclusion. However, comparatively less
   work has been done on how social status factors may moderate this
   finding. This study used the Cyberball paradigm with 85 (45 females)
   socio-economically diverse participants from a larger longitudinal
   sample. We tested whether neighborhood quality during adolescence would
   predict subsequent neural responding to social exclusion in young
   adulthood. Given previous behavioral studies indicating greater social
   vigilance and negative evaluation as a function of lower status, we
   expected that lower adolescent neighborhood quality would predict
   greater dACC activity during exclusion at young adulthood. Our findings
   indicate that young adults who lived in low-quality neighborhoods in
   adolescence showed greater dACC activity to social exclusion than those
   who lived in higher quality neighborhoods. Lower neighborhood quality
   also predicted greater prefrontal activation in the superior frontal
   gyrus, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and the middle frontal gyrus,
   possibly indicating greater regulatory effort. Finally, this effect was
   not driven by subsequent ratings of distress during exclusion. In sum,
   adolescent neighborhood quality appears to potentiate neural responses
   to social exclusion in young adulthood, effects that are independent of
   felt distress.}},

Abstract = {{Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with
   decreased ventral-striatal responsiveness during reward anticipation.
   However, previous research mostly focused on adults with heterogeneous
   ADHD subtype and divers drug treatment status while studies in children
   with ADHD are sparse. Moreover, it remains unclear to what degree ADHD
   is characterized by a delay of normal brain structure or function
   maturation. We therefore attempt to determine whether results from
   structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are
   associated with childhood and adult ADHD combined subtype (ADHD-CT).
   This study used fMRI to compare VS structure and function of 30
   participants with ADHD-CT (16 adults, 14 children) and 30 controls (20
   adults, 10 children), using a monetary incentive delay task. Joint
   analyses of structural and functional imaging data were conducted with
   Biological Parametric Mapping. Reward anticipation elicited decreased
   ventral-striatal responsiveness in adults but not in children with
   ADHD-CT. Children and adults with ADHD showed reduced ventral-striatal
   volume. Taking these gray matter differences into account, the results
   remained the same. These results suggest that decreased ventral-striatal
   responsiveness during reward anticipation is present in adults but not
   in children with ADHD-CT, irrespective of structural characteristics.
   The question arises whether ventral-striatal hypoactivity is an ADHD
   correlate that develops during the course of illness.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the functional connectivity of the subgenual anterior
   cingulate cortex (SGC) have been linked with depressive symptoms. The
   aim of this study was to map this relationship across mid to late
   adolescence. Employing a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) design, associations between patterns of resting-state
   SGC functional connectivity and symptoms of depression were examined at
   two time points in an initial sample of 72 adolescents. Using a
   region-of-interest approach, these associations were evaluated
   cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Cross-sectionally, weaker SGC
   functional connectivity with the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),
   angular gyrus and dorsal prefrontal cortex at baseline, and weaker SGC
   connectivity with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex at follow-up, were associated with higher
   depressive symptoms. Longitudinally, a decrease in SGC functional
   connectivity with DMPFC, PCC, angular gyrus and middle temporal gyrus
   was associated with higher depressive symptoms at follow-up. The
   observation of weaker SGC connectivity predicting increased symptoms
   contrasts with the majority of resting-state fMRI studies in clinically
   depressed populations. Taken together with these past studies, our
   findings suggest depression-related changes in SGC functional
   connectivity may differ across developmental and illness stages.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety disorder patients were repeatedly found to overestimate the
   association between disorder-relevant stimuli and aversive outcomes
   despite random contingencies. Such an illusory correlation (IC) might
   play an important role in the return of fear after extinction learning;
   yet, little is known about how this cognitive bias emerges in the brain.
   In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 18 female patients
   with spider phobia and 18 healthy controls were exposed to pictures of
   spiders, mushrooms and puppies followed randomly by either a painful
   electrical shock or nothing. In advance, both patients and healthy
   controls expected more shocks after spider pictures. Importantly, only
   patients with spider phobia continued to overestimate this association
   after the experiment. The strength of this IC was predicted by increased
   outcome aversiveness ratings and primary sensory motor cortex activity
   in response to the shock after spider pictures. Moreover, increased
   activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) to spider
   pictures predicted the IC. These results support the theory that
   phobia-relevant stimuli amplify unpleasantness and sensory motor
   representations of aversive stimuli, which in turn may promote their
   overestimation. Hyper-activity in dlPFC possibly reflects a
   pre-occupation of executive resources with phobia-relevant stimuli, thus
   complicating the accurate monitoring of objective contingencies and the
   unlearning of fear.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Thought disorders such as rumination or flight of ideas are
   frequent in patients with mood disorders, and not systematically linked
   to mood state. These symptoms point to anomalies in cognitive processes
   mediating the generation and control of thoughts; for example,
   associative thinking and inhibition. However, their neural substrates
   are not known. Method: To obtain an ecological measure of neural
   processes underlying the generation and suppression of spontaneous
   thoughts, we designed a free word association task during fMRI allowing
   us to explore verbal associative patterns in patients with mood
   disorders and matched controls. Participants were presented with
   emotionally negative, positive or neutral words, and asked to produce
   two words either related or unrelated to these stimuli. Results:
   Relative to controls, patients produced a reverse pattern of answer
   typicality for the related vs unrelated conditions. Controls activated
   larger semantic and executive control networks, as well as basal
   ganglia, precuneus and middle frontal gyrus. Unlike controls, patients
   activated fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and medial prefrontal
   cortex for emotional stimuli. Conclusions: Mood disorder patients are
   impaired in automated associative processes, but prone to produce more
   unique/personal associations through activation of memory and
   self-related areas.}},

Abstract = {{Moral decisions and social relationships are often characterized by
   strong feelings of ambivalence which can be a catalyst for emotional
   distress and several health-related problems. The anterior cingulate
   cortex (ACC) has been identified as a key brain region in monitoring
   conflicting information, but the neurobiological substrates of
   ambivalence processing are still widely unknown. We have conducted two
   randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, functional magnetic
   resonance imaging experiments involving 70 healthy male volunteers to
   investigate the effects of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) on neural and
   behavioral correlates of ambivalence. We chose moral decision-making and
   the imagery of partner infidelity as examples to probe volitional and
   emotional ambivalence. In both experiments, intranasal OXT diminished
   neural responses in the ACC to ambivalence. Under OXT, moral dilemma
   vignettes also elicited a reduced activation in the orbitofrontal
   cortex, and the imagery of partner infidelity was rated as less
   arousing. Interestingly, the OXT-induced differential activation in the
   ACC predicted the magnitude of arousal reduction. Taken together, our
   findings reveal an unprecedented role of OXT in causing a domain-general
   decrease of neural responses to ambivalence. By alleviating emotional
   distress, OXT may qualify as a treatment option for psychiatric
   disorders with heightened ambivalence sensitivity such as schizophrenia
   or obsessive-compulsive disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) share brain function abnormalities during cognitive
   flexibility. Serotonin is involved in both disorders, and selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can modulate cognitive flexibility
   and improve behavior in both disorders. Thus, this study investigates
   shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions in these 2 disorders
   during reward reversal, and the acute effects of an SSRI on these.
   Age-matched boys with ADHD (15), ASD (18), and controls (21) were
   compared with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a
   reversal task. Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose
   of Fluoxetine or placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
   randomized design. Repeated-measures analyses within patients assessed
   drug effects. Patients under each drug condition were compared with
   controls to assess normalization effects. fMRI data showed that, under
   placebo, ASD boys underactivated medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),
   compared with control and ADHD boys. Both patient groups shared
   decreased precuneus activation. Under Fluoxetine, mPFC activation was
   up-regulated and normalized in ASD boys relative to controls, but
   down-regulated in ADHD boys relative to placebo, which was concomitant
   with worse task performance in ADHD. Fluoxetine therefore has inverse
   effects on mPFC activation in ASD and ADHD during reversal learning,
   suggesting dissociated underlying serotonin abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{The processing of social information in the human brain is widely
   distributed neuroanatomically and finely orchestrated over time.
   However, a detailed account of the spatiotemporal organization of these
   key neural underpinnings of human social cognition remains to be
   elucidated. Here, we applied functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the same participants to
   investigate spatial and temporal neural patterns evoked by viewing
   videos of facial muscle configurations. We show that observing the
   emergence of expressions elicits sustained blood oxygenation
   level-dependent responses in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), a
   region implicated in processing meaningful biological motion. We also
   found corresponding event-related changes in sustained MEG betaband
   (14-30 Hz) oscillatory activity in the STS, consistent with the possible
   role of beta-band activity in visual perception. Dynamically evolving
   fearful and happy expressions elicited early (0-400 ms) transient
   beta-band activity in sensorimotor cortex that persisted beyond 400 ms,
   at which time it became accompanied by a frontolimbic spread (400-1000
   ms). In addition, individual differences in sustained STS beta-band
   activity correlated with speed of emotion recognition, substantiating
   the behavioral relevance of these signals. This STS beta-band activity
   showed valence-specific coupling with the time courses of facial
   movements as they emerged into full-blown fearful and happy expressions
   (negative and positive coupling, respectively). These data offer new
   insights into the perceptual relevance and orchestrated function of the
   STS and interconnected pathways in social-emotion cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Aging affects functional connectivity between brain areas, however, a
   complete picture of how aging affects integration of information within
   and between functional networks is missing. We used complex network
   measures, derived from a brain-wide graph, to provide a comprehensive
   overview of age-related changes in functional connectivity. Functional
   connectivity in young and older participants was assessed during
   resting-state fMRI. The results show that aging has a large impact, not
   only on connectivity within functional networks but also on connectivity
   between the different functional networks in the brain. Brain networks
   in the elderly showed decreased modularity (less distinct functional
   networks) and decreased local efficiency. Connectivity decreased with
   age within networks supporting higher level cognitive functions, that
   is, within the default mode, cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal
   control networks. Conversely, no changes in connectivity within the
   somatomotor and visual networks, networks implicated in primary
   information processing, were observed. Connectivity between these
   networks even increased with age. A brain-wide analysis approach of
   functional connectivity in the aging brain thus seems fundamental in
   understanding how age affects integration of information.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The functional localization of negativity bias, an
   influential index of emotion information processing, has yet to be
   identified.
   Method: Depressed (n = 47) and healthy participants (n = 58) completed a
   clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders, symptom checklists, a
   behavioral task to measure negativity bias, and then viewed positive and
   negative images of social and nonsocial scenes during an event-related
   fMRI task. Two subsamples of participants with high (i.e., 75\%; n = 26)
   and low (i.e., 25\%; n = 26) negativity bias scores were as included in
   subsequent analyses to examine neural differences.
   Results: Depressed participants with a higher, relative to lower,
   negative bias showed significantly greater neural activation in the left
   inferior frontal gyrus.
   Conclusion: High negativity bias evokes a distinctive pattern of brain
   activation in the frontal cortex of depressed participants. Increased
   activation occurred in the left inferior frontal gyrus, related to
   Brodmann area 44, which is associated with language and semantic
   processing, response inhibition, and cognitive reappraisal. This finding
   may reflect an abnormality in integrative emotional processing rather
   than processing of individual emotional dimensions in depressed
   participants with negativity bias. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective We hypothesize that the amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations (ALFF) is involved in the altered regional baseline brain
   function in social anxiety disorder (SAD). The aim of the study was to
   analyze the altered baseline brain activity in drug-naive adult patients
   with SAD.
   Methods We investigated spontaneous and baseline brain activities by
   obtaining the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data
   of 20 drug-naive adult SAD patients and 19 healthy controls. Voxels were
   used to analyze the ALFF values using one- and two-sample t-tests. A
   post-hoc correlation of clinical symptoms was also performed.
   Results Our findings show decreased ALFF in the bilateral insula, left
   medial superior frontal gyrus, left precuneus, left middle temporal
   gyrus, right middle temporal pole, and left fusiform gyrus of the SAD
   group. The SAD patients exhibited significantly increased ALFF in the
   right inferior temporal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, bilateral
   middle occipital gyrus, orbital superior frontal gyrus, right fusiform
   gyrus, right medial superior frontal gyrus, and left parahippocampal
   gyrus. Moreover, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale results for the SAD
   patients were positively correlated with the mean Z values of the right
   middle occipital and right inferior occipital but showed a negative
   correlation with the mean Z values of the right superior temporal gyrus
   and right medial superior frontal gyrus.
   Conclusion These results of the altered regional baseline brain function
   in SAD suggest that the regions with abnormal spontaneous activities are
   involved in the underlying pathophysiology of SAD patients.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo investigate whether a 12-week physical and cognitive
   exercise program can improve cognitive function and brain activation
   efficiency in community-dwelling older adults.
   DesignRandomized controlled trial.
   SettingKyoto, Japan.
   ParticipantsCommunity-dwelling older adults (N=48) were randomized into
   an exercise group (n=24) and a control group (n=24).
   InterventionExercise group participants received a weekly dual
   task-based multimodal exercise class in combination with pedometer-based
   daily walking exercise during the 12-week intervention phase. Control
   group participants did not receive any intervention and were instructed
   to spend their time as usual during the intervention phase.
   MeasurementsThe outcome measures were global cognitive function, memory
   function, executive function, and brain activation (measured using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging) associated with visual short-term
   memory.
   ResultsExercise group participants had significantly greater
   postintervention improvement in memory and executive functions than the
   control group (P<.05). In addition, after the intervention, less
   activation was found in several brain regions associated with visual
   short-term memory, including the prefrontal cortex, in the exercise
   group (P<.001, uncorrected).
   ConclusionA 12-week physical and cognitive exercise program can improve
   the efficiency of brain activation during cognitive tasks in older
   adults, which is associated with improvements in memory and executive
   function.}},

Abstract = {{Since Kraeplin and Kretschmer, the clarification of the limits between

   of the controversy has focused on whether and on which bases can be

   major depressive episode. The new emphasis on the role of clinical
   judgment introduced by DSM-5 can be regarded as a way to address these
   issues, though leaving several questions open. After examining the
   implications of the main topics raised by this still ongoing discussion,
   we will argue that in a clinical reality both mobility and intensity of
   emotional states may account for the discontinuity between ordinary

Abstract = {{The successful acquisition of arithmetic skills is an essential step in
   the development of mathematical competencies and has been associated
   with neural activity in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC). It is
   unclear, however, whether this brain region plays a causal role in
   arithmetic skill acquisition and whether arithmetic learning can be
   modulated by means of non-invasive brain stimulation of this key region.
   In the present study we addressed these questions by applying
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left PPC during
   a short-term training that simulates the typical path of arithmetic
   skill acquisition (specifically the transition from effortful procedural
   to memory-based problem-solving strategies). Sixty participants received
   either anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS while practising complex
   multiplication and subtraction problems. The stability of the
   stimulation-induced learning effects was assessed in a follow-up test
   24h after the training. Learning progress was modulated by tDCS.
   Cathodal tDCS (compared with sham) decreased learning rates during
   training and resulted in poorer performance which lasted over 24h after
   stimulation. Anodal tDCS showed an operation-specific improvement for
   subtraction learning. Our findings extend previous studies by
   demonstrating that the left PPC is causally involved in arithmetic
   learning (and not only in arithmetic performance) and that even a
   short-term tDCS application can modulate the success of arithmetic
   knowledge acquisition. Moreover, our finding of operation-specific
   anodal stimulation effects suggests that the enhancing effects of tDCS
   on learning can selectively affect just one of several cognitive
   processes mediated by the stimulated area.}},

Title = {{Neuroticism modulates the effects of intranasal vasopressin treatment on
   the neural response to positive and negative social interactions}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{108-115}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Neuroticism is a fundamental personality trait associated with proneness
   to feel negative affect. Here we ask how Neuroticism influences the
   neural response to positive and negative social interactions and how
   Neuroticism modulates the effect of intranasal oxytocin (OT) and
   vasopressin (AVP) on the neural response to social interactions. In a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 153 male participants were
   randomized to receive 24 IU intranasal OT, 20 IU AVP or placebo.
   Afterwards, they were imaged with fMRI while playing an iterated
   Prisoner's Dilemma Game. On a different day, subjects completed the NEO
   personality inventory to measure Neuroticism. Neuroticism was positively
   correlated with the neural response to negative social interactions in
   the anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal cortex and with the
   neural response to positive social interactions in the insula,
   indicating that Neuroticism modulates neuropsychological processing of
   both negative and positive social interactions. Neuroticism did not
   modulate the effect of intranasal OT treatment on the neural response to
   either positive or negative social interactions. On the other hand, AVP
   treatment significantly interacted with Neuroticism to modulate the BOLD
   response to both positive and negative social interactions.
   Specifically, AVP increased anterior cingulate cortex/medial prefrontal
   cortex and lateral temporal lobe responses to negative social
   interactions to a greater extent in participants scoring high rather
   than low on Neuroticism. AVP also increased the insula response to
   positive social interactions to a greater extent in participants scoring
   high rather than low on Neuroticism. These results imply that AVP may
   increase emotion regulation in response to negative social interactions
   and the salience of positive social interactions to a greater extent in
   individuals high compared to low in Neuroticism. The current findings
   urge caution against uniform clinical application of nonapeptides and
   suggest that their efficacy may vary as a function of personality. (C)

Abstract = {{Compromised social-perceptual ability has been proposed to contribute to
   social dysfunction in neuro-developmental disorders. While such
   impairments have been identified in Williams syndrome (WS), little is
   known about emotion processing in auditory and multisensory contexts.
   Employing a multidimensional approach, individuals with WS and typical
   development (TD) were tested for emotion identification across fearful,
   happy, and angry multisensory and unisensory face and voice stimuli.
   Autonomic responses were monitored in response to unimodal emotion. The
   WS group was administered an inventory of social functioning.
   Behaviorally, individuals with WS relative to TD demonstrated impaired
   processing of unimodal vocalizations and emotionally incongruent
   audiovisual compounds, reflecting a generalized deficit in
   social-auditory processing in WS. The TD group outperformed their
   counterparts with WS in identifying negative (fearful and angry)
   emotion, with similar between-group performance with happy stimuli.
   Mirroring this pattern, electrodermal activity (EDA) responses to the
   emotional content of the stimuli indicated that whereas those with WS
   showed the highest arousal to happy, and lowest arousal to fearful
   stimuli, the TD participants demonstrated the contrasting pattern. In
   WS, more normal social functioning was related to higher autonomic
   arousal to facial expressions. Implications for underlying neural
   architecture and emotional functions are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   context during four conditions: (a) a baseline of reading silently, (b)
   a scripted classroom activity involving reading aloud, (c) free play
   with peers and toys, and (d) free play with peers and animals (guinea

   compared to TD children in all conditions, except when the animals were
   present. Children with ASD showed a 43\% decrease in skin conductance
   responses during free play with peers in the presence of animals,
   compared to toys. Thus, animals may act as social buffers for children

Abstract = {{In this study, an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis
   was used to conduct a quantitative investigation of neuroimaging studies
   on divergent thinking. Based on the ALE results, the functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies showed that distributed brain regions
   were more active under divergent thinking tasks (DTTs) than those under
   control tasks, but a large portion of the brain regions were
   deactivated. The ALE results indicated that the brain networks of the
   creative idea generation in DTTs may be composed of the lateral
   prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex {[}such as the inferior
   parietal lobule (BA 40) and precuneus (BA 7)], anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) (BA 32), and several regions in the temporal cortex {[}such as the
   left middle temporal gyrus (BA 39), and left fusiform gyrus (BA 37)].
   The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 46) was related to selecting
   the loosely and remotely associated concepts and organizing them into
   creative ideas, whereas the ACC (BA 32) was related to observing and
   forming distant semantic associations in performing DTTs. The posterior
   parietal cortex may be involved in the semantic information related to
   the retrieval and buffering of the formed creative ideas, and several
   regions in the temporal cortex may be related to the stored long-term
   memory. In addition, the ALE results of the structural studies showed
   that divergent thinking was related to the dopaminergic system (e.g.,
   left caudate and claustrum). Based on the ALE results, both fMRI and

Abstract = {{The anterior cingulate cortex is implicated in the neurobiology of
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, few studies have examined
   functional and neurochemical abnormalities specifically in the rostral
   subdivision of the ACC (rACC) in OCD patients. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotional counting Stroop
   task and single-voxel J-resolved proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
   (H-1-MRS) in the rACC to examine the function and neurochemistry of the
   rACC in individuals with OCD and comparison individuals without OCD.
   Between-group differences in rACC activation and glutamine/glutamate
   ratio (Gln/Glu), Glu, and Gln levels, as well as associations between
   rACC activation, Gln/Glu, Glu, Gln, behavioral, and clinical measures
   were examined using linear regression. In a sample of 30 participants
   with OCD and 29 age-and sex-matched participants without OCD,
   participants with OCD displayed significantly reduced rACC deactivation
   compared with those without OCD in response to OCD-specific words versus
   neutral words on the emotional counting Stroop task. However, Gln/Glu,
   Glu, and Gln in the rACC did not differ between groups nor was there an
   association between reduced rACC deactivation and Gln/Glu, Glu, or Gln
   in the OCD group. Taken together, these findings strengthen the evidence
   for rACC dysfunction in OCD, but weigh against an underlying association
   with abnormal rACC glutamatergic neurotransmission.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Impaired emotional processing is a core feature of
   schizophrenia (SZ). Consistent findings suggested that abnormal
   emotional processing in SZ could be paralleled by a disrupted functional
   and structural integrity within the fronto-limbic circuitry. The
   effective connectivity of emotional circuitry in SZ has never been
   explored in terms of causal relationship between brain regions. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM)
   to characterize effective connectivity during implicit processing of
   affective stimuli in SZ.
   Methods: We performed DCM to model connectivity between amygdala (Amy),
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), ventral prefrontal cortex
   (VPFC), fusiform gyrus (FG) and visual cortex (VC) in 25 patients with
   SZ and 29 HC. Bayesian Model Selection and average were performed to
   determine the optimal structural model and its parameters.
   Results: Analyses revealed that patients with SZ are characterized by a
   significant reduced top-down endogenous connectivity from DLPFC to Amy,
   an increased connectivity from Amy to VPFC and a decreased driving input
   to Amy of affective stimuli compared to HC. Furthermore, DLPFC to Amy
   connection in patients significantly influenced the severity of
   psychopathology as rated on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.
   Conclusions: Results suggest a functional disconnection in brain network
   that contributes to the symptomatic outcome of the disorder. Our
   findings support the study of effective connectivity within
   cortico-limbic structures as a marker of severity and treatment efficacy
   in SZ. (c) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The causal attribution of depressive patients in negative
   events was significantly important. However, few previous studies have
   explored its neural underpinnings.
   Methods: The current study examines the neural basis of causal
   attribution in negative events of depressed patients (12) compared with
   healthy controls (12) by using the Attribution Style Task (AST).
   Briefly, participants were presented with 80 sentences describing 40
   positive and 40 negative social events. Participants were asked to
   imagine the event happening to them and select the most likely cause
   with a button press: 1 self (internal), 2 another person, and 3
   situation (external).
   Results: Behaviorally, controls showed a self-serving bias, whereas
   patients demonstrated a balanced attributional pattern with the
   attribution scores. Our fMRI results found a significant group
   difference in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus in
   depressed participants compared to normal controls. Moreover, there was
   a significantly increased activation in the IPL during non-self-serving
   attributions in negative events of patients compared to controls. Most
   interestingly, we also found the BOLD signal change of the region of IPL
   was positively related to the duration of the illness of the patients.
   Conclusion: Based on our findings, we may infer that a stronger
   activation of the IPL in depression may demonstrate that depressed
   patients always pay more attention to self-reference in negative events.
   Significance: These interesting findings might provide a biomarker of
   subtle differences in brain signal alterations associated with
   depressive cognitive characteristics. (C) 2014 International Federation

Abstract = {{Obesity contributes to 2.8 million deaths annually, making interventions
   to promote healthy eating critical. Although preliminary research
   suggests that social norms influence eating behavior, the underlying
   psychological and neural mechanisms of such conformity remain
   unexplored. We used fMRI to investigate whether group norms shift
   individuals' preferences for foods at both behavioral and neural levels.
   Hungry participants rated how much they wanted to eat a series of
   healthy and unhealthy foods and, after each trial, saw ratings that
   ostensibly represented their peers' preferences. This feedback was
   manipulated such that peers appeared to prefer each food more than, less
   than, or as much as participants themselves. After a delay, participants
   rerated each food. Participants' second ratings shifted to resemble
   group norms. Initial consensus, as compared to disagreement, with peers
   produced activity in the nucleus accumbens, a region associated with
   reward prediction errors. Furthermore, the strength of this activity
   predicted the extent to which participants' ratings conformed to peer
   ratings, suggesting that the value associated with consensus drives
   social influence. Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), a region
   associated with value computation, initially responded more strongly to
   unhealthy, as compared to healthy, foods. However, this effect was
   overwritten by group norms. After individuals learned their peers'
   preferences, vMPFC responses tracked the popularity, but not the
   healthfulness, of foods. Furthermore, changes in vMPFC activity tracked
   social influence over behavioral ratings. These data provide evidence
   that group norms can shift food preferences, supporting the use of
   norms-based interventions to promote healthy eating.}},

Abstract = {{Many scientific inventions (SI) throughout history were inspired by
   heuristic prototypes (HPs). For instance, an event or piece of knowledge
   similar to displaced water from a tub inspired Archimedes' principle.
   However, the neural mechanisms underlying this insightful problem

   correlates used to solve SI problems facilitated by HPs. Each HP had two
   versions: a literal description with an illustration (LDI) and a literal
   description with no illustration (LDNI). Thirty-two participants were
   divided randomly into these two groups. Blood oxygenation
   level-dependent fMRI contrasts between LDI and LDNI groups were
   measured. Greater activity in the right middle occipital gyrus (RMOG,
   BA19), right precentral gyrus (RPCG, BA4), and left middle frontal gyrus
   (LMFG, BA46) were found within the LDI group as compared to the LDNI
   group. We discuss these results in terms cognitive functions within
   these regions related to problem solving and memory retrieval. (C) 2015

   for both native Chinese and native English speakers, addressed phonology
   relied on the regions in the ventral pathway, whereas assembled
   phonology depended on the regions in the dorsal pathway. More
   importantly, we found that the neural mechanisms of addressed and
   assembled phonologies were shaped by native language experience.
   Specifically, one key region for addressed phonology (i.e., the left
   middle temporal gyrus) showed greater activation for addressed phonology
   in native Chinese speakers, while one key region for assembled phonology
   (i.e., the left supramarginal gyrus) showed more activation for
   assembled phonology in native English speakers. These results provide
   direct neuroimaging evidence for the effect of native language
   experience on the neural mechanisms of phonological access in a new
   language and support the assimilation-accommodation hypothesis. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Brain regions in the ``pain matrix{''}, can be activated by observing or
   reading about others in physical pain. In previous research, we found
   that reading stories about others' emotional suffering, by contrast,
   recruits a different group of brain regions mostly associated with
   thinking about others' minds. In the current study, we examined the
   neural circuits responsible for deliberately regulating empathic
   responses to others' pain and suffering. In Study 1, a sample of
   college-aged participants (n = 18) read stories about physically painful
   and emotionally distressing events during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), while either actively empathizing with the main
   character or trying to remain objective. In Study 2, the same experiment
   was performed with professional social workers, who are chronically
   exposed to human suffering (n=21). Across both studies activity in the
   amygdala was associated with empathic regulation towards others'
   emotional pain, but not their physical pain. In addition,
   psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis and Granger causal
   modeling (GCM) showed that amygdala activity while reading about others'
   emotional pain was preceded by and positively coupled with activity in
   the theory of mind brain regions, and followed by and negatively coupled
   with activity in regions associated with physical pain and bodily
   sensations. Previous work has shown that the amygdala is critically
   involved in the deliberate control of self-focused distress - the
   current results extend the central importance of amygdala activity to
   the control of other-focused empathy, but only when considering others'
   emotional pain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{cTBS delivered to the left somatosensory cortex changes its functional
   connectivity during rest}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{386-397}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{The primary somatosensory cortex (SI) plays a critical role in
   somatosensation as well as in action performance and social cognition.
   Although the SI has been a major target of experimental and clinical
   research using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to
   date information on the effect of TMS over the SI on its resting-state
   functional connectivity is very scant. Here, we explored whether
   continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a repetitive TMS protocol,
   administered over the SI can change the functional connectivity of the
   brain at rest, as measured using resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). In a randomized order on two different days
   we administered active TMS or sham TMS over the left SI. TMS was
   delivered off-line before scanning by means of cTBS. The target area was
   selected previously and individually for each subject as the part of the
   SI activated both when the participant executes and observes actions.
   Three analytical approaches, both theory driven (partial correlations
   and seed based whole brain regression) and more data driven (Independent
   Component Analysis), indicated a reduction in functional connectivity
   between the stimulated part of the SI and several brain regions
   functionally associated with the SI including the dorsal premotor
   cortex, the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and anterior cingulate cortex.
   These findings highlight the impact of cTBS delivered over the SI on its
   functional connectivity at rest. Our data may have implications for
   experimental and therapeutic applications of cTBS over the SI. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Although many different accounts of the functions of the default mode
   network (DMN) have been proposed, few can adequately account for the
   spectrum of different cognitive functions that utilize this network. The
   current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   explore the hypothesis that the role of the DMN in higher order
   cognition is to allow cognition to be shaped by information from stored
   representations rather than information in the immediate environment.
   Using a novel task paradigm, we observed increased BOLD activity in
   regions of the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex
   when individuals made decisions on the location of shapes from the prior
   trial and decreased BOLD activity when individuals made decisions on the
   location of shapes on the current trial. These data are inconsistent
   with views of the DMN as a task-negative system or one that is sensitive
   only to stimuli with strong personal or emotional ties. Instead the
   involvement of the DMN when people make decisions about where a shape
   was, rather than where it is now, supports the hypothesis that the core
   hubs of the DMN allow cognition to be guided by information other than
   the immediate perceptual input. We propose that a variety of different
   forms of higher order thought (such as imagining the future or
   considering the perspective of another person) engage the DMN because
   these more complex introspective forms of higher order thought all
   depend on the capacity for cognition to be shaped by representations
   that are not present in the external environment.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated a combination of three classification algorithms, namely
   the modified maximum uncertainty linear discriminant analysis (mMLDA),
   the centroid method, and the average linkage, with three types of
   features extracted from three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance
   (MR) brain images, specifically MR intensities, grey matter densities,
   and local deformations for distinguishing 49 first episode schizophrenia
   male patients from 49 healthy male subjects. The feature sets were
   reduced using intersubject principal component analysis before
   classification. By combining the classifiers, we were able to obtain
   slightly improved results when compared with single classifiers. The
   best classification performance (81.6\% accuracy, 75.5\% sensitivity,
   and 87.8\% specificity) was significantly better than classification by
   chance. We also showed that classifiers based on features calculated
   using more computation-intensive image preprocessing perform better;
   mMLDA with classification boundary calculated as weighted mean
   discriminative scores of the groups had improved sensitivity but similar
   accuracy compared to the original MLDA; reducing a number of
   eigenvectors during data reduction did not always lead to higher
   classification accuracy, since noise as well as the signal important for
   classification were removed. Our findings provide important information
   for schizophrenia research and may improve accuracy of computer aided
   diagnostics of neuropsychiatric diseases. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{Cognitive functioning is impaired in patients with schizophrenia,
   leading to significant disabilities in everyday functioning. Its
   improvement is an important treatment target. Neurofeedback (NF) seems a
   promising method to address the neural dysfunctions underlying those
   cognitive impairments. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a central
   hub for cognitive processing, is one of the brain regions known to be
   dysfunctional in schizophrenia. Here we conducted NF training based on
   real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with
   schizophrenia to enable them to control their ACC activity. Training was
   performed over 3 days in a group of 11 patients with schizophrenia and
   11 healthy controls. Social feedback was provided in accordance with the
   evoked activity in the selected region of interest (ROI). Neural and
   cognitive strategies were examined off-line. Both groups learned to
   control the activity of their ACC but used different neural strategies:
   patients activated the dorsal and healthy controls the rostral
   subdivision. Patients mainly used imagination of music to elicit
   activity and the control group imagination of sports. In a stepwise
   regression analysis, the difference in neural control did not result
   from the differences in cognitive strategies but from diagnosis alone.
   Based on social reinforcers, patients with schizophrenia can learn to
   regulate localized brain activity. However, cognitive strategies and
   neural network location differ from healthy controls. These data
   emphasize that for therapeutic interventions in patients with
   schizophrenia compensatory strategies may emerge. Specific cognitive
   skills or specific dysfunctional networks should be addressed to train
   impaired skills. Social NF based on fMRI may be one method to accomplish
   precise learning targets.}},

Abstract = {{The human temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is a topic of intense research.
   Imaging studies have identified TPJ activation in association with many
   higher-order functions such as theory-of-mind, episodic memory, and
   attention, causing debate about the distribution of different processes.
   One major challenge is the lack of consensus about the anatomical
   location and extent of the TPJ. Here, we address this problem using
   data-driven analysis to test the hypothesis that the bilateral TPJ can
   be parcellated into subregions. We applied independent component
   analysis (ICA) to task-free fMRI data within a local region around the
   bilateral TPJ, iterating the ICA at multiple model orders and in several
   datasets. The localized analysis allowed finer separation of processes
   and the use of multiple dimensionalities provided qualitative
   information about lateralization. We identified four subdivisions that
   were bilaterally symmetrical and one that was right biased. To test
   whether the independent components (ICs) reflected true subdivisions, we
   performed functional connectivity analysis using the IC coordinates as
   seeds. This confirmed that the subdivisions belonged to distinct
   networks. The right-biased IC was connected with a network often
   associated with attentional processing. One bilateral subdivision was
   connected to sensorimotor regions and another was connected to auditory
   regions. One subdivision that presented as distinct left-and
   right-biased ICs was connected to frontoparietal regions. Another
   subdivision that also had left-and right-biased ICs was connected to
   social or default mode networks. Our results show that the TPJ in both
   hemispheres hosts multiple neural processes with connectivity patterns
   consistent with well developed specialization and lateralization.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{There is a general conception that positive associations to one's trait,
   e.g. `I'm clever', are beneficial for cognitive performance. Scientific
   evidence shows that this is a simplification. In this functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we used written trial-based
   trait feedback `you are clever', or task feedback `your choice was
   correct', on each correct response of a rule-switching task, to
   investigate how the character of positive self-associations influences
   performance outcome. Twenty participants took part in this crossover
   design study. We found that trait feedback was less beneficial for
   motivation and performance improvement, and resulting in enhanced neural
   activation on more difficult bivalent rule trials. This indicates that
   the task was treated as more complex in this condition. For example,
   `you are clever' feedback led to enhanced activation in anterior caudate
   nucleus, an area known to process uncertainty. We further observed that
   activation in anterior paracingulate cortex was sensitive to whether
   self-reflection was imposed by external feedback or generated from
   internal processes, where the latter activation correlated positively
   with performance when following after task feedback. Our results
   illustrate how feedback can evoke self-reflections that either help or
   hinder motivation and performance, most likely by impacting on processes
   of uncertainty. The results support social psychological models
   stipulating that trait focus take resources away from task focus.}},

   Preadolescence: An Anatomic Seed-Based Study of Resting State Networks
   Related to the Posteromedial and Lateral Parietal Cortex}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   Late preterm birth confers increased risk of developmental delay,
   academic difficulties and social deficits. The late third trimester may
   represent a critical period of development of neural networks including
   the default mode network (DMN), which is essential to normal cognition.
   Our objective is to identify functional and structural connectivity
   differences in the posteromedial cortex related to late preterm birth.
   Methods
   Thirty-eight preadolescents (ages 9-13; 19 born in the late preterm
   period (>= 32 weeks gestational age) and 19 at term) without access to
   advanced neonatal care were recruited from a low socioeconomic status
   community in Brazil. Participants underwent neurocognitive testing,
   3-dimensional T1-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and
   resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI). Seed-based probabilistic
   diffusion tractography and RS-fMRI analyses were performed using
   unilateral seeds within the posterior DMN (posterior cingulate cortex,
   precuneus) and lateral parietal DMN (superior marginal and angular
   gyri).
   Results
   Late preterm children demonstrated increased functional connectivity
   within the posterior default mode networks and increased
   anti-correlation with the central-executive network when seeded from the
   posteromedial cortex (PMC). Key differences were demonstrated between
   PMC components with increased anti-correlation with the salience network
   seen only with posterior cingulate cortex seeding but not with precuneus
   seeding. Probabilistic tractography showed increased streamlines within
   the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital
   fasciculus within late preterm children while decreased intrahemispheric
   streamlines were also observed. No significant differences in
   neurocognitive testing were demonstrated between groups.
   Conclusion
   Late preterm preadolescence is associated with altered functional
   connectivity from the PMC and lateral parietal cortex to known
   distributed functional cortical networks despite no significant
   executive neurocognitive differences. Selective increased structural
   connectivity was observed in the setting of decreased posterior
   interhemispheric connections. Future work is needed to determine if
   these findings represent a compensatory adaptation employing alternate
   neural circuitry or could reflect subtle pathology resulting in
   emotional processing deficits not seen with neurocognitive testing.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperscanning
   Most neuroimaging studies of human social cognition have focused on
   brain activity of single subjects. More recently, ``two-person
   neuroimaging{''} has been introduced, with simultaneous recordings of
   brain signals from two subjects involved in social interaction. These
   simultaneous ``hyperscanning{''} recordings have already been carried
   out with a spectrum of neuroimaging modalities, such as functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and
   functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
   Dual MEG Setup
   We have recently developed a setup for simultaneous
   magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings of two subjects that
   communicate in real time over an audio link between two geographically
   separated MEG laboratories. Here we present an extended version of the
   setup, where we have added a video connection and replaced the
   telephone-landline-based link with an Internet connection. Our setup
   enabled transmission of video and audio streams between the sites with a
   one-way communication latency of about 130 ms. Our software that allows
   reproducing the setup is publicly available.
   Validation
   We demonstrate that the audiovisual Internet-based link can mediate
   real-time interaction between two subjects who try to mirror each
   others' hand movements that they can see via the video link. All the
   nine pairs were able to synchronize their behavior. In addition to the
   video, we captured the subjects' movements with accelerometers attached
   to their index fingers; we determined from these signals that the
   average synchronization accuracy was 215 ms. In one subject pair we
   demonstrate inter-subject coherence patterns of the MEG signals that
   peak over the sensorimotor areas contralateral to the hand used in the
   task.}},

   processing in marmosets}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{Vocalizations are behaviorally critical sounds, and this behavioral
   importance is reflected in the ascending auditory system, where
   conspecific vocalizations are increasingly over-represented at higher
   processing stages. Recent evidence suggests that, in macaques, this
   increasing selectivity for vocalizations might culminate in a cortical
   region that is densely populated by vocalization-preferring neurons.
   Such a region might be a critical node in the representation of vocal
   communication sounds, underlying the recognition of vocalization type,
   caller and social context. These results raise the questions of whether
   cortical specializations for vocalization processing exist in other
   species, their cortical location, and their relationship to the auditory
   processing hierarchy. To explore cortical specializations for
   vocalizations in another species, we performed high-field fMRI of the
   auditory cortex of a vocal New World primate, the common marmoset
   (Callithrix jacchus). Using a sparse imaging paradigm, we discovered a
   caudal-rostral gradient for the processing of conspecific vocalizations
   in marmoset auditory cortex, with regions of the anterior temporal lobe
   close to the temporal pole exhibiting the highest preference for
   vocalizations. These results demonstrate similar cortical
   specializations for vocalization processing in macaques and marmosets,
   suggesting that cortical specializations for vocal processing might have
   evolved before the lineages of these species diverged.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence has shown that oxytocin (OT), a mammalian hormone,
   modifies the way social stimuli are perceived and the way they affect
   behavior. Thus, OT may serve as a treatment for psychiatric disorders,
   many of which are characterized by dysfunctional social behavior. To
   explore the neural mechanisms mediating the effects of OT in macaque
   monkeys, we investigated whether OT would modulate functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) responses in face-responsive regions (faces vs.
   blank screen) evoked by the perception of various facial expressions
   (neutral, fearful, aggressive, and appeasing). In the placebo condition,
   we found significantly increased activation for emotional (mainly
   fearful and appeasing) faces compared with neutral faces across the
   face-responsive regions. OT selectively, and differentially, altered
   fMRI responses to emotional expressions, significantly reducing
   responses to both fearful and aggressive faces in face-responsive
   regions while leaving responses to appeasing as well as neutral faces
   unchanged. We also found that OT administration selectively reduced
   functional coupling between the amygdala and areas in the occipital and
   inferior temporal cortex during the viewing of fearful and aggressive
   faces, but not during the viewing of neutral or appeasing faces. Taken
   together, our results indicate homologies between monkeys and humans in
   the neural circuits mediating the effects of OT. Thus, the monkey may be
   an ideal animal model to explore the development of OT-based
   pharmacological strategies for treating patients with dysfunctional
   social behavior.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Childhood poverty negatively impacts physical and mental health in
   adulthood. Altered brain development in response to social and
   environmental factors associated with poverty likely contributes to this
   effect, engendering maladaptive patterns of social attribution and/or
   elevated physiological stress. In this fMRI study, we examined the
   association between childhood poverty and neural processing of social
   signals (i.e., emotional faces) in adulthood. Fifty-two subjects from a
   longitudinal prospective study recruited as children, participated in a
   brain imaging study at 23-25 years of age using the Emotional Faces
   Assessment Task. Childhood poverty, independent of concurrent adult
   income, was associated with higher amygdala and medial prefrontal
   cortical (mPFC) responses to threat vs. happy faces. Also, childhood
   poverty was associated with decreased functional connectivity between
   left amygdala and mPFC. This study is unique, because it prospectively
   links childhood poverty to emotional processing during adulthood,
   suggesting a candidate neural mechanism for negative social-emotional
   bias. Adults who grew up poor appear to be more sensitive to social
   threat cues and less sensitive to positive social cues.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{Novelty seeking (NS) is a personality trait reflecting excitement in
   response to novel stimuli. High NS is usually a predictor of risky
   behaviour such as drug abuse. However, the relationships between NS and
   risk-related cognitive processes, including individual risk preference
   and the brain activation associated with risk prediction, remain
   elusive. In this fMRI study, participants completed the Tridimensional
   Personality Questionnaire to measure NS and performed a probabilistic
   decision making task. Using a mathematical model, we estimated
   individual risk preference. Brain regions associated with risk
   prediction were determined via fMRI. The NS score showed a positive
   correlation with risk preference and a negative correlation with the
   activation elicited by risk prediction in the right posterior insula
   (r-PI), left anterior insula (l-AI), right striatum (r-striatum) and
   supplementary motor area (SMA). Within these brain regions, only the
   activation associated with risk prediction in the r-PI showed a
   correlation with NS after controlling for the effect of risk preference.
   Resting-state functional connectivity between the r-PI and
   r-striatum/l-AI was negatively correlated with NS. Our results suggest
   that high NS may be associated with less aversion to risk and that the
   r-PI plays an important role in relating risk prediction to NS.}},

Abstract = {{Children who sustain a prenatal or perinatal brain injury in the form of
   a stroke develop remarkably normal cognitive functions in certain areas,
   with a particular strength in language skills. A dominant explanation
   for this is that brain regions from the contralesional hemisphere ``take
   over{''} their functions, whereas the damaged areas and other
   ipsilesional regions play much less of a role. However, it is difficult
   to tease apart whether changes in neural activity after early brain
   injury are due to damage caused by the lesion or by processes related to
   postinjury reorganization. We sought to differentiate between these two
   causes by investigating the functional connectivity (FC) of brain areas
   during the resting state in human children with early brain injury using
   a computational model. We simulated a large-scale network consisting of
   realistic models of local brain areas coupled through anatomical
   connectivity information of healthy and injured participants. We then
   compared the resulting simulated FC values of healthy and injured
   participants with the empirical ones. We found that the empirical
   connectivity values, especially of the damaged areas, correlated better
   with simulated values of a healthy brain than those of an injured brain.
   This result indicates that the structural damage caused by an early
   brain injury is unlikely to have an adverse and sustained impact on the
   functional connections, albeit during the resting state, of damaged
   areas. Therefore, these areas could continue to play a role in the
   development of near-normal function in certain domains such as language
   in these children.}},

Abstract = {{Marked endocrine alterations occur after delivery. Most women cope well
   with these changes, but the postpartum period is associated with an
   increased risk of depressive episodes. Previous studies of emotion
   processing have focused on maternal-infant bonding or postpartum
   depression (PPD), and longitudinal studies of the neural correlates of
   emotion processing throughout the postpartum period in healthy women are
   lacking. In this study, 13 women, without signs of post partum
   depression, underwent fMRI with an emotional face matching task and
   completed the MADRS-S, STAI-S, and EPDS within 48 h (early postpartum)
   and 4-6 weeks after delivery (late postpartum). Also, data from a
   previous study including 15 naturally cycling controls assessed in the
   luteal and follicular phase of the menstrual cycle was used. Women had
   lower reactivity in insula, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and inferior
   frontal gyrus (IFG) in the early as compared to the late postpartum
   assessment. Insular reactivity was positively correlated with anxiety in
   the early postpartum period and with depressive symptoms late
   postpartum. Reactivity in insula and IFG were greater in postpartum
   women than in non-pregnant control subjects. Brain reactivity was not
   correlated with serum estradiol or progesterone levels. Increased
   reactivity in the insula, IFG, and MFG may reflect normal postpartum
   adaptation, but correlation with self-rated symptoms of depression and
   anxiety in these otherwise healthy postpartum women, may also suggest
   that these changes place susceptible women at increased risk of PPD.
   These findings contribute to our understanding of the neurobiological
   aspects of the postpartum period, which might shed light on the
   mechanisms underlying affective puerperal disorders, such as PPD.}},

Title = {{Why Social Pain Can Live on: Different Neural Mechanisms Are Associated
   with Reliving Social and Physical Pain}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Although social and physical pain recruit overlapping neural activity in
   regions associated with the affective component of pain, the two pains
   can diverge in their phenomenology. Most notably, feelings of social
   pain can be re-experienced or ``relived,{''} even when the painful
   episode has long passed, whereas feelings of physical pain cannot be
   easily relived once the painful episode subsides. Here, we observed that
   reliving social (vs. physical) pain led to greater self-reported
   re-experienced pain and greater activity in affective pain regions
   (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula). Moreover, the
   degree of relived pain correlated positively with affective pain system
   activity. In contrast, reliving physical (vs. social) pain led to
   greater activity in the sensory-discriminative pain system (primary and
   secondary somatosensory cortex and posterior insula), which did not
   correlate with relived pain. Preferential engagement of these different
   pain mechanisms may reflect the use of different top-down neurocognitive
   pathways to elicit the pain. Social pain reliving recruited dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex, often associated with mental state processing, which
   functionally correlated with affective pain system responses. In
   contrast, physical pain reliving recruited inferior frontal gyrus, known
   to be involved in body state processing, which functionally correlated
   with activation in the sensory pain system. These results update the
   physical-social pain overlap hypothesis: while overlapping mechanisms
   support live social and physical pain, distinct mechanisms guide
   internally-generated pain.}},

Title = {{fMRI neurofeedback facilitates anxiety regulation in females with spider
   phobia}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Spider phobics show an exaggerated fear response when
   encountering spiders. This fear response is aggravated by negative and
   irrational beliefs about the feared object. Cognitive reappraisal can
   target these beliefs, and therefore has a fear regulating effect. The
   presented study investigated if neurofeedback derived from functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) would facilitate anxiety regulation by
   cognitive reappraisal, using spider phobia as a model of anxiety
   disorders. Feedback was provided based on activation in left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right insula, as indicators of
   engagement and regulation success, respectively.
   Methods: Eighteen female spider phobics participated in a randomized,
   controlled, single-blinded study. All participants completed a training
   session in the MRI scanner. Participants assigned to the neurofeedback
   condition were instructed to shape their regulatory strategy based on
   the provided feedback. Participants assigned to the control condition
   were asked to adapt their strategy intuitively.
   Results: Neurofeedback participants exhibited lower anxiety levels than
   the control group at the end of the training. In addition, only
   neurofeedback participants achieved down-regulation of insula activation
   levels by cognitive reappraisal. Group differences became more
   pronounced over time, supporting learning as a mechanism behind this
   effect. Importantly, within the neurofeedback group, achieved changes in
   insula activation levels during training predicted long-term anxiety
   reduction.
   Conclusions: The conducted study provides first evidence that fMRI
   neurofeedback has a facilitating effect on anxiety regulation in spider
   phobia.}},

Title = {{Age of second language acquisition in multilinguals has an impact on
   gray matter volume in language-associated brain areas}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 8}},
Abstract = {{Numerous structural studies have established that experience shapes and
   reshapes the brain throughout a lifetime. The impact of early
   development, however, is still a matter of debate. Further clues may
   come from studying multilinguals who acquired their second language at
   different ages. We investigated adult multilinguals who spoke three
   languages fluently, where the third language was learned in classroom
   settings, not before the age of 9 years. Multilinguals exposed to two
   languages simultaneously from birth (SiM) were contrasted with
   multinguals who acquired their first two languages successively (SuM).
   Whole brain voxel based morphometry revealed that, relative to SuM, SiM
   have significantly lower gray matter volume in several
   language-associated cortical areas in both hemispheres: bilaterally in
   medial and inferior frontal gyrus, in the right medial temporal gyrus
   and inferior posterior parietal gyrus, as well as in the left inferior
   temporal gyrus. Thus, as shown by others, successive language learning
   increases the volume of language-associated cortical areas. In brains
   exposed early on and simultaneously to more than one language, however,
   learning of additional languages seems to have less impact. We conclude
   that at least with respect to language acquisition early developmental
   influences are maintained and have an effect on experience-dependent
   plasticity well into adulthood.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{Many situations in daily life require competing with others for the same
   goal. In this case, the joy of winning is tied to the fact that the
   rival suffers. In this fMRI study participants played a competitive game
   against another player, in which every trial had opposite consequences
   for the two players (i.e., if one player won, the other lost, or vice
   versa). Our main aim was to disentangle brain activation for two
   different types of winning. Participants could either win a trial in a
   way that it increased their payoff; or they could win a trial in a way
   that it incurred a monetary loss to their opponent. Two distinct brain
   networks were engaged in these two types of winning. Wins with a
   monetary gain activated the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area
   associated with the processing of rewards. In contrast, avoidance of
   loss/other-related monetary loss evoked activation in areas related to
   mentalizing, such as the temporo-parietal junction and precuneus.
   However, both types of winnings shared activation in the striatum. Our
   findings extend recent evidence from neuroeconomics by suggesting that
   we consider our conspecifics' payoff even when we directly compete with
   them.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{Disorder-relevant but task-unrelated stimuli impair cognitive
   performance in social anxiety disorder (SAD); however, time course and
   neural correlates of emotional interference are unknown. The present
   study investigated time course and neural basis of emotional
   interference in SAD using event-related functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). Patients with SAD and healthy controls performed an
   emotional stroop task which allowed examining interference effects on
   the current and the succeeding trial. Reaction time data showed an
   emotional interference effect in the current trial, but not the
   succeeding trial, specifically in SAD. FMRI data showed greater
   activation in the left amygdala, bilateral insula, medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and left
   opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus during emotional
   interference of the current trial in SAD patients. Furthermore, we found
   a positive correlation between patients' interference scores and
   activation in the mPFC, dorsal ACC and left angular/supramarginal gyrus.
   Taken together, results indicate a network of brain regions comprising
   amygdala, insula, mPFC, ACC, and areas strongly involved in language
   processing during the processing of task-unrelated threat in SAD.
   However, specifically the activation in mPFC, dorsal ACC, and left
   angular/supramarginal gyrus is associated with the strength of the
   interference effect, suggesting a cognitive network model of attentional
   bias in SAD. This probably comprises exceeded allocation of attentional
   resources to disorder-related information of the presented stimuli and
   increased self-referential and semantic processing of threat words in
   SAD.}},

Title = {{Social reward improves the voluntary control over localized brain
   activity in fMRI-based neurofeedback training}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Neurofeedback (NF) based on real-time functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (rt-fMRI) allows voluntary regulation of the activity in a
   selected brain region. For the training of this regulation, a
   well-designed feedback system is required. Social reward may serve as an
   effective incentive in NF paradigms, but its efficiency has not yet been
   tested. Therefore, we developed a social reward NF paradigm and assessed
   it in comparison with a typical visual NF paradigm (moving bar). We
   trained twenty-four healthy participants, on three consecutive days, to
   control activation in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with
   fMRI-based NF. In the social feedback group, an avatar gradually smiled
   when ACC activity increased, whereas in the standard feedback group, a
   moving bar indicated the activation level. In order to assess a transfer
   of the NF training both groups were asked to up-regulate their brain
   activity without receiving feedback immediately before and after the NF
   training (pre- and post-test). Finally, the effect of the acquired NF
   training on ACC function was evaluated in a cognitive interference task
   (Simon task) during the pre- and post-test. Social reward led to
   stronger activity in the ACC and reward-related areas during the NF
   training when compared to standard feedback. After the training, both
   groups were able to regulate ACC without receiving feedback, with a
   trend for stronger responses in the social feedback group. Moreover,
   despite a lack of behavioral differences, significant higher ACC
   activations emerged in the cognitive interference task, reflecting a
   stronger generalization of the NF training on cognitive interference
   processing after social feedback. Social reward can increase
   self-regulation in fMRI-based NF and strengthen its effects on neural
   processing in related tasks, such as cognitive interference. A
   particular advantage of social feedback is that a direct external reward
   is provided as in natural social interactions, opening perspectives for
   implicit learning paradigms.}},

Title = {{Violence: heightened brain attentional network response is selectively
   muted in Down syndrome}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: The ability to recognize and respond appropriately to threat
   is critical to survival, and the neural substrates subserving attention
   to threat may be probed using depictions of media violence. Whether
   neural responses to potential threat differ in Down syndrome is not
   known.
   Methods: We performed functional MRI scans of 15 adolescent and adult
   Down syndrome and 14 typically developing individuals, group matched by
   age and gender, during 50 min of passive cartoon viewing. Brain
   activation to auditory and visual features, violence, and presence of
   the protagonist and antagonist were compared across cartoon segments.
   fMRI signal from the brain's dorsal attention network was compared to
   thematic and violent events within the cartoons between Down syndrome
   and control samples.
   Results: We found that in typical development, the brain's dorsal
   attention network was most active during violent scenes in the cartoons
   and that this was significantly and specifically reduced in Down
   syndrome. When the antagonist was on screen, there was significantly
   less activation in the left medial temporal lobe of individuals with
   Down syndrome. As scenes represented greater relative threat, the
   disparity between attentional brain activation in Down syndrome and
   control individuals increased. There was a reduction in the temporal
   autocorrelation of the dorsal attention network, consistent with a
   shortened attention span in Down syndrome. Individuals with Down
   syndrome exhibited significantly reduced activation in primary sensory
   cortices, and such perceptual impairments may constrain their ability to
   respond to more complex social cues such as violence.
   Conclusions: These findings may indicate a relative deficit in emotive
   perception of violence in Down syndrome, possibly mediated by impaired
   sensory perception and hypoactivation of medial temporal structures in
   response to threats, with relative preservation of activity in
   pro-social brain regions. These findings indicate that specific genetic
   differences associated with Down syndrome can modulate the brain's
   response to violence and other complex emotive ideas.}},

Title = {{The Anterior Insula Tracks Behavioral Entropy during an Interpersonal
   Competitive Game}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{In competitive situations, individuals need to adjust their behavioral
   strategy dynamically in response to their opponent's behavior. In the
   present study, we investigated the neural basis of how individuals
   adjust their strategy during a simple, competitive game of matching
   pennies. We used entropy as a behavioral index of randomness in
   decision-making, because maximizing randomness is thought to be an
   optimal strategy in the game, according to game theory. While undergoing
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), subjects played matching
   pennies with either a human or computer opponent in each block, although
   in reality they played the game with the same computer algorithm under
   both conditions. The winning rate of each block was also manipulated.
   Both the opponent (human or computer), and the winning rate,
   independently affected subjects' block-wise entropy during the game. The
   fMRI results revealed that activity in the bilateral anterior insula was
   positively correlated with subjects' (not opponent's) behavioral entropy
   during the game, which indicates that during an interpersonal
   competitive game, the anterior insula tracked how uncertain subjects'
   behavior was, rather than how uncertain subjects felt their opponent's
   behavior was. Our results suggest that intuitive or automatic processes
   based on somatic markers may be a key to optimally adjusting behavioral
   strategies in competitive situations.}},

Title = {{10 years of BAWLing into affective and aesthetic processes in reading:
   what are the echoes?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Reading is not only ``cold{''} information processing, but involves
   affective and aesthetic processes that go far beyond what current models
   of word recognition, sentence processing, or text comprehension can
   explain. To investigate such ``hot{''} reading processes, standardized
   instruments that quantify both psycholinguistic and emotional variables
   at the sublexical, lexical, inter-, and supralexical levels (e.g.,
   phonological iconicity, word valence, arousal-span, or passage suspense)
   are necessary. One such instrument, the Berlin Affective Word List
   (BAWL) has been used in over 50 published studies demonstrating effects
   of lexical emotional variables on all relevant processing levels
   (experiential, behavioral, neuronal). In this paper, we first present
   new data from several BAWL studies. Together, these studies examine
   various views on affective effects in reading arising from dimensional
   (e.g., valence) and discrete emotion features (e.g., happiness), or
   embodied cognition features like smelling. Second, we extend our
   investigation of the complex issue of affective word processing to words
   characterized by a mixture of affects. These words entail positive and
   negative valence, and/or features making them beautiful or ugly.
   Finally, we discuss tentative neurocognitive models of affective word
   processing in the light of the present results, raising new issues for
   future studies.}},

Title = {{Balance maintenance as an acquired motor skill: Delayed gains and robust

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1609}},
Pages = {{54-62}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Does the learning of a balance and stability skill exhibit time-course
   phases and transfer limitations characteristic of the acquisition and
   consolidation of voluntary movement sequences? Here we followed the
   performance of young adults trained in maintaining balance while
   standing on a moving platform synchronized with a virtual reality road
   travel scene. The training protocol included eight 3 min long iterations
   of the road scene. Center of Pressure (CoP) displacements were analyzed
   for each task iteration within the training session, as well as during
   tests at 24h, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-training to test for
   consolidation phase ({''}offline') gains and assess retention. In
   addition, CoP displacements in reaction to external perturbations were
   assessed before and after the training session and in the 3 subsequent
   post-training assessments (stability tests). There were significant
   reductions in CoP displacements as experience accumulated within
   session, with performance stabilizing by the end of the session.
   However, CoP displacements were further reduced at 24 h post-training
   (delayed ``offline{''} gains) and these gains were robustly retained.
   There was no transfer of the practice-related gains to performance in
   the stability tests. The time-course of learning the balance maintenance
   task, as well as the limitation on generalizing the gains to untrained
   conditions, are in line with the results of studies of manual movement
   skill learning. The current results support the conjecture that a
   similar repertoire of basic neuronal mechanisms of plasticity may
   underlay skill (procedural, ``how to{''} knowledge) acquisition and
   skill memory consolidation in voluntary and balance maintenance tasks.

Title = {{Identifying enhanced cortico-basal ganglia loops associated with

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN 2}},
Abstract = {{Studies have revealed that prolonged, specialized training combined with
   higher cognitive conditioning induces enhanced brain alternation. In
   particular, dancers with long-term dance experience exhibit superior
   motor control and integration with their sensorimotor networks. However,
   little is known about the functional connectivity patterns of
   spontaneous intrinsic activities in the sensorimotor network of dancers.
   Our study examined the functional connectivity density (FCD) of dancers
   with a mean period of over 10 years of dance training in contrast with a
   matched non-dancer group without formal dance training using
   resting-state fMRI scans. FCD was mapped and analyzed, and the
   functional connectivity (FC) analyses were then performed based on the
   difference of FCD. Compared to the non-dancers, the dancers exhibited
   significantly increased FCD in the precentral gyri, postcentral gyri and
   bilateral putamen. Furthermore, the results of the FC analysis revealed
   enhanced connections between the middle cingulate cortex and the
   bilateral putamen and between the precentral and the postcentral gyri.
   All findings indicated an enhanced functional integration in the
   cortico-basal ganglia loops that govern motor control and integration in
   dancers. These findings might reflect improved sensorimotor function for
   the dancers consequent to long-term dance training.}},

Abstract = {{Social impairments in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
   may be in part due to difficulty perceiving and recognizing the actions
   of others. Evidence from imitation studies, which involves both
   observation and execution of an action, suggests differences, in
   individuals with ASD, between the ability to imitate goal-directed
   actions involving objects (transitive actions) and the ability to
   imitate actions that do not involve objects (intransitive actions). In
   the present study, we examined whether there were differences in how ASD
   adolescents encoded transitive and intransitive actions compared to
   typically developing (TD) adolescents, by having participants view
   videos of a hand reaching across a screen toward an object or to where
   an object would be while functional magnetic resonance images were
   collected. Analyses focused on areas within the action observation
   network (AON), which is activated during the observation of actions
   performed by others. We hypothesized that the AON would differentiate
   transitive from intransitive actions only in the ASD group. However,
   results revealed that object presence modulated activity in the right
   inferior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus of the TD group, a
   differentiation that was not seen in the ASD group. Furthermore, there
   were no significant group differences between the TD and ASD groups in
   any of the conditions. This suggests that there is not a global deficit
   of the AON in individuals with ASD while observing transitive and
   intransitive actions. (C) 2015 International Society for Autism

Abstract = {{Multi-subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has been
   increasingly used to study the population-wide relationship between
   human brain activity and individual biological or behavioral traits. A
   common method is to regress the scalar individual response on imaging
   predictors, known as a scalar-on-image (SI) regression. Analysis and
   computation of such massive and noisy data with complex spatio-temporal
   correlation structure is challenging. In this article, motivated by a
   psychological study on human affective feelings using fMRI, we propose a
   joint Ising and Dirichlet Process (Ising-DP) prior within the framework
   of Bayesian stochastic search variable selection for selecting brain
   voxels in high-dimensional SI regressions. The Ising component of the
   prior makes use of the spatial information between voxels, and the DP
   component groups the coefficients of the large number of voxels to a
   small set of values and thus greatly reduces the posterior computational
   burden. To address the phase transition phenomenon of the Ising prior,
   we propose a new analytic approach to derive bounds for the
   hyperparameters, illustrated on 2- and 3-dimensional lattices. The
   proposed method is compared with several alternative methods via
   simulations, and is applied to the fMRI data collected from the KLIFF
   hand-holding experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Research evidences stronger reactions toward those whose behaviors seem

   underlying appearance-behavior congruity effects, we assessed regions
   responding as a function of the congruity between visual (appearance)
   and abstract (behavior) cues. Using fMRI, trustworthy- and
   untrustworthy-looking faces were paired with positive, negative, or
   neutral behaviors. Approach judgments were stronger for congruent over
   incongruent targets, replicating prior work. Incongruent targets (e.g.,
   untrustworthy face/positive behavior) elicited medial prefrontal (mPFC)
   and dorsolateral prefrontal (dIPFC) cortex activity more than congruent
   (e.g., untrustworthy face/negative behavior), suggesting processing
   incongruent targets requires additional mentalizing and controlled
   processing. Individual differences in enjoying interpersonal
   interactions negatively correlated with mPFC activity toward incongruent
   over congruent targets, suggesting more effortful processing of
   incongruent targets for individuals with lower levels of social
   motivation. These findings indicate mPFC contributions to processing
   incongruent appearance-behavior cues, but suggest that individual
   differences may temper the extent of this effect.}},

Journal = {{CORTEX}},

Volume = {{67}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Studies have reported that patients in the severe stages of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) experience difficulties recognizing their own faces in
   recent photographs. Two case reports of late-stage AD showed that this
   loss of self-face recognition was temporally graded: photographs from
   the remote past were recognized more easily than more recent
   photographs. Little is known about the neural correlates of own face
   recognition abilities in AD patients, while neuroimaging studies in
   healthy adults have related these abilities to a bilateral
   fronto-parieto-occipital network. In this study, two behavioral
   experiments (experiments 1 and 2) and one functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) experiment (second part of experiment 2) were conducted
   to compare mild AD patients (experiment 1) and moderate AD patients
   (experiment 2) with healthy older participants in a recognition task
   involving self and familiar faces from different decades of the
   participants' life. In moderate AD patients, variable performance
   allowed us to examine correlations between scores and resting-state fMRI
   in order to link behavioral data to cerebral activity. At the behavioral
   level, the results revealed that, in mild AD, self and familiar face
   recognition was preserved. Moreover, mild AD patients and healthy older
   participants showed an inverse temporal gradient, with faster
   recognition of self and familiar recent photographs than self and
   familiar remote photographs. However, in moderate AD, both self and
   familiar face recognition were affected. fMRI results showed that the
   higher the connectivity between the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   (dMPFC) and the right superior frontal gyms (rSFG), the lower the self
   and familiar face recognition scores in moderate AD patients. Given that
   previous studies have related the superior frontal region to control
   processes rather than face recognition processes, these results might
   reflect less segregation and more interference between brain networks in
   AD. In other words, impaired face recognition in AD may be related to
   functional dedifferentiation of specific brain regions. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This study used fMRI to investigate the neural substrates of moral
   cognition in health resource allocation decision problems. In
   particular, it investigated the cognitive and emotional processes that
   underpin utilitarian approaches to health care rationing such as Quality
   Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Participants viewed hypothetical medical
   and nonmedical resource allocation scenarios which described equal or
   unequal allocation of resources to different groups. In addition,
   participants were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments in which they either did
   or did not receive advanced instructions about the principles of
   utilitarianism. In all cases, participants were asked to judge the
   proposed allocations as ``fair{''} or ``unfair.{''} More brain activity
   was observed within the superior parietal lobe, angular gyrus, middle
   temporal gyrus, and bilateral caudate nucleus when participants viewed
   scenarios depicting equal divisions of resources. Conversely, unequal
   resource divisions were associated with more activity in the inferior
   frontal gyrus and insula cortex. Furthermore, instructions about the
   principles of utilitarianism led to significant activation differences
   within the inferior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus.
   Significant differences in activity were also found within the inferior
   frontal cortex and anterior insula between medical and nonmedical
   scenarios. The implications for cognitive control mechanisms and the
   cognitive and neural bases of utilitarian ethical judgment are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Humans have a strong tendency to affiliate with other people, especially
   in emotional situations. Here, we suggest that a critical mechanism
   underlying this tendency is that socially sharing emotional experiences
   is in itself perceived as hedonically positive and thereby contributes
   to the regulation of individual emotions. We investigated the effect of
   social sharing of emotions on subjective feelings and neural activity by
   having pairs of friends view emotional (negative and positive) and
   neutral pictures either alone or with the friend. While the two friends
   remained physically separated throughout the experiment-with one
   undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging and the other
   performing the task in an adjacent room-they were made aware on a
   trial-by-trial basis whether they were seeing pictures simultaneously
   with their friend (shared) or alone (unshared). Ratings of subjective
   feelings were improved significantly when participants viewed emotional
   pictures together than alone, an effect that was accompanied by activity
   increase in ventral striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex, two
   important components of the reward circuitry. Because these effects
   occurred without any communication or interaction between the friends,
   they point to an important proximate explanation for the basic human
   motivation to affiliate with others, particularly in emotional
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{Is moral beauty different from facial beauty? Two functional magnetic
   resonance imaging experiments were performed to answer this question.
   Experiment 1 investigated the network of moral aesthetic judgments and
   facial aesthetic judgments. Participants performed aesthetic judgments
   and gender judgments on both faces and scenes containing moral acts. The
   conjunction analysis of the contrasts `facial aesthetic judgment >
   facial gender judgment' and `scene moral aesthetic judgment > scene
   gender judgment' identified the common involvement of the orbitofrontal
   cortex (OFC), inferior temporal gyrus and medial superior frontal gyrus,
   suggesting that both types of aesthetic judgments are based on the
   orchestration of perceptual, emotional and cognitive components.
   Experiment 2 examined the network of facial beauty and moral beauty
   during implicit perception. Participants performed a non-aesthetic
   judgment task on both faces (beautiful vs common) and scenes (containing
   morally beautiful vs neutral information). We observed that facial
   beauty (beautiful faces > common faces) involved both the cortical
   reward region OFC and the subcortical reward region putamen, whereas
   moral beauty (moral beauty scenes > moral neutral scenes) only involved
   the OFC. Moreover, compared with facial beauty, moral beauty spanned a
   larger-scale cortical network, indicating more advanced and complex
   cerebral representations characterizing moral beauty.}},

Abstract = {{A predominant expectation that social relationships with others are safe
   (a secure attachment style), has been linked with reduced threat-related
   amygdala activation. Experimental priming of mental representations of
   attachment security can modulate neural responding, but the effects of
   attachment-security priming on threat-related amygdala activation
   remains untested. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the
   present study examined the effects of trait and primed attachment
   security on amygdala reactivity to threatening stimuli in an emotional
   faces and a linguistic dot-probe task in 42 healthy participants. Trait
   attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were positively correlated
   with amygdala activation to threatening faces in the control group, but
   not in the attachment primed group. Furthermore, participants who
   received attachment-security priming showed attenuated amygdala
   activation in both the emotional faces and dot-probe tasks. The current
   findings demonstrate that variation in state and trait attachment
   security modulates amygdala reactivity to threat. These findings support
   the potential use of attachment security-boosting methods as
   interventions and suggest a neural mechanism for the protective effect
   of social bonds in anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Socially anxious individuals tend to shift their attention away from
   external socially threatening cues and instead become highly
   self-focused. Such heightened self-focused attention has been suggested
   to be involved in the development and maintenance of social anxiety
   disorder. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   investigate the neural correlates of self-focused attention in 16 high
   socially anxious (HSA) and 16 low socially anxious (LSA) individuals.
   Participants were instructed to focus their attention either inwardly or
   outwardly during a simulated social situation. Results indicate
   hyperactivation of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), temporo-parietal
   junction (TPJ) and temporal pole during inward vs outward attention in
   HSA compared with LSA participants. Furthermore, activation of mPFC,
   right anterior insula, TPJ and posterior cingulate cortex was positively
   correlated with the trait of self-focused attention in HSA subjects.
   Results highlight the prominent role of the mPFC and other cortical
   structures in abnormal self-focused attention in social anxiety.
   Finally, findings for the insula suggest increased processing of bodily
   states that is related to the amount of habitual self-focused attention
   in social anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Although recent research has begun to describe the neural and genetic
   processes underlying variability in responses to trauma, less is known
   about how these processes interact. We addressed this issue by using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the relationship
   between posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS), a common genetic
   polymorphism of the serotonin transporter {[}5-HTT (5-hydroxy
   tryptamine)] gene and neural activity in response to viewing images
   associated with the 9/11 terrorist attack among a rare sample of
   high-exposure 9/11 survivors (n = 17). Participants varied in whether
   they carried a copy of the short allele in the promoter region of the
   5-HTT gene. During scanning, participants viewed images of the 9/11
   attack, non-9/11 negative and neutral images. Three key findings are
   reported. First, carriers of the short allele displayed higher levels of
   PTSS. Second, both PTSS and the presence of the short allele correlated
   negatively with activity in a network of cortical midline regions (e.g.
   the retrosplenal and more posterior cingulate cortices (PCCs))
   implicated in episodic memories and self-reflection when viewing 9/11 vs
   non-9/11 negative control images. Finally, exploratory analyses
   indicated that PCC activity mediated the relationship between genotype
   and PTSS. These results highlight the role of PCC in distress following
   trauma.}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder typically begins in adolescence, a sensitive
   period for brain development, when increased complexity and salience of
   peer relationships requires novel forms of social learning. Disordered
   social learning in adolescence may explain how brain dysfunction
   promotes social anxiety. Socially anxious adolescents (n = 15) and
   adults (n = 19) and non-anxious adolescents (n = 24) and adults (n = 32)
   predicted, then received, social feedback from high and low-value peers
   while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A
   surprise recall task assessed memory biases for feedback. Neural
   correlates of social evaluation prediction errors (PEs) were assessed by
   comparing engagement to expected and unexpected positive and negative
   feedback. For socially anxious adolescents, but not adults or healthy
   participants of either age group, PEs elicited heightened striatal
   activity and negative fronto-striatal functional connectivity. This
   occurred selectively to unexpected positive feedback from high-value
   peers and corresponded with impaired memory for social feedback. While
   impaired memory also occurred in socially-anxious adults, this
   impairment was unrelated to brain-based PE activity. Thus, social
   anxiety in adolescence may relate to altered neural correlates of PEs
   that contribute to impaired learning about social feedback. Small
   samples necessitate replication. Nevertheless, results suggest that the
   relationship between learning and fronto-striatal function may attenuate
   as development progresses. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Social exclusion elicits powerful feelings of negative affect associated
   with rejection. Additionally, experiencing social exclusion reliably
   recruits neural circuitry associated with emotion processing. Recent
   work has demonstrated abnormal neural responses to social exclusion in
   children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However,
   it remains unknown to what extent these abnormalities are due to
   atypical social experiences versus genetic predispositions to atypical
   neural processing. To address this question, the current study
   investigated brain responses to social exclusion compared to a baseline
   condition of fair play in unaffected siblings of youth with ASD using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. We identified common deviations
   between unaffected siblings and ASD probands that might represent
   trait-level abnormalities in processing Social Exclusion vs. Fair Play,
   specifically in the right anterior temporoparietal junction extending
   into posterior superior temporal sulcus. Thus, hypoactivation to Social
   Exclusion vs. Fair Play in this region may represent a shared genetic
   vulnerability to developing autism. In addition, we present evidence
   supporting the idea that one's status as an unaffected sibling moderates
   the relationship between IQ and neural activation to Social Exclusion
   vs. Fair Play in anterior cingulate cortex. These results are discussed
   in the context of previous literature on neural endophenotypes of
   autism. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) has repeatedly been
   associated with anxiety and anxiety disorders, fibromyalgia, irritable
   bowel syndrome and temporomandibular joint disorder. However, the neural
   underpinnings of these associations still remain unclear. This study
   explored brain responses to facial visual stimuli with emotional cues
   using fMRI techniques in general population with different ranges of
   hypermobility.
   Methods: Fifty-one non-clinical volunteers (33 women) completed state
   and trait anxiety questionnaire measures, were assessed with a clinical
   examination for hypermobility (Beighton system) and performed an
   emotional face processing paradigm during functional neuroimaging.
   Results: Trait anxiety scores did significantly correlate with both
   state anxiety and hypermobility scores. BOLD signals of the hippocampus
   did positively correlate with hypermobility scores for the crying faces
   versus neutral faces contrast in ROI analyses. No results were found for
   any of the other studied ROIs. Additionally, hypermobility scores were
   also associated with other key affective processing areas (i.e. the
   middle and anterior cingulate gyrus, fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal
   region, orbitofrontal cortex and cerebellum) in the whole brain
   analysis.
   Conclusions: Hypermobility scores are associated with trait anxiety and
   higher brain responses to emotional faces in emotion processing brain
   areas (including hippocampus) described to be linked to anxiety and
   somatic symptoms. These findings increase our understanding of emotion
   processing in people bearing this heritable variant of collagen and the
   mechanisms through which vulnerability to anxiety and somatic symptoms
   arises in this population. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Studies to date that have used fTCD to examine language lateralisation
   have predominantly used word or sentence generation tasks. Here we
   sought to further assess the sensitivity of fTCD to language
   lateralisation by using a metalinguistic task which does not involve
   novel speech generation: rhyme judgement in response to written words.
   Line array judgement was included as a non-linguistic visuospatial task
   to examine the relative strength of left and right hemisphere
   lateralisation within the same individuals when output requirements of
   the tasks are matched. These externally paced tasks allowed us to
   manipulate the number of stimuli presented to participants and thus
   assess the influence of pace on the strength of lateralisation.
   In Experiment 1, 28 right-handed adults participated in rhyme and line
   array judgement tasks and showed reliable left and right lateralisation
   at the group level for each task, respectively. In Experiment 2 we
   increased the pace of the tasks, presenting more stimuli per trial. We
   measured laterality indices (LIs) from 18 participants who performed
   both linguistic and non-linguistic judgement tasks during the original
   `slow' presentation rate (5 judgements per trial) and a fast
   presentation rate (10 judgements per trial). The increase in pace led to
   increased strength of lateralisation in both the rhyme and line
   conditions.
   Our results demonstrate for the first time that fTCD is sensitive to the
   left lateralised processes involved in metalinguistic judgements. Our
   data also suggest that changes in the strength of language
   lateralisation, as measured by fTCD, are not driven by articulatory
   demands alone. The current results suggest that at least one aspect of
   task difficulty, the pace of stimulus presentation, influences the
   strength of lateralisation during both linguistic and non-linguistic
   tasks. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open

Abstract = {{Background: It has been suggested that the degree of hemispheric
   specialization (HS) depends on the structural connectivity between the
   two hemispheres, that is to say the corpus callosum (CC). Studies,
   performed only on healthy participants, investigated this
   anatomo-functional relationship. Nevertheless, it has never been studied
   in schizophrenia. We therefore propose to study the anatomo-functional
   relationships between the integrity of interhemispheric connectivity and
   leftward functional lateralization for language in patients with
   schizophrenia compared with healthy participants, driven by a multimodal
   approach combining fMRI and DTI-based fiber tractography. We
   hypothesized that reduced leftward functional lateralization for
   language in patients with schizophrenia could be related to a callosal
   hypoconnectivity.
   Materials and methods: Seventeen patients based on the DSM-IV, and 17
   controls were included. The functional laterality index and
   interhemispheric diffusion values between homologue temporal regions,
   belonging to the language network, were individually extracted in order
   to study the anatomo-functional relationships.
   Results: In the patients, higher mean and radial diffusivity (RD) values
   (thicker myelin sheaths) were associated with less leftward
   lateralization. In contrast, the controls presented higher RD values and
   lower fractional anisotropy values (axonal loss) with more leftward
   lateralization.
   Conclusions: Our study revealed a relationship between the CC and the HS
   for language, but did not provide evidence clarifying the direction of
   the relationship between callosal connectivity and functional
   lateralization for language. In particular, the present findings showed
   that the loss of integrity in interhemispheric callosal fibers was
   associated with reduced leftward cerebral dominance for language in
   patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy deficit is a core feature of schizophrenia which may lead to
   social dysfunction. The present study was carried out to investigate
   functional and structural abnormalities associated with empathy in
   patients with schizophrenia using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A sample of 14 schizophrenia
   patients and 14 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex and
   education were examined with structural high-resolution Ti-weighted MRI;
   fMRI images were obtained during empathy task in the same session. The
   analysis was carried out using SPM8 software. On behavioural assessment,
   schizophrenic patients (83.00 +/- 29.04) showed less scores for sadness
   compared to healthy controls (128.70 +/- 22.26) (p<0.001). fMRI results
   also showed reduced clusters of activation in the bilateral fusiform
   gyms, left lingual gyms, left middle and inferior occipital gyms in
   schizophrenic subjects as compared to controls during empathy task. In
   the same brain areas, VBM results also showed reduced grey and white
   matter volumes. The present study provides an evidence for an
   association between structural alterations and disturbed functional
   brain activation during empathy task in persons affected with
   schizophrenia. These findings suggest a biological basis for social
   cognition deficits in schizophrenics.}},

Abstract = {{The duration and quality of human performance depend on both intrinsic
   motivation and external incentives. However, little is known about the
   neuroscientific basis of this interplay between internal and external
   motivators. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   examine the neural substrates of intrinsic motivation, operationalized
   as the free-choice time spent on a task when this was not required, and
   tested the neural and behavioral effects of external reward on intrinsic
   motivation. We found that increased duration of free-choice time was
   predicted by generally diminished neural responses in regions associated
   with cognitive and affective regulation. By comparison, the possibility
   of additional reward improved task accuracy, and specifically increased
   neural and behavioral responses following errors. Those individuals with
   the smallest neural responses associated with intrinsic motivation
   exhibited the greatest error-related neural enhancement under the
   external contingency of possible reward. Together, these data suggest
   that human performance is guided by a ``tonic{''} and ``phasic{''}
   relationship between the neural substrates of intrinsic motivation
   (tonic) and the impact of external incentives (phasic).}},

Abstract = {{Eudaimonic well-being (EWB) is the fulfillment of human potential and a
   meaningful life. Previous studies have shown that personality traits,
   especially extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness,
   significantly contribute to EWB. However, the neurobiological pathways
   linking personality and EWB are not understood. Here, we used
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to
   investigate this issue. Specifically, we correlated individuals' EWB
   scores with the regional fractional amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations (fALFF) of the brain, and then examined how personality
   traits predicted EWB-related spontaneous brain activity. We found that
   EWB was positively correlated with the fALFF in the right posterior
   superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and thalamus, and negatively correlated
   with the strength of the thalamic-insular connectivity. More
   importantly, we found that personality traits influenced EWB in
   different ways. At the regional level, the fALFF in the pSTG and
   thalamus mediated the effects of neuroticism and extraversion on EWB,
   whereas the thalamus mediated the effect of conscientiousness on EWB. At
   the functional connectivity level, the thalamic-insular connectivity
   only mediated the effect of neuroticism on EWB. Taken together, our
   study provides the first evidence that EWB is associated with
   personality traits through different neural substrates.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The ability to identify the cause of another person's emotional reaction
   is an important component associated with improved success of social
   relationships and survival. Although many studies have investigated the
   mechanisms involved in emotion recognition, very little is currently
   known regarding the processes involved during emotion attribution
   decisions. Research on complementary ``emotion understanding{''}
   mechanisms, including empathy and theory of mind, has demonstrated that
   emotion understanding decisions are often made through relatively
   emotion-or cognitive-based processing streams. The current study was
   designed to investigate the behavioral and brain mechanisms involved in
   emotion attribution decisions. We predicted that dual processes,
   emotional and cognitive, are engaged during emotion attribution
   decisions. Sixteen healthy adults completed the Interpersonal Reactivity
   Index to characterize individual differences in tendency to make
   emotion-versus cognitive-based interpersonal decisions. Participants
   then underwent functional MRI while making emotion attribution
   decisions. We found neuroimaging evidence that emotion attribution
   decisions engage a similar brain network as other forms of emotion
   understanding. Further, we found evidence in support of a dual processes
   model involved during emotion attribution decisions. Higher scores of
   personal distress were associated with quicker emotion attribution
   decisions and increased anterior insula activity. Conversely, higher
   scores in perspective taking were associated with delayed emotion
   attribution decisions and increased prefrontal cortex and premotor
   activity. These findings indicate that the making of emotion attribution
   decisions relies on dissociable emotional and cognitive processing
   streams within the brain.}},

Title = {{The neural correlates of correctly rejecting lures during memory
   retrieval: the role of item relatedness}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{233}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1963-1975}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Successful memory retrieval is predicated not only on recognizing old
   information, but also on correctly rejecting new information (lures) in
   order to avoid false memories. Correctly rejecting lures is more
   difficult when they are perceptually or semantically related to
   information presented at study as compared to when lures are distinct
   from previously studied information. This behavioral difference suggests
   that the cognitive and neural basis of correct rejections differs with
   respect to the relatedness between lures and studied items. The present
   study sought to identify neural activity that aids in suppressing false
   memories by examining the network of brain regions underlying correct
   rejection of related and unrelated lures. Results showed neural overlap
   in the right hippocampus and anterior parahippocampal gyrus associated
   with both related and unrelated correct rejections, indicating that some
   neural regions support correctly rejecting lures regardless of their
   semantic/perceptual characteristics. Direct comparisons between related
   and unrelated correct rejections showed that unrelated correct
   rejections were associated with greater activity in bilateral middle and
   inferior temporal cortices, regions that have been associated with
   categorical processing and semantic labels. Related correct rejections
   showed greater activation in visual and lateral prefrontal cortices,
   which have been associated with perceptual processing and retrieval
   monitoring. Thus, while related and unrelated correct rejections show
   some common neural correlates, related correct rejections are driven by
   greater perceptual processing whereas unrelated correct rejections show
   greater reliance on salient categorical cues to support quick and
   accurate memory decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) are often comorbid and have both performance and brain
   dysfunctions during motor response inhibition. Serotonin agonists
   modulate motor response inhibition and have shown positive behavioural
   effects in both disorders.
   We therefore used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   investigate the so far unknown shared and disorder-specific inhibitory
   brain dysfunctions in these two disorders, as well as the effects of a
   single dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine.
   Age-matched boys with ADHD (18), ASD (19) and healthy controls (25) were
   compared with fMRI during a stop task measuring motor inhibition.
   Patients were scanned twice, under either an acute dose of fluoxetine or
   placebo in a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised design.
   Repeated measures analyses within patients assessed drug effects. To
   test for potential normalisation effects of brain dysfunctions, patients
   under each drug condition were compared to controls.
   Under placebo, relative to controls, ASD boys showed overactivation in
   left and right inferior frontal cortex (IFC), while ADHD boys showed
   disorder-specific underactivation in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and
   basal ganglia. Under fluoxetine, the prefrontal dysfunctions were no
   longer observed, due to inverse effects of fluoxetine on these
   activations: fluoxetine downregulated IFC and OFC activation in ASD but
   upregulated them in ADHD.
   The findings show that fluoxetine normalises frontal lobe dysfunctions
   in both disorders via inverse effects, downregulating abnormally
   increased frontal activation in ASD and upregulating abnormally
   decreased frontal activation in ADHD, potentially reflecting inverse
   baseline serotonin levels in both disorders.}},

Title = {{Altered cortical and subcortical local coherence in PTSD: evidence from

Abstract = {{Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often characterized
   by region-specific brain activation/deactivation and functional
   abnormalities in corticolimbic circuitry, as elucidated by
   task-dependent functional neuroimaging. However, little is known about
   the abnormalities in the local coherence of cortical and subcortical
   activity occurring during the resting state.
   Purpose: To evaluate the functional discrepancy of local coherence
   between cortical and subcortical regions in PTSD patients using
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Material and Methods: Resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) was performed on 14
   outpatients with PTSD, along with 14 age-and sex-matched normal control
   subjects. Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measurement of the coherence of
   spontaneous RS-fMRI signal oscillations within spatially neighboring
   voxels, was examined.
   Results: Compared with the normal controls, PTSD patients showed
   increased local coherence in subcortical regions, including amygdala,
   hippocampus, thalamus, and putamen, and decreased local coherence in
   cortical regions, including medial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex. Moreover, a correlation analysis of the ReHo
   measurement versus the severity of the disorder was performed, and
   highly positive correlation were observed in the right amygdala.
   Conclusion: The present study identified a functional discrepancy of
   local coherence between cortical and subcortical regions in PTSD
   patients compared with normal controls. The findings revealed that
   resting-state abnormalities might lead to further improvement of the
   understanding of the neural substrates of cognitive impairment and
   symptoms in PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that brain activity between partners is
   synchronized during cooperative exchange. Whether this neural
   synchronization depends on the gender of partner (i.e., opposite or same
   to the participant) is open to be explored. In current study, we used
   functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) based hyperscanning to
   study cooperation in a two-person game (female-female, female-male, and
   male-male) while assaying brain-to-brain interactions. Cooperation was
   greater in male-male pairs than in female-female pairs, with
   intermediate cooperation levels for female-male pairs. More importantly,
   in dyads with partners with opposite gender (female-male pairs), we
   found significant task-related cross-brain coherence in frontal regions
   (i.e., frontopolar cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and left dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex) whereas the cooperation in same gender dyads
   (female-female pairs and male-male pairs) was not associated with such
   synchronization. Moreover, the changes of such interbrain coherence
   across task blocks were significantly correlated with change in degree
   of cooperation only in mixed-sex dyads. These findings suggested that
   different neural processes underlie cooperation between mixed-sex and
   same-sex dyadic interactions. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2039-2048, 2015. (c)

Abstract = {{In male Caucasian subjects, learning is facilitated by receipt of social
   compared with non-social feedback, and the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT)
   facilitates this effect. In this study, we have first shown a cultural
   difference in that male Chinese subjects actually perform significantly
   worse in the same reinforcement associated learning task with social
   (emotional faces) compared with non-social feedback. Nevertheless, in
   two independent double-blind placebo (PLC) controlled between-subject
   design experiments we found OXT still selectively facilitated learning
   with social feedback. Similar to Caucasian subjects this OXT effect was
   strongest with feedback using female rather than male faces. One
   experiment performed in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging showed that during the response, but not feedback phase of the
   task, OXT selectively increased activity in the amygdala, hippocampus,
   parahippocampal gyrus and putamen during the social feedback condition,
   and functional connectivity between the amygdala and insula and caudate.
   Therefore, OXT may be increasing the salience and reward value of
   anticipated social feedback. In the PLC group, response times and state
   anxiety scores during social feedback were associated with signal
   changes in these same regions but not in the OXT group. OXT may
   therefore have also facilitated learning by reducing anxiety in the
   social feedback condition. Overall our results provide the first
   evidence for cultural differences in social facilitation of learning per
   se, but a similar selective enhancement of learning with social feedback
   under OXT. This effect of OXT may be associated with enhanced responses
   and functional connectivity in emotional memory and reward processing
   regions. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2132-2146, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Recent studies have investigated the neural correlates of how we
   perceive emotions of individuals or a group of individuals using images
   of individual bodily expressions. However, it is still largely unknown
   how we perceive the emotion of a dynamic crowd. This fMRI study used
   realistic videos of a large group of people expressing fearful, happy or
   neutral emotions. Furthermore, the emotions were expressed by either
   unrelated individuals in the group or by an interacting group. It was
   hypothesized that the dynamics between the people in a crowd is a more
   salient signal than merely the emotion of the crowd. Second, it was
   expected that the group interaction is of special importance in a
   fearful or panic situation, as opposed to a happy or neutral situation.
   Using a fast-event related design, it was revealed that observing
   interactive individuals, more so than independently expressive
   individuals, activated networks related to the perception, execution and
   integration of action and emotion. Most importantly, the interactive or
   panicked crowds, as opposed to the individually fearful crowds,
   triggered more anticipatory and action preparation activity, whereas the
   brain was less sensitive to the dynamics of individuals in a happy or
   neutral crowd. This is the first study to assess the effect of the
   dynamics between people and the collectively displayed emotion as an
   important aspect of emotional crowd perception. Hum Brain Mapp

Abstract = {{Humans readily adopt an intentional stance to other people,
   comprehending their behavior as guided by unobservable mental states
   such as belief, desire, and intention. We used fMRI in healthy adults to
   test the hypothesis that this stance is primed by the default mode of
   human brain function present when the mind is at rest. We report three
   findings that support this hypothesis. First, brain regions activated by
   actively adopting an intentional rather than nonintentional stance to a
   social stimulus were anatomically similar to those demonstrating default
   responses to fixation baseline in the same task. Second,
   moment-to-moment variation in default activity during fixation in the
   dorsomedial PFC was related to the ease with which participants applied
   an intentionalbut not nonintentional-stance to a social stimulus
   presented-moments later. Finally, individuals who showed stronger
   dorsomedial PFC activity at baseline in a separate task were generally
   more efficient when adopting the intentional stance and reported having
   greater social skills. These results identify a biological basis for the
   human tendency to adopt the intentional stance. More broadly, they
   suggest that the brain's default mode of function may have evolved, in
   part, as a response to life in a social world.}},
