Abstract = {{The present study tested whether the neural patterns that support
   imagining `performing an action', `feeling a bodily sensation' or `being
   in a situation' are directly involved in understanding other people's
   actions, bodily sensations and situations. Subjects imagined the content
   of short sentences describing emotional actions, interoceptive
   sensations and situations (self-focused task), and processed scenes and
   focused on how the target person was expressing an emotion, what this
   person was feeling, and why this person was feeling an emotion
   (other-focused task). Using a linear support vector machine classifier
   on brain-wide multi-voxel patterns, we accurately decoded each
   individual class in the self-focused task. When generalizing the
   classifier from the self-focused task to the other-focused task, we also
   accurately decoded whether subjects focused on the emotional actions,
   interoceptive sensations and situations of others. These results show
   that the neural patterns that underlie self-imagined experience are
   involved in understanding the experience of other people. This supports
   the theoretical assumption that the basic components of emotion
   experience and understanding share resources in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Experiences such as mind-wandering illustrate that cognition is not
   always tethered to events in the here-and-now. Although converging
   evidence emphasises the default mode network (DMN) in mind-wandering,
   its precise contribution remains unclear. The DMN comprises cortical
   regions that are maximally distant from primary sensory and motor
   cortex, a topological location that may support the
   stimulus-independence of mind-wandering. The DMN is functionally
   heterogeneous, comprising regions engaged by memory, social cognition
   and planning; processes relevant to mind-wandering content. Our study
   examined the relationships between: (i) individual differences in
   resting-state DMN connectivity, (ii) performance on memory, social and
   planning tasks and (iii) variability in spontaneous thought, to
   investigate whether the DMN is critical to mind-wandering because it
   supports stimulus-independent cognition, memory retrieval, or both.
   Individual variation in task performance modulated the functional
   organization of the DMN: poor external engagement was linked to stronger
   coupling between medial and dorsal subsystems, while decoupling of the
   core from the cerebellum predicted reports of detailed memory retrieval.
   Both patterns predicted off-task future thoughts. Consistent with
   predictions from component process accounts of mind-wandering, our study
   suggests a 2-fold involvement of the DMN: (i) it supports experiences
   that are unrelated to the environment through strong coupling between
   its sub-systems; (ii) it allows memory representations to form the basis
   of conscious experience.}},

   disproportionately more demanding and require the recruitment of more

Abstract = {{The human brain tracks dynamic changes within the social environment,
   forming and updating representations of individuals in our social
   milieu. This mechanism of social navigation builds an increasingly
   complex map of persons with whom we are familiar and form attachments to
   guide adaptive social behaviors. We examined the neural representation
   of known others along a continuum of attachment using fMRI. Heterosexual
   adults 16 females), in romantic relationships for more than 2 years,
   made trait judgments for a romantic partner, parent, close friend,
   familiar acquaintance and self-during scanning. Multivariate analysis,
   partial least squares, was used to identify whole-brain patterns of
   brain activation associated with trait judgments of known others across
   a continuum of attachment. Across conditions, trait judgments engaged
   the default network and lateral prefrontal cortex. Judgments about
   oneself and a partner were associated with a common activation pattern
   encompassing anterior and middle cingulate, posterior superior temporal
   sulcus, as well as anterior insula. Parent and close friend judgments
   engaged medial and anterior temporal lobe regions. These results provide
   novel evidence that mentalizing about known familiar others results in
   differential brain activity. We provide initial evidence that the
   representation of adult attachment is a distinguishing feature of these
   differences.}},

   Americans trusted and gave more to excited than calm recipients, whereas
   Koreans trusted and gave more to calm than excited recipients. These
   findings held regardless of recipient race and sex. We then used fMRI to
   probe potential affective and mentalizing mechanisms. Increased activity

   giving, as did decreased activity in the right temporo-parietal junction

Abstract = {{Moral cognition is associated with activation of the default network,
   regions implicated in mentalizing about one's own actions or the
   intentions of others. Yet little is known about the initial detection of
   moral information. We examined the neural correlates of moral processing
   during a narrative completion task, which included an implicit moral
   salience manipulation. During fMRI scanning, participants read a brief
   vignette and selected the most semantically congruent sentence from two
   options to complete the narrative. The options were immoral, moral or
   neutral statements. RT was fastest for the selection of neutral
   statements and slowest for immoral statements. Neuroimaging analyses
   revealed that responses involving morally laden content engaged default
   and executive control network brain regions including medial and rostral
   prefrontal cortex, and core regions of the salience network, including
   anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate. Immoral moral conditions
   additionally engaged the salience network. These results implicate the
   salience network in the detection of moral information, which may
   modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in
   the service of complex moral reasoning and decision-making processes.
   These findings suggest that moral cognition involves both bottom-up and
   top-down attentional processes, mediated by discrete large-scale brain
   networks and their interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Placebo analgesia (PA) depends crucially on the prefrontal cortex (PFC),
   which is assumed to be responsible for initiating the analgesic
   response. Surprisingly little research has focused on the psychological
   mechanisms mediated by the PFC and underlying PA. One increasingly
   accepted theory is that cognitive reappraisal-the reinterpretation of
   the meaning of adverse events-plays an important role, but no study has
   yet addressed the possible functional relationship with PA. We studied
   the influence of individual differences in reappraisal ability on PA and
   its prefrontal mediation. Participants completed a cognitive reappraisal
   ability task, which compared negative affect evoked by pictures in a
   reappraise versus a control condition. In a subsequent fMRI session, PA
   was induced using thermal noxious stimuli and an inert skin cream. We
   found a region in the left dorsolateral PFC, which showed a positive
   correlation between placebo-induced activation and (i) the reduction in
   participants' pain intensity ratings; and (ii) cognitive reappraisal
   ability scores. Moreover, this region showed increased placebo-induced
   functional connectivity with the periaqueductal grey, indicating its
   involvement in descending nociceptive control. These initial findings
   thus suggest that cognitive reappraisal mechanisms mediated by the
   dorsolateral PFC may play a role in initiating pain inhibition in PA.}},

Abstract = {{The cognitive regulation of emotion is impaired in major depressive
   disorder and has been linked to an imbalance of pre-frontal-subcortical
   brain activity. Despite suggestions that this relationship represents a
   neurodevelopmental marker of depression, few studies have examined the
   neural correlates of emotion regulation in depressed youth. We combined
   a `cognitive reappraisal' paradigm with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to study the neural correlates of emotional regulation in a
   large sample of non-medicated depressed adolescents and young adults (n
   = 53) and healthy controls (n = 64). As compared with healthy controls,
   young people with depression were less able to reduce negative affect
   during reappraisal, which corresponded to blunted modulation of amygdala
   activity. While in healthy individuals amygdala activation was modulated
   by age, no such relationship was observed in depressed individuals.
   Heightened activation of the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex (vmPFC) and
   reduced activation of the dorsal midline cortex was also found for the
   depressed group. Overall, these findings suggest that brain systems that

Abstract = {{The association between moral purity and physical cleanliness has been
   widely discussed recently. Studies found that moral threat initiates the
   need of physical cleanliness, but actual physical cleaning and priming
   of cleaning have inconsistent effects on subsequent attitudes and
   behaviors. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to explore the underlying neural mechanism of actual physical
   cleaning and priming of cleaning. After recalling moral transgression
   with strong feelings of guilt and shame, participants either actually
   cleaned their faces with a wipe or were primed with cleanliness through
   viewing its pictures. Results showed that actual physical cleaning
   reduced the spontaneous brain activities in the right insula and MPFC,
   regions that involved in embodied moral emotion processing, while
   priming of cleaning decreased activities in the right superior frontal
   gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, regions that participated in executive
   control processing. Additionally, actual physical cleaning also changed
   functional connectivity between insula/MPFC and emotion related regions,
   whereas priming of cleaning modified connectivity within both moral and
   sensorimotor areas. These findings revealed that actual physical
   cleaning and priming of cleaning led to changes in different brain
   regions and networks, providing neural evidence for the inconsistent
   effects of cleanliness on subsequent attitudes and behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by callous lack of
   empathy, impulsive antisocial behavior, and criminal recidivism. Studies
   of brain structure and function in psychopathy have frequently
   identified abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex. However, findings
   have not yet converged to yield a clear relationship between specific
   subregions of prefrontal cortex and particular psychopathic traits. We
   performed a multimodal neuroimaging study of prefrontal cortex volume
   and functional connectivity in psychopathy, using a sample of adult male
   prison inmates . We conducted volumetric analyses in prefrontal
   subregions, and subsequently assessed resting-state functional
   connectivity in areas where volume was related to psychopathy severity.
   We found that overall psychopathy severity and Factor 2 scores (which
   index the impulsive/antisocial traits of psychopathy) were associated
   with larger prefrontal subregion volumes, particularly in the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Furthermore,
   Factor 2 scores were also positively correlated with functional
   connectivity between several areas of the prefrontal cortex. The results
   were not attributable to age, race, IQ, substance use history, or brain
   volume. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for co-localized
   increases in prefrontal cortex volume and intra-prefrontal functional
   connectivity in relation to impulsive/antisocial psychopathic traits.}},

Abstract = {{Health communication via mass media is an important strategy when
   targeting risky drinking, but many questions remain about how health
   messages are processed and how they unfold their effects within
   receivers. Here we examine how the brains of young adults-a key target
   group for alcohol prevention-'tune in' to real-life health prevention
   messages about risky alcohol use. In a first study, a large sample of
   authentic public service announcements (PSAs) targeting the risks of
   alcohol was characterized using established measures of message
   effectiveness. In the main study, we used inter-subject correlation
   analysis of fMRI data to examine brain responses to more and less
   effective PSAs in a sample of young adults. We find that more effective
   messages command more similar responses within widespread brain regions,
   including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insulae and precuneus. In
   previous research, these regions have been related to processing
   narratives, emotional stimuli, self-relevance and attention towards
   salient stimuli. The present study thus suggests that more effective
   health prevention messages have greater `neural reach', i.e. they engage
   the brains of audience members' more widely. This work outlines a
   promising strategy for assessing the effects of health communication at
   a neural level.}},

Abstract = {{Eye-contact modifies how we perceive emotions and modulates activity in
   the social brain network. Here, using fMRI, we demonstrate that adding a
   fixation cross in the eye region of dynamic facial emotional stimuli
   significantly increases activation in the social brain of healthy,
   neurotypical participants when compared with activation for the exact
   same stimuli observed in a free-viewing mode. In addition, using PPI
   analysis, we show that the degree of amygdala connectivity with the rest
   of the brain is enhanced for the constrained view for all emotions
   tested except for fear, and that anxiety and alexithymia modulate the
   strength of amygdala connectivity for each emotion differently. Finally,
   we show that autistic traits have opposite effects on amygdala
   connectivity for fearful and angry emotional expressions, suggesting
   that these emotions should be treated separately in studies
   investigating facial emotion processing.}},

Abstract = {{Working memory (WM) and fluid intelligence (Gf) are thought to be highly
   related, though psychometrically distinct cognitive constructs. Both are
   important in a wide range of cognitively demanding tasks, and predictive
   of success in educational, occupational, and social domains. From a
   cognitive perspective, WM and Gf may share a capacity constraint due to
   the shared demand for attentional resources. Neuroimaging investigations
   of these two cognitive constructs have suggested similar shared frontal
   and parietal areas of neural activation as well, though to our knowledge
   the two have not been investigated in the same population. Here, we
   examine group level functional activations for tasks of WM (dual
   n-back), Gf (Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices; RSPM), as well as a
   theoretically unrelated comparison task of visual word/pseudoword
   decoding (lexical decision task) in a large sample of healthy young
   adults (N = 63) aged 18-40. Consistent with previous research, results
   indicate large areas of fronto-parietal activation in response to
   increasing task demands for the n-back task (dorsolateral,
   ventrolateral, and rostral prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex, and
   posterior parietal cortex), which largely subsume similar but more
   circumscribed regions of activation for the RSPM and lexical decision
   tasks. These results are discussed in terms of a task-general central
   network which may underlie performance of WM, Gf, and word decoding
   tasks alike, and perhaps even goal-directed behaviour more generally.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{7, SI}},
Pages = {{621-631}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is unknown whether there are neurobiologic differences
   between various anxiety and depressive disorders, or whether they are
   characterized by shared neurobiologic variation that cuts across
   diagnostic boundaries. For instance, multiple anxiety disorders and
   depression may be characterized by abnormalities in blood oxygen-level
   dependent (BOLD) response during the processing of affective scenes and
   faces. To interrogate the shared or unique nature of these aberrations,
   research that examines the influence of transdiagnostic, dimensional
   predictors across multiple diagnoses is needed.
   Methods: One hundred ninety-nine individuals, 142 with primary diagnoses
   of social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or
   major depressive disorder (MDD) and 57 free from psychiatric diagnoses
   (healthy controls, HCs), performed a face-matching task involving
   fearful, angry, and happy faces (and geometric shapes) while undergoing
   functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results: Across the three primary diagnoses, anxiety symptom scores were
   associated with increased Angry > Shapes activation in the bilateral
   insula, anterior/midcingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (dlPFC), while depressive symptoms were associated with reduced dlPFC
   activation for Angry > Shapes. Patient > HC differences were limited to
   non a priori regions, and no differences in BOLD activation were
   observed between diagnostic groups.
   Conclusions: (1) Activation in paralimbic, cingulate, and lateral
   prefrontal regions in response to angry faces is associated with
   transdiagnostic anxiety and depressive symptomatology. (2) Anxiety and
   depressive symptoms may exert opposing influences on lateral prefrontal
   activation. (3) Abnormal threat processing in GAD, SAD, and MDD may
   reflect shared neural dysfunction that varies with symptom load.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Accumulating evidence suggests that posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD) is associated with disrupted default mode network (DMN)
   connectivity, but findings across studies have not been uniform.
   Individual differences in relevant genes may account for some of the
   reported variability in the relationship betweenDMNconnectivity and
   PTSD. In this study, we investigated this possibility using genome-wide
   association study (GWAS) derived polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for
   relevant psychiatric traits. We hypothesized that the association
   betweenPTSDandDMNconnectivity would be moderated by genetic risk for one
   or more psychiatric traits such that individuals with elevated polygenic
   risk for psychopathology and severe PTSD would exhibit disrupted
   DMNconnectivity.
   Methods: Participants were 156 white, non-Hispanic veterans of thewars
   in Iraq and Afghanistan who were genotyped and underwent resting state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and clinical assessment. PRSs for
   neuroticism, anxiety, major depressive disorder, and cross-disorder risk
   (based on five psychiatric disorders) were calculated using summary
   statistics from published large-scale consortia-basedGWASs.
   Results: Cross-disorder polygenic risk influenced the relationship
   betweenDMNconnectivity and PTSD symptom severity such that individuals
   at greater genetic risk showed a significant negative association
   between PTSD symptom severity and connectivity between the posterior
   cingulate cortex and right middle temporal gyrus. Polygenic risk for
   neuroticism, anxiety, and major depressive disorder did not
   influenceDMNconnectivity directly or through an interaction with PTSD.
   Conclusions: Findings illustrate the potential power of genome-wide PRSs
   to advance understanding of the relationship between PTSD and DMN
   connectivity, a putative neural endophenotype of the disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Disturbances in emotion regulation and sleep are shared
   across anxiety and mood disorders. Poor sleep has been shown to impair
   cognitive processes which may undermine cognitive regulatory function.
   However, it remains unknown if sleep quality impacts regulatory
   mechanisms in clinical anxiety and depression.
   Methods: During fMRI, 78 patients with social anxiety disorder,
   generalized anxiety disorder, and/or major depressive disorder completed
   a validated emotion regulation task, which involved reappraisal (i. e.,
   decrease negative affect) as compared to viewing aversive images. Sleep
   quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and
   actigraphy, representing subjective and objectivemeasures of sleep,
   respectively. Regression analysis was conducted with the PSQI and
   actigraphy sleep efficiency, duration, and wake-after sleep onset
   variables.
   Results: PSQI and actigraphy measures indicated that the majority of
   patients experienced problematic sleep, however, subjective and
   objective sleep measures were uncorrelated. Whole-brain voxel-wise
   regression analysis, controlling for diagnosis, revealed worse
   self-reported sleep corresponded with less reappraise-related activation
   in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC). The same analysis
   performed with actigraphy data showed less sleep efficiency positively
   corresponded with DACC activation. Post-hoc stepwise regression analysis
   showed these sleep measures predicted DACC activity whereas anxiety and
   depression symptoms did not.
   Conclusions: Individual differences in self-perceived and objective
   sleep quality differentially modulated the DACC, which is implicated in
   cognitive reappraisal. Findings suggest neural correlates of emotion
   regulation tracks different aspects of the sleep experience. Results
   also indicate sleep disturbancemay play a role in the emotion
   dysregulation observed in anxiety and depressive disorders.}},

Abstract = {{To understand temporally extended events, the human brain needs to
   accumulate information continuously across time. Interruptions that
   require switching of attention to other event sequences disrupt this
   process. To reveal neural mechanisms supporting integration of event
   information, we measured brain activity with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) from 18 participants while they viewed
   6.5-minute excerpts from three movies (i) consecutively and (ii) as
   interleaved segments of approximately 50-s in duration. We measured
   inter-subject reliability of brain activity by calculating inter-subject
   correlations (ISC) of fMRI signals and analyzed activation timecourses
   with a general linear model (GLM). Interleaving decreased the ISC in
   posterior temporal lobes, medial prefrontal cortex, superior precuneus,
   medial occipital cortex, and cerebellum. In the GLM analyses, posterior
   temporal lobes were activated more consistently by instances of speech
   when the movies were viewed consecutively than as interleaved segments.
   By contrast, low-level auditory and visual stimulus features and editing
   boundaries caused similar activity patterns in both conditions. In the
   medial occipital cortex, decreases in ISC were seen in short bursts
   throughout the movie clips. By contrast, the other areas showed
   longer-lasting differences in ISC during isolated scenes depicting
   socially-relevant and suspenseful content, such as deception or
   inter-subject conflict. The areas in the posterior temporal lobes also
   showed sustained activity during continuous actions and were deactivated
   when actions ended at scene boundaries. Our results suggest that the
   posterior temporal and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, as well as the
   cerebellum and dorsal precuneus, support integration of events into
   coherent event sequences. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Journal = {{HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3428-3443}},

Abstract = {{The motivation to receive rewards enhances episodic memories, and the
   motivation is modulated by task difficulty. In episodic retrieval,
   however, functional neuroimaging evidence regarding the motivation that
   mediates interactions between reward and task difficulty is scarce. The
   present fMRI study investigated this issue. During encoding performed
   without fMRI, participants encoded Japanese words using either deep or
   shallow strategies, which led to variation in difficulty level during
   subsequent retrieval. During retrieval with fMRI, participants
   recognized the target words in either high or low monetary reward
   conditions. In the behavioral results, a reward-related enhancement of
   memory was found only when the memory retrieval was difficult, and the
   rewarding effect on subjective motivation was greater in the retrieval
   of memories with high difficulty than those with low difficulty. The
   fMRI data showed that reward-related increases in the activation of the
   substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), medial temporal lobe
   (MTL), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) were greater during the retrieval of memories
   with high difficulty than those with low difficulty. Furthermore,
   reward-related enhancement of functional connectivity between the SN/VTA
   and MTL and between the SN/VTA and dmPFC during the retrieval of
   memories with high difficulty was significantly correlated with
   reward-related increases of retrieval accuracy and subjective
   motivation. The reward-related enhancement of episodic retrieval and
   retrieval-related motivation could be most effective when the level of
   retrieval difficulty is optimized. Such reward-related enhancement
   memory and motivation could be modulated by a network including the
   reward-related SN/VTA, motivation-related dmPFC, and memory-related MTL.

Abstract = {{Based on higher prevalence rates of several mental disorders for city
   dwellers, psychosocial stress effects of urban living have been proposed
   as an environmental risk factor contributing to the development of
   mental disorders. Recently, it was shown that amygdala activation
   differs between city dwellers and rural residents in response to a
   cognitive-social stressor. Besides its influence on the amygdala,
   chronic stress also affects mesocorticolimbic brain regions involved in
   reward processing, and stress-related dysregulation of the
   mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is thought to contribute to onset and
   manifestation of psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated
   differences in reward systems functioning in 147 healthy subjects living
   either in cities or in less urban areas by means of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging during performance of the desire-reason-dilemma
   paradigm, which permits a targeted investigation of bottom-up activation
   and top-down regulation of the reward circuit. Compared with subjects
   from less urban areas, city dwellers showed an altered activation and
   modulation capability of the midbrain (VTA) dopamine system. City
   dwellers also revealed increased responses in other brain regions
   involved in reward processing and in the regulation of stress and
   emotions, such as amygdala, orbitofrontal, and pregenual anterior
   cingulate cortex. These results provide further evidence for effects of
   an urban environment on the mesolimbic dopamine system and the limbic
   system which may increase the risk to develop mental disorders. (C) 2017

   for Civilization Diseases (LIFE) cohort (60-80 years old, mean BMI 27.6
   kg/m(2) +/- 4.2 SD, main sample: n = 521, replication sample: n = 191)
   was determined. Statistical analyses included a multivariate model
   selection approach followed by univariate analyses to adjust for
   possible confounders. Results showed that a higher BMI was significantly
   associated with lower default mode functional connectivity in the
   posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. The effect remained stable
   after controlling for age, sex, head motion, registration quality,
   cardiovascular, and genetic factors as well as in replication analyses.
   Lower functional connectivity in BMI-associated areas correlated with
   worse executive function. In addition, higher BMI correlated with
   stronger head motion. Using 3T neuroimaging in a large cohort of healthy
   older adults, independent negative associations of obesity and
   functional connectivity in the posterior default mode network were
   observed. In addition, a subtle link between lower resting-state
   connectivity in BMI-associated regions and cognitive function was found.
   The findings might indicate that obesity is associated with patterns of
   decreased default mode connectivity similar to those seen in populations
   at risk for Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{To analyze the involvement of different brain regions in behavioral
   inhibition and impulsiveness, differences in activation were
   investigated in fMRI data from a response inhibition task, the
   stop-signal task, in 1709 participants. First, areas activated more in
   stop-success (SS) than stop-failure (SF) included the lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) extending into the inferior frontal gyrus
   (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, BA 47/12), and the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Second, the anterior cingulate and anterior
   insula (AI) were activated more on failure trials, specifically in SF
   versus SS. The interaction between brain region and SS versus SF
   activations was significant (P=5.6 {*} 10(-8)). The results provide new
   evidence from this ``big data{''} investigation consistent with the
   hypotheses that the lateral OFC is involved in the stop-related
   processing that inhibits the action; that the DLPFC is involved in
   attentional processes that influence task performance; and that the AI
   and anterior cingulate are involved in emotional processes when failure
   occurs. The investigation thus emphasizes the role of the human lateral
   OFC BA 47/12 in changing behavior, and inhibiting behavior when
   necessary. A very similar area in BA47/12 is involved in changing
   behavior when an expected reward is not obtained, and has been shown to
   have high functional connectivity in depression. (C) 2017 Wiley

Abstract = {{Empathy has been found to affect the neural processing of social and
   monetary rewards. Alexithymia, a subclinical condition showing a close
   inverse relationship with empathy is linked to dysfunctions of
   socio-emotional processing in the brain. Whether alexithymia alters the
   neural processing of rewards, which is currently unknown. Here, we
   investigated the influence of both alexithymia and empathy on reward
   processing using a social incentive delay (SID) task and a monetary
   incentive delay (MID) task in 45 healthy men undergoing functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Controlling for temperament-character
   dimensions and rejection sensitivity, the relationship of alexithymia
   and empathy with neural activity in several a priori regions of interest
   (ROIs) was examined by means of partial correlations, while participants
   anticipated and received social and monetary rewards. Results were
   considered significant if they survived Holm-Bonferroni correction for
   multiple comparisons. Alexithymia modulated neural activity in several
   ROIs of the emotion and reward network, both during the anticipation of
   social and monetary rewards and in response to the receipt of monetary
   rewards. In contrast, empathy did not affect reward anticipation and
   modulated ROI activity only in response to the receipt of social
   rewards. These results indicate a significant influence of alexithymia
   on the processing of social and monetary rewards in the healthy brain.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{52-62}},

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) regulates social behavior in sex-specific
   ways across species. OT has promising effects on alleviating social
   deficits in sex-biased neuropsychiatric disorders. However little is
   known about potential sexually dimorphic effects of OT on brain
   function. Using the rat as a model organism, we determined whether OT
   administered centrally or peripherally induces sex differences in brain
   activation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine
   blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity changes in the
   brains of awake rats during the 20 min following intracerebroventricular
   (ICV; 1 g/5 I) or intraperitoneal (IP; 0.1 mg/kg) OT administration as
   compared to baseline. ICV OT induced sex differences in BOLD activation
   in 26 out of 172 brain regions analyzed, with 20 regions showing a
   greater volume of activation in males (most notably the nucleus
   accumbens and insular cortex), and 6 regions showing a greater volume of
   activation in females (including the lateral and central amygdala). IP
   OT also elicited sex differences in BOLD activation with a greater
   volume of activation in males, but this activation was found in
   different and fewer (10) brain regions compared to ICV OT. In
   conclusion, exogenous OT modulates neural activation differently in male
   versus female rats with the pattern and magnitude, but not the
   direction, of sex differences depending on the route of administration.
   These findings highlight the need to include both sexes in basic and
   clinical studies to fully understand the role of OT on brain function.}},

Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{32-43}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{We examined whether adolescents' neural responses to social exclusion
   and inclusion are influenced by their own popularity and acceptance and
   by the popularity of their excluders and includers. Accepted adolescents
   are highly prosocial. In contrast, popular adolescents, who are central
   and influential, show prosocial as well as antisocial behaviors, such as
   peer exclusion. Fifty-two 12-16 year-old adolescents underwent an
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan while playing the
   ball-tossing game Cyberball in which they received or did not receive
   the ball from other virtual players. The other virtual players were
   described as either highly popular or average in popularity.
   Participants' own popularity and acceptance were assessed with peer
   nominations at school (n = 31). Participants' acceptance was positively
   correlated with activity of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
   during exclusion. Participants' popularity was positively associated
   with ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex activity during
   exclusion, but only when the excluders were popular virtual players.
   Participants showed increased rostral ACC activation to inclusion by
   players who were average in popularity. These findings indicate that
   peer status plays an important role in adolescents' neural processing of
   social exclusion and inclusion. Moreover, these findings underscore that
   popularity and acceptance are distinct types of high peer status in
   adolescence, with not only distinct behavioral correlates, but also
   distinct neural correlates. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is considerable variation in negative and positive symptoms of
   psychosis, global functioning, and emotional face perception (EFP), not
   only in schizophrenia but also in other psychotic disorders and healthy
   individuals. However, EFP impairment and its association with worse
   symptoms and global functioning have been examined largely in the domain
   of schizophrenia. The present study adopted a dimensional approach to
   examine the association of behavioral and neural measures of EFP with
   symptoms of psychosis and global functioning across individuals with
   schizophrenia spectrum (SZ; N = 28) and other psychotic (OP; N = 29)
   disorders, and never-psychotic participants (NP; N = 21). Behavioral and
   functional MRI data were recorded as participants matched emotional
   expressions of faces and geometrical shapes. Lower accuracy and
   increased activity in early visual regions, hippocampus, and amygdala
   during emotion versus shape matching were associated with higher
   negative, but not positive, symptoms and lower global functioning,
   across all participants. This association remained even after
   controlling for group-related (SZ, OP, and NP) variance, dysphoria, and
   antipsychotic medication status, except in amygdala. Furthermore,
   negative symptoms mediated the relationship between behavioral and brain
   EFP measures and global functioning. This study provides some of the
   first evidence supporting the specific relationship of EFP measures with
   negative symptoms and global functioning across psychotic and
   never-psychotic samples, and transdiagnostically across different
   psychotic disorders. Present findings help bridge the gap between basic
   EFP-related neuroscience research and clinical research in psychosis,
   and highlight EFP as a potential symptom-specific marker that tracks
   global functioning.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of RDoC reward constructs in adolescents with diverse
   psychiatric symptoms: A Reward Flanker Task pilot study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{216}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{36-45}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: There has been growing interest under the Research Domain
   Criteria initiative to investigate behavioral constructs and their
   underlying neural circuitry. Abnormalities in reward processes are
   salient across psychiatric conditions and may precede future
   psychopathology in youth. However, the neural circuitry underlying such
   deficits has not been well defined. Therefore, in this pilot, we studied
   youth with diverse psychiatric symptoms and examined the neural
   underpinnings of reward anticipation, attainment, and positive
   prediction error (PPE, unexpected reward gain). Clinically, we focused
   on anhedonia, known to reflect deficits in reward function.
   Methods: Twenty-two psychotropic medication-free youth, 16 with
   psychiatric symptoms, exhibiting a full range of anhedonia, were scanned
   during the Reward Flanker Task. Anhedonia severity was quantified using
   the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging analyses were false discovery rate corrected for multiple
   comparisons.
   Results: Anticipation activated a broad network, including the medial
   frontal cortex and ventral striatum, while attainment activated memory
   and emotion-related regions such as the hippocampus and parahippocampal
   gyrus, but not the ventral striatum. PPE activated a right-dominant
   fronto-temporo-parietal network. Anhedonia was only correlated with
   activation of the right angular gyrus during anticipation and the left
   precuneus during PPE at an uncorrected threshold.
   Limitations: Findings are preliminary due to the small sample size.
   Conclusions: This pilot characterized the neural circuitry underlying
   different aspects of reward processing in youth with diverse psychiatric
   symptoms. These results highlight the complexity of the neural circuitry
   underlying reward anticipation, attainment, and PPE. Furthermore, this
   study underscores the importance of RDoC research in youth.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that solving mental tasks leads to tonic increase in
   cardiovascular activity. Our previous research showed that tasks
   involving rule application (RA) caused greater tonic increase in
   cardiovascular activity than tasks requiring rule discovery (RD).
   However, it is not clear what brain mechanisms are responsible for this
   difference. The aim of two experimental studies was to compare the
   patterns of brain and cardiovascular activity while both RD and the RA
   numeric tasks were being solved. The fMRI study revealed greater brain
   activation while solving RD tasks than while solving RA tasks. In
   particular, RD tasks evoked greater activation of the left inferior
   frontal gyrus and selected areas in the parietal, and temporal cortices,
   including the precuneus, supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus, inferior
   parietal lobule, and the superior temporal gyrus, and the cingulate
   cortex. In addition, RA tasks caused larger increases in HR than RD
   tasks. The second study, carried out in a cardiovascular laboratory,
   showed greater increases in heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure
   (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP)
   while solving RA tasks than while solving RD tasks. The results support
   the hypothesis that RD and RA tasks involve different modes of
   information processing, but the neuronal mechanism responsible for the
   observed greater cardiovascular response to RA tasks than to RD tasks is
   not completely clear.}},

Title = {{Functional MRI examination of empathy for pain in people with
   schizophrenia reveals abnormal activation related to cognitive
   perspective-taking but typical activation linked to affective sharing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY \& NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background Schizophrenia is associated with important disturbances in
   empathy that are related to everyday functioning. Empathy is classically
   defined as including affective (sharing others' emotions) and cognitive
   (taking others' cognitive perspectives) processes. In healthy
   individuals, studies on empathy for pain revealed specific brain systems
   associated with these sets of processes, notably the anterior middle
   cingulate (aMCC) and anterior insula (AI) for affective sharing and the
   bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ) for the cognitive processes,
   but the integrity of these systems in patients with schizophrenia
   remains uncertain.
   Methods Patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls performed a
   pain empathy task while undergoing fMRI scanning. Participants observed
   pictures of hands in either painful or nonpainful situations and rated
   the level of pain while imagining either themselves (self) or an unknown
   person (other) in these situations.
   Results We included 27 patients with schizophrenia and 21 healthy
   controls in our analyses. For the pain versus no pain contrast, patients
   showed overall typical activation patterns in the aMCC and AI, with only
   a small part of the aMCC showing reduced activation compared with
   controls. For the other versus self contrast, patients showed an
   abnormal modulation of activation in the TPJ bilaterally (extending to
   the posterior superior temporal sulcus, referred to as the TPJ/pSTS).
   Limitations The design included an unnecessary manipulation of the
   visual perspective that reduced the number of trials for analysis. The
   sample size may not account for the heterogeneity of schizophrenia.
   Conclusion People with schizophrenia showed relatively intact brain
   activation when observing others' pain, but showed abnormalities when
   asked to take the cognitive perspectives of others.}},

   maintain functional connectivity between long-distance regions even
   after controlling for other covariates such as age, gender, education,
   and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Network Based Statistics (NBS)
   also revealed strong and consistent evidence that social network

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has elucidated that procrastination can be influenced
   by regulatory mode orientations. However, the neural mechanism of
   regulatory modes affecting procrastination is not well understood. To
   address this question, we employed resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) to test the influence of two regulatory
   modes (assessment and locomotion) on procrastination. The behavioral
   results showed that procrastination was positively correlated with
   assessment orientation but negatively correlated with locomotion
   orientation. Neuroimaging results indicated that the functional
   connectivity between parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and dorsal anterior
   cingulate (dACC) was negatively correlated with assessment scores, while
   the functional connectivity between anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC)
   and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) was negatively correlated with
   locomotion scores. Critically, mediation analysis showed that the
   different effects of two distinct regulatory modes on procrastination
   were mediated by PHC-dACC and aPFC-PHC functional connectivity
   respectively. These results suggested that people's procrastination
   could be predicted by regulatory mode orientations, which is mediated by
   PHC connectivity with dACC and aPFC respectively. The present study
   extends our knowledge on procrastination and provides neural mechanism
   for understanding the link between regulatory mode orientations and
   procrastination.}},

Abstract = {{Mindfulness is paying attention, non-judgmentally, to experience in the
   moment. Mindfulness training reduces depression and anxiety and
   influences neural processes in midline self-referential and lateralized
   somatosensory and executive networks. Although mindfulness benefits
   emotion regulation, less is known about its relationship to anger and
   the corresponding neural correlates. This study examined the
   relationship of mindful awareness and brain hemodynamics of angry face
   processing, and the impact of mindfulness training. Eighteen healthy
   volunteers completed an angry face processing fMRI paradigm and
   measurement of mindfulness and anger traits. Ten of these participants
   were recruited from a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) class
   and also completed imaging and other assessments post-training.
   Self-reported mindful awareness increased after MBSR, but trait anger
   did not change. Baseline mindful awareness was negatively related to
   left inferior parietal lobule activation to angry faces; trait anger was
   positively related to right middle frontal gyrus and bilateral angular
   gyrus. No significant pre-post changes in angry face processing were
   found, but changes in trait mindful awareness and anger were associated
   with sub-threshold differences in paralimbic activation. These
   preliminary and hypothesis-generating findings, suggest the analysis of
   possible impact of mindfulness training on anger may begin with
   individual differences in angry face processing.}},

   Attentional Orienting in Autism Spectrum Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{Impaired joint attention represents the core clinical feature of autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD). Behavioral studies have suggested that
   gaze-triggered attentional orienting is intact in response to
   supraliminally presented eyes but impaired in response to subliminally
   presented eyes in individuals with ASD. However, the neural mechanisms
   underlying conscious and unconscious gaze-triggered attentional
   orienting remain unclear. We investigated this issue in ASD and
   typically developing (TD) individuals using event-related functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. The participants viewed cue stimuli of
   averted or straight eye gaze direction presented either supraliminally
   or subliminally and then localized a target. Reaction times were shorter
   when eye-gaze cues were directionally valid compared with when they were
   neutral under the supraliminal condition in both groups; the same
   pattern was found in the TD group but not the ASD group under the
   subliminal condition. The temporo-parieto-frontal regions showed
   stronger activation in response to averted eyes than to straight eyes in
   both groups under the supraliminal condition. The left amygdala was more
   activated while viewing averted vs. straight eyes in the TD group than
   in the ASD group under the subliminal condition. These findings provide
   an explanation for the neural mechanisms underlying the impairment in
   unconscious but not conscious gaze-triggered attentional orienting in
   individuals with ASD and suggest possible neurological and behavioral
   interventions to facilitate their joint attention behaviors.}},

Title = {{fMRI Repetition Suppression During Generalized Social Categorization}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Correctly identifying friends and foes is integral to successful group
   living. Here, we use repetition suppression to examine the neural
   circuitry underlying generalized group categorization-the process of
   categorizing in-group and out-group members across multiple social
   categories. Participants assigned to an arbitrary team (i.e., Eagles or
   Rattlers) underwent fMRI while categorizing political and arbitrary
   in-group and out-group members. We found that frontoparietal control
   network exhibited repetition suppression in response to ``identical
   in-group{''} (Democrat-Democrat or Eagles-Eagles) and ``different
   in-group{''} (Eagles-Democrat or Democrat-Eagles) trials relative to
   ``out-group/in-group trials{''} (Republican-Democrat or Rattler-Eagles).
   Specifically, the repetition suppression contrast map included bilateral
   superior parietal lobule, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC), and bilateral middle temporal gyrus. Participants who reported
   an increased tendency to join and value their social groups exhibited
   decreased repetition suppression in bilateral DLPFC. Comparison of our
   whole-brain repetition suppression map with an independently identified
   map of frontoparietal control network revealed 34.3\% overlap. Social
   categorization requires recognizing both a target's group membership but
   also the target's orientation toward one's self. Fittingly, we find that
   generalized social categorization engages a network that acts as a
   functional bridge between dorsal attentional (exogenously-oriented) and
   default mode (internally-oriented) networks.}},

Title = {{Separability of motor imagery of the self from interpretation of motor
   intentions of others at the single trial level: an EEG study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: We aimed to investigate the separability of the neural
   correlates of 2 types of motor imagery, self and third person (actions
   owned by the participant himself vs. another individual). If possible
   this would allow for the development of BCI interfaces to train
   disorders of action and intention understanding beyond simple imitation,
   such as autism.
   Methods: We used EEG recordings from 20 healthy participants, as well as
   electrocorticography (ECoG) in one, based on a virtual reality setup. To
   test feasibility of discrimination between each type of imagery at the
   single trial level, time-frequency and source analysis were performed
   and further assessed by data-driven statistical classification using
   Support Vector Machines.
   Results: The main observed differences between self-other imagery
   conditions in topographic maps were found in Frontal and
   Parieto-Occipital regions, in agreement with the presence of 2
   independent non mu related contributions in the low alpha frequency
   range. ECOG corroborated such separability. Source analysis also showed
   differences near the temporo- parietal junction and single-trial average
   classification accuracy between both types of motor imagery was 67 +/-
   1\%, and raised above 70\% when 3 trials were used. The single-trial
   classification accuracy was significantly above chance level for all the
   participants of this study (p < 0.02).
   Conclusions: The observed pattern of results show that Self and Third
   Person MI use distinct electrophysiological mechanisms detectable at the
   scalp (and ECOG) at the single trial level, with separable levels of
   involvement of the mirror neuron system in different regions. These
   observations provide a promising step to develop new BCI
   training/rehabilitation paradigms for patients with neurodevelopmental
   disorders of action understanding beyond simple imitation, such as
   autism, who would benefit from training and anticipation of the
   perceived intention of others as opposed to own intentions in social
   contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Encountering another's suffering can elicit both empathic distress and
   empathic care-the warm desire to affiliate. It remains unclear whether
   these two feelings can be accurately and differentially predicted from
   neural activity and to what extent their neural substrates can be
   distinguished. We developed fMRI markers predicting moment-by-moment
   intensity levels of care and distress intensity while participants (n =
   66) listened to true biographies describing human suffering. Both
   markers' predictions correlated strongly with self-report in
   out-of-sample participants (r = 0.59 and r = 0.63, p < 0.00001), and
   both markers predicted later trialby-trial charitable donation amounts
   (p < 0.05). Empathic care was preferentially associated with nucleus
   accumbens and medial orbitofrontal cortex activity, whereas distress was
   preferentially associated with premotor and somatosensory cortical
   activity. In tests of marker specificity with an independent behavioral
   sample (n = 200), the empathic care marker was associated with a
   mixed-valence feeling state, whereas the empathic distress marker was
   specific to negative emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with s/s genotype of serotonin transporter gene-linked
   promotor region (5-HTTLPR), which appear with a high frequency in
   Japanese, exhibit more diagnosable depression in relation to stressful
   life events than those with the s/l or l/l genotype. We prospectively
   investigated the brain volume changes in first-episode and medication
   naive major depression disorder patients (MDD) with the s/s genotype in
   Japanese. We assessed the differences between 27 MDD with the s/s
   genotype and 44 healthy subjects (HS) with the same genotype using a
   whole-brain voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis of MRI. Gray matter
   volume in a brain region with significant clusters obtained via
   voxel-based morphometry analysis were measured and, as an exploratory
   analysis, evaluated for relationships to the subcategory scores (core,
   sleep, activity, psychic, somatic anxiety, delusion) of the Hamilton
   Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Social Readjustment Rating Scale
   (SRRS). The brain volume in the left insula lobe was significantly
   smaller in the MDD than in the HS. The left insula lobe volume
   correlated negatively with the ``psychic{''} score of HAM-D and the
   SRRS. In a Japanese population with the s/s genotype, we found an
   atrophy of the insula in the MDD, which might be associated with
   ``psychic{''} symptom and stress events.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the association between human personality traits and
   resting-state brain activity has gained interest in neuroimaging
   studies. However, it remains unclear if Big Five personality traits are
   represented in frequency bands (similar to 0.25 Hz) of resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity. Based on earlier
   neurophysiological studies, we investigated the correlation between the
   five personality traits assessed by the NEO Five-Factor Inventory
   (NEO-FFI), and the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation
   (fALFF) at four distinct frequency bands (slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz), slow-4
   (0.027-0.073 Hz), slow-3 (0.073-0.198 Hz) and slow-2 (0.198-0.25 Hz)).
   We enrolled 835 young subjects and calculated the correlations of
   resting-state fMRI signals using a multiple regression analysis. We
   found a significant and consistent correlation between fALFF and the
   personality trait of extraversion at all frequency bands. Furthermore,
   significant correlations were detected in distinct brain regions for
   each frequency band. This finding supports the frequency-specific
   spatial representations of personality traits as previously suggested.
   In conclusion, our data highlight an association between human
   personality traits and fALFF at four distinct frequency bands.}},

Title = {{Impaired Coupling between the Dorsomedial Prefrontal Cortex and the
   Amygdala in Schizophrenia Smokers Viewing Anti-smoking Images}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cigarette smoking is highly prevalent in schizophrenia and
   is one of the main factors contributing to the significantly decreased
   life expectancy in this population. Schizophrenia smokers, compared to
   their counterparts with no comorbid psychiatric disorder, are largely
   unaware and indifferent to the long-term negative consequences of
   cigarette smoking. The objective of this study was to determine, for the
   first time, if these meta-cognitive deficits are associated with
   neuro-functional alterations in schizophrenia smokers.
   Methods: Twenty-four smokers with no psychiatric disorder and 21 smokers
   with schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) were scanned using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and exposed to anti-smoking images. Granger
   causality analyses were used to examine the effective connectivity
   between brain regions found to be significantly activated.
   Results: Across groups, potent activations were observed in the left
   ventro-lateral pre-frontal cortex, the left amygdala (AMG), and the
   dorsomedial pre-frontal cortex (dmPFC). Using the dmPFC as a seed
   region, we found an abnormal negative connectivity from the dmPFC to the
   AMG in schizophrenia smokers during the viewing of anti-smoking stimuli.
   This abnormal connectivity was not present during the viewing of
   aversive stimuli unrelated to tobacco.
   Discussion: Given the well-established roles of the dmPFC in social
   cognition and of the AMG in emotional processing, our results suggest
   that the relative indifference of schizophrenia smokers regarding the
   negative consequences of tobacco smoking could be explained by a
   cognitive-affective dissonance.}},

Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Studies focusing on the comprehension of figurative language among
   schizophrenia patients (SZ) reveal their difficulties comprehending such
   language and their tendency to interpret it literally. The present study
   investigated hemispheric processing and comprehension of irony in 16 SZ
   patients and 18 typically developing (TD) adults. Two experimental tasks
   were used: an online divided visual field experiment and an offline
   irony questionnaire. The results show an atypical reversal of
   hemispheric processing of irony in SZ patients as compared to TD adults.
   While the TD group demonstrated a right hemisphere advantage in
   processing irony, SZ patients demonstrated a left hemisphere advantage.
   Greater comprehension of irony was associated with decreased negative
   symptoms. In addition, under conditions that not involving a time
   restriction, the SZ patients' performance improved. Our findings
   reinforce those of previous studies suggesting that brain lateralization
   is atypical in SZ patients.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout human evolution, infectious diseases have been a primary
   cause of death. Detection of subtle cues indicating sickness and
   avoidance of sick conspecifics would therefore be an adaptive way of
   coping with an environment fraught with pathogens. This study determines
   how humans perceive and integrate early cues of sickness in conspecifics
   sampled just hours after the induction of immune system activation, and
   the underlying neural mechanisms for this detection. In a double-blind
   placebo-controlled crossover design, the immune system in 22 sample
   donors was transiently activated with an endotoxin injection
   {[}lipopolysaccharide (LPS)]. Facial photographs and body odor samples
   were taken from the same donors when ``sick{''} (LPS-injected) and when
   ``healthy{''} (saline-injected) and subsequently were presented to a
   separate group of participants (n = 30) who rated their liking of the
   presented person during fMRI scanning. Faces were less socially
   desirable when sick, and sick body odors tended to lower liking of the
   faces. Sickness status presented by odor and facial photograph resulted
   in increased neural activation of odor-and faceperception networks,
   respectively. A superadditive effect of olfactory-visual integration of
   sickness cues was found in the intraparietal sulcus, which was
   functionally connected to core areas of multisensory integration in the
   superior temporal sulcus and orbitofrontal cortex. Taken together, the
   results outline a disease-avoidance model in which neural mechanisms
   involved in the detection of disease cues and multisensory integration
   are vital parts.}},

Title = {{Support Vector Machine Analysis of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   of Interoception Does Not Reliably Predict Individual Outcomes of
   Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: The approach to apply multivariate pattern analyses based on
   neuro imaging data for outcome prediction holds out the prospect to
   improve therapeutic decisions in mental disorders. Patients suffering
   from panic disorder with agoraphobia (PD/AG) often exhibit an increased
   perception of bodily sensations. The purpose of this investigation was
   to assess whether multivariate classification applied to a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) interoception paradigm can predict
   individual responses to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in PD/AG.
   Methods: This analysis is based on pretreatment fMRI data during an
   interoceptive challenge from a multicenter trial of the German
   PANIC-NET. Patients with DSM-IV PD/ AG were dichotomized as responders
   (n = 30) or non-responders (n = 29) based on the primary outcome
   (Hamilton Anxiety Scale Reduction >= 50\%) after 6 weeks of CBT (2 h/
   week). fMRI parametric maps were used as features for response
   classification with linear support vector machines (SVM) with or without
   automated feature selection. Predictive accuracies were assessed using
   cross validation and permutation testing. The influence of
   methodological parameters and the predictive ability for specific
   interoception-related symptom reduction were further evaluated.
   Results: SVM did not reach sufficient overall predictive accuracies
   (38.0-54.2\%) for anxiety reduction in the primary outcome. In the
   exploratory analyses, better accuracies (66.7\%) were achieved for
   predicting interoception specific symptom relief as an alternative
   outcome domain. Subtle information regarding this alternative response
   criterion but not the primary outcome was revealed by post hoc
   univariate comparisons.
   Conclusion: In contrast to reports on other neurofunctional probes, SVM
   based on an interoception paradigm was not able to reliably predict
   individual response to CBT. Results speak against the clinical
   applicability of this technique.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of evidence accumulation during value-based decisions
   revealed via simultaneous EEG-fMRI}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Current computational accounts posit that, in simple binary choices,
   humans accumulate evidence in favour of the different alternatives
   before committing to a decision. Neural correlates of this accumulating
   activity have been found during perceptual decisions in parietal and
   prefrontal cortex; however the source of such activity in value-based
   choices remains unknown. Here we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI and
   computational modelling to identify EEG signals reflecting an
   accumulation process and demonstrate that the within-and across-trial
   variability in these signals explains fMRI responses in posterior-medial
   frontal cortex. Consistent with its role in integrating the evidence
   prior to reaching a decision, this region also exhibits task-dependent
   coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum, brain
   areas known to encode the subjective value of the decision alternatives.
   These results further endorse the proposition of an evidence
   accumulation process during value-based decisions in humans and
   implicate the posterior-medial frontal cortex in this process.}},

Title = {{Stochastic Signatures of Involuntary Head Micro-movements Can Be Used to
   Classify Females of ABIDE into Different Subtypes of Neurodevelopmental

Abstract = {{Background: The approximate 5: 1 male to female ratio in clinical
   detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) prevents research from
   characterizing the female phenotype. Current open access repositories
   {[}such as those in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE I-II)]
   contain large numbers of females to help begin providing a new
   characterization of females on the autistic spectrum. Here we introduce
   new methods to integrate data in a scale-free manner from continuous
   biophysical rhythms of the nervous systems and discrete (ordinal)
   observational scores.
   Methods : New data-types derived from image-based involuntary head
   motions and personalized statistical platform were combined with a
   data-driven approach to unveil sub-groups within the female cohort.
   Further, to help refine the clinical DSM-based ASD vs. Asperger's
   Syndrome (AS) criteria, distributional analyses of ordinal score data
   from Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)-based criteria were
   used on both the female and male phenotypes.
   Results : Separate clusters were automatically uncovered in the female
   cohort corresponding to differential levels of severity. Specifically,
   the AS-subgroup emerged as the most severely affected with an excess
   level of noise and randomness in the involuntary head micro-movements.
   Extending the methods to characterize males of ABIDE revealed ASD-males
   to be more affected than AS-males. A thorough study of ADOS-2 and ADOS-G
   scores provided confounding results regarding the ASD vs. AS male
   comparison, whereby the ADOS-2 rendered the AS-phenotype worse off than
   the ASD-phenotype, while ADOS-G flipped the results. Females with AS
   scored higher on severity than ASD-females in all ADOS test versions and
   their scores provided evidence for significantly higher severity than
   males. However, the statistical landscapes underlying female and male
   scores appeared disparate. As such, further interpretation of the ADOS
   data seems problematic, rather suggesting the critical need to develop
   an entirely new metric to measure social behavior in females.
   Conclusions : According to the outcome of objective, data-driven
   analyses and subjective clinical observation, these results support the
   proposition that the female phenotype is different. Consequently the
   ``social behavioral male ruler{''} will continue to mask the female
   autistic phenotype. It is our proposition that new observational
   behavioral tests ought to contain normative scales, be statistically
   sound and combined with objective data-driven approaches to better
   characterize the females across the human lifespan.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{The ability to assess another person's direction of attention is
   paramount in social communication, many studies have reported a similar
   pattern between gaze and arrow cues in attention orienting. Neuroimaging
   research has also demonstrated no qualitative differences in attention
   to gaze and arrow cues. However, these studies were implemented under
   simple experiment conditions. Researchers have highlighted the
   importance of contextual processing (i.e., the semantic congruence
   between cue and target) in attentional orienting, showing that
   attentional orienting by social gaze or arrow cues could be modulated
   through contextual processing. Here, we examine the neural activity of
   attentional orienting by gaze and arrow cues in response to contextual
   processing using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results
   demonstrated that the influence of neural activity through contextual
   processing to attentional orienting occurred under invalid conditions
   (when the cue and target were incongruent versus congruent) in the
   ventral frontoparietal network, although we did not identify any
   differences in the neural substrates of attentional orienting in
   contextual processing between gaze and arrow cues. These results support
   behavioural data of attentional orienting modulated by contextual
   processing based on the neurocognitive architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Humans readily sort one another into multiple social categories from
   mere facial features. However, the facial features used to do so are not
   always clear-cut because they can be associated with opponent categories
   (e.g., feminine male face). Recently, computational models and
   behavioral studies have provided indirect evidence that categorizing
   such faces is accomplished through dynamic competition between parallel,
   coactivated social categories that resolve into a stable categorical
   percept. Using a novel paradigm combining fMRI with real-time hand
   tracking, the present study examined how the brain translates diverse
   social cues into categorical percepts. Participants (male and female)
   categorized faces varying in gender and racial typicality. When
   categorizing atypical faces, participants' hand movements were
   simultaneously attracted toward the unselected category response,
   indexing the degree to which such faces activated the opposite category
   in parallel. Multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPAs) provided evidence that
   such social category coactivation manifested in neural patterns of the
   right fusiform cortex. The extent to which the hand was simultaneously
   attracted to the opposite gender or race category response option
   corresponded to increased neural pattern similarity with the average
   pattern associated with that category, which in turn associated with
   stronger engagement of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. The
   findings point to a model of social categorization in which occasionally
   conflicting facial features are resolved through competition between
   coactivated ventral-temporal cortical representations with the
   assistance of conflict-monitoring regions. More broadly, the results
   offer a promising multimodal paradigm to investigate the neural basis of
   ``hidden{''}, temporarily active representations in the service of a
   broad range of cognitive processes.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder
   characterized by social deficits and repetitive behaviors that typically
   emerge by 24 months of age. To develop effective early interventions
   that can potentially ameliorate the defining deficits of ASD and improve
   long-term outcomes, early detection is essential. Using prospective
   neuroimaging of 59 6-month-old infants with a high familial risk for
   ASD, we show that functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging
   correctly identified which individual children would receive a research
   clinical best-estimate diagnosis of ASD at 24months of age. Functional
   brain connections were defined in 6-month-old infants that correlated
   with 24-month scores on measures of social behavior, language, motor
   development, and repetitive behavior, which are all features common to
   the diagnosis of ASD. A fully cross-validated machine learning algorithm
   applied at age 6 months had a positive predictive value of 100\% {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI), 62.9 to 100], correctly predicting 9 of 11
   infants who received a diagnosis of ASD at 24 months (sensitivity,

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{In the last two decades the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has become
   one of the most investigated areas of the brain. Extensive neuroimaging
   evidence suggests countless functions for this region, ranging from
   conflict and error coding, to social cognition, pain and effortful
   control. In response to this burgeoning amount of data, a proliferation
   of computational models has tried to characterize the neurocognitive
   architecture of ACC. Early seminal models provided a computational
   explanation for a relatively circumscribed set of empirical findings,
   mainly accounting for EEG and fMRI evidence. More recent models have
   focused on ACC's contribution to effortful control. In parallel to these
   developments, several proposals attempted to explain within a single
   computational framework a wider variety of empirical findings that span
   different cognitive processes and experimental modalities. Here we
   critically evaluate these modeling attempts, highlighting the continued
   need to reconcile the array of disparate ACC observations within a
   coherent, unifying framework.}},

Abstract = {{The intrinsic value of an action refers to the inherent sense that
   experiencing a behavior is enjoyable even if it has no explicit outcome.
   Previous research has suggested that a common valuation mechanism within
   the reward network may be responsible for processing the intrinsic value
   of achieving both the outcome and external rewards. However, how the
   intrinsic value of action is neurally represented remains unknown. We
   hypothesized that the intrinsic value of action is determined by an
   action-outcome contingency indicating the behavior is controllable and
   that the outcome of the action can be evaluated by this feedback.
   Consequently, the reward network should be activated, reflecting the
   generation of the intrinsic value of action. To test this hypothesis, we
   conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigation
   of a stopwatch game in which the action-outcome contingency was
   manipulated. This experiment involved 36 healthy volunteers and four
   versions of a stopwatch game that manipulated controllability (the
   feeling that participants were controlling the stopwatch themselves) and
   outcome (a signal allowing participants to see the result of their
   action). A free-choice experiment was administered after the fMRI to
   explore preference levels for each game. The results showed that the
   stopwatch game with the action-outcome contingency evoked a greater
   degree of enjoyment because the participants chose this condition over
   those that lacked such a contingency. The ventral striatum and midbrain
   were activated only when action-outcome contingency was present. Thus,
   the intrinsic value of action was represented by an increase in ventral
   striatal and midbrain activation. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Objective: Anxiety disorders are among the most frequent psychiatric
   disorders. Current treatment guidelines recommend antidepressants, the
   calcium modulator gabapentin, and benzodiazepines as pharmacological
   treatments. However, delayed onset of action precludes the use of
   antidepressants as an acute treatment, while benzodiazepines can be
   recommended only as an emergency treatment due to their inherent risk of
   dependence. Therefore, an alternative pharmacological agent with acute
   efficacy is needed. Preliminary evidence points towards possible
   anxiolytic properties of the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine. The
   goals of this study were to test the acute anxiolytic properties of
   quetiapine in patients suffering from arachnophobia in a challenge
   paradigm, and to assess the effects of quetiapine on the central nervous
   fear network.
   Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
   proof-of-concept study, n = 58 arachnophobic patients underwent an fMRI
   scan while looking at phobia-related and neutral stimuli. Subjective
   anxiety was evaluated retrospectively in questionnaires.
   Results: The functional imaging data revealed that patients showed
   stronger amygdala activation to phobia related than to neutral stimuli.
   However, no effect of quetiapine on fear network activity was detected.
   Further, on questionnaire measures, quetiapine significantly reduced
   somatic anxiety symptoms, but had no effect on general psychological
   anxiety.
   Conclusion: Viewing phobic pictures resulted in a robust amygdala
   activation in arachnophobic patients. Quetiapine seems to have no
   influence on activation in anxiety-related brain areas but appears to
   reduce acute somatic anxiety symptoms in patients with specific phobia.
   The central nervous correlates of the anxiolytic effects of quetiapine
   remain to be clarified in future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The and cooperation increase from adolescence to adulthood, but studies
   on gender differences in this development are rare. We investigated
   gender and age-related differences in trust and reciprocity and
   associated neural mechanisms in 43 individuals (16-27 years, 22 male).
   Participants played two multi-round trust games with a cooperative and
   an unfair partner. Males showed more basic trust towards unknown others
   than females. Both genders increased trust during cooperative
   interactions, with no differences in average trust. Age was unrelated to
   trust during cooperation. During unfair interactions males decreased
   their trust more with age than females. ROI analysis showed age-related
   increases inactivation in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during cooperative investments,
   and increased age-related caudate activation during both cooperative and
   unfair repayments. Gender differences in brain activation were only
   observed during cooperative repayments, with males activating the TPJ
   more than females, and females activating the caudate more. The findings
   suggest relatively mature processes of trust and reciprocity in the
   investigated age range. Gender differences only occur in unfair
   contexts, becoming more pronounced with age. Largely similar neural
   activation in males and females and few age effects suggest that
   similar, mature cognitive strategies are employed. (c) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{In dialogue, language processing is adapted to the conversational
   partner. We hypothesize that the brain facilitates partner-adapted
   language processing through preparatory neural configurations (task
   sets) that are tailored to the conversational partner. In this
   experiment, we measured neural activity with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) while healthy participants in the scanner (a)
   engaged in a verbal communication task with a conversational partner
   outside of the scanner, or (b) spoke outside of a conversational context
   (to test the microphone). Using multivariate searchlight analysis, we
   identify cortical regions that represent information on whether speakers
   plan to speak to a conversational partner or without having a partner.
   Most notably a region that has been associated with processing
   social-affective information and perspective taking, the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex, as well as regions that have been associated with
   prospective task representation, the bilateral ventral prefrontal
   cortex, are involved in encoding the speaking condition. Our results
   suggest that speakers prepare, in advance of speaking, for the social
   context in which they will speak.}},

Abstract = {{Moral emotions elicited in response to others' suffering are mediated by
   empathy and affect how we respond to their pain. South Africa provides a
   unique opportunity to study group processes given its racially divided
   past. The present study seeks insights into aspects of the moral brain
   by investigating behavioral and functional MRI responses of White and
   Black South Africans who lived through apartheid to in-and out-group
   physical and social pain. Whereas the physical pain task featured faces
   expressing dynamic suffering, the social pain task featured victims of
   apartheid violence from the South African Truth and Reconciliation
   Commission to elicit heartfelt emotion. Black participants' behavioral
   responses were suggestive of in group favoritism, whereas White
   participants' responses were apparently egalitarian. However, all
   participants showed significant in-group biases in activation in the
   amygdala (physical pain), as well as areas involved in mental state
   representation, including the precuneus, temporoparietal junction (TPJ)
   and frontal pole (physical and social pain). Additionally, Black
   participants reacted with heightened moral indignation to own-race
   suffering, whereas White participants reacted with heightened shame to
   Black suffering, which was associated with blunted neural empathic
   responding. These findings provide ecologically valid insights into some
   behavioral and brain processes involved in complex moral situations.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy has been supposed to be a proximate mechanism of altruistic
   behavior. We investigated whether empathy for pain drives actions
   without altruistic effects and how such actions modulate neural
   responses to others' pain. In two experiments, we asked healthy adults
   to press a button for no reason when viewing video clips showing faces
   with pain expressions receiving needle penetration or faces with neutral
   expressions receiving a cotton swab touch. Experiment 1 found that
   participants pressed a button with greater response force when watching
   painful than non-painful stimuli. Participants who reported greater
   unpleasant feelings pressed the button harder when viewing painful
   stimuli. Experiment 2 revealed that passively viewing painful vs
   non-painful stimuli increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals in
   the middle cingulate cortex, supplementary motor cortex, and bilateral
   second somatosensory and inferior frontal cortex, which, however, were
   reduced by the action of button press without altruistic effects. In
   addition, individuals who reported higher personal distress illustrated
   greater decrease of the second somatosensory activity induced by button
   press. Our results indicate that empathy for pain motivates simple
   actions without altruistic effects that in turn reduce neural responses
   to others' pain, suggesting a functional role of action execution in
   self distress relief when viewing others' suffering.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to mentally represent future events is a significant human
   psychological achievement. A challenge that people encounter is that
   they often lack detailed specifics about distant relative to near future
   events. Construal level theory proposes that people represent distant
   future events by their abstract and essential features-a process
   referred to as high-level construal. As events become temporally
   proximal, people represent events by their increasingly available and
   reliable concrete and idiosyncratic features-a process referred to as
   low-level construal. The present fMRI experiment provides direct neural
   evidence for these assertions. Using the why-how localizer as a measure
   of construal level, results revealed brain regions associated with both
   temporal distance and high-level construal (medial prefrontal cortex),
   as well as temporal proximity and low-level construal (precuneus). We
   discuss the implications of these findings for the neuroscience of
   mental time travel and cognitive representation.}},

Abstract = {{The resting connectivity of the brain's salience network, particularly
   the ventral subsystem of the salience network, has been previously
   associated with various measures of affective reactivity. Numerous
   studies have demonstrated that increased affective arousal leads to
   enhanced consolidation of memory. This suggests that individuals with
   greater ventral salience network connectivity will exhibit greater
   responses to affective experience, leading to a greater enhancement of
   memory by affect. To test this hypothesis, resting ventral salience
   connectivity was measured in 41 young adults, who were then exposed to
   neutral and negative affect inductions during a paired associate memory
   test. Memory performance for material learned under both negative and
   neutral induction was tested for correlation with resting connectivity
   between major ventral salience nodes. The results showed a significant
   interaction between mood induction (negative vs neutral) and
   connectivity between ventral anterior insula and pregenual anterior
   cingulate cortex, indicating that salience node connectivity predicted
   memory for material encoded under negative, but not neutral induction.
   These findings suggest that the network state of the perceiver, measured
   prior to affective experience, meaningfully influences the extent to
   which affect modulates memory. Implications of these findings for
   individuals with affective disorder, who show alterations in both
   connectivity and memory, are considered.}},

Abstract = {{There is substantial evidence for behavioral sex differences in risk
   trajectories for alcohol and substance use, with internalizing factors
   such as negative affectivity contributing more to female risk. Because
   the neural development of emotion circuitry varies between males and
   females across adolescence, it represents a potential mechanism by which
   underlying neurobiology contributes to risk for substance use.
   Longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted in
   males and females (n = 18 each) with a family history of alcohol use
   disorders starting at ages 8-13 years. Participants performed an
   affective word task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at 1-
   to 2-year intervals, covering the age range of 8.5-17.6 years (3-4 scans
   per participant). Significant age-related sex differences were found in
   the right amygdala and right precentral gyrus for the negative vs
   neutral word condition. Males showed a significant decrease in both
   amygdala and precentral gyrus activation with age, whereas the response
   in females persisted. The subjective experience of internalizing
   symptomatology significantly increased with age for females but not for
   males. Taken together, these results reveal sex differences in negative
   affect processing in at-risk adolescents, and offer longitudinal neural
   evidence for female substance use risk through internalizing pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Psychometric research has identified stable traits that predict
   inter-individual differences in appetitive motivation and approach
   behavior. Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System
   (BIS/BAS) scales have been developed to quantitatively assess these
   traits. However, neural mechanisms corresponding to the proposed
   constructs reflected in BIS/BAS are still poorly defined. The ventral
   striatum (VS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are implicated in
   subserving reward-related functions that are also associated with the
   BAS. In this study, we examined whether functional connectivity between
   these regions predicts components of these scales. We employed
   resting-state functional connectivity and BIS/BAS scores assessed by a
   personality questionnaire. Participants completed a resting state run
   and the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Systems (BIS/BAS)
   Questionnaire. Using resting-state BOLD, we assessed correlations
   between two basal ganglia ROIs (caudate and putamen) and bilateral OFC
   ROIs, establishing single subject connectivity summary scores. Summary
   scores were correlated with components of BIS/BAS scores. Results
   demonstrate a novel correlation between BAS-fun seeking and
   resting-state connectivity between middle OFC and putamen, implying that
   spontaneous synchrony between reward-processing regions may play a role
   in defining personality characteristics related to impulsivity.}},

Abstract = {{Here we tested the hypothesis that entrepreneurs' emotional experience
   and brain responses toward their own firm resemble those of parents
   toward their own children. Using fMRI, we measured the brain activity
   while male entrepreneurs viewed pictures of their own and of a familiar
   firm, and while fathers viewed pictures of their own and of a familiar
   child. The entrepreneurs who self-rated as being very closely attached
   with their venture showed a similar suppression of activity in the
   posterior cingulate cortex, temporoparietal junction, and dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex as fathers during viewing pictures of their own
   children versus familiar children. In addition, individual differences
   in the confidence trait influenced the neural encoding of both paternal
   and entrepreneurial processing. For underconfident fathers, a picture of
   one's own child was associated with stronger activation and for
   overconfident fathers with weaker activation in the amygdala and in
   caudate nucleus, a brain structure associated with processing of
   rewards. Similar association with activation, yet more widespread in the
   emotional processing network, was observed in entrepreneurs suggesting a
   similar neural basis for increased sensitivity to threats and potential
   risks concerning one's venture and child. In conclusion, both
   entrepreneurial and parental love seem to be supported by brain
   structures associated with reward and emotional processing as well as
   social understanding. (C) 2017 The Authors Human Brain Mapping Published

Abstract = {{Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is associated with poor
   self-control, underpinned by inferior fronto-striatal deficits.
   Real-time functional magnetic resonance neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) allows
   participants to gain self-control over dysregulated brain regions.
   Despite evidence for beneficial effects of electrophysiological-NF on
   ADHD symptoms, no study has applied the spatially superior rtfMRI-NF
   neurotherapy to ADHD. A randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy
   of rtfMRI-NF of right inferior prefrontal cortex (rIFG), a key region
   that is compromised in ADHD and upregulated with psychostimulants, on
   improvement of ADHD symptoms, cognition, and inhibitory fMRI activation.
   To control for region-specificity, an active control group received
   rtfMRI-NF of the left parahippocampal gyrus (lPHG). Thirty-one ADHD boys
   were randomly allocated and had to learn to upregulate their target
   brain region in an average of 11 rtfMRI-NF runs over 2 weeks. Feedback
   was provided through a video-clip of a rocket that had to be moved up
   into space. A transfer session without feedback tested learning
   retention as a proximal measure of transfer to everyday life. Both NF
   groups showed significant linear activation increases with increasing
   number of runs in their respective target regions and significant
   reduction in ADHD symptoms after neurotherapy and at 11-month follow-up.
   Only the group targeting rIFG, however, showed a transfer effect, which
   correlated with ADHD symptom reductions, improved at trend level in
   sustained attention, and showed increased IFG activation during an
   inhibitory fMRI task. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates for the
   first time feasibility, safety, and shorter-and longer-term efficacy of
   rtfMRI-NF of rIFG in adolescents with ADHD. (C) 2017 The Authors Human

Abstract = {{Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficuly in
   recognizing bodies and faces, which are more pronounced in children than
   adults. If such difficulties originate from dysfunction of the
   extrastriate body area (EBA) and the fusiform face area (FFA),
   activation in these regions might be more atypical in children than in
   adults. We preformed functional magnetic resonance imaging while
   children and adults with ASD and age-matched typically developed (TD)
   individuals observed face, body, car, and scene. To examine various
   aspects, we performed individual region of interest (ROI) analysis, as
   well as conventional random effect group analysis. At individual ROI
   analysis, we examined the ratio of participants showing a
   category-sensitive response, the size of regions, location and
   activation patterns among the four object categories. Adults with ASD
   showed no atypicalities in activation of the EBA and FFA, whereas
   children with ASD showed atypical activation in these regions.
   Specifically, a smaller percentage of children with ASD showed
   face-sensitive activation of the FFA than TD children. Moreover, the
   size of the EBA was smaller in children with ASD than in TD children.
   Our results revealed atypicalities in both the FFA and EBA in children
   with ASD but not in adults with ASD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and

Abstract = {{When making judgments in a group, individuals often revise their initial
   beliefs about the best judgment to make given what others believe.
   Despite the ubiquity of this phenomenon, we know little about how the
   brain updates beliefs when integrating personal judgments (individual
   information) with those of others (social information). Here, we
   investigated the neurocomputational mechanisms of how we adapt our
   judgments to those made by groups of different sizes, in the context of
   jury decisions for a criminal. By testing different theoretical models,
   we showed that a social Bayesian inference model captured changes in
   judgments better than 2 other models. Our results showed that
   participants updated their beliefs by appropriately weighting individual
   and social sources of information according to their respective
   credibility. When investigating 2 fundamental computations of Bayesian
   inference, belief updates and credibility estimates of social
   information, we found that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
   computed the level of belief updates, while the bilateral frontopolar
   cortex (FPC) was more engaged in individuals who assigned a greater
   credibility to the judgments of a larger group. Moreover, increased
   functional connectivity between these 2 brain regions reflected a
   greater influence of group size on the relative credibility of social
   information. These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the
   computational roles of the FPC-dACC network in steering judgment
   adaptation to a group's opinion. Taken together, these findings provide
   a computational account of how the human brain integrates individual and
   social information for decision-making in groups.}},

Title = {{Relationship between the change of language symptoms and the change of

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the
   change of language symptoms and the change of regional cerebral blood
   flow (rCBF) in the recovery process of two children with acquired
   aphasia caused by infarctions from Moyamoya disease with an onset age of
   8 years.
   Methods: We compared the results for the Standard Language Test of
   Aphasia (SLTA) with rCBF changes in 7 language regions.in the left
   hemisphere and their homologous regions in the right hemisphere at 4
   time points from 3 weeks for up to 5 years after the onset of aphasia,
   while controlling for the effect of age.
   Results: In both cases, strong correlations were seen within a
   hemisphere between adjacent regions or regions that are connected by
   neuronal fibers, and between some language regions in the left
   hemisphere and their homologous regions in the right hemisphere.
   Conversely, there were differences between the two cases in the time
   course of rCBF changes during their recovery process.
   Conclusion: Consistent with previous studies, the current study
   suggested that both hemispheres were involved in the long-term recovery
   of language symptoms in children with acquired aphasia. We suggest that
   the differences between both cases during their recovery process might
   be influenced by the brain states before aphasia, by which hemisphere
   was affected, and by the timing of the surgical revascularization
   procedure. However, the changes were observed in the data obtained for
   rCBF with strong correlations with the changes in language performance,
   so it is possible that rCBF could be used as a biomarker for language
   symptom changes. (C) 2017 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive social behavior appears to require flexible interaction between
   multiple large-scale brain networks, including the executive control
   network (ECN), the default mode network (DMN), and the salience network
   (SN), as well as interactions with the perceptual processing systems
   these networks function to modulate. Highly connected cortical ``hub{''}
   regions are also thought to facilitate interactions between these
   networks, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC),
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
   and anterior insula (AI). However, less is presently known about the
   relationship between these network functions and individual differences
   in social-cognitive abilities. In the present study, 23 healthy adults
   (12 female) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while
   performing a visually based social judgment task (requiring the
   evaluation of social dominance in faces). Participants also completed
   both self-report and performance-based measures of emotional
   intelligence (EI), as well as measures of personality and facial
   perception ability. During scanning, social judgment, relative to a
   control condition involving simple perceptual judgment of facial
   features in the same stimuli, activated hub regions associated with each
   of the networks mentioned above (observed clusters included: bilateral
   DLPFC, DMPFC/ACC, AI, and ventral visual cortex). Interestingly,
   self-reported and performance-based measures of social-cognitive ability
   showed opposing associations with these patterns of activation.
   Specifically, lower self-reported EI and lower openness in personality
   both independently predicted greater activation within hub regions of
   the SN, DMN, and ECN (i.e., the DLPFC, DMPFC/ACC, and AI clusters); in
   contrast, in the same analyses greater scores on performance-based EI
   measures and on facial perception tasks independently predicted greater
   activation within hub regions of the SN and ECN (the DLPFC and AI
   clusters), and also in the ventral visual cortex. These findings suggest
   that lower confidence in one's own social-cognitive abilities may
   promote the allocation of greater cognitive resources to, and improve
   the performance of, social-cognitive functions.}},

Abstract = {{In the present simultaneous EEG/ECG-fMRI study we compared the temporal
   and spatial characteristics of the brain responses and the cardiac
   activity during fear picture processing between spider,
   blood-injection-injury (BII) and social fearful as well as healthy
   (non-fearful) volunteers. All participants were presented with two
   neutral and six fear-related blocks of pictures: two social, two spider
   and two blood/injection fear blocks. In a social fear block neutral
   images were occasionally interspersed with photographs of angry faces
   and social exposure scenes. In spider and blood/injection fear blocks
   neutral pictures were interspersed with spider fear-relevant and
   blood/injection pictures, respectively. When compared to healthy
   controls the social fear group responded with increased activations in
   the anterior orbital, middle/anterior cingulate and middle/superior
   temporal areas for pictures depicting angry faces and with a few
   elevated superior frontal activations for social exposure scenes. In the
   blood/injection fear group, heart rate was decreased and the activity in
   the middle/inferior frontal and visual processing regions was increased
   for blood/injection pictures. The HR decrease for blood/injection
   pictures correlated with increased frontal responses. In the spider fear
   group, spider fear-relevant pictures triggered increased activations
   within a broad subcortical and cortical neural fear network. The HR
   response for spider fear-relevant stimuli was increased and correlated
   with an increased insula and hippocampus activity. When compared to
   healthy controls, all fear groups showed higher LPP amplitudes for their
   feared cues and an overall greater P1 hypervigilance effect. Contrasts
   against the fear control groups showed that the increased responses for
   fear-specific stimuli are mostly related to specific fears and not to
   general anxiety proneness. The results suggest different engagement of
   cognitive evaluation and down-regulation strategies and an overall
   increased sensitization of the fear system in the three fear groups.}},

Abstract = {{Social stress has a major detrimental impact on subjective well-being.
   Previous research mainly focused on two methods to induce and measure
   social stress: social exclusion and performance evaluation. For social
   exclusion researchers frequently focused on the Cyberball task, which in
   contrast to many psychosocial stress paradigms does not include a
   performance component. The aim of the current study was to establish an
   optimized psychosocial stress paradigm by combining both, social
   exclusion as well as performance evaluation within a single fMRI
   paradigm. We implemented a modification of the Cyberball task including
   a performance game (with exclusion and inclusion periods) in addition to
   the already established exclusion and inclusion periods. This indeed
   resulted in increased subjective stress in the performance game. Hence,
   the modified Cyberball version seems to be superior in mapping relevant
   neural social stress correlates more pronounced and reliably. Exclusion
   within the performance-related context contrasted to the unmodified
   exclusion was associated with higher activation in the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex and the anterior insula. Moreover, the modified
   exclusion reflected greater social processing in the precuneus, several
   temporo-parietal and medial prefrontal areas, as suggested by the
   additional task aspects of social evaluation and social perspective
   taking. The findings emphasize that public negative evaluation is
   effective in substantially enlarging and potentiating the distressing
   effect of exclusion on a subjective as well as on a neural level. This
   may have a great potential for further experimental research on social
   stress.}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests that culture influences how people perceive the world,
   which extends to memory specificity, or how much perceptual detail is
   remembered. The present study investigated cross-cultural differences
   (Americans us East Asians) at the time of encoding in the neural
   correlates of specific Versus general memory formation. Participants
   encoded photos of everyday items in the scanner and 48 h later completed
   a surprise recognition test. The recognition test consisted of same
   (i.e., previously seen in scanner), similar (i.e., same name, different
   features), or new photos (i.e., items not previously seen in scanner).
   For Americans compared to East Asians, we predicted greater activation
   in the hippo campus and right fusiform for specific memory at
   recognition, as these regions were implicated previously in encoding
   perceptual details. Results revealed that East Asians activated the left
   fusiform and left hippocampus more than Americans for specific versus
   general memory. Follow-up analyses ruled out alternative explanations of
   retrieval difficulty and familiarity for this pattern of cross-cultural
   differences at encoding. Results overall suggest that culture should be
   considered as another individual difference that affects memory
   specificity and modulates neural regions underlying these processes. (C)

Abstract = {{Given the recent surge in functional neuroimaging studies on social
   exclusion, the current study employed activation likelihood estimation
   (ALE) based meta-analyses to identify brain regions that have
   consistently been implicated across different experimental paradigms
   used to investigate exclusion. We also examined the neural correlates
   underlying Cyberball, the most commonly used paradigm to study
   exclusion, as well as differences in exclusion-related activation
   between developing (7-18 years of age, from pre-adolescence up to late
   adolescence) and emerging adult (broadly defined as undergraduates,
   including late adolescence and young adulthood) samples. Results
   revealed involvement of the bilateral medial prefrontal and posterior
   cingulate cortices, right precuneus and left ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex across the different paradigms used to examine social exclusion;
   similar activation patterns were identified when restricting the
   analysis to Cyberball studies. Investigations into age-related effects
   revealed that ventrolateral prefrontal activations identified in the
   full sample were driven by (i.e. present in) developmental samples,
   while medial prefrontal activations were driven by emerging adult
   samples. In addition, the right ventral striatum was implicated in
   exclusion, but only in developmental samples. Subtraction analysis
   revealed significantly greater activation likelihood in striatal and
   ventrolateral prefrontal clusters in the developmental samples as
   compared to emerging adults, though the opposite contrast failed to
   identify any significant regions. Findings integrate the knowledge
   accrued from functional neuroimaging studies on social exclusion to
   date, highlighting involvement of lateral prefrontal regions implicated
   in regulation and midline structures involved in social cognitive and
   self-evaluative processes across experimental paradigms and ages, as
   well as limbic structures in developing samples specifically.}},

Abstract = {{Current drug treatments for schizophrenia (SCZ) can alleviate positive
   symptoms, but have little effect on the negative symptoms and cognitive
   deficits that are difficult to translate into preclinical models for
   drug development. Therefore, we aimed to determine the dose-response
   effects of acute phencyclidine (PCP, 1.0-5.0 mg/kg) on rat brain
   connectivity and detect markers for different SCZ-like symptoms.
   Pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) and
   microdialysis were used to investigate PCP-induced effects on functional
   connectivity (FC) and dopamine levels, respectively. Next, we evaluated
   the association between PCP-induced changes in imaging parameters and
   behavior. PCP at doses of 3.0-5.0 mg/kg induced fMRI signal changes in
   several brain regions associated with SCZ. Additionally, the FC was
   globally disturbed, dopamine levels increased, and locomotor activity
   increased, reflecting the manifestation of SCZ-like positive symptoms. A
   distinct pattern in the measures was observed at lower PCP doses
   (1.0-2.0 mg/kg); PCP induced fMRI signal changes in the fronto-cortical
   regions, and increased dopamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex.
   In addition to the dysconnectivity of these regions, the hippocampal FC
   was disrupted. These observations are consistent with the induction of
   SCZ-like cognitive deficits and negative symptoms, which were observed
   as impaired novel object recognition and decreased social interaction.
   No indicators for positive symptoms were observed at lower PCP doses. We
   conclude that acute PCP induces SCZ-like symptom classes in a
   dose-dependent manner; PCP doses of 1.0-2.0 mg/kg are more suitable for
   modeling SCZ-like negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, while
   SCZ-like positive symptoms dominate at doses of 3.0-5.0 mg/kg. (C) 2017

Journal = {{SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{52-58}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rs-fMRI) has repeatedly shown evidence of altered functional
   connectivity of large-scale networks in schizophrenia. The relationship
   between these connectivity changes and behaviour (e.g. symptoms,
   neuropsychological performance) remains unclear.
   Methods: Functional connectivity in 27 patients with schizophrenia or
   schizoaffective disorder, and 25 age and gender matched healthy controls
   was examined using rs-fMRI. Based on seed regions from previous studies,
   we examined functional connectivity of the default, cognitive control,
   affective and attention networks. Effects of symptom severity and theory
   of mind performance on functional connectivity were also examined.
   Results: Patients showed increased connectivity between key nodes of the
   default network including the precuneus and medial prefrontal cortex
   compared to controls (p < 0.01, FWE-corrected). Increasing positive
   symptoms and increasing theory of mind performance were both associated
   with altered connectivity of default regions within the patient group (p
   < 0.01, FWE-corrected).
   Discussion: This study confirms previous findings of default
   hyper-connectivity in schizophrenia spectrum patients and reveals an
   association between altered default connectivity and positive symptom
   severity. As a novel find, this study also shows that default
   connectivity is correlated to and predictive of theory of mind
   performance. Extending these findings by examining the effects of
   emerging social cognition treatments on both default connectivity and
   theory of mind performance is now an important goal for research. (C)

Abstract = {{Childhood trauma strongly impacts emotional responses in schizophrenia.
   We have explored an association between early trauma and the amygdala
   functional connectivity using generalized psychophysiological
   interaction during an emotional task. Twenty-one schizophrenia patients
   and twenty-five controls were included. In schizophrenia patients,
   higher levels of sexual abuse and physical neglect during childhood were
   associated with decreased connectivity between the amygdala and the
   posterior cingulate/precuneus region. Additionally, patients showed
   decreased coupling between the amygdala and the posterior
   cingulate/precuneus region compared to controls.
   These findings suggest that early trauma could impact later connectivity
   in specific stress-related circuits affecting self-consciousness and
   social cognition in schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{26-34}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Self-evaluation affects one's own mental state, social interactions and
   everyday life. Mood, in turn, has an impact on self-evaluation. However,
   the influence of mood on self-evaluation at the neural level has barely
   been examined. In this fMRI study, the interaction of mood and
   self-perception was investigated in 20 healthy participants. Happy, sad
   and neutral music was presented while participants were instructed to
   immerse themselves in the mood of the music and to rate how well
   presented traits characterized themselves. In a lexical control
   condition, subjects had to count a specific letter in the word.
   Behavioral data reflected successful mood induction. While
   self-ascription of positive traits was unaffected by Mood,
   self-ascription of negative characteristics was decreased by negative
   affect. A positive correlation was found between self-worth scores and
   the difference in the amount of self-ascribed positive versus negative
   traits during negative mood induction. At the neural level,
   amygdalo-hippocampal, superior and middle temporal structures were
   differently involved in self-evaluation (vs. lexical processing)
   depending on the mood. While activation of the amygdalo-hippocampal
   complex was found during sad in comparison to both happy and neutral
   mood, superior/middle temporal gyrus (STG/MTG) activation was only found
   when contrasting sad vs. neutral mood. Further, a correlation analysis
   with self-worth ratings revealed a positive relation to STG activation
   during self-ascription of trait adjectives in sad compared to neutral
   mood. Our results underscore the importance of the current emotional
   state for self-evaluation and identify some neural correlates of this
   effect. Our findings in healthy research participants suggest a
   compensatory mechanism during sad mood induction to maintain a positive
   self-image, which is supported by activation of limbic and
   fronto-temporal cortex. Studies in clinically depressed populations
   could reveal whether this compensatory mechanism is aberrant.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{51-63}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies of speech perception have consistently indicated a
   left-hemisphere dominance in the temporal lobes' responses to
   intelligible auditory speech signals (McGettigan and Scott, 2012).
   However, there are important communicative cues that cannot be extracted
   from auditory signals alone, including the direction of the talker's
   gaze. Previous work has implicated the superior temporal cortices in
   processing gaze direction, with evidence for predominantly
   right-lateralized responses (Carlin \& Calder, 2013). The aim of the
   current study was to investigate whether the lateralization of responses
   to talker gaze differs in an auditory communicative context.
   Participants in a functional MRI experiment watched and listened to
   videos of spoken sentences in which the auditory intelligibility and
   talker gaze direction were manipulated factorially. We observed a
   left-dominant temporal lobe sensitivity to the talker's gaze direction,
   in which the left anterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus and temporal
   pole showed an enhanced response to direct gaze - further investigation
   revealed that this pattern of lateralization was modulated by auditory
   intelligibility. Our results suggest flexibility in the distribution of
   neural responses to social cues in the face within the context of a
   challenging speech perception task.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The birth of a preterm infant and Neonatal Intensive Care
   Unit hospitalization constitute a potentially traumatic experience for
   mothers. Although behavioral studies investigated the parenting stress
   in preterm mothers, no study focused on the underlying neural
   mechanisms. We examined the effect of preterm births in mothers, by
   comparing brain activation in mothers of preterm and full-term infants.
   STUDY DESIGN: We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure
   the cerebral response of 10 first-time mothers of preterm infants
   (gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1500) and 11 mothers of
   full-term infants, viewing happy-, neutral-and distress-face images of
   their own infant, along with a matched unknown infant.
   RESULTS: While viewing own infant's face preterm mothers showed
   increased activation in emotional processing area (i.e., inferior
   frontal gyrus) and social cognition (i.e., supramarginal gyrus) and
   affiliative behavior (i.e., insula).
   CONCLUSION: Differential brain activation patterns in mothers appears to
   be a function of the atypical parenthood transition related to
   prematurity.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple lines of research indicate that fathers often treat boys and
   girls differently in ways that impact child outcomes. The complex
   picture that has emerged, however, is obscured by methodological
   challenges inherent to the study of parental caregiving, and no studies
   to date have examined the possibility that gender differences in
   observed real-world paternal behavior are related to differential
   paternal brain responses to male and female children. Here we compare
   fathers of daughters and fathers of sons in terms of naturalistically
   observed everyday caregiving behavior and neural responses to child
   picture stimuli. Compared with fathers of sons, fathers of daughters
   were more attentively engaged with their daughters, sang more to their
   daughters, used more analytical language and language related to sadness
   and the body with their daughters, and had a stronger neural response to
   their daughter's happy facial expressions in areas of the brain
   important for reward and emotion regulation (medial and lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex {[}OFC]). In contrast, fathers of sons engaged in
   more rough and tumble play (RTP), used more achievement language with
   their sons, and had a stronger neural response to their son's neutral
   facial expressions in the medial OFC (mOFC). Whereas the mOFC response
   to happy faces was negatively related to RTP, the mOFC response to
   neutral faces was positively related to RTP, specifically for fathers of
   boys. These results indicate that real-world paternal behavior and brain
   function differ as a function of child gender.}},

Abstract = {{Voluntary help during a time of need fosters interpersonal gratitude,
   which has positive social and personal consequences such as improved
   social relationships, increased reciprocity, and decreased distress. In
   a behavioral and a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   experiment, participants played a multiround interactive game where they
   received pain stimulation. An anonymous partner interacted with the
   participants and either intentionally or unintentionally (i.e.,
   determined by a computer program) bore part of the participants' pain.
   In each round, participants either evaluated their perceived pain
   intensity (behavioral experiment) or transferred an amount of money to
   the partner (fMRI experiment). Intentional (relative to unintentional)
   help led to lower experience of pain, higher reciprocity (money
   allocation), and increased interpersonal closeness toward the partner.
   fMRI revealed that for the most grateful condition (i.e., intentional
   help), value-related structures such as the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC) showed the highest activation in response to the
   partner's decision, whereas the primary sensory area and the anterior
   insula exhibited the lowest activation at the pain delivery stage.
   Moreover, the vmPFC activation was predictive of the individual
   differences in reciprocal behavior, and the posterior cingulate cortex
   (PCC) activation was predictive of self-reported gratitude. Furthermore,
   using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), we showed that the neural
   activation pattern in the septum/hypothalamus, an area associated with
   affiliative affect and social bonding, and value-related structures
   specifically and sensitively dissociated intentional help from
   unintentional help conditions. These findings contribute to our
   understanding of the psychological and neural substrates of the
   experience of interpersonal gratitude and the social consequences of
   this emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Although the mirror neuron system (MNS) has been extensively studied in
   monkeys and adult humans, very little is known about its development.
   Previous studies suggest that the MNS is present by infancy and that the
   brain and MNS-related cognitive abilities (such as language, empathy,
   and imitation learning) continue to develop after childhood. In humans,
   the PFt area of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) seems to particularly
   correlate with the functional properties of the PF area in primates,
   which contains mirror neurons. However, little is known about the
   functional connectivity (FC) of the PFt area with other brain areas and
   whether these networks change over time. Here, we investigated the FC
   development of the PFt area-based network in 59 healthy subjects aged
   7-26 years at resting-state to study brain development from late
   childhood through adolescence to early adulthood. The bilateral PFt
   showed similar core FC networks, which included the frontal lobe, the
   cingulate gyri, the insula, the somatosensory cortex, the precuneus, the
   superior and inferior parietal lobules, the temporal lobe, and the
   cerebellum posterior lobes. Furthermore, the FC between the left PFt and
   the left IPL exhibited a significantly positive correlation with age,
   and the FC between the left PFt and the right postcentral gyrus
   exhibited a significantly negative correlation with age. In addition,
   the FC between the right PFt and the right putamen exhibited a
   significantly negative correlation with age. Our findings suggest that
   the PFt area-based network develops and is reorganized with age. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a
   brain stimulation and modulation electrophysiological technique, it can
   change cortical excitability of target brain region, modulate neuron
   plasticity and brain connections. Previous researches indicated that
   rTMS could reduce cue-induced craving in drug addiction.
   Objective: In this study, we employed real and sham rTMS of the left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to test whether it could reduce
   cue-induced craving for methamphetamine (MA) and influence cognitive
   function in a randomised clinical trial.
   Methods: Thirty MA-addicted patients were randomized to receive 5
   sessions of 8 min sham or 10 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC. Subjects rated
   their craving at baseline, after exposed to MA-associated cues and after
   rTMS sessions.
   Results: Real rTMS over the left DLPFC reduced craving significantly
   after 5 sessions of rTMS as compared to sham stimulation. Furthermore,
   real rTMS improved verbal learning and memory and social cognition in MA
   addicted patients.
   Conclusions: The present study suggests that 10 Hz rTMS of the left
   DLPFC may reduce craving and have no negative effects on cognitive
   function in MA-addicted patients, supporting the safety of rTMS in
   treating MA addiction.}},

Abstract = {{The present study meta-analyzed 45 experiments with 959 subjects and 463
   activation foci reported in 43 published articles that investigated the
   neural mechanism of moral functions by comparing neural activity between
   the moral task conditions and non-moral task conditions with the
   Activation Likelihood Estimation method. The present study examined the
   common activation foci of morality-related task conditions. In addition,
   the study compared the neural correlates of moral sensitivity with the
   neural correlates of moral judgment, which are the two functional
   components in the Neo-Kohlbergian model of moral functioning. The
   results showed that brain regions associated with the default mode
   network were significantly more active during morality-related task
   conditions than during non-morality task conditions. These brain regions
   were also commonly activated in both moral judgment and moral
   sensitivity task conditions. In contrast, the right temporoparietal
   junction and supramarginal gyrus were found to be more active only
   during conditions of moral judgment. These findings suggest that the
   neural correlates of moral sensitivity and moral judgment are perhaps
   commonly associated with brain circuitries of self-related psychological
   processes, but the neural correlates of those two functional components
   are distinguishable from each other.}},

Abstract = {{Effectiveness of memory consolidation is determined by multiple factors,
   including sleep after learning, emotional valence, arousal and novelty.
   Few studies investigated how the effect of sleep compares with (and
   interacts with) these other factors, of which virtually none are in
   children. The present study did so by repeated assessment of declarative
   memory in 386 children (45\% boys) aged 9-11years through an online
   word-pair task. Children were randomly assigned to either a morning or
   evening learning session of 30 unrelated word-pairs with positive,
   neutral or negative valenced cues and neutral targets. After immediately
   assessing baseline recognition, delayed recognition was recorded either
   12 or 24h later, resulting in four different assessment schedules. One
   week later, the procedure was repeated with exactly the same word-pairs
   to evaluate whether effects differed for relearning versus original
   novel learning. Mixed-effect logistic regression models were used to
   evaluate how the probability of correct recognition was affected by
   sleep, valence, arousal, novelty and their interactions. Both immediate
   and delayed recognition were worse for pairs with negatively valenced or
   less arousing cue words. Relearning improved immediate and delayed
   word-pair recognition. In contrast to these effects, sleep did not
   affect recognition, nor did sleep moderate the effects of arousal,
   valence and novelty. The findings suggest a robust inclination of
   children to specifically forget the pairing of words to negatively
   valenced cue words. In agreement with a recent meta-analysis, children
   seem to depend less on sleep for the consolidation of information than
   has been reported for adults, irrespective of the emotional valence,
   arousal and novelty of word-pairs.}},

Abstract = {{Some intrinsic connectivity networks including the default mode network
   (DMN) and executive control network (ECN) may underlie social anxiety
   disorder (SAD). Although the cerebellum has been implicated in the
   pathophysiology of SAD and several networks relevant to higher-order
   cognition, it remains unknown whether cerebellar areas involved in DMN
   and ECN exhibit altered resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)
   with cortical networks in SAD. Forty-six patients with SAD and 64
   healthy controls (HC) were included and submitted to the baseline
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Seventeen
   SAD patients who completed post-treatment clinical assessments were
   included after group cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). RsFC of three
   cerebellar subregions in both groups was assessed respectively in a
   voxel-wise way, and these rsFC maps were compared by two-sample t tests
   between groups. Whole-brain voxel-wise regression was performed to
   examine whether cerebellar connectivity networks can predict response to
   CBT. Lower rsFC circuits of cerebellar subregions compared with HC at
   baseline (p < 0.05, corrected by false discovery rate) were revealed.
   The left Crus I rsFC with dorsal medial prefrontal cortex was negatively
   correlated with symptom severity. The clinical assessments in SAD
   patients were significantly decreased after CBT. Higher pretreatment
   cerebellar rsFC with angular gyrus and dorsal lateral frontal cortex
   corresponded with greater symptom improvement following CBT. Cerebellar
   rsFC circuits involving DMN and ECN are possible neuropathologic
   mechanisms of SAD. Stronger pretreatment cerebellar rsFC circuits
   involving ECN suggest potential neural markers to predict CBT response.}},

Abstract = {{Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by remarkable
   heterogeneity in social, communication, and behavioral deficits,
   creating a major barrier in identifying effective treatments for a given
   individual with ASD. To facilitate precision medicine in ASD, we
   utilized a well-validated biological motion neuroimaging task to
   identify pretreatment biomarkers that can accurately forecast the
   response to an evidence-based behavioral treatment, Virtual
   Reality-Social Cognition Training (VR-SCT). In a preliminary sample of
   17 young adults with high-functioning ASD, we identified neural
   predictors of change in emotion recognition after VR-SCT. The predictors
   were characterized by the pretreatment brain activations to biological
   vs. scrambled motion in the neural circuits that support (a) language
   comprehension and interpretation of incongruent auditory emotions and
   prosody, and (b) processing socio-emotional experience and interpersonal
   affective information, as well as emotional regulation. The predictive
   value of the findings for individual adults with ASD was supported by
   regression-based multivariate pattern analyses with cross validation. To
   our knowledge, this is the first pilot study that shows
   neuroimaging-based predictive biomarkers for treatment effectiveness in
   adults with ASD. The findings have potentially far-reaching implications
   for developing more precise and effective treatments for ASD. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Receiving negative social feedback can be detrimental to emotional,
   cognitive, and physical well-being, and fear of negative social feedback
   is a prominent feature of mental illnesses that involve social anxiety.
   A large body of evidence has implicated the neuropeptides oxytocin and
   vasopressin in the modulation of human neural activity underlying social
   cognition, including negative emotion processing; however, the influence
   of oxytocin and vasopressin on neural activity elicited during negative
   social evaluation remains unknown. Here 21 healthy men underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging in a double-blind,
   placebo-controlled, crossover design to determine how intranasally
   administered oxytocin and vasopressin modulated neural activity when
   receiving negative feedback on task performance from a study
   investigator. We found that under placebo, a preferential response to
   negative social feedback compared with positive social feedback was
   evoked in brain regions putatively involved in theory of mind
   (temporoparietal junction), pain processing (anterior insula and
   supplementary motor area), and identification of emotionally important
   visual cues in social perception (right fusiform). These activations
   weakened with oxytocin and vasopressin administration such that neural
   responses to receiving negative social feedback were not significantly
   greater than positive social feedback. Our results show effects of both
   oxytocin and vasopressin on the brain network involved in negative
   social feedback, informing the possible use of a pharmacological
   approach targeting these regions in multiple disorders with impairments
   in social information processing.}},

Abstract = {{The neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) have been
   identified as modulators of emotional social behaviors and associated
   with neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by social dysfunction.
   Experimental and therapeutic use of OXT and AVP via the intranasal route
   is the subject of extensive clinical research. However, the large-scale
   functional substrates directly engaged by these peptides and their
   functional dynamics remain elusive. By using cerebral blood volume (CBV)
   weighted fMRI in the mouse, we show that intranasal administration of
   OXT rapidly elicits the transient activation of cortical regions and a
   sustained activation of hippocampal and forebrain areas characterized by
   high oxytocin receptor density. By contrast, intranasal administration
   of AVP produced a robust and sustained deactivation in cortico-parietal,
   thalamic and mesolimbic regions. Importantly, intravenous administration
   of OXT and AVP did not recapitulate the patterns of modulation produced
   by intranasal dosing, supporting a central origin of the observed
   functional changes. In keeping with this notion, hippocampal local field
   potential recordings revealed multi-band power increases upon intranasal
   OXT administration. We also show that the selective OXTderivative TGOT
   reproduced the pattern of activation elicited by OXT and that the
   deletion of OXT receptors does not affect AVP-mediated deactivation.
   Collectively, our data document divergent modulation of brainwide neural
   systems by intranasal administration of OXT and AVP, an effect that
   involves key substrates of social and emotional behavior. The observed
   divergence calls for a deeper investigation of the systems-level
   mechanisms by which exogenous OXT and AVP modulate brain function and
   exert their putative therapeutic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Affective coldness is one of the main features of Machiavellianism.
   Recent studies have revealed that Machiavellians are emotionally
   detached and that this ``affective blunting{''} is associated with
   intense feelings, emotional instability, negative emotions, and
   difficulty in enduring distress. We used brain-imaging techniques to
   investigate emotion regulation in Machiavellianism at a
   neuropsychological level. We used situations in which participants were
   required to demonstrate emotional flexibility to explore the controversy
   surrounding the fact that Machiavellianism is associated with both
   cold-mindedness and emotional instability. Participants performed a
   reappraisal task in which emotionally evocative pictures (from the
   International Affective Picture System) were presented in different
   contexts (negative, positive, and neutral). They were asked to interpret
   a scenario according to its title and to reinterpret it according to
   another context created by a new title (e.g., negatively labeled
   pictures shifted to positively labeled ones). During task performance,
   Machiavellians showed increased activation of brain regions associated
   with emotion generation-for example, the amygdala and insula. This
   indicates that Machiavellian individuals are able to be involved
   emotionally in social situations. Increased activation in the temporal
   and parahippocampal regions during reappraisal suggests that
   Machiavellians use semantic-perceptual processes to construct
   alternative interpretations of the same situation and have enhanced
   memory for emotional stimuli. Furthermore, they seem to possess an
   intense awareness that leads them to shift attention from external to
   internal information to detect environmental changes. These cognitive
   processes may enable them to adjust their behavior quickly. This study
   supports the flexibility hypothesis of Machiavellianism and suggests
   that Machiavellians' approach to emotion regulation is linked to their
   rational mode of thinking.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{One of teenagers' key developmental tasks is to engage in new and
   meaningful relationships with peers and adults outside the family
   context. Attachment-derived expectations about the self and others in
   terms of internal attachment working models have the potential to shape
   such social reorientation processes critically and thereby influence
   adolescents' social-emotional development and social integration.
   Because the neural underpinnings of this developmental task remain
   largely unknown, we sought to investigate them by functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. We asked n = 44 adolescents (ages 12.01-18.84 years)
   to evaluate positive and negative adjectives regarding either themselves
   or a close other during an adapted version of the well-established
   self-other trait-evaluation task. As measures of attachment, we obtained
   scores reflecting participants' positive versus negative
   attachment-derived self- and other-models by means of the Relationship
   Questionnaire. We controlled for possible confounding factors by also
   obtaining scores reflecting internalizing/externalizing problems,
   schizotypy, and borderline symptomatology. Our results revealed that
   participants with a more negative attachment-derived self-model showed
   increased brain activity during positive and negative adjective
   evaluation regarding the self, but decreased brain activity during
   negative adjective evaluation regarding a close other, in bilateral
   amygdala/parahippocampus, bilateral anterior temporal pole/anterior
   superior temporal gyrus, and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These
   findings suggest that a low positivity of the self-concept
   characteristic for the attachment anxiety dimension may influence neural
   information processing, but in opposite directions when it comes to
   self- versus (close) other-representations. We discuss our results in
   the framework of attachment theory and regarding their implications
   especially for adolescent social-emotional development and social
   integration.}},

Abstract = {{Former studies suggest that the core features of psychopathy, namely the
   callous-unemotional (CU) traits are associated with emotional
   dysfunction characterized by atypical processing of other people's
   distress. Using a dimensional approach to CU traits, the current study
   aims to test neural activity during performance of a facial expression
   recognition task in a community sample of young adults. Forty-one
   participants (25 females, M age = 25.44, SD = 4.03) completed the
   Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging data were collected to measure neural responses to fearful,
   happy and sad faces as compared with neutral facial expressions.
   Region-of-interest analyses revealed that during exposure to fearful
   face expressions, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses were
   negatively associated with CU traits in the right anterior cingulate
   gyms (ACCg), but not in the amygdala. These findings support that CU
   traits are related to a unique neural response to fearful faces in
   noncriminal population as well. It also highlights the importance of
   taking into account other regions outside the amygdala, in particular
   the ACC, when testing the relation between CU traits and fear response.

   Acquisition Study in Adolescent Couples}},

Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a sensitive period for the development of romantic
   relationships. During this period the maturation of frontolimbic
   networks is particularly important for the capacity to regulate
   emotional experiences. In previous research, both functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) and dense array electroencephalography (dEEG)
   measures have suggested that responses in limbic regions are enhanced in
   adolescents experiencing social rejection. In the present research, we
   examined social acceptance and rejection from romantic partners as they
   engaged in a Chatroom Interact Task. Dual 128-channel dEEG systems were
   used to record neural responses to acceptance and rejection from both
   adolescent romantic partners and unfamiliar peers (N = 75). We employed
   a two-step temporal principal component analysis (PCA) and spatial
   independent component analysis (ICA) approach to statistically identify
   the neural components related to social feedback. Results revealed that
   the early (288 ms) discrimination between acceptance and rejection
   reflected by the P3a component was significant for the romantic partner
   but not the unfamiliar peer. In contrast, the later (364 ms) P3b
   component discriminated between acceptance and rejection for both
   partners and peers. The two-step approach (PCA then ICA) was better able
   than either PCA or ICA alone in separating these components of the
   brain's electrical activity that reflected both temporal and spatial
   phases of the brain's processing of social feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Self-concept is used to explain emotional disturbance or other
   behavioural and psychological problems associated with depression.
   Self-referential processing generally reflects self-concept in different
   domains. Cortical midline structures, such as the medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC), are critical for self-referential processing both in
   healthy controls and depressive patients. However, the role of
   subregions of the MPFC in self-referential processing in depression
   remains uncertain. In this study, we aimed to explore the neural basis
   of self-referential processing in depressive patients and the
   activation-deactivation patterns of subregions of the MPFC. Nineteen
   depressive patients and 21 controls completed the classic
   self-referential task with two different judgement conditions:
   self-referential processing and semantic processing. In the
   self-referential condition, with analysis of the two sample t-test
   unipolar patients showed significantly higher activation of the central
   MPFC and significantly lower activation of the dorsal MPFC, relative to
   controls. The results substantially suggested that the different
   activation of the MPFC may be selectively involved in self-referential
   processing in depressive patients, potentially indicating abnormal
   engagement of cognitive control and emotion regulation in this group.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Economic status played an important role in the modulation of economic
   decision making. The present fMRI study aimed at investigating how
   economic status modulated behavioral and neural responses to unfairness
   in a modified Ultimatum Game (UG). During scanning, participants played
   as responders in the UG, and they were informed of the economic status
   of proposers before receiving offers. At the behavioral level, higher
   rejection rates and lower fairness ratings were revealed when proposers
   were in high economic status than in low economic status. Besides, the
   most time-consuming decisions tended to occur at lower unfairness level
   when the proposers were in high (relative to low) economic status. At
   the neural level, stronger activation of left thalamus was revealed when
   fair offers were proposed by proposers in high rather than in low
   economic status. Greater activation of right medial prefrontal cortex
   was revealed during acceptance to unfair offers in high economic status
   condition rather than in low economic status condition. Taken together,
   these findings shed light on the significance of proposers' economic
   status in responders' social decision making in UG.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Mentalizing is a fundamental aspect of social cognition that includes
   understanding the mental states of others. This process involves the
   participation of a well-defined set of brain regions. However, it is
   still unknown how different contextual situations, such as previous
   cooperative or non-cooperative interactions, can modulate the brain
   activity related to the inference of others' mental states. Hence, this
   study investigated whether a previous social interaction can modulate
   the neural mechanisms involved in a way to response to inferred mental
   states of cooperators and non-cooperators in positive vs. negative
   emotional situations. Participants first engaged in a Dictator game with
   cooperator and non-cooperator confederates. Then, in an fMRI setup,
   participants had to infer the mental states of the cooperator and
   non-cooperator confederates under positive and negative situations.
   Results showed that in addition to the mentalizing network, inferring
   mental states recruited occipital and cerebellar areas in the
   cooperative context. A differential pattern of activity that depended on
   the emotional valence of the situation was also detected, i.e., negative
   situations recruited prefrontal cortex (PFC) in both contexts, while
   temporal regions were recruited only for the non-cooperative context.
   Overall, these results suggest that our previous experiences with others
   modulate the brain activity related to the inferences we make about
   their mental states in specific emotional situations.}},

Title = {{Oxytocin Increases the Perceived Value of Both Self- and Other-Owned
   Items and Alters Medial Prefrontal Cortex Activity in an Endowment Task}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) can influence self-processing and may
   help motivate us to value the attributes of others in a more self-like
   manner by reducing medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) responses. We do not
   know however whether this OXT effect extends to possessions. We tend to
   place a higher monetary value on specific objects that belong to us
   compared to others, known as the ``endowment effect{''}. In two
   double-blind, between-subject placebo (PLC) controlled experiments in
   subjects from a collectivist culture, we investigated the influence of
   intranasal OXT on the endowment effect, with the second study
   incorporating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the task,
   subjects decided whether to buy or sell their own or others'
   (mother/father/classmate/stranger) possessions at various prices. Both
   experiments demonstrated an endowment effect in the self-owned condition
   which extended to close others (mother/father) and OXT increased this
   for self and all other-owned items. This OXT effect was associated with
   reduced activity in the ventral mPFC (vmPFC) in the self-owned condition
   but increased in the mother-condition. For the classmateand
   stranger-owned conditions OXT increased activity in the dorsal mPFC
   (dmPFC). Changes in vmPFC activation were associated with the size of
   the endowment effect for self-and mother-owned items. Functional
   connectivity between the dmPFC and ventral striatum (VStr) was reduced
   by OXT in self-and mother-owned conditions and between vmPFC and
   precuneus in the self-condition. Overall our results show that OXT
   enhances the endowment effect for both self-and other-owned items in
   Chinese subjects. This effect is associated with reduced mPFC activation
   in the self-condition but enhanced activation in all other-conditions
   and involves differential actions on both dorsal and ventral regions as
   well as functional connectivity with brain reward and other
   self-processing regions. Overall our findings suggest that OXT increases
   the perceived value of both self-and other-owned items by acting on
   neural circuitry involved in self-processing and reward.}},

Title = {{Reliability in adolescent fMRI within two years - a comparison of three
   tasks}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Longitudinal developmental fMRI studies just recently began to focus on
   within-subject reliability using the intraclass coefficient (ICC). It
   remains largely unclear which degree of reliability can be achieved in
   developmental studies and whether this depends on the type of task used.
   Therefore, we aimed to systematically investigate the reliability of
   three well-classified tasks: an emotional attention, a cognitive
   control, and an intertemporal choice paradigm. We hypothesized to find
   higher reliability in the cognitive task than in the emotional or
   reward-related task. 104 healthy mid-adolescents were scanned at age 14
   and again at age 16 within M=1.8 years using the same paradigms,
   scanner, and scanning protocols. Overall, we found both variability and
   stability (i.e. poor to excellent ICCs) depending largely on the region
   of interest (ROI) and task. Contrary to our hypothesis, whole brain
   reliability was fair for the cognitive control task but good for the
   emotional attention and intertemporal choice task. Subcortical ROIs
   (ventral striatum, amygdala) resulted in lower ICCs than visual ROIs.
   Current results add to the yet sparse overall ICC literature in both
   developing samples and adults. This study shows that analyses of
   stability, i.e. reliability, are helpful benchmarks for longitudinal
   studies and their implications for adolescent development.}},

Title = {{Complexity of weighted graph: A new technique to investigate structural
   complexity of brain activities with applications to aging and autism}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{In recent years complexity of the brain structure in healthy and
   disordered subjects has been studied increasingly. But to the best of
   the authors' knowledge, researchers so far have investigated the
   structural complexity only in the context of two restricted networks
   known as Small-World and Scale-free networks; whereas other aspects of
   the structural complexity of brain activities may be affected by aging
   and neurodegenerative disorders such as the Alzheimer's disease and
   autism spectrum disorder. In this study, two general complexity metrics
   of graphs, Graph Index Complexity and Offdiagonal Complexity are
   proposed as general measures of complexity, not restricted to SWN only.
   They are adopted to measure the structural complexity of the weighted
   graphs instead of the common binary graphs. Fuzzy Synchronization
   Likelihood is applied to the EEGs and their sub-bands, as a functional
   connectivity metric of the brain, to construct the functional
   connectivity graphs. Two applications are used to evaluate the efficacy
   of the complexity measures: diagnosis of autism and aging, both based on
   EEG. It was discovered that the Graph Index Complexity of gamma band is
   discriminative in distinguishing autistic children from non-autistic
   children. Also, Offdiagonal Complexity of theta band in young subjects
   was observed to be significantly different than old subjects. This study
   shows that changes in the structure of functional connectivity of brain
   in disorders and different healthy states can be revealed by
   unrestricted metrics of graph complexity. While the applications
   presented in this paper are based on EEG, the approach is general and
   can be used with other modalities such as fMRI, MEG, etc. Further, it
   can be used to study every other neurological and psychiatric disorder.

Abstract = {{Conduct disorder (CD) is a developmental disorder defined by a
   repetitive and persistent display of antisocial and aggressive behaviors
   that violates the rights of others or basic social rules. Recently,
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRl) has been
   widely adopted to investigate the altered intrinsic neural activities
   and the disrupted endogenous brain connectivity of CD. In this study,
   functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping, a newly developed
   ultrafast voxel-wise method based on rsfMRl, was applied for the first
   time to examine the changes in the brain functional connectivity in CD
   at the voxel level. We assessed the differences in FCD between eighteen
   male adolescents with CD and eighteen typically-developing (TD)
   individuals. Then, the identified brain regions in which CD patients and
   healthy controls exhibited significant difference in FCD were extracted
   to calculate the correlations between measures of FCD values and
   clinical data. We discovered that compared to healthy controls, CD
   patients showed increased short-range FCD in the default-mode network
   including the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the
   bilateral precuneus (PCUN). More importantly, increased short-range FCD
   values in the bilateral PCC, the bilateral PCUN, and increased
   long-range FCD values in the left MCC showed significant correlations
   with the impulsivity. Overall, these results suggested that the FCD
   abnormalities in CD patients occurred in brain regions known to be
   involved in cognition, emotion and visual perception. (C) 2017 IBRO.

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Loneliness is broadly described as a negative emotional response
   resulting from the differences between the actual and desired social
   relations of an individual, which is related to the neural responses in
   connection with social and emotional stimuli. Prior research has
   discovered that some neural regions play a role in loneliness. However,
   little is known about the differences among individuals in loneliness
   and the relationship of those differences to differences in neural
   networks. The current study aimed to investigate individual differences
   in perceived loneliness related to the causal interactions between
   resting-state networks (RSNs), including the dorsal attentional network
   (DAN), the ventral attentional network (VAN), the affective network
   (AfN) and the visual network (VN). Using conditional granger causal
   analysis of resting-state fMRI data, we revealed that the weaker causal
   flow from DAN to VAN is related to higher loneliness scores, and the
   decreased causal flow from AfN to VN is also related to higher
   loneliness scores. Our results clearly support the hypothesis that there
   is a connection between loneliness and neural networks. It is envisaged
   that neural network features could play a key role in characterizing the
   loneliness of an individual.}},

Abstract = {{Difficulties in social-emotional processing have been proposed to play
   an important role in the development and maintenance of anorexia nervosa
   (AN). Few studies, thus far, have investigated neural processes that
   underlie these difficulties, including processing emotional facial
   expressions. However, the majority of these studies have investigated
   neural responses to adult emotional display, which may be confounded by
   elevated sensitivity to social rank and threat in AN. Therefore, the aim
   of this study was to investigate the neural processes underlying
   implicit processing of positively and negatively valenced infant
   emotional display in AN. Twenty-one adult women with AN and twenty-six
   healthy comparison (HC) women were presented with images of positively
   valenced, negatively valenced, and neutral infant faces during a fMRI
   scan. Significant differences between the groups in positive > neutral
   and negative > neutral contrasts were investigated in a priori regions
   of interest, including the bilateral amygdala, insula, and lateral
   prefrontal cortex (PFC). The findings revealed that the AN participants
   showed relatively increased recruitment while the HC participants showed
   relatively reduced recruitment of the bilateral amygdala and the right
   dorsolateral PFC in the positive > neutral contrast. In the negative >
   neutral contrast, the AN group showed relatively increased recruitment
   of the left posterior insula while the HC groups showed relatively
   reduced recruitment of this region. These findings suggest that people
   with AN may engage in implicit prefrontal down-regulation of elevated
   limbic reactivity to positively social-emotional stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Social ties are crucial for humans. Disruption of ties through social
   exclusion has a marked effect on our thoughts and feelings; however,
   such effects can be tempered by broader social network resources. Here,
   we use fMRI data acquired from 80 male adolescents to investigate how
   social exclusion modulates functional connectivity within and across
   brain networks involved in social pain and understanding the mental
   states of others (i.e., mentalizing). Furthermore, using objectively
   logged friendship network data, we examine how individual variability in
   brain reactivity to social exclusion relates to the density of
   participants' friendship networks, an important aspect of social network
   structure. We find increased connectivity within a set of regions
   previously identified as a mentalizing system during exclusion relative
   to inclusion. These results are consistent across the regions of
   interest as well as a whole-brain analysis. Next, examining how social
   network characteristics are associated with task-based connectivity
   dynamics, we find that participants who showed greater changes in
   connectivity within the mentalizing system when socially excluded by
   peers had less dense friendship networks. This work provides insight to
   understand how distributed brain systems respond to social and emotional
   challenges and how such brain dynamics might vary based on broader
   social network characteristics.}},

   connectome also had more similar day-to-day emotional synchrony.
   Furthermore, dyadic RSN connectome similarity was associated with
   children's emotional competence, suggesting that being neurally in-tune
   with their parents confers emotional benefits. We provide the first
   evidence that dyadic RSN similarity is associated with emotional
   synchrony in what is often our first and most essential social bond, the
   parent-child relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Brain connectivity is traditionally thought to be important for
   creativity. Here we investigated the associations of creativity measured
   by divergent thinking (CMDT) with resting-state functional magnetic
   imaging (fMRI) measures and their sex differences. We examined these
   relationships in the brains of 1277 healthy young adults. Whole-brain
   analyses revealed a significant interaction between verbal CMDT and sex
   on (a) regional homogeneity within an area from the left anterior
   temporal lobe (b) on the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC)
   between the mPFC and the left inferior frontal gyrus and (c) on
   fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in several
   distinct areas, including the precuneus and middle cingulate gyrus, left
   middle temporal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and cerebellum. These
   interactions were mediated by positive correlations in females and
   negative correlations in males. These findings suggest that greater CMDT
   in females is reflected by (a) regional coherence (regional homogeneity)
   of brain areas responsible for representing and combining concepts as
   well as (b) the efficient functional connection (RSFC) between the key
   areas for the default state of cognitive activity and speech production,
   and (c) greater spontaneous neural activity (fALFF) during the resting
   of brain areas involved in frontal lobe functions, default cognitive
   activities, and language functions. Furthermore, these findings suggest
   that the associations between creativity and resting state brain
   connectivity patterns are different between males and females.}},

Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) allows for the integrative study of
   neuronal processes at a macroscopic level. The majority of studies to
   date have assumed stationary interactions between brain regions, without
   considering the dynamic aspects of network organization. Only recently
   has the latter received increased attention, predominantly in human
   studies. Applying dynamic FC (dFC) analysis to mice is attractive given
   the relative simplicity of the mouse brain and the possibility to
   explore mechanisms underlying network dynamics using pharmacological,
   environmental or genetic interventions. Therefore, we have evaluated the
   feasibility and research potential of mouse dFC using the interventions
   of social stress or anesthesia duration as two case-study examples. By
   combining a sliding-window correlation approach with dictionary
   learning, several dynamic functional states (dFS) with a complex
   organization were identified, exhibiting highly dynamic inter- and
   intra-modular interactions. Each dFS displayed a high degree of
   reproducibility upon changes in analytical parameters and across
   datasets. They fluctuated at different degrees as a function of
   anesthetic depth, and were sensitive indicators of pathology as shown
   for the chronic psychosocial stress mouse model of depression. Dynamic
   functional states are proposed to make a major contribution to
   information integration and processing in the healthy and diseased
   brain.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have explored the concept of attachment in multiple ways,
   from animal studies examining imprinting to abnormal attachment in
   psychopathology. However, until recently, few have considered how neural
   circuitry develops the effective social bonds that are subsequently
   replicated in relationships across the lifespan. This current
   cross-sectional study undertook a fMRI Activation Likelihood Estimation
   (ALE) meta-analyses to examine the neurocircuitry that governs emotional
   and behavioural functions critical for building effective social
   relationships in children and adults. Results suggest that dissociable
   dorsal cognitive ({''}cool{''}) and ventral - affective ({''}hot{''})
   frontal-subcortical circuits (FSC) work together to govern social
   relationships, with repeated social consequences leading to potentially
   adaptive - or maladaptive - relationships that can become routinized in
   the cerebellum. Implications for forming stable, functional, social
   bonds are considered, followed by recommendations for those who struggle
   with cool and hot FSC functioning that can hinder the development of
   adaptive prosocial relationships. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background: Methylation of the serotonin 3A receptor gene (HTR3A) has
   been linked to child maltreatment and adult psychopathology. The present
   study examined whether HTR3A methylation might be associated with
   mothers' lifetime exposure to interpersonal violence (IPV), IPV-related
   psychopathology, child disturbance of attachment, and maternal neural
   activity.
   Methods: Number of maternal lifetime IPV exposures and measures of
   maternal psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
   major depression and aggressive behavior (AgB), and a measure of child
   attachment disturbance known as ``secure base distortion{''} (SBD) were
   assessed in a sample of 35 mothers and children aged 12-42 months. Brain
   fMRI activation was assessed in mothers using 30-s silent film excerpts
   depicting menacing adult male-female interactions versus prosocial and
   neutral interactions. Group and continuous analyses were performed to
   test for associations between clinical and fMRI variables with DNA
   methylation.
   Results: Maternal IPV exposure-frequency was associated with maternal
   PTSD; and maternal IPV-PTSD was in turn associated with child SBD.
   Methylation status of several CpG sites in the HTR3A gene was associated
   with maternal IPV and IPV-PTSD severity, AgB and child SBD, in
   particular, self-endangering behavior. Methylation status at a specific
   CpG site (CpG2(-)III) was associated with decreased medial prefrontal
   cortical (mPFC) activity in response to film-stimuli of adult male
   -female interactions evocative of violence as compared to prosocial and
   neutral interactions.
   Conclusions: Methylation status of the HTR3A gene in mothers is linked
   to maternal IPV-related psychopathology, trauma-induced brain activation
   patterns, and child attachment disturbance in the form of SBD during a
   sensitive period in the development of self-regulation. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Maternal attachment-related parenting behaviors require mothers to
   regulate self-related and child related distress. Emotion regulation is,
   in turn, influenced by maternal mood and personal developmental history.
   In the current study we examined how depressive mood may alter maternal
   limbic system function and functional connectivity underlying defensive
   and hedonic motivations. Twenty nine mothers were recruited to undergo a
   baby-cry task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   scan. Based on self-reported depression symptoms and clinical interview,
   the participants were grouped as healthy controls (n =15) and currently
   depressed (n=14). In the baby-cry task, 30 s-long auditory stimuli of
   baby-cry sounds were presented to simulate four conditions: generic
   baby-cry (Just-Listen), baby-cry as if it were their own child's cry
   (Your-Baby), baby-cry as if it were themselves (Self), and matched
   control sounds (Noise). Depressed mothers, as compared to healthy
   controls, showed greater Self versus Just-Listen responses in left
   extended amygdala and decreased functional coupling between this left
   extended amygdala as the seed and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in
   self-oriented (Self versus Just-Listen) and child-oriented (Your-Baby
   versus Just-Listen) distress signals. Moreover, the extended amygdala's
   differential functional connectivity with dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   (dmPFC) during the Your-Baby versus Self was increased for depressed
   mothers and decreased for healthy controls. Thus, depression may affect
   mothers by increasing baby-cry threat responses and dysregulating
   associations between threat and heathy child-oriented parenting
   motivations. These results are discussed in the context of attachment
   and self-psychology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{DIABETOLOGY \& METABOLIC SYNDROME}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Background: Obesity's increasing follows decreased perception of weight
   status in obese persons, mainly female, undergoing age-related changes.
   Objective: To study weight perception and psychological alterations
   associated to MS and T2DM.
   Methods: 200 patients selected from Metabolic Syndrome Outpatient Clinic
   of University of Campinas. Instruments: Beck Depression and Beck Anxiety
   Inventories', Toronto Alexithymia Scale-26s, questionnaire and data from
   reports. Approved by Unicamp Research Ethic Committee.
   Results: Patients aged 18-40 years perceived their weight higher than
   actual (A < D) (p = 0.0272), amongst untreated hypertensive (p = 0.037).
   = 41 years old patient's subdivided into A = D and A > D. A = D had 4.3
   more chances to be alexithymic than A < D. 35\% of A < D accepted their
   physical appearance, contrarily A = D (66\%) and A > D (69\%) (p =
   0.0018). 50\% of A < D felt offended by social aggression due to their
   weight; A = D (20\%) and A > D (34\%) (p = 0.007). 3.6 more chances of A
   > D than A < D using anti-hypertensive drugs (p = 0.021) (>= 41 years
   old) and 3.5 more chances to perceive A = D (41-60 years old) (p =
   0.023). A = D presented 3.8 more chances of depression than A < D and
   4.3 more chances of alexithymia than A < D (62\% of 41-60 year-old
   patients with higher cholesterol, mainly LDL and hyper-triglycerides). A
   = D with alexithymia, partially linked with higher cholesterol, suggests
   neuroinflammation due to hypertriglycerides. Females, who declared had
   been anteriorly made diet as treatment to lose weight were exactly those
   who perceived their weight A > D (45\%, p = 0.0091).
   Conclusions: Age as a period of development, in which cultural
   influences occurs, was a factor in weight misperception. A < D and A > D
   were distinct in age, history of obesity and BMI.}},

Abstract = {{Resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is commonly used to study the brain's
   intrinsic neural coupling, which reveals specific spatiotemporal
   patterns in the form of resting state networks (RSNs). It has been
   hypothesized that slow rs-fMRI oscillations (<0.1 Hz) are driven by
   underlying electrophysiological rhythms that typically occur at much
   faster timescales (>5 Hz); however, causal evidence for this
   relationship is currently lacking. Here we measured rs-fMRI in humans
   while applying transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to
   entrain brain rhythms in left and right sensorimotor cortices. The two
   driving tACS signals were tailored to the individual's alpha rhythm (8 -
   12 Hz) and fluctuated in amplitude according to a 1 Hz power envelope.
   We entrained the left versus right hemisphere in accordance to two
   different coupling modes where either alpha oscillations were
   synchronized between hemispheres (phase-synchronized tACS) or the slower
   oscillating power envelopes (power-synchronized tACS).
   Power-synchronized tACS significantly increased rs-fMRI connectivity
   within the stimulated RSN compared with phase-synchronized or no tACS.
   This effect outlasted the stimulation period and tended to be more
   effective in individuals who exhibited a naturally weak interhemispheric
   coupling. Using this novel approach, our data provide causal evidence
   that synchronized power fluctuations contribute to the formation of
   fMRI-based RSNs. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that the brain's
   intrinsic coupling at rest can be selectively modulated by choosing
   appropriate tACS signals, which could lead to new interventions for
   patients with altered rs-fMRI connectivity.}},

   underwent WMT or received no intervention for 4 weeks. Compared with no
   intervention, WMT increased DC in the anatomical cluster, including
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).
   Furthermore, WMT increased fALFF in the anatomical cluster including the
   right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), frontopolar area and mPFC.
   WMT increased regional homogeneity in the anatomical cluster that spread
   from the precuneus to posterior cingulate cortex and posterior parietal

   on Empathy for Pain: An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{As a typical form of empathy, empathy for pain refers to the perception
   and appraisal of others' pain, as well as the corresponding affective
   responses. Numerous studies investigated the factors affecting the
   empathy for pain, in which the exposure to violent video games (VVGs)
   could change players' empathic responses to painful situations. However,
   it remains unclear whether exposure to VVG influences the empathy for
   pain. In the present study, in terms of the exposure experience to VVG,
   two groups of participants (18 in VVG group, VG; 17 in non-VVG group,
   NG) were screened from nearly 200 video game experience questionnaires.
   And then, the functional magnetic resonance imaging data were recorded
   when they were viewing painful and non-painful stimuli. The results
   showed that the perception of others' pain were not significantly
   different in brain regions between groups, from which we could infer
   that the desensitization effect of VVGs was overrated.}},

Month = {{MAY-AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we study complex or executive attention based on sex and
   difficulty of switching attention task. An experimental study was
   carried out using a mixed complex 2 x 4 design in which 48 students
   participated performing the Complex Attention task of the Spanish
   version of PSSCogRehab 2012 software. Data analysis was performed using
   a factorial variance analysis for mixed complex designs and the
   Mann-Whitney U-statistic. The results showed that there are no
   significant differences between the performance of males and females in
   terms of success, however, males tend to be faster when the switching
   attention task is easy; the gap between the sexes ceases to be
   significant as the level of complexity of the task increases. It was
   found that the difficulty of the task significantly influences the
   process of attentional change since as the level of complexity
   increases, the successes decrease and the response time increases in
   both sexes. The global change costs of men and women were estimated at
   different levels of difficulty, however, no significant differences were
   found between sexes. These results suggest similarities rather than
   differences between the sexes, at least in a cognitive process, which
   has social, educational and even clinical implications related to the
   evaluation of executive attention and the treatment of attentional
   disorders. (C) 2017 Universitat de Barcelona. Published by Elsevier

Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Unlike many species that enact social behaviour in loose aggregations
   (such as swarms or herds), humans form groups comprising many long-term,
   intense, non-reproductive bonds with non-kin(1). The cognitive demands
   of navigating such groups are thought to have significantly influenced
   human brain evolution(2). Yet little is known about how and to what
   extent the human brain encodes the structure of the social networks in
   which it is embedded. We characterized the social network of an academic
   cohort (N = 275); a subset (N = 21) completed a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving viewing individuals who varied
   in terms of `degrees of separation' from themselves (social distance),
   the extent to which they were well-connected to well-connected others
   (eigenvector centrality) and the extent to which they connected
   otherwise unconnected individuals (brokerage). Understanding these
   characteristics of social network position requires tracking direct
   relationships, bonds between third parties and the broader network
   topology. Pairing network data with multi-voxel pattern analysis, we
   show that information about social network position is accurately
   perceived and spontaneously activated when encountering familiar
   individuals. These findings elucidate how the human brain encodes the
   structure of its social world and underscore the importance of
   integrating an understanding of social networks into the study of social
   perception.}},

Title = {{Avoidant Responses to Interpersonal Provocation Are Associated with
   Increased Amygdala and Decreased Mentalizing Network Activity}},
Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{When intentionally pushed or insulted, one can either flee from the
   provoker or retaliate. The implementation of such fight-or-flight
   decisions is a central aspect in the genesis and evolution of aggression
   episodes, yet it is usually investigated only indirectly or in nonsocial
   situations. In the present fMRI study, we aimed to distinguish brain
   regions associated with aggressive and avoidant responses to
   interpersonal provocation in humans. Participants (thirty-six healthy
   young women) could either avoid or face a highly (HP) and a lowly (LP)
   provoking opponent in a competitive reaction time task: the
   fight-orescape (FOE) paradigm. Subjects avoided the HP more often, but
   retaliated when facing her. Moreover, they chose to fight the HP more
   quickly, and showed increased heart rate (HR) right before confronting
   her. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and sensorimotor cortex were more active
   when participants decided to fight, whereas the mentalizing network was
   engaged when deciding to avoid. Importantly, avoiding the HP relative to
   the LP was associated with both higher activation in the right
   basolateral amygdala and lower relative activity in several mentalizing
   regions {[}e. g., medial and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG),
   temporal-parietal junction (TPJ)]. These results suggest that avoidant
   responses to provocation might result from heightened threat
   anticipation and are associated with reduced perspective taking.
   Furthermore, our study helps to reconcile conflicting findings on the
   role of the mentalizing network, the amygdala, and the OFC in
   aggression.}},

Abstract = {{The tribal character of the affective link between football fans and
   their teams is a well-recognized phenomenon. Other forms of love such as
   romantic or maternal attachment have previously been studied from a
   neuroimaging point of view. Here we aimed to investigate the neural
   basis of this tribal form of love, which implies both the feeling of
   belongingness and rivalry against opposing teams. A pool of 56
   participants was submitted to an fMRI experimental design involving the
   presentation of winning and losing football moments of their loved,
   rival or neutral teams. We found recruitment of amygdala and reward
   regions, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra
   (SN), as well as other limbic regions involved in emotional cognition,
   for `positive vs neutral' and `positive vs negative' conditions. The
   latter contrast was correlated with neuropsychological scores of
   fanaticism in the amygdala and regions within the reward system, as the
   VTA and SN. The observation of increased response patterns in critical
   components of the reward system, in particular for positive content
   related to the loved team, suggests that this kind of non-romantic love
   reflects a specific arousal and motivational state, which is biased for
   emotional learning of positive outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by affective
   instability, but self-injurious behavior appears to have an
   emotion-regulating effect. We investigated whether pain-mediated affect
   regulation can be altered at the neural level by residential Dialectical
   Behavior Therapy (DBT), providing adaptive emotion regulation
   techniques. Likewise, we investigated whether pain thresholds or the
   appraisal of pain change after psychotherapy. We investigated 28
   patients with BPD undergoing DBT (self-referral), 15 patients with
   treatment as usual and 23 healthy control subjects at two time points 12
   weeks apart. We conducted an fMRI experiment eliciting negative emotions
   with picture stimuli and induced heat pain to investigate the role of
   pain in emotion regulation. Additionally, we assessed heat and cold pain
   thresholds.
   At first measurement, patients with BPD showed amygdala deactivation in
   response to painful stimulation, as well as altered connectivity between
   left amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. These effects were
   reduced after DBT, as compared with patients with treatment as usual.
   Pain thresholds did not differ between the patient groups. We replicated
   the role of pain as a means of affect regulation in BPD, indicated by
   increased amygdala coupling. For the first time, we could demonstrate
   that pain-mediated affect regulation can be changed by DBT.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala responds to stimulus novelty, which may correspond to an
   evaluation of novel stimuli for potential threat, and trait anxiety may
   modulate this response. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)
   may also be sensitive to novelty as it responds to both uncertainty and
   threat. If so, a BNST novelty response may also be affected by trait
   anxiety and interact with stimulus negativity. We presented participants
   with novel and repeated negative and neutral images while measuring
   brain activity via fMRI, and assessed participants' self-reported trait
   anxiety. We expected to replicate past findings of novelty responses in
   the hippocampus and amygdala that are independent of stimulus
   negativity. We also expected BNST novelty-sensitivity and that trait
   anxiety would predict greater sensitivity to both novelty and negativity
   in the amygdala and BNST, but not the hippocampus. Our a priori analyses
   replicated past findings of a novelty response that was independent of
   valence in the hippocampus and amygdala. The BNST exhibited a novelty
   response for negative, but not neutral, images. Trait anxiety did not
   modulate the response to novelty or negativity in any of the ROIs
   investigated. Our findings suggest that the BNST plays a role in the
   detection of novelty.

Abstract = {{Loss or reduction of awareness is common in neuropsychiatric disorders
   and culturally influenced dissociative phenomena but the underlying
   brain mechanisms are poorly understood. fMRI was combined with
   suggestions for automatic writing in 18 healthy highly hypnotically
   suggestible individuals in a within-subjects design to determine whether
   clinical alterations in awareness of thought and movement can be
   experimentally modelled and studied independently of illness. Subjective
   ratings of control, ownership, and awareness of thought and movement,
   and fMRI data were collected following suggestions for thought insertion
   and alien control of writing movement, with and without loss of
   awareness. Subjective ratings confirmed that suggestions were effective.
   At the neural level, our main findings indicated that loss of awareness
   for both thought and movement during automatic writing was associated
   with reduced activation in a predominantly left-sided posterior cortical
   network including BA 7 (superior parietal lobule and precuneus), and
   posterior cingulate cortex, involved in self-related processing and
   awareness of the body in space. Reduced activity in posterior parietal
   cortices may underlie specific clinical and cultural alterations in
   awareness of thought and movement. Clinically, these findings may assist
   development of imaging assessments for loss of awareness of
   psychological origin, and interventions such as neurofeedback.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to successfully suppress impulses and angry affect is
   fundamental to control aggressive reactions following provocations. The
   aim of this study was to examine neural responses to provocations and
   aggression using a laboratory model of reactive aggression. We used a
   novel functional magnetic resonance imaging point-subtraction aggression
   paradigm in 44 men, of whom 18 were incarcerated violent offenders and
   26 were control non-offenders. We measured brain activation following
   provocations (monetary subtractions), while the subjects had the
   possibility to behave aggressively or pursue monetary rewards. The
   violent offenders behaved more aggressively than controls (aggression
   frequency 150 vs 84, P = 0.03) and showed significantly higher brain
   reactivity to provocations within the amygdala and striatum, as well as
   reduced amygdala-prefrontal and striato-prefrontal connectivity.
   Amygdala reactivity to provocations was positively correlated with
   task-related behavior in the violent offenders. Across groups, striatal
   and prefrontal reactivity to provocations was positively associated with
   trait anger and trait aggression. These results suggest that violent
   individuals display abnormally high neural sensitivity to social
   provocations, a sensitivity related to aggressive behavior. These
   findings provide novel insight into the neural pathways that are
   sensitive to provocations, which is critical to more effectively shaped
   interventions that aim to reduce pathological aggressive behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion dysregulation (ED) reflects deficits in understanding and
   managing negative emotions and may serve as a transdiagnostic mechanism
   of risk for trauma-related psychiatric disorders. Therefore,
   understanding neurobiological substrates of ED in traumatized
   individuals is critical. The present study examined associations between
   ED and baseline structural differences and patterns of functional
   activity during an emotional task in a sample of African American women
   (n = 136) recruited from an urban hospital. Participants engaged in a
   structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) session. A subsample (n =
   92) also viewed emotional face stimuli during functional MRI. ED was
   related to greater dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) surface area
   (P-corr < 0.05) and increased dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and
   ventromedial PFC activation to fearful stimuli (P-corr < 0.05),
   independent of the trauma and psychiatric symptoms. DMPFC activation was
   also associated with posttraumatic stress disorder and depression
   symptoms. Mediation analyses showed a significant mediation effect of ED
   on the relation between dmPFC activation and psychiatric symptoms. These

Abstract = {{Previous neuroimaging work has shown that increased reward-related
   activity following exposure to food cues is predictive of self-control
   failure. The balance model suggests that self-regulation failures result
   from an imbalance in reward and executive control mechanisms. However,
   an open question is whether the relative balance of activity in brain
   systems associated with executive control (vs reward) supports
   self-regulatory outcomes when people encounter tempting cues in daily
   life. Sixty-nine chronic dieters, a population known for frequent lapses
   in self-control, completed a food cue-reactivity task during an fMRI
   scanning session, followed by a weeklong sampling of daily eating
   behaviors via ecological momentary assessment. We related participants'
   food cue activity in brain systems associated with executive control and
   reward to real-world eating patterns. Specifically, a balance score
   representing the amount of activity in brain regions associated with
   self-regulatory control, relative to automatic reward-related activity,
   predicted dieters' control over their eating behavior during the
   following week. This balance measure may reflect individual self-control
   capacity and be useful for examining self-regulation success in other
   domains and populations.}},

Abstract = {{Mirror neurons are a subset of brain cells that discharge during action
   execution and passive observation of similar actions. An open question
   concerns the functional role of their ability to match observed and
   executed actions. Since understanding of goals requires conscious
   perception of actions, we expect that mirror neurons potentially
   involved in action goal coding, will be modulated by changes in action
   perception level. Here, we manipulated perception level of action videos
   depicting short hand movements and measured the corresponding fMRI BOLD
   responses in mirror regions. Our results show that activity levels
   within a network of regions, including the sensorimotor cortex, primary
   motor cortex, dorsal premotor cortex and posterior superior temporal
   sulcus, are sensitive to changes in action perception level, whereas
   activity levels in the inferior frontal gyrus, ventral premotor cortex,
   supplementary motor area and superior parietal lobule are invariant to
   such changes. In addition, this parcellation to two sub-networks
   manifest as smaller functional distances within each group of regions
   during task and resting state. Our results point to functional
   differences between regions within the mirror neurons system which may
   have implications with respect to their possible role in action
   understanding.}},

Title = {{Social-cognitive brain function and connectivity during visual

Abstract = {{Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia are
   neurodevelopmental conditions that are characterized by significant
   social impairment. Emerging genomic and neurobiological evidence has
   increasingly pointed to shared pathophysiologic mechanisms in the two
   disorders. Overlap in social impairment may reflect similar underlying
   neural dysfunction in social-cognitive brain networks, yet few studies
   have directly compared brain function and communication between those
   with ASD and schizophrenia.
   Methods: Outpatients with schizophrenia (n=36), ASD (n=33), and healthy
   volunteers (n=37) completed a visual perspective-taking task during
   functional neuroimaging at 3T to assess similarities and differences in
   fronto-temporal brain function and connectivity during social-cognitive
   processing. Analyses employed general linear models to examine
   differences in amplitude of BOLD-signal response between disorder
   groups, and computed functional connectivity coefficients to investigate
   differences in the connectivity profiles of networks implicated in
   social cognition.
   Results: Despite similar behavioral impairments, participants with ASD
   and schizophrenia evidenced distinct neural abnormalities during
   perspective-taking. Functional activation results indicated reduced
   temporoparietal junction and medial prefrontal activity in ASD compared
   to schizophrenia (all P-uncor < 0.002). Functional connectivity analyses
   further revealed significantly greater local orbitofrontal connectivity
   in ASD than schizophrenia (all P-FDR < 0.028) during perspective-taking.
   Differences in brain activation and connectivity were unrelated to
   antipsychotic medication dose.
   Conclusions: Autism and schizophrenia are characterized by similar
   social-cognitive impairments that may stem from different underlying
   abnormalities in the functional organization and communication of the
   social brain. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Stress and negative affect are known contributors to drug use and
   relapse, and several known treatments for addictions include strategies
   for managing them. In the current study, we administered a
   well-established stress provocation during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to 23 participants who completed either mindfulness
   training (MT; N=11) or the American Lung Association's Freedom From
   Smoking (FFS; N= 12), which is a cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT)
   for smoking cessation. Across the entire sample, we found that stress
   reactivity in several brain regions including the amygdala and
   anterior/mid insula was related to reductions in smoking after
   treatment, as well as at 3-month post-treatment follow-up. Moreover,
   conjunction analysis revealed that these same regions also
   differentiated between treatment groups such that the MT group showed
   lower stress-reactivity compared to the FFS/CBT group. This suggests
   that reduction in stress reactivity may be one of the mechanisms that
   underlie the efficacy of MT in reducing smoking over time. The findings
   have important implications for our understanding of stress, the neural
   and psychological mechanisms that underlie mindfulness-based treatments,
   and for smoking cessation treatments more broadly.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Schizophrenia is characterized by impaired -social and non
   social cognition both of which lead to functional deficits. These
   deficits may benefit from cognitive remediation, but the neural
   underpinnings of such improvements have not been clearly delineated.
   Methods: We conducted a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) study in
   early course schizophrenia patients randomly assigned to cognitive
   enhancement therapy (CET) or enriched supportive therapy (EST) and
   treated for two years. Imaging data over three time points including
   fMRI blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) data were acquired during
   performance of a cognitive control paradigm, the Preparing to Overcome
   Prepotency (POP) task, and functional connectivity data, were analyzed.
   Results: During the two years of treatment, CET patients showed a
   continual increase in BOLD activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (DLPFC), whereas EST patients tended to show no change in
   prefrontal brain function throughout treatment. Increases in right DLPFC
   activity were modestly associated with improved neurocognition (beta
   =.14, p =.041), but not social cognition. Functional connectivity
   analyses showed reduced connectivity between the DLPFC and the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) in CET compared to EST over the two years of
   treatment, which was associated with neurocognitive improvement.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest that CET leads to enhanced neural
   activity in brain regions mediating cognitive control and increased
   efficiency in prefrontal circuits; such changes may be related to the
   observed therapeutic effects of CET on neurocognitive function.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the claim that mirror neuron activity is the
   mechanism by which we come to know about the action-related intentions
   of others (e.g. Gallese et al., 1996; Rizzolatti et al., 1996), i.e.
   that they are a mechanism for `mind-reading'. I agree with recent
   authors (e.g. Hickok, 2008; Jacob, 2008) who reject this view but
   nevertheless I argue that mirror neurons may still have a role to play
   in the ways in which we understand one another (social cognition). If we
   adopt a certain kind of pluralism about social cognition then the mirror
   neuron system could play a role in social cognition even if it provides
   no access to the minds of others at all. I argue for this view and
   consider what the approach might entail for the ontology of the mirror
   neuron system.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is a cornerstone of social behavior, impairments of which are
   characteristic of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism and
   psychopathy. According to the ``shared representations{''} theory,
   empathy relies on neural processes similar to those underpinning the
   first-hand experience of a given emotion. A recent study by Mischkowski,
   Crocker, and Way (Soc Cogn Affect Neurosci 11: 1345-1353, 2016) provides
   novel insights into neurobiological underpinnings of empathy by
   demonstrating that acetaminophen, a widely used painkiller, reduces
   empathy for other's physical and social pain.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although dystonia is traditionally conceptualized as a basal
   ganglia disorder, increasing interest has been directed at a different
   neural network node, the cerebellum, which may play a significant role
   in the pathophysiology of dystonia. Abnormal sensorimotor processing and
   disturbed motor schemes, possibly attributable to cerebellar changes,
   remain unclear.
   Methods: We sought to characterize the extent of cerebellar dysfunction
   within the motor network using functional MRI activation analysis,
   connectivity analysis, and voxel-based morphometry in cervical dystonia
   patients ( n525, 15 women, mean age 45.8 years) and healthy volunteers (
   n525, 15 women, mean age 44.7 years) in a visuospatial task requiring
   predictive motor timing.
   Results: Cervical dystonia patients showed decreased activation in the
   posterior cerebellar lobules as well as in the premotor areas, the
   associative parietal cortex, and visual regions. Patients also had
   decreased cerebellar connectivity with bilateral basal ganglia
   structures and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
   Conclusions: This promotes the view that dystonia results from
   miscommunication between the basal ganglia and cerebellar loops, thus
   providing new insights into the brain regions essential for the
   development of cervical dystonia. (C) 2017 International Parkinson and

Abstract = {{Inferring the relative rank (i.e., status) of others is essential to
   navigating social hierarchies. A survey of the expanding social
   psychological and neuroscience literatures on status reveals a diversity
   of focuses (e.g., perceiver vs. agent), operationalizations (e.g.,
   status as dominance vs. wealth), and methodologies (e.g., behavioral,
   neuroscientific). Accommodating this burgeoning literature on status in
   person perception, the present review offers a novel social
   neuroscientific framework that integrates existing work with theoretical
   clarity. This framework distinguishes between five key concepts: (1)
   strategic pathways to status acquisition for agents, (2) status
   antecedents (i.e., perceptual and knowledge-based cues that confer
   status rank), (3) status dimensions (i.e., domains in which an
   individual may be ranked, such as wealth), (4) status level (i.e., one's
   rank along a given dimension), and (5) the relative importance of a
   given status dimension, dependent on perceiver and context
   characteristics. Against the backdrop of this framework, we review
   multiple dimensions of status in the nonhuman and human primate
   literatures. We then review the behavioral and neuroscientific
   literatures on the consequences of perceived status for attention and
   evaluation. Finally, after proposing a social neuroscience framework, we
   highlight innovative directions for future social status research in
   social psychology and neuroscience.}},

Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive tasks recruit multiple brain regions. Understanding how these
   regions influence each other (the network structure) is an important
   step to characterize the neural basis of cognitive processes. Often,
   limited evidence is available to restrict the range of hypotheses a
   priori, and techniques that sift efficiently through a large number of
   possible network structures are needed (network discovery). This article
   introduces a novel modelling technique for network discovery (Dynamic
   Network Modelling or DNM) that builds on ideas from Granger Causality
   and Dynamic Causal Modelling introducing three key changes: (1)
   efficient network discovery is implemented with statistical tests on the
   consistency of model parameters across participants, (2) the tests take
   into account the magnitude and sign of each influence, and (3) variance
   explained in independent data is used as an absolute (rather than
   relative) measure of the quality of the network model. In this article,
   we outline the functioning of DNM, we validate DNM in simulated data for
   which the ground truth is known, and we report an example of its
   application to the investigation of influences between regions during
   emotion recognition, revealing top-down influences from brain regions
   encoding abstract representations of emotions (medial prefrontal cortex
   and superior temporal sulcus) onto regions engaged in the perceptual
   analysis of facial expressions (occipital face area and fusiform face
   area) when participants are asked to switch between reporting the
   emotional valence and the age of a face.}},

   visuo-spatial attention shifts}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{81-91}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that the frontal eye-fields (FEF) in the dorsal
   attention network (DAN) guide top-down selective attention. In addition,
   converging evidence implies a causal role for the FEF in attention
   shifting, which is also known to recruit the ventral attention network
   (VAN) and fronto-striatal regions. To investigate the causal influence
   of the FEF as (part of) a central hub between these networks, we applied
   thetaburst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) off-line, combined
   with functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) during a cued visuo-spatial
   attention shifting paradigm.
   We found that TBS over the right FEF impaired performance on a visual
   discrimination task in both hemifields following attention shifts, while
   only left hemifield performance was affected when participants were cued
   to maintain the focus of attention. These effects recovered ca. 20 min
   post stimulation. Furthermore, particularly following attention shifts,
   TBS suppressed the neural signal in bilateral FEF, right inferior and
   superior parietal lobule (IPL/SPL) and bilateral supramarginal gyri
   (SMG). Immediately post stimulation, functional connectivity was
   impaired between right FEF and right SMG as well as right putamen.
   Importantly, the extent of decreased connectivity between right FEF and
   right SMG correlated with behavioural impairment following attention
   shifts.
   The main finding of this study demonstrates that influences from right
   FEF on SMG in the ventral attention network causally underly attention
   shifts, presumably by enabling disengagement from the current focus of
   attention.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Prioritizing self-transcendent values such as family and
   friends more than nontranscendent values such as wealth and privilege is
   associated with lower stress response. In this study, we tested whether
   having self-transcendent values can reduce specific responses in the
   brain in the context of potentially threatening health communications.
   Methods Sedentary adults (N = 67) who would likely feel threatened by
   health messages that highlight the risk of sedentary behavior were
   recruited. Participants indicated the degree to which they prioritize
   self-transcendent values more than nontranscendent values. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants' neural responses to
   health messages were assessed within neural regions implicated in threat
   responses, including bilateral amygdala and anterior insula (AI).
   Results A tendency to prioritize self-transcendent more than
   nontranscendent values was associated with lower reactivity during
   exposure to health messages within anatomically defined regions of left
   amygdala (t(55) = -2.66, p = .010, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] =
   -0.08 to -0.01), right amygdala (t(55) = -2.22, p = .031, 95\% CI =
   -0.06 to 0.0), and left AI (t(55) = -2.17, p = .034, 95\% CI = -0.04 to
   0.0), as well as a mask functionally defined to be associated with
   threat using an automated meta-analysis (t(55) = -2.04, p = .046, 95\%
   CI = -0.05 to 0.0). No significant effect was obtained within the right
   AI (t(55) = -1.38, p = .17, 95\% CI = -0.04 to .01). These effects were
   partially enhanced by reinforcing important values through
   self-affirmation, remained significant after accounting for
   self-reported social connection, and were specific to health message
   processing (versus generic self-related information).
   Conclusions Attenuated neural reactivity to potentially threatening
   health messages may be a novel way that prioritizing self-transcendent
   values could lead to positive health behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Studies conducted in drug addiction suggest a transition in processing
   of drug-related cues from the ventral to the dorsal component of the
   striatum. However, this process has not been studied in a behavioral
   addiction. Assessment of this process in a non-drug addiction can
   provide insight into the pathophysiology of both substance and
   behavioral addictions. Thirty-nine male Internet gaming disorder (IGD)
   subjects and 23 male matched healthy controls (HCs) participated in
   functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of a
   cue-reactivity task involving alternating presentation of Internet
   gaming-related stimuli (game cues) and general Internet surfing-related
   stimuli (control cues). Cue-induced neural activations in the ventral
   and dorsal striatum (DS) were compared between IGD and HC participants.
   Associations between cue-reactivity within these regions and cue-induced
   craving and severity and duration of IGD were also explored. IGD
   participants exhibited higher cue-induced activations within both the
   ventral and DS when compared with HCs. Within the IGD group, activity
   within the left ventral striatum (VS) was correlated negatively with
   cue-induced craving; positive associations were found between

   negatively associated with right VS volumes among IGD participants.
   Consistent with studies in substance addictions, our results suggest
   that a transition from ventral to dorsal striatal processing may occur
   among individuals with IGD, a condition without the impact of substance

Abstract = {{Drugs of abuse stimulate striatal dopamine release and activate reward
   pathways. This study examined the impact of alcohol and cannabis
   marketing on the reward circuit in alcohol and cannabis users while
   sober and intoxicated. It was predicted that alcohol and cannabis
   marketing would increase striatal activation when sober and that reward
   sensitivity would be less during alcohol and cannabis intoxication.
   Heavy alcohol (n = 20) and regular cannabis users (n= 21) participated
   in a mixed factorial study involving administration of alcohol and
   placebo in the alcohol group and cannabis and placebo in the cannabis
   group. Non-drug users (n = 20) served as between group reference. Brain
   activation after exposure to alcohol and cannabis marketing movies was
   measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging and compared
   between groups while sober and compared with placebo while intoxicated.
   Implicit alcohol and cannabis cognitions were assessed by means of a
   single-category implicit association test. Alcohol and cannabis
   marketing significantly increased striatal BOLD activation across all
   groups while sober. Striatal activation however decreased during
   intoxication with alcohol and cannabis. Implicit associations with
   cannabis marketing cues were significantly more positive in alcohol and
   cannabis users as compared with non-drug using controls. Public
   advertising of alcohol or cannabis use elicits striatal activation in
   the brain's reward circuit. Reduction of marketing would reduce brain
   exposure to reward cues that motivate substance use. Conversely,
   elevated dopamine levels protect against the reinforcing potential of
   marketing.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with schizophrenia display notable deficits in social
   functioning. Research indicates that neural connectivity within the
   default mode network (DMN) is related to social cognition and social
   functioning in healthy and clinical populations. However, the
   association between DMN connectivity, social cognition, and social
   functioning has not been studied in schizophrenia. For the present
   study, the authors used resting-state neuroimaging data to evaluate
   connectivity between the main DMN hubs (i.e., the medial prefrontal
   cortex {[}mPFC] and the posterior cingulate cortex-anterior precuneus
   {[}PPC]) in individuals with schizophrenia (n = 28) and controls (n =
   32). The authors also examined whether DMN connectivity was associated
   with social functioning via social attainment (measured by the Specific
   Levels of Functioning Scale) and social competence (measured by the
   Social Skills Performance Assessment), and if social cognition mediates
   the association between DMN connectivity and these measures of social
   functioning. Results revealed that DMN connectivity did not differ
   between individuals with schizophrenia and controls. However,
   connectivity between the mPFC and PCC hubs was significantly associated
   with social competence and social attainment in individuals with
   schizophrenia but not in controls as reflected by a significant
   group-by-connectivity interaction. Social cognition did not mediate the
   association between DMN connectivity and social functioning in
   individuals with schizophrenia. The findings suggest that
   fronto-parietal DMN connectivity in particular may be differentially
   associated with social functioning in schizophrenia and controls. As a
   result, DMN connectivity may be used as a neuroimaging marker to monitor
   treatment response or as a potential target for interventions that aim
   to enhance social functioning in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Communication between cortical regions is necessary for optimal
   cognitive processing. Functional relationships between cortical regions
   can be inferred through measurements of temporal synchrony in
   spontaneous activity patterns. These relationships can be further
   elaborated by surveying effects of cortical lesions upon inter-regional
   connectivity. Lesions to cortical hubs and heteromodal association
   regions are expected to induce distributed connectivity changes and
   higher-order cognitive deficits, yet their functional consequences
   remain relatively unexplored. Here, we used resting-state fMRI to
   investigate intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) and graph theoretical
   metrics in 12 patients with circumscribed lesions of the medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) portion of the Default Network (DN), and
   compared these metrics with those observed in healthy matched comparison
   participants and a sample of 1139 healthy individuals. Despite
   significant mPFC destruction, patients did not demonstrate weakened
   intrinsic FC among undamaged DN nodes. Instead, network-specific changes
   were manifested as weaker negative correlations between the DN and
   attentional and somatomotor networks. These findings conflict with the
   DN being a homogenous system functionally anchored at mPFC. Rather, they
   implicate a role for mPFC in mediating cross-network functional
   interactions. More broadly, our data suggest that lesions to association
   cortical hubs might induce clinical deficits by disrupting communication
   between interacting large-scale systems.}},

Abstract = {{Imitating speech necessitates the transformation from sensory targets to
   vocal tract motor output, yet little is known about the representational
   basis of this process in the human brain. Here, we address this question
   by using real-time MR imaging (rtMRI) of the vocal tract and functional
   MRI (fMRI) of the brain in a speech imitation paradigm. Participants
   trained on imitating a native vowel and a similar nonnative vowel that
   required lip rounding. Later, participants imitated these vowels and an
   untrained vowel pair during separate fMRI and rtMRI runs. Univariate
   fMRI analyses revealed that regions including left inferior frontal
   gyrus were more active during sensorimotor transformation (ST) and
   production of nonnative vowels, compared with native vowels; further, ST
   for nonnative vowels activated somatomotor cortex bilaterally, compared
   with ST of native vowels. Using test representational similarity
   analysis (RSA) models constructed from participants' vocal tract images
   and from stimulus formant distances, we found that RSA searchlight
   analyses of fMRI data showed either type of model could be represented
   in somatomotor, temporal, cerebellar, and hippocampal neural activation
   patterns during ST. We thus provide the first evidence of widespread and
   robust cortical and subcortical neural representation of vocal tract
   and/or formant parameters, during prearticulatory ST.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies on patients diagnosed with social anxiety
   disorder (SAD) reported changed patterns of the resting-state functional
   connectivity network (rs-FCN) between the prefrontal cortices and other
   prefrontal, amygdalar or striatal regions. Using a graph theory
   approach, this study explored the modularity based community profile and
   patterns of inter-/intra-modular communication for the rs-FCN in SAD.
   Methods: In total, for 28 SAD patients and 27 healthy controls (HC),
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired in
   resting-state and subjected to a graph theory analysis.
   Results: The within-module degree z-score for a hub region {[}out of a
   total of 10 hub regions ranked using the participation coefficient]
   named left middle temporal gyms was impaired in SAD compared to HC,
   proportional to the severity of clinician-scored and patient-reported
   functional impairment in SAD.
   Limitations: Most of participants included in this study were
   undergraduate students in their early-to-mid 20's.
   Conclusions: This study showed the importance of functional
   communication from the left middle temporal gyros with other
   opercular-insular-subcortical regions for better objective functioning
   and lesser subjective disability in SAD.}},

   showed significant Group (high-vs. lowrisk)xPerformance (hit vs.
   miss)xCondition (no reward vs. reward) interactions in a whole-brain
   analysis. All regions exhibited similar patterns, whereby the high-risk
   group showed blunted activation differences between trials with vs.
   without rewards when participants hit the target. Moreover, high-risk
   children showed activation differences between trials with vs. without
   rewards in the opposite direction, compared to the low-risk group, when
   they missed the target.
   Limitations: This study had a modest sample size, though larger than
   existing studies. Children with maternal depression are at elevated risk
   for future psychopathology, yet not all experience clinically
   significant symptoms; longitudinal research is necessary to fully track
   the pathway from risk to disorder.
   Conclusion: Children of depressed mothers exhibited attenuated neural
   activation differences and activation patterns opposite to children
   without depressed mothers. Our findings may provide targets for
   hypothesis driven preventive interventions and lead to earlier
   identification of individuals at risk.}},

Abstract = {{In small, selected samples, an approach combining resting-state
   functional connectivity MRI and multivariate pattern analysis has been
   able to successfully classify patients diagnosed with unipolar
   depression. Purposes of this investigation were to assess the
   generalizability of this approach to a large clinically more realistic
   sample and secondarily to assess the replicability of previously
   reported methodological feasibility in a more homogeneous subgroup with
   pronounced depressive symptoms. Two independent subsets were drawn from
   the depression and control cohorts of the BiDirect study, each with 180
   patients with and 180 controls without depression. Functional
   connectivity either among regions covering the gray matter or selected
   regions with known alterations in depression was assessed by
   resting-state fMRI. Support vector machines with and without automated
   feature selection were used to train classifiers differentiating between
   individual patients and controls in the entire first subset as well as
   in the subgroup. Model parameters were explored systematically. The
   second independent subset was used for validation of successful models.
   Classification accuracies in the large, heterogeneous sample ranged from
   45.0 to 56.1\% (chance level 50.0\%). In the subgroup with higher
   depression severity, three out of 90 models performed significantly
   above chance (60.8-61.7\% at independent validation). In conclusion,
   common classification methods previously successful in small homogenous
   depression samples do not immediately translate to a more realistic
   population. Future research to develop diagnostic classification
   approaches in depression should focus on more specific clinical
   questions and consider heterogeneity, including symptom severity as an
   important factor.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin reduces amygdala responses to threatening social stimuli in

   undergoing fMRI during a social approach-avoidance task. Oxytocin
   decreased amygdala activation during threat approach and not during
   threat avoidance. This neural effect supports oxytocin's social

Abstract = {{Prior studies indicate that anxiety disorders are associated with
   heightened sensitivity to uncertain threat (U threat). Individual
   differences in reactivity to U threat have been measured in the
   laboratory with two methodologiesstartle eyeblink potentiation and fMRI.
   While startle and fMRI are purported to relate to each other, very
   little research exists on whether individual differences in one measure
   are associated with individual differences in another and, thus, whether
   startle and fMRI capture shared mechanisms. Therefore, the current study
   was designed to investigate if and where in the brain measures of
   startle potentiation and fMRI BOLD signal correlate during response to U
   threat across two independent samples. Participants in both studies
   completed two threat anticipation tasks-once during collection of
   startle potentiation and once during fMRI. In Study 1 (n=43), the
   startle and fMRI tasks both used electric shock as the threat. As an
   extension, in Study 2 (n=38), the startle task used electric shock but
   the fMRI task used aversive images. Despite these methodological
   differences, greater startle potentiation to U threat was associated
   with greater dorsal anterior cingulate, caudate, and orbitofrontal
   cortex reactivity to U threat in both samples. The findings suggest that
   startle and fMRI measures of responding to U threat overlap, and points
   toward an integrated brain-behavior profile of aberrant U threat
   responding.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Addicts to specific internet applications involving
   communication features showed increased social anxiety, emotional
   competence deficits and impaired prefrontal-related inhibitory control.
   The dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex (dACC) likely plays an important
   role in cognitive control and negative affect (such as social exclusion,
   pain or anxiety).
   Aim: To assess (social) anxiety-related inhibitory control in specific
   Internet addiction (addicted use of games and social networks) and its
   relation to altered dACC activation.
   Methods: N=44 controls and n=51 specific internet addicts completed an
   anxious words-based Affective Go/No-Go task (AGN). A subsample of n=23
   healthy controls and n=25 specific internet addicts underwent functional
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while completing an Emotional Stroop
   Task (EST) with socially anxious, positive, negative and neutral words.
   Subgroups of internet gaming and social network addicts were
   exploratively assessed. Psychometric measures of social anxiety,
   emotional competence and impulsivity were additionally explored.
   Results: Specific internet addicts showed higher impulsivity, social
   anxiety and reduced emotional competence. Between-group differences in
   AGN and EST behavioral measures were not detected. No group differences
   were found in the dACC, but explorative analyses revealed decreased left
   middle and superior temporal gyrus activation during interference of
   socially anxious words in internet gaming and relative to social network
   addicts.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) encompasses brain systems that exhibit
   coherent neural activity at rest. DMN brain systems have been implicated
   in diverse social, cognitive, and affective processes, as well as risk
   for forms of dementia and psychiatric disorders that associate with
   systemic inflammation. Areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and
   surrounding medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) within the DMN have been
   implicated specifically in regulating autonomic and neuroendocrine
   processes that relate to systemic inflammation via bidirectional
   signaling mechanisms. However, it is still unclear whether indicators of
   inflammation relate directly to coherent resting state activity of the
   ACC, mPFC, or other areas within the DMN. Accordingly, we tested whether
   plasma interleukin (IL)-6, an indicator of systemic inflammation,
   covaried with resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN among 98
   adults aged 30-54 (39\% male; 81\% Caucasian). Independent component
   analyses were applied to resting state fMRI data to generate DMN
   connectivity maps. Voxel-wise regression analyses were then used to test
   for associations between IL -6 and DMN connectivity across individuals,
   controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and fMRI signal motion.
   Within the DMN, IL -6 covaried positively with connectivity of the
   sub-genual ACC and negatively with a region of the dorsal medial PFC at
   corrected statistical thresholds. These novel findings offer evidence
   for a unique association between a marker of systemic inflammation (IL
   -6) and ACC and mPFC functional connectivity within the DMN, a network
   that may be important for linking aspects of immune function to
   psychological and behavioral states in health and disease. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Metacognition refers to a range of cognitive processes that allow one to
   form complex ideas of self and others and to use this information to
   navigate psychosocial challenges. Several studies in both early-phase
   and prolonged schizophrenia have demonstrated not only that significant
   deficits in metacognitive ability are present, but importantly that they
   are associated with significant functional impairment and decreased
   quality of life. In spite of the importance of metacognitive impairment
   in schizophrenia, relatively little is known about the biological
   substrates that may contribute to this dysfunction. In this study, we
   examined the relationship between resting state functional connectivity
   of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a structure shown in prior
   voxel-based morphometry studies to be associated with metacognition,
   with metacognitive function in an early phase psychosis cohort (n=18).
   Analyses revealed a positive association of resting state functional
   connectivity between the mPFC and precuneus and posterior cingulate
   structures and metacognitive ability. These results provide evidence of
   disrupted resting state connectivity in structures relevant to
   metacognitive dysfunction in early-phase psychosis, which may have
   implications for pathophysiological models of complex cognitive deficits
   in this illness.}},

Abstract = {{Increased amygdala activation is consistently found in patients
   suffering from social anxiety disorder (SAD), a psychiatric condition
   characterized by an intense fear of social situations and scrutiny.
   Disruptions in the amygdalar-frontal network in SAD may explain the
   inability of frontal regions to appropriately down-regulate amygdalar
   hyper-activation.
   In this study, we measured 15 SAD patients and 15 healthy controls
   during an affective counting Stroop task with emotional faces to assess
   the interaction of affective stimuli with a cognitive task in SAD, as
   well as to investigate the causal interactions between the amygdala and
   the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) using dynamic causal modeling
   (DCM).
   Here we show for the first time that differences in OFC-amygdala
   effective connectivity between SAD patients and healthy controls are
   influenced by cognitive load during task processing. In SAD patients
   relative to controls dysfunctional amygdala regulation was observed
   during passive viewing of harsh faces This could be linked to ongoing
   self-initiated cognitive processes (such as rumination and anticipation
   of negative events) that hinder successful amygdala regulation. However,
   between-group differences diminished during cognitive processing,
   suggesting that attentional load interfered with emotional processing in
   both patients and controls.}},

Title = {{Neural coding of prior expectations in hierarchical intention inference}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{The ability to infer other people's intentions is crucial for successful
   human social interactions. Such inference relies on an adaptive
   interplay of sensory evidence and prior expectations. Crucially, this
   interplay would also depend on the type of intention inferred, i.e., on
   how abstract the intention is. However, what neural mechanisms adjust
   the interplay of prior and sensory evidence to the abstractness of the
   intention remains conjecture. We addressed this question in two separate
   fMRI experiments, which exploited action scenes depicting different
   types of intentions (Superordinate vs. Basic; Social vs. Non-social),
   and manipulated both prior and sensory evidence. We found that
   participants increasingly relied on priors as sensory evidence became
   scarcer. Activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) reflected this
   interplay between the two sources of information. Moreover, the more
   abstract the intention to infer (Superordinate > Basic, Social >
   Non-Social), the greater the modulation of backward connectivity between
   the mPFC and the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), resulting in an
   increased influence of priors over the intention inference. These
   results suggest a critical role for the fronto-parietal network in
   adjusting the relative weight of prior and sensory evidence during
   hierarchical intention inference.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{During the last years, it has been established that the prefrontal and
   posterior parietal brain lobes, which are mostly related to
   intelligence, have many connections to cerebellum. However, there is a
   limited research investigating cerebellum's relationship with cognitive
   processes. In this study, the network of cerebellum was analyzed in
   order to investigate its overall organization in individuals with low
   and high crystallized Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data were selected from 136 subjects in
   resting-state from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database and were
   further separated into two IQ groups composed of 69 low-IQ and 67
   high-IQ subjects. Cerebellum was parcellated into 28 lobules/ROIs (per
   subject) using a standard cerebellum anatomical atlas. Thereafter,
   correlation matrices were constructed by computing Pearson's correlation
   coefficients between the average BOLD time-series for each pair of ROIs
   inside the cerebellum. By computing conventional graph metrics,
   small-world network properties were verified using the weighted
   clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length for estimating
   the trade-off between segregation and integration. In addition, a
   connectivity metric was computed for extracting the average cost per
   network. The concept of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) was adopted and
   implemented in order to avoid methodological biases in graph comparisons
   and retain only the strongest connections per network. Subsequently, six
   global and three local metrics were calculated in order to retrieve
   useful features concerning the characteristics of each MST. Moreover,
   the local metrics of degree and betweenness centrality were used to
   detect hubs, i.e., nodes with high importance. The computed set of
   metrics gave rise to extensive statistical analysis in order to examine
   differences between low and high-IQ groups, as well as between all
   possible gender-based group combinations. Our results reveal that both
   male and female networks have small-world properties with differences in
   females (especially in higher IQ females) indicative of higher neural
   efficiency in cerebellum. There is a trend toward the same direction in
   men, but without significant differences. Finally, three lobules showed
   maximum correlation with the median response time in low-IQ individuals,
   implying that there is an increased effort dedicated locally by this
   population in cognitive tasks.}},

Month = {{APR 25}},
Abstract = {{Social norms are important for human social interactions, and violations
   of these norms are evaluated partly on the intention of the actor. Here,
   we describe the revised Social Norm Processing Task (SNPT-R), a paradigm
   enabling the study of behavioral and neural responses to intended and
   unintended social norm violations among both adults and adolescents. We
   investigated how participants (adolescents and adults, n = 87) rate
   intentional and unintentional social norm violations with respect to
   inappropriateness and embarrassment, and we examined the brain
   activation patterns underlying the processing of these transgressions in
   an independent sample of 21 adults using functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (fMRI). We hypothesized to find activation within the medial
   prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in
   response to both intentional and unintentional social norm violations,
   with more pronounced activation for the intentional social norm
   violations in these regions and in the amygdala. Participants' ratings
   confirmed the hypothesis that the three types of stories are evaluated
   differently with respect to intentionality: intentional social norm
   violations were rated as the most inappropriate and most embarrassing.
   Furthermore, fMRI results showed that reading stories on intentional and
   unintentional social norm violations evoked activation within the
   frontal pole, the paracingulate gyrus and the superior frontal gyrus. In
   addition, processing unintentional social norm violations was associated
   with activation in, among others, the orbitofrontal cortex, middle
   frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule, while reading intentional
   social norm violations was related to activation in the left amygdala.
   These regions have been previously implicated in thinking about one's
   self, thinking about others and moral reasoning. Together, these
   findings indicate that the SNPT-R could serve as a useful paradigm for
   examining social norm processing, both at the behavioral and the neural
   level.}},

   reportability across behavioral, cognitive and neural measurements of

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Vividness is an aspect of consciousness related to mental imagery and
   prospective episodic memory. Despite being harshly criticized in the
   past for failing to demonstrate robust correlations with behavioral
   measures, currently this construct is attracting a resurgent interest in
   cognitive neuroscience. Therefore, an updated examination of the
   validity of this construct is timely. A corpus of peer-reviewed
   literature was analyzed through meta-analysis, which compared the two
   main formats used to measure vividness {[}trial-by-trial vividness
   ratings (VR) and the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ)].
   These two formats were compared in relation to all available
   behavioral/cognitive (BC) and neuroscience (NS) measures in Phase 1
   (3542 statistical observations representing 393 journal articles); and
   then in relation to all available BC, EEG and fMRI literature in Phase 2
   (3624 observations representing 402 articles). Both Phases observed
   significantly larger effect size estimates (ESEs) for VR than VVIQ, and
   larger ESEs for NS than BC measures. ESEs for EEG and fMRI were not
   significantly different in Phase 2, but were greater than BC ESEs. These
   data suggest VR are a more reliable self-report measure than VVIQ, and
   may reflect a more direct route of reportability than the latter.
   Furthermore, both VR and VVIQ are more strongly associated with the
   neural, than the cognitive and behavioural correlates of imagery. If one
   establishes neuroscience measures as the criterion variable, then
   self-reports of vividness show higher construct validity than
   behavioural/cognitive measures of imagery. We discuss how the present
   findings contribute to current issues on measurement of reportability;
   and how this study advances our understanding of vividness as a
   phenomenological characteristic of imagery, and other forms of conscious
   experience which do not necessarily involve imagery.}},

Abstract = {{Studies employing the Ultimatum Game (UG) which involves two parties
   (i.e., proposers and responders) splitting some money have suggested the
   role that anterior insula (Al) plays in detecting fairness norm
   violation, i.e., violation of the responder's expectation of receiving
   equal splits from the proposer. In this study, we explored how Al would
   respond when there existed simultaneously another expectation of being
   treated equivalently as others. Participants acted as responders and
   would be informed about both the offers they received and the average
   amount of money the same proposer offered to others. Hence we introduced
   different conditions where participants were treated equivalently or not
   equivalently as other responders in UG. Participants could decide to
   accept or reject the offer with acceptance leading to the suggested
   split and rejection leaving both parties nothing. Behavioral results
   showed that participants rejected more unfair offers and reacted more
   slowly during acceptance (vs. rejection) of offers when they were
   offered less than others. At the neural level, stronger Al activation
   was observed when participants received unfair relative to fair offers,
   as well as when they received unequal relative to equal offers.
   Moreover, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (dmPFC/dACC) exhibited greater activity during receiving unequal (vs.
   equal) offers and during acceptance (vs. rejection) of offers which were
   less than others'. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that
   the treatment of others modulated both behavioral responses to
   unfairness and neural correlates of the fairness-related decision-making
   process, and that Al played a general role in detecting norm violations.

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between impulsivity and cognitive control is still
   unknown. We hypothesized that trait impulsivity would differentially
   correlate with specific cognitive control processes. Trait impulsivity
   was measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, which assesses motor,
   attention, and non-planning impulsiveness components. Cognitive control
   was measured by a hybrid-designed Stroop task, which distinguishes
   proactive and reactive control. Thirtythree participants performed the
   Stroop task while they were scanned by functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Proactive and reactive control involved increased activity in
   the fronto-parietal network, and brain activity was associated with
   impulsivity scores. Specifically, higher motor impulsiveness was
   associated with a larger proactive control effect in the inferior
   parietal lobule and a smaller reactive control effect in the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate contex.
   Higher attention impulsivity was associated with a smaller proactive
   control effect in the right DLPFC. Such a correlation pattern suggests
   that impulsivity trait components are attributable to different
   cognitive control subsystems.}},

   traumatic brain injury}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{A somewhat perplexing finding in the systems neuroscience has been the
   observation that physical injury to neural systems may result in
   enhanced functional connectivity (i.e., hyperconnectivity) relative to
   the typical network response. The consequences of local or global
   enhancement of functional connectivity remain uncertain and this is
   particularly true for the overall metabolic cost of the network. We
   examine the hyperconnectivity hypothesis in a sample of 14 individuals
   with TBI with data collected at approximately 3, 6, and 12 months
   following moderate and severe TBI. As anticipated, individuals with TBI
   showed increased network strength and cost early after injury, but by
   one-year post injury hyperconnectivity was more circumscribed to frontal
   DMN and temporal-parietal attentional control regions. Cost in these
   subregions was a significant predictor of cognitive performance.
   Cost-efficiency analysis in the Power 264 data parcellation suggested
   that at 6 months post injury the network requires higher cost
   connections to achieve high efficiency as compared to the network 12
   months post injury. These results demonstrate that networks
   self-organize to re-establish connectivity while balancing
   cost-efficiency trade-offs.}},

Title = {{Intranasal oxytocin enhances intrinsic corticostriatal functional
   connectivity in women}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{Oxytocin may influence various human behaviors and the connectivity
   across subcortical and cortical networks. Previous oxytocin studies are
   male biased and often constrained by task-based inferences. Here, we
   investigate the impact of oxytocin on resting-state connectivity between
   subcortical and cortical networks in women. We collected resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data on 26 typically
   developing women 40 min following intranasal oxytocin administration
   using a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. Independent
   components analysis (ICA) was applied to examine connectivity between
   networks. An independent analysis of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene
   expression in human subcortical and cortical areas was carried out to
   determine plausibility of direct oxytocin effects on OXTR. In women,
   OXTR was highly expressed in striatal and other subcortical regions, but
   showed modest expression in cortical areas. Oxytocin increased
   connectivity between corticostriatal circuitry typically involved in
   reward, emotion, social communication, language and pain processing.
   This effect was 1.39 standard deviations above the null effect of no
   difference between oxytocin and placebo. This oxytocin-related effect on
   corticostriatal connectivity covaried with autistic traits, such that
   oxytocin-related increase in connectivity was stronger in individuals
   with higher autistic traits. In sum, oxytocin strengthened
   corticostriatal connectivity in women, particularly with cortical
   networks that are involved in social-communicative, motivational and
   affective processes. This effect may be important for future work on
   neurological and psychiatric conditions (for example, autism),
   particularly through highlighting how oxytocin may operate differently
   for subsets of individuals.}},

   Connectivity in Asthmatic Patients}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Group cognitive behavior therapy (GCBT) is an effective
   treatment in improving self-management behaviors and quality of life for
   asthmatic patients. However, the mechanisms by which GCBT improves
   asthma-related clinical symptoms remain unknown. Previous studies have
   indicated that insula is an important region involved in the
   neuropathology of asthma. Therefore, we examined the possible alteration
   of functional connectivity (FC) in insula subregions after GCBT in
   asthmatic patients. Methods: Forty-two asthmatic patients and 60 healthy
   controls (HCs) received resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (rs-fMRI) scan and clinical assessments, 17 asthmatic patients
   completed GCBT treatment consisting of 8 sessions, and then received
   rs-fMRI scan and clinical assessments. Results: Asthmatic patients had
   greater left ventral anterior insula (vAI) FC with the left cerebellum
   posterior lobe, right middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), but less FC with bilateral postcentral gyrus,
   bilateral occipital lobe, and left precentral gyrus compared with HCs.
   FC between left posterior insula and left medial frontal gyrus also
   increased in the patients. In addition, right vAI showed increased FC
   with right caudate and left putamen. FC between right dorsal anterior
   insula (dAI) and left calcarine however decreased. The increase in FC in
   insula subregions were significantly improved following GCBT. FC between
   the left vAI connectivity and left postcentral gyrus was positively
   correlated with the percentage of improvement in 17-items Hamilton
   depression rating scale scores, and FC between the right dAI and left
   calcarine was negatively associated with the improvement percentage in
   asthma control test scores. Conclusions: This study in the first time
   demonstrated that GCBT led to significant improvement of FC between
   insula subregions and other brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{Social behavior is often shaped by the rich storehouse of biographical
   information that we hold for other people. In our daily life, we rapidly
   and flexibly retrieve a host of biographical details about individuals
   in our social network, which often guide our decisions as we navigate
   complex social interactions. Even abstract traits associated with an
   individual, such as their political affiliation, can cue a rich cascade
   of person-specific knowledge. Here, we asked whether the anterior
   temporal lobe (ATL) serves as a hub for a distributed neural circuit
   that represents person knowledge. Fifty participants across two studies
   learned biographical information about fictitious people in a 2-d
   training paradigm. On day 3, they retrieved this biographical
   information while undergoing an fMRI scan. A series of multivariate and
   connectivity analyses suggest that the ATL stores abstract person
   identity representations. Moreover, this region coordinates interactions
   with a distributed network to support the flexible retrieval of person

Abstract = {{The correspondence in meaning extracted from written versus spoken input
   remains to be fully understood neurobiologically. Here, in a total of 38
   subjects, the functional anatomy of cross-modal semantic similarity for
   concrete words was determined based on a dual criterion: First, a
   voxelwise univariate analysis had to show significant activation during
   a semantic task (property verification) performed with written and
   spoken concrete words compared to the perceptually matched control
   condition. Second, in an independent dataset, in these clusters, the
   similarity in fMRI response pattern to two distinct entities, one
   presented as a written and the other as a spoken word, had to correlate
   with the similarity in meaning between these entities. The left ventral
   occipitotemporal transition zone and ventromedial temporal cortex,
   retrosplenial cortex, pars orbitalis bilaterally, and the left pars
   triangularis were all activated in the univariate contrast. Only the
   left pars triangularis showed a cross-modal semantic similarity effect.
   There was no effect of phonological nor orthographic similarity in this
   region. The cross-modal semantic similarity effect was confirmed by a
   secondary analysis in the cytoarchitectonically defined BA45. A semantic
   similarity effect was also present in the ventral occipital regions but
   only within the visual modality, and in the anterior superior temporal
   cortex only within the auditory modality. This study provides direct
   evidence for the coding of word meaning in BA45 and positions its
   contribution to semantic processing at the confluence of input-modality
   specific pathways that code for meaning within the respective input
   modalities.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{308-317}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Animal studies suggest that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
   dependent signalling in limbic and prefrontal regions is critically
   involved in both cognitive and emotional functions. In humans,
   ketamine-induced transient, and disorder associated chronic NMDAR
   hypofunction (i.e. in schizophrenia) has been associated with deficient
   performance in the domains of memory and higher-order emotional
   functioning, as well as altered neural activity in the underlying
   limbic-prefrontal circuits. To model the effects of NMDAR hypofunction
   on the integration of emotion and cognition the present pharmacological
   fMRI study applied the NMDAR antagonist ketamine (target plasma
   level=100 ng/ml) to 21 healthy volunteers in a within-subject placebo
   controlled crossover design during encoding of neutral, positive and
   negative pictures. Our results show that irrespective of emotion,
   ketamine suppressed parahippocampal and medial prefrontal activity. In
   contrast, ketamine selectively increased amygdala and orbitofrontal
   activity during successful encoding of negative stimuli. On the network
   level ketamine generally increased medial prefrontal-parahippocampal
   coupling while specifically decreasing amygdala-orbitofrontal interplay
   during encoding of negative stimuli. On the behavioural level, ketamine
   produced generally decreased memory performance and abolished the
   emotional enhancement of memory after a wash-out period of 5 days. The
   present findings suggest that ketamine produces general as well as
   valence-specific effects during emotional memory formation. The pattern
   partly overlaps with alterations previously observed in patients with
   schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Informing the Structure of Executive Function in Children: A
   Meta-Analysis of Functional Neuroimaging Data}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{APR 7}},
Abstract = {{The structure of executive function (EF) has been the focus of much
   debate for decades. What is more, the complexity and diversity provided
   by the developmental period only adds to this contention. The
   development of executive function plays an integral part in the
   expression of children's behavioral, cognitive, social, and emotional
   capabilities. Understanding how these processes are constructed during
   development allows for effective measurement of EF in this population.
   This meta-analysis aims to contribute to a better understanding of the
   structure of executive function in children. A coordinate-based
   meta-analysis was conducted (using BrainMap GingerALE 2.3), which
   incorporated studies administering functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) during inhibition, switching, and working memory updating tasks
   in typical children (aged 6-18 years). The neural activation common
   across all executive tasks was compared to that shared by tasks
   pertaining only to inhibition, switching or updating, which are commonly
   considered to be fundamental executive processes. Results support the
   existence of partially separable but partially overlapping inhibition,
   switching, and updating executive processes at a neural level, in
   children over 6 years. Further, the shared neural activation across all
   tasks (associated with a proposed ``unitary{''} component of executive
   function) overlapped to different degrees with the activation associated
   with each individual executive process. These findings provide evidence
   to support the suggestion that one of the most influential structural
   models of executive functioning in adults can also be applied to
   children of this age. However, the findings also call for careful
   consideration and measurement of both specific executive processes, and
   unitary executive function in this population. Furthermore, a need is
   highlighted for a new systematic developmental model, which captures the
   integrative nature of executive function in children.}},

Abstract = {{The human superior temporal sulcus (STS) is responsive to visual and
   auditory information, including sounds and facial cues during speech
   recognition. We investigated the functional organization of STS with
   respect to modality-specific and multimodal speech representations.
   Twenty younger adult participants were instructed to perform an oddball
   detection task and were presented with auditory, visual, and audiovisual
   speech stimuli, as well as auditory and visual nonspeech control stimuli
   in a block fMRI design. Consistent with a hypothesized
   anterior-posterior processing gradient in STS, auditory, visual and
   audiovisual stimuli produced the largest BOLD effects in anterior,
   posterior and middle STS (mSTS), respectively, based on whole-brain,
   linear mixed effects and principal component analyses. Notably, the mSTS
   exhibited preferential responses to multisensory stimulation, as well as
   speech compared to nonspeech. Within the mid-posterior and mSTS regions,
   response preferences changed gradually from visual, to multisensory, to
   auditory moving posterior to anterior. Post hoc analysis of visual
   regions in the posterior STS revealed that a single subregion bordering
   the mSTS was insensitive to differences in low-level motion kinematics
   yet distinguished between visual speech and nonspeech based on
   multi-voxel activation patterns. These results suggest that auditory and
   visual speech representations are elaborated gradually within anterior
   and posterior processing streams, respectively, and may be integrated
   within the mSTS, which is sensitive to more abstract speech information
   within and across presentation modalities. The spatial organization of
   STS is consistent with processing streams that are hypothesized to
   synthesize perceptual speech representations from sensory signals that
   provide convergent information from visual and auditory modalities.}},

   AMONG THE CHINESE POPULATION}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{347}},
Pages = {{76-84}},

Abstract = {{Expressive suppression is a kind of emotion regulation strategies by
   suppressing behaviors related to emotional responding. Despite the
   amount of behavioral research on expressive suppression, the structural
   and functional mechanisms underlying the interaction between gender and
   expressive suppression in Chinese healthy subjects have remained
   unknown. In the current study, we assessed the levels of expressive
   suppression and acquired the structural and functional imaging data from
   273 Chinese individuals. A nearly automatic cortical processing
   technique was used to calculate cortical thickness for each subject. The
   results from cortical thickness analyses revealed a significant
   interaction between gender and expressive suppression in the superior
   frontal gyrus. Then, we conducted the whole-brain functional
   connectivity analysis with the seed of the superior frontal gyrus to
   explore the functionally related regions of brain. Subsequent analysis
   of the interaction between gender and expressive suppression indicated a
   significant functional connectivity between the superior frontal gyrus
   and default mode network (DMN) core regions, including the medial
   prefrontal cortex, precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus. Our results
   provided the robust empirical evidence illustrating the role of the
   superior frontal gyrus and DMN in gender difference of expressive
   suppression among the Chinese population. These findings might have
   implications for understanding gender difference in emotion processing
   and regulation. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, dominance hierarchies emerge through
   social competition and underlie the control of resources. Confronting
   the disruptive influence of socioeconomic inequalities, human
   populations tend to split into groups who legitimize existing dominance
   hierarchies and groups who condemn them. Here, we hypothesized that
   variations in the neural sensitivity to dominance ranks partly underpins
   this ideological split, as measured by the social dominance orientation
   scale (SDO). Following a competitive task used to induce dominance
   representations about three opponents (superior, equal and inferior),
   subjects were passively presented the faces of these opponents while
   undergoing fMRI. Analyses demonstrated that two key brain regions, the
   superior temporal sulcus (STS) and anterior dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (aDLPFC) were sensitive to social ranks. Confirming our
   hypothesis, the sensitivity of the right aDLPFC to social ranks
   correlated positively with the SDO scale, which is known to predict
   behaviors and political attitudes associated with the legitimization of
   dominance hierarchies. This study opens new perspectives for the
   neurosciences of political orientation and social dominance.}},

Abstract = {{Animal models and human neuroimaging studies suggest that altered levels
   of glutamatergic metabolites within a corticolimbic circuit have a major
   role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Rodent models propose that
   prefrontal glutamate dysfunction could lead to amygdala hyper-response
   to environmental stress and underlie hippocampal overdrive in
   schizophrenia. Here we determine whether changes in brain glutamate are
   present in individuals with high schizotypy (HS), which refers to the
   presence of schizophrenia-like characteristics in healthy individuals,
   and whether glutamate levels are related to altered corticolimbic
   response to emotion. Twenty-one healthy HS subjects and 22 healthy
   subjects with low schizotypy (LS) were selected based on their Oxford
   and Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences rating. Glutamate
   levels were measured in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using proton
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy, followed by a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) scan to measure corticolimbic response during
   emotional processing. fMRI results and fMRI x glutamate interactions
   were considered significant after voxel-wise P < 0.05 family-wise error
   correction. While viewing emotional pictures, HS individuals showed
   greater activation than did subjects with LS in the caudate, and
   marginally in the ACC, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and
   putamen. Although no between-group differences were found in glutamate
   concentrations, within the HS group ACC glutamate was negatively
   correlated with striatal activation (left: z = 4.30, P = 0.004 and
   right: z = 4.12 P = 0.008 caudate; left putamen: z = 3.89, P = 0.018)
   and marginally with MPFC (z = 3.55, P = 0.052) and amygdala (left: z =
   2.88, P = 0.062; right: z = 2.79, P = 0.079), correlations that were not
   present in LS subjects. These findings provide, to our knowledge, the
   first evidence that brain glutamate levels are associated with
   hyper-responsivity in brain regions thought to be critical in the
   pathophysiology of psychosis.}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by aberrant prefrontal
   activity during reappraisal, an adaptive cognitive approach aimed at
   downregulating the automatic response evoked by a negative event
   Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is first-line psychotherapy for SAD,
   however, many remain symptomatic after treatment indicating baseline
   individual differences in neurofunctional activity may factor into CBT
   outcome. An emotion regulation strategy practiced in CBT is cognitive
   restructuring, a proxy for reappraisal. Therefore, neural response
   during reappraisal may serve as a brain-based predictor of CBT success.
   Prior to 12 weeks of individual CBT, 34 patients with SAD completed a
   validated emotion regulation task during fMRL Task instructions included
   `Reappraise,' that is, use a cognitive approach to reduce affective
   state to a negative image, which was contrasted with looking at a
   negative image ('Look'). Regression results for Reappraise (vs. Look)
   revealed greater reduction in symptom severity was predicted by less
   pre-CBT activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
   Regarding predictive validity, DLPFC significantly classified responder
   status. Post-hoc analysis revealed DLPFC activity, but not demographic
   data, baseline clinical measures, or reappraisal-related affective state
   during fMRI, significantly accounted for the variance in symptom
   reduction. Findings indicate patients with SAD are more likely to
   benefit from CBT if there is less pre-treatment DLPFC recruitment, a
   region strongly implicated in emotion regulation. Patients with reduced
   baseline frontal activation when reappraising negative stimuli may be
   especially helped by explicit cognitive interventions. Further research
   is necessary to establish DLPFC as a stable brain based marker of
   treatment outcome. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The influence of 5-HTTLPR transporter genotype on amygdala-subgenual

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Social deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are linked to amygdala
   functioning and functional connection between the amygdala and subgenual
   anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) is involved in the modulation of
   amygdala activity. Impairments in behavioral symptoms and amygdala
   activation and connectivity with the sACC seem to vary by serotonin
   transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) variant genotype in
   diverse populations. The current preliminary investigation examines
   whether amygdala-sACC connectivity differs by 5-HTTLPR genotype and
   relates to social functioning in ASD. A sample of 108 children and
   adolescents (44 ASD) completed an fMRI face-processing task. Youth with
   ASD and low expressing 5-HTTLPR genotypes showed significantly greater
   connectivity than youth with ASD and higher expressing genotypes as well
   as typically developing (TD) individuals with both low and higher
   expressing genotypes, in the comparison of happy vs. baseline faces and
   happy vs. neutral faces. Moreover, individuals with ASD and higher
   expressing genotypes exhibit a negative relationship between
   amygdala-sACC connectivity and social dysfunction. Altered amygdala-sACC
   coupling based on 5-HTTLPR genotype may help explain some of the
   heterogeneity in neural and social function observed in ASD. This is the
   first ASD study to combine genetic polymorphism analyses and functional
   connectivity in the context of a social task. (c) 2016 The Authors.

Journal = {{DEVELOPMENTAL COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{84-92}},

Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging studies have suggested divergent relationships
   between antisocial behavior (AB) and callous-unemotional (CU) traits and
   amygdala reactivity to fearful and angry facial expressions in
   adolescents. However, little work has examined if these findings extend
   to dimensional measures of behavior in ethnically diverse, non-clinical
   samples, or if participant sex, ethnicity, pubertal stage, and age
   moderate associations. We examined links between amygdala reactivity and
   dimensions of AB and CU traits in 220 Hispanic and non-Hispanic
   Caucasian adolescents (age 11-15; 49.5\% female; 38.2\% Hispanic), half
   of whom had a family history for depression and thus were at relatively
   elevated risk for late starting, emotionally dysregulated AB. We found
   that AB was significantly related to increased right amygdala reactivity
   to angry facial expressions independent of sex, ethnicity, pubertal
   stage, age, and familial risk status for depression. CU traits were not
   related to fear- or anger-related amygdala reactivity. The present study
   further demonstrates that AB is related to increased amygdala reactivity
   to interpersonal threat cues in adolescents, and that this relationship
   generalizes across sex, ethnicity, pubertal stage, age, and familial
   risk status for depression. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Being accepted or rejected by peers is highly salient for developing
   social relations in childhood. We investigated the behavioral and neural
   correlates of social feedback and subsequent aggression in 7-10-year-old
   children, using the Social Network Aggression Task (SNAT). Participants
   viewed pictures of peers that gave positive, neutral or negative
   feedback to the participant's profile. Next, participants could blast
   aloud noise towards the peer, as an index of aggression. We included
   three groups (N = 19, N = 28 and N = 27) and combined the results
   meta-analytically. Negative social feedback resulted in the most
   behavioral aggression, with large combined effect-sizes. Whole brain
   condition effects for each separate sample failed to show robust
   effects, possibly due to the small samples. Exploratory analyses over
   the combined test and replication samples confirmed heightened
   activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) after negative social
   feedback. Moreover, meta-analyses of activity in predefined regions of
   interest showed that negative social feedback resulted in more neural
   activation in the amygdala, anterior insula and the mPFC/anterior
   cingulate cortex. Together, the results show that social motivation is
   already highly salient in middle childhood, and indicate that the SNAT
   is a valid paradigm for assessing the neural and behavioral correlates
   of social evaluation in children. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by

Journal = {{IRANIAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a
   non-invasive and convenient method of mapping brain activity associated
   with the human sensory systems. Among these systems there is a lack of
   data from olfactory studies, which could be attributed to technical
   difficulties in odor delivery during scanning. The current study took
   advantage of an olfactometer to evaluate brain activity during the
   odor-smelling process.
   Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the brain regions of the
   human olfactory system via fMRI brain imaging. A speculative survey was
   used to highlight the differences between studies conducted in healthy
   populations using olfactory tasks, as well as conducting literature
   survey in terms of the technical principles applying through these tasks
   in fMRI studies.
   Subjects and Methods: A functional map of the olfactory system that used
   a block design, alternating between odor and non-odor phases, was
   examined in 15 healthy volunteers. The general linear model was used to
   identify statistically significant voxels that showed activation during
   the activation blocks.
   Results: Primary and secondary olfactory regions, including the
   piriformis, insula, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, caudate nucleus,
   inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus,
   and cerebellum, demonstrated significant activation in response to odor
   stimulation.
   Conclusion: Activation of the aforementioned brain areas, and the
   pattern of activation, is largely in accordance with previous published
   olfactory studies carried out in healthy individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Negative emotions such as anxiety enhance pain perception. However,
   certain threat characteristics are discussed to have different or even
   divergent effects on pain (hypoalgesia vs hyperalgesia). In order to
   investigate the neurobiological basis of different threats, we compared
   the impact of conditioned threat (CT) vs instructed threat (IT) on pain
   using fMRI. In two groups, participants underwent either Pavlovian
   threat conditioning or an instructed threat procedure. Afterwards, in an
   identical test phase participants watched the same visual cues from the
   previous phase indicating potential threat or safety, and received
   painful thermal stimulation. In the test phase, pain ratings were
   increased in both groups under threat. Group comparisons show elevated
   responses in amygdala and hippocampus for pain under threat in the CT
   group, and higher activation of the mid-cingulate gyrus (MCC) in the IT
   group. Psychophysiological interaction analyses in CT demonstrated
   elevated connectivity of the amygdala and the insula for the comparison
   of pain under threat vs safety. In IT, the same comparison revealed
   elevated functional connectivity of the MCC and the insula. The results
   suggest a similar pain augmenting effect of CT and IT, which, however,
   seems to rely on different networks mediating the impact of threat on
   pain.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to voluntarily regulate our emotional response to
   threatening and highly arousing stimuli by using cognitive reappraisal
   strategies is essential for our mental and physical well-being. This
   might be achieved by prefrontal brain regions (e.g. inferior frontal
   gyrus, IFG) down-regulating activity in the amygdala. It is unknown, to
   which degree effective connectivity within the emotion-regulation
   network is linked to individual differences in reappraisal skills. Using
   psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging data, we examined changes in inter-regional
   connectivity between the amygdala and IFG with other brain regions
   during reappraisal of emotional responses and used emotion regulation
   success as an explicit regressor. During down-regulation of emotion,
   reappraisal success correlated with effective connectivity between IFG
   with dorsolateral, dorsomedial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC).
   During up-regulation of emotion, effective coupling between IFG with
   anterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial and ventromedial PFC as well as
   the amygdala correlated with reappraisal success. Activity in the
   amygdala covaried with activity in lateral and medial prefrontal regions
   during the up-regulation of emotion and correlated with reappraisal
   success. These results suggest that successful reappraisal is linked to
   changes in effective connectivity between two systems, prefrontal
   cognitive control regions and regions crucially involved in emotional
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals differ in their motives and strategies to cooperate in
   social dilemmas. These differences are reflected by an individual's
   social value orientation: proselfs are strategic and motivated to
   maximize self-interest, while prosocials are more trusting and value
   fairness. We hypothesize that when deciding whether or not to cooperate
   with a random member of a defined group, proselfs, more than prosocials,
   adapt their decisions based on past experiences: they `learn'
   instrumentally to form a base-line expectation of reciprocity. We
   conducted an fMRI experiment where participants (19 proselfs and 19
   prosocials) played 120 sequential prisoner's dilemmas against randomly
   selected, anonymous and returning partners who cooperated 60\% of the
   time. Results indicate that cooperation levels increased over time, but
   that the rate of learning was steeper for proselfs than for prosocials.
   At the neural level, caudate and precuneus activation were more
   pronounced for proselfs relative to prosocials, indicating a stronger
   reliance on instrumental learning and self-referencing to update their
   trust in the cooperative strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Social learning is fundamental to human interactions, yet its
   computational and physiological mechanisms are not well understood. One
   prominent open question concerns the role of neuromodulatory
   transmitters. We combined fMRI, computational modelling and genetics to
   address this question in two separate samples (N = 35, N = 47).
   Participants played a game requiring inference on an adviser's
   intentions whose motivation to help or mislead changed over time. Our
   analyses suggest that hierarchically structured belief updates about
   current advice validity and the adviser's trustworthiness, respectively,
   depend on different neuromodulatory systems. Low-level prediction errors
   (PEs) about advice accuracy not only activated regions known to support
   `theory of mind', but also the dopaminergic midbrain. Furthermore, PE
   responses in ventral striatum were influenced by the Met/Val
   polymorphism of the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene. By
   contrast, high-level PEs ('expected uncertainty') about the adviser's
   fidelity activated the cholinergic septum. These findings, replicated in
   both samples, have important implications: They suggest that social
   learning rests on hierarchically related PEs encoded by midbrain and
   septum activity, respectively, in the same manner as other forms of
   learning under volatility. Furthermore, these hierarchical PEs may be
   broadcast by dopaminergic and cholinergic projections to induce
   plasticity specifically in cortical areas known to represent beliefs
   about others.}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that as cognitive demands of a non-emotional task
   increase, amygdala response to task-irrelevant emotional stimuli is
   reduced. However, it remains unclear whether effects are due to altered
   task demands, or altered perceptual input associated with task demands.
   Here, we present fMRI data from 20 adult males during a novel cognitive
   conflict task in which the requirement to scan emotional information was
   necessary for task performance and held constant across levels of
   cognitive conflict. Response to fearful facial expressions was
   attenuated under high (vs low) conflict conditions, as indexed by both
   slower reaction times and reduced right amygdala response.
   Psychophysiological interaction analysis showed that increased amygdala
   response to fear in the low conflict condition was accompanied by
   increased functional coupling with middle frontal gyrus, a prefrontal
   region previously associated with emotion regulation during cognitive
   task performance. These data suggest that amygdala response to emotion
   is modulated as a function of task demands, even when perceptual inputs
   are closely matched across load conditions. PPI data also show that, in
   particular emotional contexts, increased functional coupling of amygdala
   with prefrontal cortex can paradoxically occur when executive demands
   are lower.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical intolerance is a medically unexplained affliction that implies
   deleterious reactions to non-toxic everyday chemical exposure.
   Sensitization (i.e. increased reactivity to repeated, invariant
   stimulation) to odorous stimulation is an important component in
   theoretical explanations of chemical intolerance, but empirical evidence
   is scarce. We hypothesized that (1) individuals who sensitize to
   repeated olfactory stimulation, compared with those who habituate, would
   express a lower blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) response in key
   inhibitory areas such as the rACC, and higher signal in pain/saliency
   detection regions, as well as primary and/or secondary olfactory
   projection areas; and (2) olfactory sensitization, compared with
   habituation, would be associated with greater self-reported chemical
   intolerance. More-over, we assessed whether olfactory sensitization was
   paralleled by comparable trigeminal processing - in terms of perceptual
   ratings and BOLD responses. We grouped women from a previous functional
   magnetic imaging study based on intensity ratings of repeated amyl
   acetate exposure over time. Fourteen women sensitized to the exposure,
   15 habituated, and 20 were considered ``intermediate{''} (i.e. neither
   sensitizers nor habituaters). Olfactory sensitizers, compared with
   habituaters, displayed a BOLD-pattern in line with the hypothesis, and
   reported greater problems with odours in everyday life. They also
   expressed greater reactions to CO2 in terms of both perceived intensity
   and BOLD signal. The similarities with pain are discussed. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Understanding the neural processes that underlie learning to read can
   provide a scientific foundation for literacy education but studying
   these processes in real-world contexts remains challenging. We present
   behavioural data from adult participants learning to read artificial
   words and name artificial objects over two days. Learning profiles and
   generalisation confirmed that componential learning of visual-verbal
   associations distinguishes reading from object naming. Functional MRI
   data collected on the second day allowed us to identify the neural
   systems that support componential reading as distinct from systems
   supporting holistic visual-verbal associations in object naming. Results
   showed increased activation in posterior ventral occipitotemporal (vOT),
   parietal, and frontal cortices when reading an artificial orthography
   compared to naming artificial objects, and the reverse profile in
   anterior vOT regions. However, activation differences between trained
   and untrained words were absent, suggesting a lack of cortical
   representations for whole words. Despite this, hippocampal responses
   provided some evidence for overnight consolidation of both words and
   objects learned on day 1. The comparison between neural activity for
   artificial words and objects showed extensive overlap with systems
   differentially engaged for real object naming and English
   word/pseudoword reading in the same participants. These findings
   therefore provide evidence that artificial learning paradigms offer an
   alternative method for studying the neural systems supporting language
   and literacy. Implications for literacy acquisition are discussed.}},

Title = {{Within vs. between-subject effects of intranasal oxytocin on the neural
   response to cooperative and non-cooperative social interactions}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{22-30}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) plays a critical role in modulating
   social behavior across a wide range of vertebrate species. In humans,
   intranasal oxytocin (INOT) has been shown to modulate various aspects of
   social behavior, such as empathy, trust, in-group preference, and memory
   of socially relevant cues. Most INOT studies employ cross-sectional
   designs despite the enhanced statistical power and reduction in error
   variance associated with individual differences characteristic of
   within-subject designs. Using the Prisoner Dilemma task, which models a
   real-life dyadic social interaction, our group has systematically
   explored the effect of INOT on social cooperation and non-cooperation
   using a cross-sectional design. In the current study, we investigated if
   the main findings from our cross-sectional study could be replicated in
   a within-subject design using the same paradigm and whether new findings
   would emerge. We found OT to attenuate the ventral tegmental area
   response to reciprocated cooperation in women, an effect that is also
   present in our cross-sectional sample. However, other cross-sectional
   findings, especially those found in men, were not observed in this
   within-subject study. We hypothesize that the discrepancy can be
   explained by differing OT effects based on the degree of stimulus
   novelty/familiarity. Our within-subject study also revealed new effects
   not found previously in our cross-sectional study. Most importantly, OT
   treatment on scan 2 blocked amygdala habituation to unreciprocated
   cooperation found in a group that received placebo on both scans among
   men. Our results suggest that exogenous OT reduces the salience of
   positive social interactions among women and prevents habituation to
   negative social interactions among men. These findings may have
   implications for the potential clinical utility of OT as a treatment for
   psychiatric disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The burden of conscientiousness? Examining brain activation and cortisol
   response during social evaluative stress}},
Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{48-56}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Although conscientiousness has for a long time been considered generally
   adaptive, there are findings challenging this view, suggesting that
   conscientiousness might be less advantageous during uncontrollable
   stress. We here examined the impact of conscientiousness on brain
   activation during and the cortisol response following an uncontrollable
   social evaluative stress task in order to test this hypothesis.
   Brain activation and cortisol levels were measured during an fMRI stress
   task, where subjects (n=86) performed cognitive tasks containing
   preprogrammed failure under time pressure, while being monitored by a
   panel of experts inducing social-evaluative threat. The degree of
   conscientiousness was measured using the NEO-FFI.
   We observed a positive correlation between conscientiousness and
   salivary cortisol levels in response to the stressful task in male
   subjects only. In male subjects conscientiousness correlated positively
   with activation in right amygdala and left insula, and, moreover,
   mediated the influence of amygdala and insula activation on cortisol
   output. This pattern of brain activation can be interpreted as a
   disadvantageous response to uncontrollable stress to which highly
   conscientious individuals might be predisposed.
   This is the first study showing the effect of conscientiousness on
   physiology and brain activation to an uncontrollable psychosocial
   stressor. Our results provide neurobiological evidence for the
   hypothesis that conscientiousness should not just be seen as beneficial,
   but rather as a trait associated with either costs or benefits depending
   on the extent to which one is in control of the situation. (C) 2017

Title = {{Neural evidence for phonologically based language production deficits in
   older adults: An fMRI investigation of age-related differences in
   picture-word interference}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{IntroductionOlder adults often show declines in phonological aspects of
   language production, particularly for low-frequency words, but maintain
   strong semantic systems. However, there are different theories about the
   mechanism that may underlie such age-related differences in language
   (e.g., age-related declines in transmission of activation or
   inhibition).
   MethodsThis study used fMRI to investigate whether age-related
   differences in language production are associated with transmission
   deficits or inhibition deficits. We used the picture-word interference
   paradigm to examine age-related differences in picture naming as a
   function of both target frequency and the relationship between the
   target picture and distractor word.
   ResultsWe found that the presence of a categorically related distractor
   led to greater semantic elaboration by older adults compared to younger
   adults, as evidenced by older adults' increased recruitment of regions
   including the left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral precuneus. When
   presented with a phonologically related distractor, patterns of neural
   activation are consistent with previously observed age deficits in
   phonological processing, including age-related reductions in the
   recruitment of regions such as the left middle temporal gyrus and right
   supramarginal gyrus. Lastly, older, but not younger, adults show
   increased brain activation of the pre- and postcentral gyri as a
   function of decreasing target frequency when target pictures are paired
   with a phonological distractor, suggesting that cuing the phonology of
   the target disproportionately aids production of low-frequency items.
   ConclusionsOverall, this pattern of results is generally consistent with
   the transmission deficit hypothesis, illustrating that links within the
   phonological system, but not the semantic system, are weakened with age.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) circuit plays a key role in
   emotional processing. GABA-ergic inhibition within the mPFC has been
   suggested to play a role in the shaping of amygdala activity. However,
   the functional and neurochemical interactions within the amygdala-mPFC
   circuits and their relevance to emotional processing remain unclear. To
   investigate this circuit, we obtained resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and proton MR spectroscopy in 21 healthy
   subjects to assess the potential relationship between GABA levels within
   mPFC and the amygdala-mPFC functional connectivity. Trait anxiety was
   assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y2). Partial
   correlations were used to measure the relationships among the functional
   connectivity outcomes, mPFC GABA levels and STAI-Y2 scores. Age,
   educational level and amount of the gray and white matters within
   H-1-MRS volume of interest were included as nuisance variables. The
   rs-fMRI signals of the amygdala and the vmPFC were significantly
   anti-correlated. This negative functional coupling between the two
   regions was inversely correlated with the GABA+/tCr level within the
   mPFC and the STAI-Y2 scores. We suggest a close relationship between
   mPFC GABA levels and functional interactions within the amygdala-vmPFC
   circuit, providing new insights in the physiology of emotion.}},

Abstract = {{For more than 15 years, motor interference paradigms have been used to
   investigate the influence of action observation on action execution.
   Most research on so-called automatic imitation has focused on variables
   that play a modulating role or investigated potential confounding
   factors. Interestingly, furthermore, a number of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have tried to shed light on the
   functional mechanisms and neural correlates involved in imitation
   inhibition. However, these fMRI studies, presumably due to poor temporal
   resolution, have primarily focused on high-level processes and have
   neglected the potential role of low-level motor and perceptual
   processes. In the current EEG study, we therefore aimed to disentangle
   the influence of low-level perceptual and motoric mechanisms from
   high-level cognitive mechanisms. We focused on potential congruency
   differences in the visual N190 - a component related to the processing
   of biological motion, the Readiness Potential - a component related to
   motor preparation, and the high-level P3 component. Interestingly, we
   detected congruency effects in each of these components, suggesting that
   the interference effect in an automatic imitation paradigm is not only
   related to high-level processes such as self-other distinction but also
   to more low-level influences of perception on action and action on
   perception. Moreover, we documented relationships of the neural effects
   with (autistic) behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Recognizing the identity of a person is fundamental to guide social
   interactions. We can recognize the identity of a person looking at her

   how visual and auditory information come together, enabling us to
   recognize identity independently of the modality of the stimulus. This
   study reports converging evidence across univariate contrasts and
   multivariate classification showing that the posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (pSTS), previously known to encode polymodal visual and auditory
   representations, encodes information about person identity with
   invariance within and across modality. In particular, pSTS shows
   selectivity for faces, selectivity for voices, classification of face
   identity across image transformations within the visual modality, and
   classification of person identity across modality. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {{Oxytocin differentially alters resting state functional connectivity
   between amygdala subregions and emotional control networks: Inverse
   correlation with depressive traits}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{458-467}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has received increasing
   attention for its role in modulating social-emotional processes across
   species. Previous studies on using intranasal-OT in humans point to a
   crucial engagement of the amygdala in the observed neuromodulatory
   effects of OT under task and rest conditions. However, the amygdala is
   not a single homogenous structure, but rather a set of structurally and
   functionally heterogeneous nuclei that show distinct patterns of
   connectivity with limbic and frontal emotion-processing regions. To
   determine potential differential effects of OT on functional
   connectivity of the amygdala subregions, 79 male participants underwent
   resting-state fMRI following randomized intranasal-OT or placebo
   administration. In line with previous studies OT increased the
   connectivity of the total amygdala with dorso-medial prefrontal regions
   engaged in emotion regulation. In addition, OT enhanced coupling of the
   total amygdala with cerebellar regions. Importantly, OT differentially
   altered the connectivity of amygdala subregions with distinct up-stream
   cortical nodes, particularly prefrontal/parietal, and cerebellar
   down-stream regions. OT-induced increased connectivity with cerebellar
   regions were largely driven by effects on the centromedial and
   basolateral subregions, whereas increased connectivity with prefrontal
   regions were largely mediated by right superficial and basolateral
   subregions. OT decreased connectivity of the centromedial subregions
   with core hubs of the emotional face processing network in temporal,
   occipital and parietal regions. Preliminary findings suggest that
   effects on the superficial amygdala-prefrontal pathway were inversely
   associated with levels of subclinical depression, possibly indicating
   that OT modulation may be blunted in the context of increased
   pathological load. Together, the present findings suggest a
   subregional-specific modulatory role of OT on amygdala-centered emotion
   processing networks in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are known to be characterized by
   restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests and by impairments in
   social communication and interactions mainly including ``theory of
   mind{''} (ToM) processes. The cerebellum has emerged as one of the brain
   regions affected by ASDs. As the cerebellum is known to influence
   cerebral cortex activity via cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) circuits,
   it has been proposed that cerebello-cortical ``disconnection{''} could
   in part underlie autistic symptoms. We used resting-state (RS)
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the
   potential RS connectivity changes between the cerebellar dentate nucleus
   (DN) and the CTC circuit targets, that may contribute to ASD
   pathophysiology. When comparing ASD patients to controls, we found
   decreased connectivity between the left DN and cerebral regions known to
   be components of the ToM network and the default mode network,
   implicated in specific aspects of mentalizing, social cognition
   processing, and higher order emotional processes. Further, a pattern of
   overconnectivity was also detected between the left DN and the
   supramodal cerebellar lobules associated with the default mode network.
   The presented RS-fMRI data provide evidence that functional connectivity
   (FC) between the dentate nucleus and the cerebral cortex is altered in
   ASD patients. This suggests that the dysfunction reported within the
   cerebral cortical network, typically related to social features of ASDs,
   may be at least partially related to an impaired interaction between
   cerebellum and key cortical social brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{The neural basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not yet
   understood. ASD is marked by social deficits and is strongly associated
   with cerebellar abnormalities. We studied the organization and
   cerebellar connectivity of the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), an area
   that plays a crucial role in social cognition. We applied localized
   independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data from autistic
   and neurotypical adolescents to yield an unbiased parcellation of the
   bilateral TPJ into 11 independent components (ICs). A comparison between
   neurotypical and autistic adolescents showed that the organization of
   the TPJ was not significantly altered in ASD. Second, we used the time
   courses of the TPJ ICs as spatially unbiased ``seeds{''} for a
   functional connectivity analysis applied to voxels within the
   cerebellum. We found that the cerebellum contained a fine-grained,
   lateralized map of the TPJ. The connectivity of the TPJ subdivisions
   with cerebellar zones showed one striking difference in ASD. The right
   dorsal TPJ showed markedly less connectivity with the left Crus II.
   Disturbed cerebellar input to this key region for cognition and
   multimodal integration may contribute to social deficits in ASD. The
   findings might also suggest that the right TPJ and/or left Crus II are
   potential targets for noninvasive brain stimulation therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an illness that frequently begins during
   adolescence and involves weight loss. Two groups of adolescent girls
   (AN-A, weight-recovered following AN) and (HC-A, healthy comparison)
   completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging task involving social
   evaluations, allowing comparison of neural activations during
   self-evaluations, friend-evaluations, and perspective-taking self
   evaluations. Although the two groups were not different in their
   whole-brain activations, anxiety and body shape concerns were correlated
   with neural activity in a priori regions of interest. A cluster in
   medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate correlated
   with the body shape questionnaire; subjects with more body shape
   concerns used this area less during self than friend evaluations. A
   cluster in medial prefrontal cortex and the cingulate also correlated
   with anxiety such that more anxiety was associated with engagement when
   disagreeing rather than agreeing with social terms during self
   evaluations. This data suggests that differences in the utilization of
   frontal brain regions during social evaluations may contribute to both
   anxiety and body shape concerns in adolescents with AN. Clinical
   follow-up was obtained, allowing exploration of whether brain function
   early in course of disease relates to illness trajectory. The
   adolescents successful in recovery used the posterior cingulate and
   precuneus more for friend than self evaluations than the adolescents
   that remained ill, suggesting that neural differences related to social
   evaluations may provide clinical predictive value. Utilization of both
   MPFC and the precuneus during social and self evaluations may be a key
   biological component for achieving sustained weight-recovery in
   adolescents with AN. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AimsTo (1) test if activation in brain regions related to reward
   (nucleus accumbens) and emotion (amygdala) differ when branded and plain
   packs of cigarettes are viewed, (2) test whether these activation
   patterns differ by smoking status and (3) examine whether activation
   patterns differ as a function of visual attention to health warning
   labels on cigarette packs.
   DesignCross-sectional observational study combining functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) with eye-tracking. Non-smokers, weekly smokers
   and daily smokers performed a memory task on branded and plain cigarette
   packs with pictorial health warnings presented in an event-related
   design.
   SettingClinical Research and Imaging Centre, University of Bristol, UK.
   ParticipantsNon-smokers, weekly smokers and daily smokers (n=72) were
   tested. After exclusions, data from 19 non-smokers, 19 weekly smokers
   and 20 daily smokers were analysed.
   MeasurementsBrain activity was assessed in whole brain analyses and in
   pre-specified masked analyses in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens.
   On-line eye-tracking during scanning recorded visual attention to health
   warnings.
   FindingsThere was no evidence for a main effect of pack type or smoking
   status in either the nucleus accumbens or amygdala, and this was
   unchanged when taking account of visual attention to health warnings.
   However, there was evidence for an interaction, such that we observed
   increased activation in the right amygdala when viewing branded as
   compared with plain packs among weekly smokers (P=0.003). When taking
   into account visual attention to health warnings, we observed higher
   levels of activation in the visual cortex in response to plain packaging
   compared with branded packaging of cigarettes (P=0.020).
   ConclusionsBased on functional magnetic resonance imaging and
   eye-tracking data, health warnings appear to be more salient on plain'
   cigarette packs than branded packs.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals differ in their tendency to perceive negativity in ambiguous
   situations or facial expressions. Prior research demonstrates that this
   so-called ``negativity bias{''} is exaggerated in children; for
   instance, when they rate the emotional content of neutral facial
   expressions. However, neutral faces are frequently used as a baseline
   condition in pediatric emotion processing studies, as they are thought
   to be emotionally neutral. Here, we present data that challenge that
   notion. We demonstrate that children and adolescents rate neutral faces,
   particularly of adults, as negative, similar to ratings elicited by
   angry faces. In addition, we found a lack of age-related decrease in
   reaction time for neutral adult faces, suggesting that these stimuli
   remain salient across development. Demonstrating the relevance of
   individual differences, higher negativity bias was associated with lower
   self-reported reward sensitivity and increased functional connectivity
   of the amygdala. Together, these findings indicate that neutral faces
   are not perceived as emotionally neutral in children, thus discouraging
   their use as baseline condition in pediatric research. These data also
   offer a potential neurobiological substrate of the negativity bias in
   children. The link to corticolimbic emotion-processing circuitry and
   affective experience implies that exaggerations in these biases may be
   relevant for the development of emotional psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in psychiatry use
   various tasks to identify case-control differences in the patterns of
   task-related brain activation. Differently activated regions are often
   ascribed disorder-specific functions in an attempt to link disease
   expression and brain function. We undertook a systematic meta-analysis
   of data from task-fMRI studies to examine the effect of diagnosis and
   study design on the spatial distribution and direction of case-control
   differences on brain activation. We mapped to atlas regions coordinates
   of case-control differences derived from 537 task-fMRI studies in
   schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety
   disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder comprising observations
   derived from 21,427 participants. The fMRI tasks were classified
   according to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). We investigated
   whether diagnosis, RDoC domain or construct and use of
   regions-of-interest or whole-brain analyses influenced the
   neuroanatomical pattern of results. When considering all primary
   studies, we found an effect of diagnosis for the amygdala and caudate
   nucleus and an effect of RDoC domains and constructs for the amygdala,
   hippocampus, putamen and nucleus accumbens. In contrast, whole-brain
   studies did not identify any significant effect of diagnosis or RDoC
   domain or construct. These results resonate with prior reports of common
   brain structural and genetic underpinnings across these disorders and
   caution against attributing undue specificity to brain functional
   changes when forming explanatory models of psychiatric disorders. (C)

   years old), characterizing cerebellar response and BIO > SCRAM-selective
   effective connectivity, as well as associations with age and social
   ability. TD individuals recruited regions throughout cerebellar
   posterior lobe during BIO > SCRAM, especially bilateral lobule VI, and
   demonstrated connectivity with right posterior superior temporal sulcus

   SCRAM activity in left VI and left Crus I/II, and bilateral connectivity
   with RpSTS in Crus I/II and VIIIb/IX. No between-group differences

Abstract = {{We conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a visual
   search paradigm to test the hypothesis that aging is associated with
   increased frontoparietal involvement in both target detection and
   bottom-up attentional guidance (featural salience). Participants were 68
   healthy adults, distributed continuously across 19 to 78 years of age.
   Frontoparietal regions of interest (ROIs) were defined from
   resting-state scans obtained prior to task-related fMRI. The search
   target was defined by a conjunction of color and orientation. Each
   display contained one item that was larger than the others (i.e., a size
   singleton) but was not informative regarding target identity. Analyses
   of search reaction time (RT) indicated that bottom-up attentional
   guidance from the size singleton (when coincident with the target) was
   relatively constant as a function of age. Frontoparietal fMRI activation
   related to target detection was constant as a function of age, as was
   the reduction in activation associated with salient targets. However,
   for individuals 35 years of age and older, engagement of the left
   frontal eye field (FEF) in bottom-up guidance was more prominent than
   for younger individuals. Further, the agerelated differences in left FEF
   activation were a consequence of decreasing resting-state functional
   connectivity in visual sensory regions. These findings indicate that
   age-related compensatory effects may be expressed in the relation
   between activation and behavior, rather than in the magnitude of
   activation, and that relevant changes in the activation-RT relation may
   begin at a relatively early point in adulthood. (C) 2017 Wiley

   a Foreign Language in Adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Children naturally acquire a language in social contexts where they
   interact with their caregivers. Indeed, research shows that social
   interaction facilitates lexical and phonological development at the
   early stages of child language acquisition. It is not clear, however,
   whether the relationship between social interaction and learning applies
   to adult second language acquisition of syntactic rules. Does learning
   second language syntactic rules through social interactions with a
   native speaker or without such interactions impact behavior and the
   brain? The current study aims to answer this question. Adult Japanese
   participants learned a new foreign language, Japanese sign language
   (JSL), either through a native deaf signer or via DVDs. Neural
   correlates of acquiring new linguistic knowledge were investigated using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The participants in each
   group were indistinguishable in terms of their behavioral data after the
   instruction. The fMRI data, however, revealed significant differences in
   the neural activities between two groups. Significant activations in the
   left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were found for the participants who
   learned JSL through interactions with the native signer. In contrast, no
   cortical activation change in the left IFG was found for the group who
   experienced the same visual input for the same duration via the DVD
   presentation. Given that the left IFG is involved in the syntactic
   processing of language, spoken or signed, learning through social
   interactions resulted in an fMRI signature typical of native speakers:
   activation of the left IFG. Thus, broadly speaking, availability of
   communicative interaction is necessary for second language acquisition

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized at a neurobiological
   level by disrupted activity in emotion regulation neural circuitry.
   Previous work has demonstrated amygdala hyperreactivity and disrupted
   prefrontal responses to social cues in individuals with SAD (Kim et al.,
   2011). While exposure -based psychological treatments effectively reduce
   SAD symptoms, not all individuals respond to treatment. Better
   understanding of the neural mechanisms involved offers the potential to
   improve treatment efficacy. In this study, we investigated functional
   connectivity in emotion regulation neural circuitry in a randomized
   controlled treatment trial for SAD. Participants with SAD underwent fMRI
   scanning while performing an implicit emotion regulation task prior to
   treatment (n=62). Following 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy,
   acceptance and commitment therapy, or wait -list, participants completed
   a second scan (n=42). Psychophysiological interaction analyses using
   amygdala seed regions demonstrated differences between SAD and healthy
   control participants (HC; n=16) in right amygdala-vmPFC connectivity.
   SAD participants demonstrated more negative amygdala-tovmPFC
   connectivity, compared to HC participants, an effect that was correlated
   with SAD symptom severity. Post -treatment symptom reduction was
   correlated with altered amygdala-to-vm/v1PFC connectivity, independent
   of treatment type. Greater symptom reduction was associated with more
   negative amygdala-to-vm/v1PFC connectivity. These findings suggest that
   effective psychological treatment for SAD enhances amygdalaprefrontal
   functional connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has often highlighted hyperactivity in emotion regions
   to simple, static social threat cues in social anxiety disorder (SAD).
   Investigation of the neurobiology of SAD using more naturalistic
   paradigms can further reveal underlying mechanisms and how these relate
   to clinical outcomes. We used fMRT to investigate responses to novel
   dynamic rejection stimuli in individuals with SAD (N=70) and healthy
   controls (HC; N=17), and whether these responses predicted treatment
   outcomes following cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or acceptance and
   commitment therapy (ACT). Both HC and SAD groups reported greater
   distress to rejection compared to neutral social stimuli. At the neural
   level, HCs exhibited greater activations in social pain/rejection
   regions, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula,
   to rejection stimuli. The SAD group evidenced a different pattern, with
   no differences in these rejection regions and relatively greater
   activations in the amygdala and other regions to neutral stimuli.
   Greater responses in anterior cingulate cortex and the amygdala to
   rejection vs. neutral stimuli predicted better CBT outcomes. In
   contrast, enhanced activity in sensory -focused posterior insula
   predicted ACT responses.}},

Abstract = {{Placebo treatments can strongly affect clinical outcomes, but research
   on how they shape other life experiences and emotional well-being is in
   its infancy. We used fMRI in humans to examine placebo effects on a
   particularly impactful life experience, social pain elicited by a recent
   romantic rejection. We compared these effects with placebo effects on
   physical (heat) pain, which are thought to depend on pathways connecting
   prefrontal cortex and periaqueductal gray (PAG). Placebo treatment,
   compared with control, reduced both social and physical pain, and
   increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in both
   modalities. Placebo further altered the relationship between affect and
   both dlPFC and PAG activity during social pain, and effects on behavior
   were mediated by a pathway connecting dlPFC to the PAG, building on
   recent work implicating opioidergic PAG activity in the regulation of
   social pain. These findings suggest that placebo treatments reduce
   emotional distress by altering affective representations in
   frontal-brainstem systems.}},

Abstract = {{Persistent developmental stuttering is a neurologically based speech
   disorder associated with cognitivelinguistic, motor and emotional
   abnormalities. Previous studies investigating the relationship between
   anxiety and stuttering have yielded mixed results, but it has not yet
   been examined whether anxiety influences brain activity underlying
   stuttering. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we
   investigated the functional connectivity associated with state anxiety
   in a syllable repetition task, and trait anxiety during rest in adults
   who stutter (N = 19) and fluent controls (N = 19). During the speech
   task, people who stutter (PWS) showed increased functional connectivity
   of the right amygdala with the prefrontal gyrus (the left ventromedial
   frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus) and the left insula
   compared to controls. During rest, PWS showed stronger functional
   connectivity between the right hippocampus and the left orbital frontal
   gyrus, and between the left hippocampus and left motor areas than
   controls. Taken together, our results suggest aberrant bottom-up and/or
   top-down interactions for anxiety regulation, which might be responsible
   for the higher level of state anxiety during speech and for the
   anxiety-prone trait in PWS. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
   examine the neural underpinnings of anxiety in PWS, thus yielding new
   insight into the causes of stuttering which might aid strategies for the
   diagnosis and treatment of stuttering. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by

Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with disrupted brain
   networks. Neuroimaging techniques provide noninvasive methods of
   investigating abnormal connectivity patterns in ASD. In the present
   study, we compare functional connectivity networks in people with ASD
   with those in typical controls, using neuroimaging data from the Autism
   Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) project. Specifically, we focus on
   the characteristics of intrinsic functional connectivity based on data
   collected by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (rs-fMRI). Our aim was to identify disrupted brain connectivity patterns
   across all networks, instead of in individual edges, by using advanced
   statistical methods. Unlike many brain connectome studies, in which
   networks are prespecified before the edge connectivity in each network
   is compared between clinical groups, we detected the latent
   differentially expressed networks automatically. Our network-level
   analysis identified abnormal connectome networks that (i) included a
   high proportion of edges that were differentially expressed between
   people with ASD and typical controls; and (ii) showed highly-organized
   graph topology. These findings provide new insight into the study of the
   underlying neuropsychiatric mechanism of ASD.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Clinical data have been equivocal and controversial as to the benefits
   to the brain and cognition of hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal
   women. Recent reevaluation of the role of estrogens proposed that HT may
   effectively prevent the deleterious effects of aging on cognition, and
   reduces the risks of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, if
   initiated early at the beginning of menopause. Yet, little is known
   about the effects of HT on brain activation related to cognitive
   control, the ability to make flexible decisions in relation to internal
   goals. Here, we used fMRI to directly test for a modulation of
   sequential 17 beta estradiol (2 mg/day) plus oral progesterone (100
   mg/day) on task switching-related brain activity in women at early
   postmenopause. The results showed that HT enhanced dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex recruitment during task switching. Between-subjects
   correlation analyses revealed that women who engaged more the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed higher task switching performance
   after HT administration. These results suggest that HT, when taken early
   at the beginning of postmenopause, may have beneficial effect on
   cognitive control prefrontal mechanisms. Together, these findings
   demonstrate that HT can prevent the appearance of reduced prefrontal
   cortex activity, a neurophysiological measure observed both in healthy
   aging and early dementia.}},

   by biased information-processing vis-a-vis threat of social exclusion.
   However, uncertainty still abounds regarding the very nature of this
   sensitivity to social exclusion in SAD. Especially, brain alterations
   related to social exclusion have not been explored in SAD. Our primary
   purpose was thus to determine both the self-report and neural correlates
   of social exclusion in this population. 23 patients with SAD and 23
   matched nonanxious controls played a virtual game ({''}Cyberball{''})
   during fMRI recording. Participants were first included by other
   players, then excluded, and finally re-included. At the behavioral
   level, patients with SAD exhibited significantly higher levels of social
   exclusion feelings than nonanxious controls. At the brain level,
   patients with SAD exhibited significantly higher activation within the
   left inferior frontal gyrus relative to nonanxious controls during the
   re-inclusion phase. Moreover, self-report of social exclusion correlates
   with the activity of this cluster among individuals qualifying for SAD
   diagnosis. Our pattern of findings lends strong support to the notion
   that SAD may be better portrayed by a poor ability to recover following
   social exclusion than during social exclusion per se. These findings
   value social neuroscience as an innovative procedure to gain new insight
   into the underlying mechanisms of SAD.}},

Abstract = {{Topological networks lie at the heart of our cities and social milieu.
   However, it remains unclear how and when the brain processes topological
   structures to guide future behaviour during everyday life. Using fMRI in
   humans and a simulation of London (UK), here we show that, specifically
   when new streets are entered during navigation of the city, right
   posterior hippocampal activity indexes the change in the number of local
   topological connections available for future travel and right anterior
   hippocampal activity reflects global properties of the street entered.
   When forced detours require re- planning of the route to the goal,
   bilateral inferior lateral prefrontal activity scales with the planning
   demands of a breadth-first search of future paths. These results help
   shape models of how hippocampal and prefrontal regions support
   navigation, planning and future simulation.}},

Title = {{The Dorsal Medial Prefrontal Cortex Is Recruited by High Construal of
   Non-social Stimuli}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is part of the mentalizing
   network, a set of brain regions consistently engaged in inferring mental
   states. However, its precise function in this network remains unclear.
   It has recently been proposed that the dmPFC is involved in high-level
   abstract (i.e., categorical) identification or construction of both
   social and non-social stimuli, referred to as ``high construal.{''} This
   was based on the observation of greater activation in the dmPFC shared
   by a high construal social condition (trait inference based on visually
   presented behavior) and a high construal non-social condition
   (categorization of visually presented objects) vs. matched low construal
   conditions (visual description of the same pictures). However, dmPFC
   activation has been related to task contexts requiring responses based
   on self-guided generation of mental content or decisions as compared to
   responses more directly determined by the experimental context (e.g.,
   free vs. rule-governed choice). The previously reported dmPFC activity
   may reflect differences in task constraint (i.e., the extent to which
   the task context guided the process) confounded with the construal
   manipulation. Therefore, in the present study, we manipulated construal
   level and constraint independently, while participants underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As before, participants
   visually described (low level construal) or categorized (high level
   construal) pictures of objects. Orthogonal to this, the description or
   categorization task had to be performed on either one object (low
   constraint) or on two objects simultaneously (high constraint), limiting
   the number of possible responses. Statistical analysis revealed common
   greater activation in both high construal conditions (high and low
   constraint) than in their low construal counterparts, replicating the
   influence of construal level on dmPFC activation (greater involvement in
   high than low construal), but no influence of constraint. In line with
   previous proposals and earlier work, we suggest that the dmPFC is
   involved in high-construal abstraction across different domains.}},

Abstract = {{Information sharing is an integral part of human interaction that serves
   to build social relationships and affects attitudes and behaviors in
   individuals and large groups. We present a unifying neurocognitive
   framework of mechanisms underlying information sharing at scale
   (virality). We argue that expectations regarding self-related and social
   consequences of sharing (e.g., in the form of potential for
   self-enhancement or social approval) are integrated into a
   domain-general value signal that encodes the value of sharing a piece of
   information. This value signal translates into population-level
   virality. In two studies (n = 41 and 39 participants), we tested these
   hypotheses using functional neuroimaging. Neural activity in response to
   80 New York Times articles was observed in theory-driven regions of
   interest associated with value, self, and social cognitions. This
   activity then was linked to objectively logged population-level data
   encompassing n = 117,611 internet shares of the articles. In both
   studies, activity in neural regions associated with self-related and
   social cognition was indirectly related to population-level sharing
   through increased neural activation in the brain's value system. Neural
   activity further predicted population-level outcomes over and above the
   variance explained by article characteristics and commonly used
   self-report measures of sharing intentions. This parsimonious framework
   may help advance theory, improve predictive models, and inform new
   approaches to effective intervention. More broadly, these data shed
   light on the core functions of sharing-to express ourselves in positive
   ways and to strengthen our social bonds.}},

Title = {{Intrinsic Brain Activity Responsible for Sex Differences in Shyness and
   Social Anxiety}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 13}},
Abstract = {{Male and female show significant differences in important behavioral
   features such as shyness, yet the neural substrates of these differences
   remain poorly understood. Previous neuroimaging studies have
   demonstrated that both shyness and social anxiety in healthy subjects
   are associated with increased activation in the fronto-limbic and
   cognitive control areas. However, it remains unknown whether these brain
   abnormalities would be shared by different genders. Therefore, in the
   current study, we used resting-state fMRI (r-fMRI) to investigate sex
   differences in intrinsic cerebral activity that may contribute to
   shyness and social anxiety. Sixty subjects (28 males, 32 females)
   participated in r-fMRI scans, and the amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were used to measure the
   spontaneous regional cerebral activity in all subjects. We first
   compared the differences between male and female both in the ALFF and
   fALFF and then we also examined the whole brain correlation between the
   ALFF/fALFF and the severity of shyness as well as social anxiety by
   genders. Referring to shyness measure, we found a significant positive
   correlation between shyness scores (CBSS) and ALFF/fALFF value in the
   frontoparietal control network and a negative correlation in the
   cingulo-insular network in female; while in male, there is no such
   correlation. For the social anxiety level, we found positive
   correlations between Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) scores and
   spontaneous activity in the frontal-limbic network in male and negative
   correlation between the frontal-parietal network; however, such
   correlation was not prominent in female. This pattern suggests that shy
   female individuals engaged a proactive control process, driven by a
   positive association with activity in frontoparietal network and
   negative association in cingulo-insular network, whereas social anxiety
   males relied more on a reactive control process, driven by a positive
   correlation of frontal-limbic network and negative correlation of
   frontoparietal network. Our results reveal that shyness or social
   anxiety is associated with disrupted spontaneous brain activity patterns
   and that these patterns are influenced by sex.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{The interpretation of social cues is a fundamental function of human
   social behavior, and resolution of inconsistencies between spoken and
   gestural cues plays an important role in successful interactions. To
   gain insight into these underlying neural processes, we compared neural
   responses in a traditional color/word conflict task and to a
   gesture/word conflict task to test hypotheses of domain-general and
   domain-specific conflict resolution. In the gesture task, recorded
   spoken words ({''}yes{''} and ``no{''}) were presented simultaneously
   with video recordings of actors performing one of the following
   affirmative or negative gestures: thumbs up, thumbs down, head nodding
   (up and down), or head shaking (side-to-side), thereby generating
   congruent and incongruent communication stimuli between gesture and
   words. Participants identified the communicative intent of the gestures
   as either positive or negative. In the color task, participants were
   presented the words ``red{''} and ``green{''} in either red or green
   font and were asked to identify the color of the letters. We observed a
   classic ``Stroop{''} behavioral interference effect, with participants
   showing increased response time for incongruent trials relative to
   congruent ones for both the gesture and color tasks. Hemodynamic signals
   acquired using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) were
   increased in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for
   incongruent trials relative to congruent trials for both tasks
   consistent with a common, domain-general mechanism for detecting
   conflict. However, activity in the left DLPFC and frontal eye fields and
   the right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), superior temporal gyrus
   (STG), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), and primary and auditory association
   cortices was greater for the gesture task than the color task. Thus, in
   addition to domain-general conflict processing mechanisms, as suggested
   by common engagement of right DLPFC, socially specialized neural modules
   localized to the left DLPFC and right TPJ including adjacent homologous
   receptive language areas were engaged when processing conflicting
   communications. These findings contribute to an emerging view of
   specialization within the TPJ and adjacent areas for interpretation of
   social cues and indicate a role for the region in processing social
   conflict.}},

Title = {{Trait self-consciousness predicts amygdala activation and its functional
   brain connectivity during emotional suppression: an fMRI analysis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated how
   trait neuroticism and its heterogeneous subdimensions are related to the
   emotional consequences and neural underpinnings of emotion regulation.
   Two levels of neuroticism assessments were conducted with 47 female
   subjects, who were required to attend to, suppress emotion displays to,
   or cognitively reappraise the meanings of negative images. The results
   showed reduced emotional experience and bilateral amygdala activation
   during reappraisal, and this regulation effect is unaffected by
   individual differences in neuroticism and its subdimensions. By
   contrast, the emotion downregulation effect of suppression in the right
   amygdala is compromised with increasing self-consciousness but not
   overall neuroticism dimension. This association holds robust after
   controlling the potential contribution of habitual suppression.
   Moreover, the psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed
   that self-consciousness predicts weaker functional coupling of the right
   amygdala to supplementary motor area and putamen during expressive
   suppression, two regions mediating the control and execution of motor
   actions. These findings suggest that self-consciousness predicts
   increased difficulty in emotional regulation using expressive
   suppression; and that the heterogeneous nature of trait neuroticism
   needs to be considered in exploring the association of neuroticism and
   emotion regulation.}},

Title = {{Lack of Evidence That Neural Empathic Responses Are Blunted in Excessive
   Users of Violent Video Games: An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{The use of violent video games has been often linked to increase of
   aggressive behavior. According to the General Aggression Model, one of
   the central mechanisms for this aggressiveness inducing impact is an
   emotional desensitization process resulting from long lasting repeated
   violent game playing. This desensitization should evidence itself in a
   lack of empathy. Recent research has focused primarily on acute, short
   term impact of violent media use but only little is known about long
   term effects. In this study 15 excessive users of violent games and
   control subjects matched for age and education viewed pictures depicting
   emotional and neutral situations with and without social interaction
   while fMRI activations were obtained. While the typical pattern of
   activations for empathy and theory of mind networks was seen, both
   groups showed no differences in brain responses. We interpret our
   results as evidence against the desensitization hypothesis and suggest
   that the impact of violent media on emotional processing may be rather
   acute and short-lived.}},

Title = {{Differences on Brain Connectivity in Adulthood Are Present in Subjects
   with Iron Deficiency Anemia in Infancy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Iron deficiency continues to be the most prevalent micronutrient deficit
   worldwide. Since iron is involved in several processes including
   myelination, dopamine neurotransmission and neuronal metabolism, the
   presence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in infancy relates to
   long-lasting neurofunctional effects. There is scarce data regarding
   whether these effects would extend to former iron deficient anemic human
   adults. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a
   novel technique to explore patterns of functional connectivity. Default
   Mode Network (DMN), one of the resting state networks, is deeply
   involved in memory, social cognition and self-referential processes. The
   four core regions consistently identified in the DMN are the medial
   prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex and left and
   right inferior parietal cortex. Therefore to investigate the DMN in
   former iron deficient anemic adults is a particularly useful approach to
   elucidate de long term effects on functional brain. We conducted this
   research to explore the connection between IDA in infancy and altered
   patterns of resting state brain functional networks in young adults.
   Resting-state fMRI studies were performed to 31 participants that belong
   to a follow-up study since infancy. Of them, 14 participants were former
   iron deficient anemic in infancy and 17 were controls, with mean age of
   21.5 years (+/- 1.5) and 54.8\% were males. Resting-state fMRI protocol
   was used and the data was analyzed using the seed based connectivity
   statistical analysis to assess the DMN. We found that compared to
   controls, former iron deficient anemic subjects showed posterior DMN
   decreased connectivity to the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC),
   whereas they exhibited increased anterior DMN connectivity to the right
   PCC. Differences between groups were also apparent in the left medial
   frontal gyrus, with former iron deficient anemic participants having
   increased connectivity with areas included in DMN and dorsal attention
   networks. These preliminary results suggest different patterns of
   functional connectivity between former iron deficient anemic and control
   young adults. Indeed, IDA in infancy, a common nutritional problem among
   human infants, may turn out to be important for understanding the
   mechanisms of cognitive alterations, common in adulthood.}},

Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{There is interest in understanding the influence of biological factors,
   like sex, on the organization of brain function. We investigated the
   influence of biological sex on the behavioral and neural basis of face
   recognition in healthy, young adults. In behavior, there were no sex
   differences on the male Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) + or the
   female CFMT + (that we created) and no own-gender bias (OGB) in either
   group. We evaluated the functional topography of ventral stream
   organization by measuring the magnitude and functional neural size of 16
   individually defined face-, two object-, and two place-related regions
   bilaterally. There were no sex differences in any of these measures of
   neural function in any of the regions of interest (ROIs) or in group
   level comparisons. These findings reveal that men and women have similar
   category-selective topographic organization in the ventral visual
   pathway. Next, in a separate task, we measured activation within the 16
   face-processing ROIs specifically during recognition of target male and
   female faces. There were no sex differences in the magnitude of the
   neural responses in any face-processing region. Furthermore, there was
   no OGB in the neural responses of either the male or female
   participants. Our findings suggest that face recognition behavior,
   including the OGB, is not inherently sexually dimorphic. Face
   recognition is an essential skill for navigating human social
   interactions, which is reflected equally in the behavior and neural
   architecture of men and women.}},

Abstract = {{Our attitudes toward others influence a wide range of everyday behaviors
   and have been the most extensively studied concept in the history of
   social psychology. Yet they remain difficult to measure reliably and
   objectively, since both explicit and implicit measures are typically
   confounded by other psychological processes. We here address the
   feasibility of decoding incidental attitudes based on brain activations.
   Participants were presented with pictures of members of a Japanese idol
   group inside an functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner while
   performing an unrelated detection task, and subsequently (outside the
   scanner) performed an incentive-compatible choice task that revealed
   their attitude toward each celebrity. We used a real-world election
   scheme that exists for this idol group, which confirmed both strongly
   negative and strongly positive attitudes toward specific individuals.
   Whole-brain multivariate analyses (searchlight-based support vector
   regression) showed that activation patterns in the anterior striatum
   predicted each participant's revealed attitudes (choice behavior) using
   leave-one-out (as well as 4-fold) cross-validation across participants.
   In contrast, attitude extremity (unsigned magnitude) could be decoded
   from a distinct region in the posterior striatum. The findings
   demonstrate dissociable striatal representations of valenced attitude
   and attitude extremity and constitute a first step toward an objective
   and process-pure neural measure of attitudes.}},

Abstract = {{There is extensive discussion on whether spontaneous and explicit forms
   of ToM are based on the same cognitive/neural mechanisms or rather
   reflect qualitatively different processes. For the first time, we
   analyzed the BOLD signal for false belief processing by directly
   comparing spontaneous and explicit ToM task versions. In both versions,
   participants watched videos of a scene including an agent who acquires a
   true or false belief about the location of an object (belief formation
   phase). At the end of the movies (outcome phase), participants had to
   react to the presence of the object. During the belief formation phase,
   greater activity was found for false vs true belief trials in the right
   posterior parietal cortex. The ROI analysis of the right
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), confirmed this observation. Moreover,
   the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) was active during the
   outcome phase, being sensitive to violation of both the participant's
   and agent's expectations about the location of the object. Activity in
   the TPJ and aMPFC was not modulated by the spontaneous/explicit task.
   Overall, these data show that neural mechanisms for spontaneous and
   explicit ToM overlap. Interestingly, a dissociation between TPJ and
   aMPFC for belief tracking and outcome evaluation, respectively, was also
   found.}},

Abstract = {{Angry expressions of both voices and faces represent disorder-relevant
   stimuli in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Although individuals with SAD
   show greater amygdala activation to angry faces, previous work has
   failed to find comparable effects for angry voices. Here, we
   investigated whether voice sound-intensity, a modulator of a voice's
   threat-relevance, affects brain responses to angry prosody in SAD. We
   used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore
   brain responses to voices varying in sound intensity and emotional
   prosody in SAD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Angry and neutral
   voices were presented either with normal or high sound amplitude, while
   participants had to decide upon the speaker's gender. Loud vs normal
   voices induced greater insula activation, and angry vs neutral prosody
   greater orbitofrontal cortex activation in SAD as compared with HC
   subjects. Importantly, an interaction of sound intensity, prosody and
   group was found in the insula and the amygdala. In particular, the
   amygdala showed greater activation to loud angry voices in SAD as
   compared with HC subjects. This finding demonstrates a modulating role
   of voice sound-intensity on amygdalar hyperresponsivity to angry prosody
   in SAD and suggests that abnormal processing of interpersonal threat
   signals in amygdala extends beyond facial expressions in SAD.}},

Abstract = {{Rewards reliably elicit ventral striatum activity. More recently studies
   have shown that vicarious rewards elicit similar activation. Ventral
   striatum responses to rewards for self peak during adolescence. However,
   it is currently not well understood how ventral striatum responses to
   vicarious rewards develop. In this study, we test this question using
   behavioral and fMRI data. A total of 233 participants aged 9-26 years
   old played a gambling game in the scanner in which they could win or
   lose money for themselves, their best friend and mother. Participants
   rated how close they felt to their friend and mother and how much they
   liked winning for them. These ratings were positively correlated. On the
   neural level males showed higher responses to winning for a friend, but
   there were no age differences. In contrast, there was a quadratic effect
   of age when winning for mother, showing heightened ventral striatum
   activity in mid-adolescence. Furthermore, there was an interaction
   between age and sex; for females responses to winning for friends become
   stronger with age relative to winning for mothers. In conclusion, this
   study provided evidence for elevated ventral striatumresponses for
   mothers in mid-adolescence, and a shift in ventral striatum responses
   towards peers in girls.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive reappraisal and placebo administration constitute two
   different approaches for modulating one's own emotional state. Whereas
   reappraisal is an explicit (effortful) type of self-regulation, placebo
   treatment initiates implicit processes of affective control. The brain
   mechanisms underlying these processes have not been directly compared
   with each other up until now; doing this enables the identification of
   distinct and shared neuronal features. We conducted a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study with 45 women, who were presented with
   disgusting and neutral images in a block design, at three experimental
   sessions, over 3 consecutive days. They were asked to passively view the
   images in one session, engage in reappraisal in another, and in another
   session they received a placebo pill: a disgust-reducing `anti-nausea
   drug'. Relative to passive viewing, both reappraisal and placebo
   treatment effectively reduced the experienced disgust intensity. In the
   placebo condition, this reduction was associated with decreased
   activation of the insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
   In contrast, reappraisal induced increased activation in both regions.
   Furthermore, both regulation strategies were associated with opposite
   patterns of connectivity in a network encompassing the amygdala, the
   insula and the DLPFC. Only placebo administration led to a reduced
   coupling in this network.}},

Abstract = {{As a personality trait, grit involves the tendency to strive to achieve
   long-termgoals with continual passion and perseverance and plays an
   extremely crucial role in personal achievement. However, the neural
   mechanisms of grit remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to
   explore the association between grit and the fractional amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in 217 healthy adolescent students
   using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). We
   found that an individual's grit was negatively related to the regional
   fALFF in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), which is
   involved in self-regulation, planning, goal setting and maintenance, and
   counterfactual thinking for reflecting on past failures. The results
   persisted even after the effects of general intelligence and the `big
   five' personality traits were adjusted for. More importantly, the fALFF
   of the right DMPFC played a mediating role in the association between
   grit and academic performance. Overall, these findings reveal regional
   fALFF as a neural basis of grit and highlight the right DMPFC as a
   neural link between grit and academic performance.}},

Abstract = {{Through associative reward learning, arbitrary cues acquire the ability
   to automatically capture visual attention. Previous studies have
   examined the neural correlates of value-driven attentional orienting,
   revealing elevated activity within a network of brain regions
   encompassing the visual corticostriatal loop {[}caudate tail, lateral
   occipital complex (LOC) and early visual cortex] and intraparietal
   sulcus (IPS). Such attentional priority signals raise a broader question
   concerning how visual signals are combined with reward signals during
   learning to create a representation that is sensitive to the confluence
   of the two. This study examines reward signals during the cued reward
   training phase commonly used to generate value-driven attentional
   biases. High, compared with low, reward feedback preferentially
   activated the value-driven attention network, in addition to regions
   typically implicated in reward processing. Further examination of these
   reward signals within the visual system revealed information about the
   identity of the preceding cue in the caudate tail and LOC, and
   information about the location of the preceding cue in IPS, while early
   visual cortex represented both location and identity. The results reveal
   teaching signals within the value-driven attention network during
   associative reward learning, and further suggest functional
   specialization within different regions of this network during the
   acquisition of an integrated representation of stimulus value.}},

Abstract = {{The rostral-ventral subdivision of the anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)
   plays a key role in the regulation of emotional processing. Although
   rACC has strong anatomical connections with anterior insular cortex
   (AIC), amygdala, prefrontal cortex and striatal brain regions, it is
   unclear whether the functional connectivity of rACC with these regions
   changes when regulating emotional processing. Furthermore, it is not
   known whether this connectivity changes with deficits in emotion
   regulation seen in different kinds of anxiety and depression. To address
   these questions regarding rACC functional connectivity, non-patients
   high in self-reported anxious apprehension (AP), anxious arousal (AR),
   anhedonic depression (AD) or none (CON) indicated the ink color of
   pleasant, neutral and unpleasant words during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. While ignoring task-irrelevant unpleasant words, AD
   and CON showed an increase in the functional connectivity of rACC with
   AIC, putamen, caudate and ventral pallidum. There was a decrease in this
   connectivity in AP and AR, with AP showing greater reduction than AR.
   These findings provide support for the role of rACC in integrating
   interoceptive, emotional and cognitive functions via interactions with
   insula and striatal regions during effective emotion regulation in
   healthy individuals and a failure of this integration that may be
   specific to anxiety, particularly AP.}},

Abstract = {{Cocaine dependence frequently co-occurs with personality disorders,
   leading to increased interpersonal problems and greater burden of
   disease. Personality disorders are characterised by patterns of thinking
   and feeling that divert from social expectations. However, the
   comorbidity between cocaine dependence and personality disorders has not
   been substantiated by measures of brain activation during social
   decision-making. We applied functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   compare brain activations evoked by a social decision-making taskthe
   Ultimatum Gamein 24 cocaine dependents with personality disorders
   (CDPD), 19 cocaine dependents without comorbidities and 19 healthy
   controls. In the Ultimatum Game participants had to accept or reject
   bids made by another player to split monetary stakes. Offers varied in
   fairness (in fair offers the proposer shares similar to 50 percent of
   the money; in unfair offers the proposer shares <30 percent of the
   money), and participants were told that if they accept both players get
   the money, and if they reject both players lose it. We contrasted brain
   activations during unfair versus fair offers and accept versus reject
   choices. During evaluation of unfair offers CDPD displayed lower
   activation in the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex and higher
   activation in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and superior frontal and
   temporal gyri. Frontal activations negatively correlated with emotion
   recognition. During rejection of offers CDPD displayed lower activation
   in the anterior cingulate cortex, striatum and midbrain. Dual diagnosis
   is linked to hypo-activation of the insula and anterior cingulate cortex
   and hyper-activation of frontal-temporal regions during social
   decision-making, which associates with poorer emotion recognition.}},

   prefrontal and temporal brain networks. While shared behavioral and
   neural underpinnings are suspected for cognitive empathy and negative
   symptoms, research is needed to test these hypotheses. In two studies,
   we evaluated whether resting-state functional connectivity between
   data-driven networks, or components (referred to as, inter-component
   connectivity), predicted cognitive empathy and experiential and
   expressive negative symptoms in schizophrenia subjects. Study 1: We
   examined associations between cognitive empathy and medial prefrontal
   and temporal inter-component connectivity at rest using a group-matched
   schizophrenia and control sample. We then assessed whether
   inter-component connectivity metrics associated with cognitive empathy
   were also related to negative symptoms. Study 2: We sought to replicate
   the connectivity-symptom associations observed in Study 1 using an
   independent schizophrenia sample. Study 1 results revealed that while
   the groups did not differ in average inter-component connectivity, a
   medial-fronto-temporal metric and an orbito-fronto-temporal metric were
   related to cognitive empathy. Moreover, the medial-fronto-temporal
   metric was associated with experiential negative symptoms in both
   schizophrenia samples. These findings support recent models that link
   social cognition and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{Trust in reciprocity (TR) is defined as the risky decision to invest
   valued resources in another party with the hope of mutual benefit.
   Several fMRI studies have investigated the neural correlates of TR in
   one-shot and multiround versions of the investment game (IG). However,
   an overall characterization of the underlying neural networks remains
   elusive. Here, a coordinate-based meta- analysis was employed
   (activation likelihood estimation method, 30 articles) to investigate
   consistent brain activations in each of the IG stages (i.e., the trust,
   reciprocity and feedback stage). Results showed consistent activations
   in the anterior insula (AI) during trust decisions in the one-shot IG
   and decisions to reciprocate in the multiround IG, likely related to
   representations of aversive feelings. Moreover, decisions to reciprocate
   also consistently engaged the intraparietal sulcus, probably involved in
   evaluations of the reciprocity options. On the contrary, trust decisions
   in the multiround IG consistently activated the ventral striatum, likely
   associated with reward prediction error signals. Finally, the dorsal
   striatum was found consistently recruited during the feedback stage of
   the multiround IG, likely related to reinforcement learning. In
   conclusion, our results indicate different neural networks underlying
   trust, reciprocity, and feedback learning. These findings suggest that
   although decisions to trust and reciprocate may elicit aversive feelings
   likely evoked by the uncertainty about the decision outcomes and the
   pressing requirements of social standards, multiple interactions allow
   people to build interpersonal trust for cooperation via a learning
   mechanism by which they arguably learn to distinguish trustworthy from
   untrustworthy partners. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{As a fundamental concern of human beings, mortality salience impacts
   various human social behaviors including intergroup interactions;
   however, the underlying neural signature remains obscure. Here, we
   examined the neural signatures underlying the impact of mortality
   reminders on in-group bias in costly punishment combining a second-party
   punishment task with multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data. After
   mortality salience (MS) priming or general negative affect priming,
   participants received offers from racial in-group and out-group
   proposers and decided how to punish proposers by reducing their payoffs.
   We revealed that MS priming attenuated in-group bias and dampened the
   discriminated activation patterns pertaining to group identities in
   regions previously implicated in costly punishment, including
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal junction, anterior
   cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The group identity
   represented in multivariate patterns of activity of these regions
   predicted in-group bias for the control condition, i.e., the stronger
   discriminative representations of group identities in these regions; the
   larger was the in-group bias. Furthermore, the in-group bias was
   reliably decoded by distributed activation patterns in the
   punishment-related networks but only in the control condition and not in
   the MS condition. These findings elucidate the neural underpinnings of
   the effects of mortality reminders on intergroup interaction. Hum Brain

Abstract = {{In social interactions, humans are expected to regulate interpersonal
   distance in response to the emotion displayed by others. Yet, the neural
   mechanisms implicated in approach-avoidance tendencies to distinct
   emotional expressions have not been fully described. Here, we
   investigated the neural systems implicated in regulating the distance to
   different emotions, and how they vary as a function of empathy.
   Twenty-three healthy participants assessed for psychopathic traits
   underwent fMRI scanning while they viewed approaching and withdrawing
   angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral faces. Participants were also
   asked to set the distance to those faces on a computer screen, and to
   adjust the physical distance from the experimenter outside the scanner.
   Participants kept the greatest distances from angry faces, and shortest
   from happy expressions. This was accompanied by increased activation in
   the dorsomedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, inferior frontal
   gyrus, and temporoparietal junction for angry and happy expressions
   relative to the other emotions. Irrespective of emotion, longer
   distances were kept from approaching faces, which was associated with
   increased activation in the amygdala and insula, as well as parietal and
   prefrontal regions. Amygdala activation was positively correlated with
   greater preferred distances to angry, fearful and sad expressions.
   Moreover, participants scoring higher on coldhearted psychopathic traits
   (lower empathy) showed reduced amygdala activation to sad expressions.
   These findings elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying social
   approach-avoidance, and how they are related to variations in empathy.

Abstract = {{Introduction: A gene-environment interaction between expression
   genotypes of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and adverse childhood
   experience increases the risk of antisocial behavior. However, the
   neural underpinnings of this interaction remain uninvestigated. A
   cortico-limbic circuit involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the
   amygdala is central to the suppression of aggressive impulses and is
   modulated by serotonin (5-HT). MAOA genotypes may modulate the
   vulnerability of this circuit and increase the risk for emotion
   regulation deficits after specific life events. Acute tryptophan
   depletion (ATD) challenges 5-HT regulation and may identify vulnerable
   neuronal circuits, contributing to the gene-environment interaction.
   Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging measured the restingstate
   state activity in 64 healthy males in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
   study. Cortical maps of amygdala correlation identified the impact of
   ATD and its interaction with low-(MAOA-L) and highexpression variants
   (MAOA-H) of MAOA on cortico-limbic connectivity. Results: Across all
   Regions of Interest (ROIs) exhibiting an ATD effect on cortico-limbic
   connectivity, MAOA-L carriers were more susceptible to ATD than MAOA-H
   carriers. In particular, the MAOA-L group exhibited a larger reduction
   of amygdala connectivity with the right prefrontal cortex and a larger
   increase of amygdala connectivity with the insula and dorsal PCC.
   Conclusion: MAOA-L carriers were more susceptable to a central 5-HT
   challenge in cortico-limbic networks. Such vulnerability of the cortical
   serotonergic system may contribute to the emergence of antisocial
   behavior after systemic challenges, observed as geneenvironment
   interaction. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The human left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL) plays a pivotal role in
   many cognitive functions and is an important node in the default mode
   network (DMN). Although many previous studies have proposed different
   parcellation schemes for the LIPL, the detailed functional organization
   of the LIPL and the exact correspondence between the DMN and LIPL
   subregions remain unclear. Mounting evidence indicates that spontaneous
   fluctuations in the brain are strongly associated with cognitive
   performance at the behavioral level. However, whether a consistent
   functional topographic organization of the LIPL during rest and under
   task can be revealed remains unknown. Here, they used resting- state
   functional connectivity (RSFC) and task- related coactivation patterns
   separately to parcellate the LIPL and identified seven subregions. Four
   subregions were located in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and three
   subregions were located in the angular gyrus (AG). The subregion-
   specific networks and functional characterization revealed that the four
   anterior subregions were found to be primarily involved in sensorimotor
   processing, movement imagination and inhibitory control, audition
   perception and speech processing, and social cognition, whereas the
   three posterior subregions were mainly involved in episodic memory,
   semantic processing, and spatial cognition. The results revealed a
   detailed functional organization of the LIPL and suggested that the LIPL
   is a functionally heterogeneous area. In addition, the present study
   demonstrated that the functional architecture of the LIPL during rest
   corresponds with that found in task processing. (C) 2017Wiley

Abstract = {{Guided by indirect evidence, recent approaches propose a tripartite
   crosstalk among interoceptive signaling, emotional regulation, and
   low-level social cognition. Here we examined the neurocognitive
   convergence of such domains. First, we performed three meta-analyses of
   functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to identify which areas
   are consistently coactivated by these three systems. Multi-level Kernel
   Density Analysis (MKDA) revealed major overlaps in the right anterior
   insular and frontotemporal regions (viz., the orbitofrontal and inferior
   frontal gyri, the amygdala, and mid temporal lobe/subcortical
   structures). Second, we explored such domains in patients with
   fronto-insulo-temporal damage. Relative to controls, the patients showed
   behavioral impairments of interoception, emotional processing, and
   social cognition, with preservation of other cognitive functions.
   Convergent results from both studies offer direct support for a model of
   insular-frontotemporal regions integrating interoception, emotion, and
   social cognition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampus has been implicated in integrating information across
   separate events in support of mnemonic generalizations. These
   generalizations may be underpinned by processes at both encoding
   (linking similar information across events) and retrieval
   ({''}on-the-fly{''} generalization). However, the relative contribution
   of the hippocampus to encoding-and retrieval-based generalizations is
   poorly understood. Using fMRI in humans, we investigated the hippocampal
   role in gradually learning a set of spatial discriminations and
   subsequently generalizing them in an acquired equivalence task. We found
   a highly significant correlation between individuals' performance on a
   generalization test and hippocampal activity during the test, providing
   evidence that hippocampal processes support on-the-fly generalizations
   at retrieval. Within the same hippocampal region there was also a
   correlation between activity during the final stage of learning (when
   all associations had been learnt but no generalization was required) and
   subsequent generalization performance. We suggest that the hippocampus
   spontaneously retrieves prior events that share overlapping features
   with the current event. This process may also support the creation of
   generalized representations during encoding. These findings are
   supportive of the view that the hippocampus contributes to both
   encodingand retrieval-based generalization via the same basic mechanism;
   retrieval of similar events sharing common features. (C) 2016 The

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{148}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The disparity between the chronological age of an individual and their
   brain-age measured based on biological information has the potential to
   offer clinically relevant biomarkers of neurological syndromes that
   emerge late in the lifespan. While prior brain-age prediction studies
   have relied exclusively on either structural or functional brain data,
   here we investigate how multimodal brain-imaging data improves age
   prediction. Using cortical anatomy and whole-brain functional
   connectivity on a large adult lifespan sample (N=2354, age 19-82), we
   found that multimodal data improves brain-based age prediction,
   resulting in a mean absolute prediction error of 4.29 years.
   Furthermore, we found that the discrepancy between predicted age and
   chronological age captures cognitive impairment. Importantly, the
   brain-age measure was robust to confounding effects: head motion did not
   drive brain-based age prediction and our models generalized reasonably
   to an independent dataset acquired at a different site (N=475).
   Generalization performance was increased by training models on a larger
   and more heterogeneous dataset. The robustness of multimodal brain-age
   prediction to confounds, generalizability across sites, and sensitivity
   to clinically-relevant impairments, suggests promising future
   application to the early prediction of neurocognitive disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Excessively choosing immediate over larger future rewards, or delay
   discounting (DD), associates with multiple clinical conditions.
   Individual differences in DD likely depend on variations in the
   activation of and functional interactions between networks, representing
   possible endophenotypes for associated disorders, including alcohol use
   disorders (AUDs). Numerous fMRI studies have probed the neural bases of
   DD, but investigations of large-scale networks remain scant. We
   addressed this gap by testing whether activation within large-scale
   networks during Now/Later decision-making predicts individual
   differences in DD. To do so, we scanned 95 social drinkers (18-40 years
   old; 50 women) using fMRI during hypothetical choices between small
   monetary amounts available today or larger amounts available later. We
   identified neural networks engaged during Now/Later choice using
   independent component analysis and tested the relationship between
   component activation and degree of DD. The activity of two components
   during Now/Later choice correlated with individual DD rates: A temporal
   lobe network positively correlated with DD, whereas a
   frontoparietal-striatal network negatively correlated with DD.
   Activation differences between these networks predicted individual
   differences in DD, and their negative correlation during Now/Later
   choice suggests functional competition. A generalized
   psychophysiological interactions analysis confirmed a decrease in their
   functional connectivity during decision-making. The functional
   connectivity of these two networks negatively correlates with
   alcohol-related harm, potentially implicating these networks in AUDs.
   These findings provide novel insight into the neural underpinnings of
   individual differences in impulsive decision-making with potential
   implications for addiction and related disorders in which impulsivity is
   a defining feature.}},

Abstract = {{Despite advances in understanding the brain structures involved in the

   structures involved in their acquisition. Here, we combined fMRI, a task
   involving learning the valence of different social groups, and modeling
   of the learning process involved in the development of biases in
   thinking about social groups that support prejudice. Participants read
   descriptions of valenced behaviors performed by members of novel social
   groups, with majority groups being more frequently encountered during
   learning than minority groups. A model-based fMRI analysis revealed that
   the anterior temporal lobe tracked the trial-by-trial changes in the
   valence associated with each group encountered in the task. Descriptions
   of behavior by group members that deviated from the group average (i.e.,
   prediction errors) were associated with activity in the left lateral
   PFC, dorsomedial PFC, and lateral anterior temporal cortex. Minority
   social groups were associated with slower acquisition rates and more
   activity in the ventral striatum and ACC/dorsomedial PFC compared with
   majority groups. These findings provide new insights into the brain

Abstract = {{Humans follow another person's eye gaze to objects of interest to the

   eye gaze-following. The location of the GFP is in the vicinity of the
   posterior members of the core face-processing system that consists of
   distinct patches in ventral visual cortex, the STS, and frontal cortex,
   also involved in processing information on the eyes. To test whether the
   GFP might correspond to one of the posterior face patches, we compared
   the pattern of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging
   contrasts reflecting the passive vision of static faces with the one
   evoked by shifts of attention guided by the eye gaze of others. The
   viewing of static faces revealed the face patch system. On the other
   hand, eye gaze-following activated a cortical patch (the GFP) with its
   activation maximum separated by more than 24 mm in the right and 19 mm
   in the left hemisphere from the nearest face patch, the STS face area
   (FA). This segregation supports a distinct function of the GFP,
   different from the elementary processing of facial information.}},

Abstract = {{Speeded responses to an external cue are slower when the cue interrupts
   preparation to perform the same or a similar action in a self-paced
   manner. To explore the mechanism underlying this `cost of intention', we
   examined whether the size of the cost is influenced by the nature of the
   external cue. Specifically, we assessed whether the cost of intention is
   different for movements made in response to an imitative cue (an
   on-screen hand movement) compared to those made in response to a
   symbolic cue. Consistent with previous reports, externally cued
   responses were significantly slower on trials where participants were
   preparing to perform an internally driven movement later in the trial.
   Also as predicted, simple response times to the imitative cue were
   faster than those made to the symbolic cue. Critically, the cost of
   intention was similar for each cue type, suggesting that preparing an
   intentional action influenced responses cued by the symbolic and
   imitative cues to a similar degree. These findings suggest that the
   nature of the external cue does not influence the response time delay
   associated with concurrent intentional preparation. Together with
   previous findings, the results of the current study shed further light
   on the potential mechanisms underlying the cost of intention.}},

Abstract = {{Initiating joint attention (IJA), the behavioral instigation of
   coordinated focus of 2 people on an object, emerges over the first 2
   years of life and supports social-communicative functioning related to
   the healthy development of aspects of language, empathy, and theory
   ofmind. Deficits in IJA provide strong early indicators for autism
   spectrumdisorder, and therapies targeting joint attention have shown
   tremendous promise. However, the brain systems underlying IJA in early
   childhood are poorly understood, due in part to
   significantmethodological challenges in imaging localized brain function
   that supports social behaviors during the first 2 years of life. Herein,
   we showthat the functional organization of the brain is intimately
   related to the emergence of IJA using functional connectivitymagnetic
   resonance imaging and dimensional behavioral assessments in a large
   semilongitudinal cohort of infants and toddlers. In particular, though
   functional connections spanning the brain are involved in IJA, the
   strongest brain-behavior associations clusterwithin connections between
   a small subset of functional brain networks; namely between the visual
   network and dorsal attention network and between the visual network and
   posterior cingulate aspects of the defaultmode network. These
   observationsmark the earliest known description of how functional brain
   systems underlie a burgeoning fundamental social behavior, may help
   improve the design of targeted therapies for neurodevelopmental
   disorders, and, more generally, elucidate physiologicalmechanisms
   essential to healthy social behavior development.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding human-object interactions is critical for extracting
   meaning from everyday visual scenes and requires integrating complex
   relationships between human pose and object identity into a new percept.
   To understand how the brain builds these representations, we conducted 2
   fMRI experiments in which subjects viewed humans interacting with
   objects, noninteracting human-object pairs, and isolated humans and
   objects. A number of visual regions process features of humanobject
   interactions, including object identity information in the lateral
   occipital complex (LOC) and parahippocampal place area (PPA), and human
   pose information in the extrastriate body area (EBA) and posterior
   superior temporal sulcus ( pSTS). Representations of human-object
   interactions in some regions, such as the posterior PPA (retinotopic
   maps PHC1 and PHC2) are well predicted by a simple linear combination of
   the response to object and pose information. Other regions, however,
   especially pSTS, exhibit representations for human-object interaction
   categories that are not predicted by their individual components,
   indicating that they encode human-object interactions as more than the
   sumof their parts. These results reveal the distributed networks
   underlying the emergent representation of human-object interactions
   necessary for social perception.}},

Abstract = {{In an effort to advance the understanding of brain function and
   organisation accompanying second language learning, we investigate the
   neural substrates of novel grammar learning in a group of healthy
   adults, consisting of participants with high and average language
   analytical abilities (LAA). By means of an Independent Components
   Analysis, a data-driven approach to functional connectivity of the
   brain, the fMRI data collected during a grammar-learning task were
   decomposed into maps representing separate cognitive processes. These
   included the default mode, task-positive, working memory, visual,
   cerebellar and emotional networks. We further tested for differences
   within the components, representing individual differences between the
   High and Average LAA learners. We found high analytical abilities to be
   coupled with stronger contributions to the task-positive network from
   areas adjacent to bilateral Broca's region, stronger connectivity within
   the working memory network and within the emotional network. Average LAA
   participants displayed stronger engagement within the task-positive
   network from areas adjacent to the right-hemisphere homologue of Broca's
   region and typical to lower level processing (visual word recognition),
   and increased connectivity within the default mode network. The
   significance of each of the identified networks for the grammar learning
   process is presented next to a discussion on the established markers of
   inter-individual learners' differences. We conclude that in terms of
   functional connectivity, the engagement of brain's networks during
   grammar acquisition is coupled with one's language learning
   abilities.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Consumer behaviors are shaped by fundamental motives: affiliation,
   self-protection, status attainment, mate attraction, mate retention, and
   child-rearing. It has been argued that each fundamental motive is
   activated by cues pertaining to threats or opportunities linked with
   each fundamental motive, and may be based on qualitatively different
   cognitive and neural systems. Steroid hormones influence specific neural
   systems and consumer behaviors rooted in diverse fundamental motives. By
   taking steroid sex hormones as examples of internal cues, we suggested
   that at least three fundamental motives (status attainment, mate
   attraction, and mate retention) may be explained by common cognitive and
   neural mechanisms. Consumer behaviors rooted in diverse fundamental
   motives, including status attainment, mate attraction, and mate
   retention, may be commonly explained by social motivations/vigilance
   (amygdala) and reward processing (reward-related brain regions).
   Neuroscientific tools may be useful for refining the fundamental motive
   framework, and for understanding more fully consumer behaviors rooted in
   evolutionary motives.}},

   fMRI BOLD signals from viewers were examined while they watched the
   thin-sliced TED talks. The results showed significantly greater
   activation in the parts of the occipitotemporal cortex related to visual
   motion and social cognition while watching the top 10 clips than when
   watching the bottom 10 clips. In the third experiment, the magnitude of
   motion in the video clips, as quantified by motion vectors, differed

Abstract = {{Guilt is a social emotion that promotes prosocial and moral behaviours.
   It arises as a result of harming or not helping another individual,
   serving as a prompt for the guilty individual to take reparative
   actions, known as restitution. The neural regions involved in feelings
   of guilt are not completely understood, and in particular, regions
   associated with acts of restitution are not known. We employed a novel
   social decision-making fMRI paradigm involving decisions to donate to
   charities, with feedback designed to illicit guilt and a second
   opportunity to help. Whole-brain analysis demonstrated that decisions
   not to help an individual in need were associated with increased
   activity in the amygdala, insula, and middle temporal gyrus. In an
   exploratory analysis we observed a positive correlation between trait
   guilt and activity in vIPFC and mPFC during acts of restitution. These
   results extend models of decision making to suggest vIPFC and mPFC play
   important roles not only in processing aversive social cues and updating
   response decisions, but that their activity may support individual
   differences in such prosocial decisions. The results also support the
   role of the anterior insula in guilt-related decision making,
   identifying these regions as potential targets for interventions in
   neuropsychiatric disorders featuring deficient guilt. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   the malleability of human behavior}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Brain activity in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during exposure to
   persuasive messages can predict health behavior change. This
   brain-behavior relationship has been linked to areas of MPFC previously
   associated with self-related processing; however, the mechanism
   underlying this relationship is unclear. We explore two components of
   self-related processing-self-reflection and subjective valuation- and
   examine coherent activity between relevant networks of brain regions
   during exposure to health messages encouraging exercise and discouraging
   sedentary behaviors. We find that objectively logged reductions in
   sedentary behavior in the following month are linked to functional
   connectivity within brain regions associated with positive valuation,
   but not within regions associated with self-reflection on personality
   traits. Furthermore, functional connectivity between valuation regions
   contributes additional information compared to average brain activation
   within single brain regions. These data support an account in which MPFC
   integrates the value of messages to the self during persuasive health
   messaging and speak to broader questions of how humans make decisions
   about how to behave.}},

Title = {{Transfer Effects to a Multimodal Dual-Task after Working Memory Training
   and Associated Neural Correlates in Older Adults - A Pilot Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{FEB 24}},
Abstract = {{Working memory (WM) performance declines with age. However, several
   studies have shown that WM training may lead to performance increases
   not only in the trained task, but also in untrained cognitive transfer
   tasks. It has been suggested that transfer effects occur if training
   task and transfer task share specific processing components that are
   supposedly processed in the same brain areas. In the current study, we
   investigated whether single-task WM training and training-related
   alterations in neural activity might support performance in a dual-task
   setting, thus assessing transfer effects to higher-order control
   processes in the context of dual-task coordination. A sample of older
   adults (age 60-72) was assigned to either a training or control group.
   The training group participated in 12 sessions of an adaptive n-back
   training. At pre and post-measurement, a multimodal dual-task was
   performed in all participants to assess transfer effects. This task
   consisted of two simultaneous delayed match to sample WM tasks using two
   different stimulus modalities (visual and auditory) that were performed
   either in isolation (single-task) or in conjunction (dual-task). A
   subgroup also participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) during the performance of the n-back task before and after
   training. While no transfer to single-task performance was found,
   dual-task costs in both the visual modality (p < 0.05) and the auditory
   modality (p < 0.05) decreased at post-measurement in the training but
   not in the control group. In the fMRI subgroup of the training
   participants, neural activity changes in left dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (DLPFC) during one-back predicted post-training auditory
   dual-task costs, while neural activity changes in right DLPFC during
   three-back predicted visual dual-task costs. Results might indicate an
   improvement in central executive processing that could facilitate both
   WM and dual-task coordination.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging evidence implicates the association between rumination and
   default mode network (DMN) in major depressive disorder (MDD). However,
   the relationship between rumination and DMN subsystems remains
   incompletely understood, especially in patients with MDD. Thirty-three
   first-episode drug-naive patients with MDD and thirty-three healthy
   controls (HCs) were enrolled and underwent resting-sate fMRI scanning.
   Functional connectivity analysis was performed based on 11 pre-defined
   regions of interest (ROIs) for three DMN subsystems: the midline core,
   dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL).
   Compared with HCs group, patients with MDD exhibited increased
   within-system connectivity in the dMPFC subsystem and inter-system
   connectivity between the dMPFC and MTL subsystems. Decreased
   inter-system connectivity was identified between the midline core and
   dMPFC subsystem in MDD patients. Depressive rumination was positively
   correlated with within-system connectivity in the dMPFC subsystem
   (dMPFC-TempP) and with inter-system connectivity between the dMPFC and
   MTL subsystems (LTC-PHC). Our results suggest MDD may be characterized
   by abnormal DMN subsystems connectivity, which may contribute to the
   pathophysiology of the maladaptive self-focus in MDD patients.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Third-party altruistic decision-making has been shown to be modulated by
   other-regarding attention (e.g., focusing on the offender's crime or the
   victim's situation especially in judicial judgment). However, the neural
   mechanisms underlying this modulation remain poorly understood. In this
   fMRI study, participants voluntarily decided if they wanted to punish
   the first-party offender or help the second-party victim using their own
   monetary endowment in an unfair context. Particularly, before deciding
   they were asked to focus on the (un) fairness of the offender proposing
   the offer (offender-focused block, OB), the feeling of the victim
   receiving this offer (victim-focused block, VB), or without any specific
   focus (baseline block, BB). We found that compared to BB participants
   punished more frequently and prolonged help choices in OB, whereas they
   helped more frequently in VB. These findings were accompanied by an
   increased activation in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) during
   decision making in OB and VB. Moreover, regions relevant to cognitive
   control (esp. IFG/AI and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) were
   strongly recruited during specific choices conflicting the attention
   focus (e.g., choosing help in OB). Our findings revealed how
   other-regarding attention modulates third-party altruistic

Title = {{Different brain structures associated with artistic and scientific
   creativity: a voxel-based morphometry study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Creativity is the ability to produce original and valuable ideas or
   behaviors. In real life, artistic and scientific creativity promoted the
   development of human civilization; however, to date, no studies have
   systematically investigated differences in the brain structures
   responsible for artistic and scientific creativity in a large sample.
   Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), this study identified differences
   in regional gray matter volume (GMV) across the brain between artistic
   and scientific creativity (assessed by the Creative Achievement
   Questionnaire) in 356 young, healthy subjects. The results showed that
   artistic creativity was significantly negatively associated with the
   regional GMV of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC). In contrast, scientific creativity was
   significantly positively correlated with the regional GMV of the left
   middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG).
   Overall, artistic creativity was associated with the salience network
   (SN), whereas scientific creativity was associated with the executive
   attention network and semantic processing. These results may provide an
   effective marker that can be used to predict and evaluate individuals'
   creative performance in the fields of science and art.}},

   with semantic dementia highlight the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) as an
   amodal store of semantic knowledge but these studies do not permit
   precise localisation of this function. The current investigation used
   multiple imaging methods in healthy participants to examine functional
   dissociations within ATL. Multi-voxel pattern analysis identified
   spatially segregated regions: a response to input modality in anterior
   superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) and a response to meaning in more ventral
   anterior temporal lobe (vATL). This functional dissociation was
   supported by resting-state connectivity that found greater coupling for
   aSTG with primary auditory cortex and vATL with the default mode
   network. A meta-analytic decoding of these connectivity patterns
   implicated aSTG in processes closely tied to auditory processing (such
   as phonology and language) and vATL in meaning-based tasks (such as
   comprehension or social cognition). Thus we provide converging evidence
   for the segregation of meaning and input modality in the ATL.}},

Title = {{Neural correlates of pupil dilation during human fear learning}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{186-197}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fear conditioning and extinction are prevailing experimental
   and etiological models for normal and pathological anxiety. Pupil
   dilations in response to conditioned stimuli are increasingly used as a
   robust psychophysiological readout of fear learning, but their neural
   correlates remain unknown. We aimed at identifying the neural correlates
   of pupil responses to threat and safety cues during a fear learning
   task.
   Methods: Thirty-four healthy subjects underwent a fear conditioning and
   extinction paradigm with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) and pupillometry. After a stringent preprocessing and
   artifact rejection procedure, trial-wise pupil responses to threat and
   safety cues were entered as parametric modulations to the fMRI general
   linear models.
   Results: Trial-wise magnitude of pupil responses to both conditioned and
   safety stimuli correlated positively with activity in dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC), thalamus, supramarginal gyrus and insula for
   the entire fear learning task, and with activity in the dACC during the
   fear conditioning phase in particular. Phasic pupil responses did not
   show habituation, but were negatively correlated with tonic baseline
   pupil diameter, which decreased during the task. Correcting phasic pupil
   responses for the tonic baseline pupil diameter revealed thalamic
   activity, which was also observed in an analysis employing a linear
   (declining) time modulation.
   Conclusion: Pupil dilations during fear conditioning and extinction
   provide useful readouts to track fear learning on a trial-by-trial
   level, particularly with simultaneous fMRI. Whereas phasic pupil
   responses reflect activity in brain regions involved in fear learning
   and threat appraisal, most prominently in dACC, tonic changes in pupil
   diameter may reflect changes in general arousal.}},

Title = {{Intranasal oxytocin reduces social perception in women: Neural
   activation and individual variation}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{314-329}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Most intranasal oxytocin research to date has been carried out in men,
   but recent studies indicate that females' responses can differ
   substantially from males'. This randomized, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled study involved an all-female sample of 28 women not
   using hormonal contraception. Participants viewed animations of
   geometric shapes depicting either random movement or social interactions
   such as playing, chasing, or fighting. Probe questions asked whether any
   shapes were ``friends{''} or ``not friends.{''} Social videos were
   preceded by cues to attend to either social relationships or physical
   size changes. All subjects received intranasal placebo spray at scan 1.
   While the experimenter was not blinded to nasal spray contents at Scan
   1, the participants were. Scan 2 followed a randomized, double-blind
   design. At scan 2, half received a second placebo dose while the other
   half received 24 III of intranasal oxytocin. We measured neural
   responses to these animations at baseline, as well as the change in
   neural activity induced by oxytocin. Oxytocin reduced activation in
   early visual cortex and dorsal-stream motion processing regions for the
   social > size contrast, indicating reduced activity related to social
   attention. Oxytocin also reduced endorsements that shapes were
   ``friends{''} or ``not friends,{''} and this significantly correlated
   with reduction in neural activation. Furthermore, participants who
   perceived fewer social relationships at baseline were more likely to
   show oxytocin-induced increases in a broad network of regions involved
   in social perception and social cognition, suggesting that lower social
   processing at baseline may predict more positive neural responses to
   oxytocin.}},

   abilities}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{409-422}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Despite the thousands of papers investigating the neural basis of face
   perception in both humans and non-human primates, very little is known
   about how activation within this neural architecture relates to face
   processing behavior. Here, we investigated individual differences in
   brain-behavior correspondences within both core and extended regions of
   the face-processing system in healthy typically developing adults. To do
   so, we employed a set of behavioral and neural measures to capture a
   multifaceted perspective on assessing these brain-behavior relations.
   This included quantifying face and object recognition behavior, the
   magnitude and size of functional activation within each region, as well
   as a measure of global activation across regions. We report that face,
   but not object, recognition behavior was associated with I) the
   magnitude of face-selective activation in the left FFA]., 2) larger
   face-related regions in multiple bilateral face-patches in the fusiform
   gyri as well as the bilateral anterior temporal lobe and amygdala, and
   3) more distributed global face-network activation. In contrast, face
   recognition behavior was not associated with any measure of object- or
   place-selective activation. These findings suggest that superior
   behavior is served by engaging sufficiently large, distributed patches
   of neural real estate, which might reflect the integration of
   independent populations of neurons that enables the formation of richer
   representations.}},

Title = {{The neural circuits for arithmetic principles}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{432-446}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Arithmetic principles are the regularities underlying arithmetic
   computation. Little is known about how the brain supports the processing
   of arithmetic principles. The current fMRI study examined neural
   activation and functional connectivity during the processing of
   verbalized arithmetic principles, as compared to numerical computation
   and general language processing. As expected, arithmetic principles
   elicited stronger activation in bilateral horizontal intraparietal
   sulcus and right supramarginal gyms than did language processing, and
   stronger activation in left middle temporal lobe and left orbital part
   of inferior frontal gyrus than did computation. In contrast, computation
   elicited greater activation in bilateral horizontal intraparietal sulcus
   (extending to posterior superior parietal lobule) than did either
   arithmetic principles or language processing. Functional connectivity
   analysis with the psychophysiological interaction approach (PPI) showed
   that left temporal-parietal (MTG-HIPS) connectivity was stronger during
   the processing of arithmetic principle and language than during
   computation, whereas parietal-occipital connectivities were stronger
   during computation than during the processing of arithmetic principles
   and language. Additionally, the left fronto-parietal (orbital IFG-HIPS)
   connectivity was stronger during the processing of arithmetic principles
   than during computation. The results suggest that verbalized arithmetic
   principles engage a neural network that overlaps but is distinct from
   the networks for computation and language processing.}},

Title = {{Relationship of a common OXTR gene variant to brain structure and

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},

Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{500-506}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{A large body of research suggests that oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene
   polymorphisms may influence both social behaviors and psychiatric
   conditions related to social deficits, such as autism spectrum disorders
   (ASDs), schizophrenia, and mood and anxiety disorders. However, the
   neural mechanism underlying these associations is still unclear.
   Relative to controls, patients with these psychiatric conditions show
   differences in brain structure, and in resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI)
   signal synchronicity among default mode network (DMN) regions (also
   known as functional connectivity). We used a stepwise imaging genetics
   approach in 328 healthy young adults to test the hypothesis that 10 SNPs
   in OXTR are associated with differences in DMN synchronicity and
   structure of some of the associated brain regions. As OXTR effects may
   be sex-dependent, we also tested whether our findings were modulated by
   sex. OXTR rs2254298 A allele carriers had significantly lower rsFC with
   PCC in a cluster extending from the right fronto-insular cortex to the
   putamen and globus pallidus, and in bilateral dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex (dACC) compared to individuals with the GG genotype; all observed
   effects were found only in males. Moreover, compared to the male
   individuals with GG genotype ofrs2254298, the male A allele carriers
   demonstrated significantly thinner cortical gray matter in the bilateral
   dACC. Our findings suggest that there may be sexually dimorphic
   mechanisms by which a naturally occurring variation of the OXTR gene may
   influence brain structure and function in DMN-related regions implicated
   in neuropsychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive emotion regulation (CER) is a critical human ability to face
   aversive emotional stimuli in a flexible way, via recruitment of
   specific prefrontal brain circuits. Animal research reveals a central

   findings from animal research to human CER, we hypothesized that
   successful CER would affect the balance of competing influences of
   striatal afferents on striatal aPE signals, in a way favoring PFC as
   opposed to subcortical (i.e., non-isocortical) striatal inputs. Using
   aversive Pavlovian conditioning with and without CER during fMRI, we
   found that during CER, superior regulators indeed reduced the modulatory
   impact of subcortical striatal afferents (hippocampus, amygdala and VTA)
   on ventral striatal aPE signals, while keeping the PFC impact intact. In
   contrast, inferior regulators showed an opposite pattern. Our results
   demonstrate that ventral striatal aPE signals and associated competing
   modulatory inputs are critical mechanisms underlying successful
   cognitive regulation of aversive emotions in humans.}},

Title = {{GABRB1 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Associated with Altered Brain
   Responses (but not Performance) during Measures of Impulsivity and
   Reward Sensitivity in Human Adolescents}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Variations in genes encoding several GABA(A) receptors have been
   associated with human drug and alcohol abuse. Among these, a number of
   human studies have suggested an association between GABRB1, the gene
   encoding GABA(A) receptor beta 1 subunits, with Alcohol dependence (AD),
   both on its own and comorbid with other substance dependence and
   psychiatric illnesses. In the present study, we hypothesized that the
   GABRB1 genetically-associated increased risk for developing alcoholism
   may be associated with impaired behavioral control and altered
   sensitivity to reward, as a consequence of altered brain function.
   Exploiting the IMAGEN database (Schumann et al., 2010), we explored in a
   human adolescent population whether possession of the minor (T) variant
   of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2044081 is associated with
   performance of tasks measuring aspects of impulsivity, and reward
   sensitivity that are implicated in drug and alcohol abuse. Allelic
   variation did not associate with altered performance in either a
   stop-signal task (SST), measuring one aspect of impulsivity, or a
   monetary incentive delay (MID) task assessing reward anticipation.
   However, increased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) response in the right hemisphere
   inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left hemisphere caudate/insula and left
   hemisphere inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) during MID performance was
   higher in the minor (T) allelic group. In contrast, during SST
   performance, the BOLD response found in the right hemisphere
   supramarginal gyrus, right hemisphere lingual and left hemisphere
   inferior parietal gyrus indicated reduced responses in the minor
   genotype. We suggest that beta 1-containing GABA(A) receptors may play a
   role in excitability of brain regions important in controlling
   reward-related behavior, which may contribute to susceptibility to
   addictive behavior.}},

Title = {{Increased anterior cingulate cortex response precedes behavioural

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) are characterised by increased
   self-control, cognitive rigidity and impairments in set-shifting, but
   the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the neural
   correlates of behavioural adaptation to changes in reward contingencies
   in young acutely ill AN patients. Thirty-six adolescent/young adult,
   non-chronic female AN patients and 36 age-matched healthy females
   completed a wellestablished probabilistic reversal learning task during
   fMRI. We analysed hemodynamic responses in empirically-defined regions
   of interest during positive feedback and negative feedback not
   followed/followed by behavioural adaptation and conducted functional
   connectivity analyses. Although overall task performance was comparable
   between groups, AN showed increased shifting after receiving negative
   feedback (lose-shift behaviour) and altered dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex (dACC) responses as a function of feedback. Specifically,
   patients had increased dACC responses (which correlated with
   perfectionism) and task-related coupling with amygdala preceding
   behavioural adaption. Given the generally preserved task performance in
   young AN, elevated dACC responses specifically during behavioural
   adaption is suggestive of increased monitoring for the need to adjust
   performance strategies. Higher dACC-amygdala coupling and increased
   adaptation after negative feedback underlines this interpretation and
   could be related to intolerance of uncertainty which has been suggested
   for AN.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromodulators such as dopamine can alter the intrinsic firing
   properties of neurons and may thereby change the configuration of larger
   functional circuits. The primate orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) receives
   dopaminergic input from midbrain nuclei, but the role of dopamine in the
   OFC is still unclear. Here we tested the idea that dopaminergic activity
   changes the pattern of connectivity between the OFC and the rest of the
   brain and thereby reconfigures functional networks in the OFC. To this
   end, we combined double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacology {[}D-2
   receptor (D2R) antagonist amisulpride] in humans with resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and clustering methods. In the
   placebo group, we replicated previously observed parcellations of the
   OFC into two and six subregions based on connectivity patterns with the
   rest of the brain. Most importantly, while the twofold clustering did
   not differ significantly between groups, blocking D2Rs significantly
   changed the composition of the sixfold parcellation, suggesting a
   dopamine-dependent reconfiguration of functional OFC subregions.
   Moreover, multivariate decoding analyses revealed that amisulpride
   changed the whole-brain connectivity patterns of individual OFC
   subregions. In particular, D2R blockade shifted the balance of OFC
   connectivity from associative areas in the temporal and parietal lobe
   toward functional connectivity with the frontal cortex. In summary, our
   results suggest that dopamine alters the composition of functional OFC
   circuits, possibly indicating a broader role for neuromodulators in the
   dynamic reconfiguration of functional brain networks.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Social interaction inherently involves the subjective evaluation of cues
   salient to social inclusion and exclusion. Testifying to the importance
   of such social cues, parts of the neural system dedicated to the
   detection of physical pain, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)
   and anterior insula (AI), have been shown to be equally sensitive to the
   detection of social pain experienced after social exclusion. However,
   recent work suggests that this dACC-AI matrix may index any socially
   pertinent information. We directly tested the hypothesis that the
   dACC-AI would respond to cues of both inclusion and exclusion, using a
   novel social feedback fMRI paradigm in a population-derived sample of
   adolescents. We show that the dACC and left AI are commonly activated by
   feedback cues of inclusion and exclusion. Our findings suggest that
   theoretical accounts of the dACC-AI network as a neural alarm system
   restricted within the social domain to the processing of signals of
   exclusion require significant revision.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive impairment is one of the most common problem saffecting older
   adults. In this study, we investigated whether Tai Chi Chuan and
   Baduanjin practice can modulate mental control functionand the resting

   older adults. Participants in the two exercise groups practiced either
   Tai Chi Chuan or Baduanjin for 12 weeks, and those in the control group
   received basic health education. Memory tests and fMRI scans were
   conducted at baseline and at the end of the study. Seed-based (bilateral
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC) rsFC analysis was performed. We
   found that compared to the controls, 1) both Tai Chi Chuan and Baduanjin
   groups demonstrated significant improvements in mental control function;
   2) the Tai Chi Chuan group showed a significant decrease in rsFC between
   the DLPFC and the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and anterior
   cingulate cortex; and 3) the Baduanjin group showed a significant
   decrease in rsFC between the DLPFC and the left putamen and insula.
   Mental control improvement was negatively associated with rsFC
   DLPFC-putamen changes across all subjects. These findings demonstrate

Abstract = {{Increasing recent research has sought to understand the recollection
   impairments experienced by individuals with autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD). Here, we tested whether these memory deficits reflect a reduction
   in the probability of retrieval success or in the precision of memory
   representations. We also used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to study the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding and
   retrieval in ASD, focusing particularly on the functional connectivity
   of core episodic memory networks. Adults with ASD and typical control
   participants completed a memory task that involved studying visual
   displays and subsequently using a continuous dial to recreate their
   appearance. The ASD group exhibited reduced retrieval success, but there
   was no evidence of a difference in retrieval precision. fMRI data
   revealed similar patterns of brain activity and functional connectivity
   during memory encoding in the 2 groups, though encoding-related lateral
   frontal activity predicted subsequent retrieval success only in the
   control group. During memory retrieval, the ASD group exhibited
   attenuated lateral frontal activity and substantially reduced
   hippocampal connectivity, particularly between hippocampus and regions
   of the fronto-parietal control network. These findings demonstrate
   notable differences in brain function during episodic memory retrieval
   in ASD and highlight the importance of functional connectivity to
   understanding recollection-related retrieval deficits in this
   population.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   investigate how spontaneous activity interacts with evoked activity, as
   well as how the temporal structure of spontaneous activity, that is,
   long-range temporal correlations, relate to this interaction. Using an
   extremely sparse event-related design (intertrial intervals: 52-60 s), a
   novel blood oxygen level-dependent signal correction approach
   (accounting for spontaneous fluctuations using pseudotrials) and phase
   analysis, we provided direct evidence for a nonadditive interaction
   between spontaneous and evoked activity. We demonstrated the discrepancy
   between the present and previous observations on why a linear
   superposition between spontaneous and evoked activity can be seen by
   using co-occurring signals from homologous brain regions. Importantly,
   we further demonstrated that the nonadditive interaction can be
   characterized by phase-dependent effects of spontaneous activity, which
   is closely related to the degree of long-range temporal correlations in
   spontaneous activity as indexed by both power-law exponent and
   phase-amplitude coupling. Our findings not only contribute to the
   understanding of spontaneous brain activity and its scale-free
   properties, but also bear important implications for our understanding
   of neural activity in general.}},

Abstract = {{Preterm infants face an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD). The relationship between autism during childhood and early brain
   development remains unexplored. We studied 84 preterm children born at
   <27 weeks of gestation, who underwent neonatal magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) at term and were screened for ASD at 6.5 years. Full-scale
   intelligence quotient was measured and neonatal morbidities were
   recorded. Structural brain morphometric studies were performed in 33
   infants with high-quality MRI and no evidence of focal brain lesions.
   Twenty-three (27.4\%) of the children tested ASD positive and 61
   (72.6\%) tested ASD negative. The ASD-positive group had a significantly
   higher frequency of neonatal complications than the ASD-negative group.
   In the subgroup of 33 children, the ASD infants had reduced volumes in
   the temporal, occipital, insular, and limbic regions and in the brain
   areas involved in social/behavior and salience integration. This study
   shows that the neonatal MRI scans of extremely preterm children,
   subsequently diagnosed with ASD at 6.5 years, showed brain structural
   alterations, localized in the regions that play a key role in the core
   features of autism. Early detection of these structural alterations may
   allow the early identification and intervention of children at risk of
   ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial navigation is a crucial ability for living. Previous animal
   studies have shown that the S100B gene is causally related to spatial
   navigation performance in mice. However, the genetic factors influencing
   human navigation and its neural substrates remain unclear. Here, we
   provided the first evidence that the S100B gene modulates neural
   processing of navigationally relevant scenes in humans. First, with a
   novel protocol, we demonstrated that the spatial pattern of S100B gene
   expression in postmortem brains was associated with brain activation
   pattern for spatial navigation in general, and for scene processing in
   particular. Further, in a large fMRI cohort of healthy adults of Han
   Chinese (N = 202), we found that S100B gene polymorphisms modulated
   scene selectivity in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and parahippocampal
   place area. Finally, the serum levels of S100B protein mediated the
   association between S100B gene polymorphismand scene selectivity in the
   RSC. Our study takes the first step toward understanding the
   neurogenetic mechanism of human spatial navigation and suggests a novel
   approach to discover candidate genes modulating cognitive functions.}},

Abstract = {{Narratives are an important component of culture and play a central role
   in transmitting social values. Little is known, however, about how the
   brain of a listener/reader processes narratives. A receiver's response
   to narration is influenced by the narrator's framing and appeal to
   values. Narratives that appeal to ``protected values,{''} including core
   personal, national, or religious values, may be particularly effective
   at influencing receivers. Protected values resist compromise and are
   tied with identity, affective value, moral decision-making, and other
   aspects of social cognition. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms
   underlying reactions to protected values in narratives. During fMRI
   scanning, we presented 78 American, Chinese, and Iranian participants
   with real-life stories distilled from a corpus of over 20 million
   weblogs. Reading these stories engaged the posterior medial, medial
   prefrontal, and temporo-parietal cortices. When participants believed
   that the protagonist was appealing to a protected value, signal in these
   regions was increased compared with when no protected value was
   perceived, possibly reflecting the intensive and iterative search
   required to process this material. The effect strength also varied
   across groups, potentially reflecting cultural differences in the degree
   of concern for protected values.}},

   Within face-responsive regions, emotional faces evoke stronger responses
   than neutral faces ({''}valence effect{''}). We used fMRI and Dynamic
   Causal Modeling (DCM)to test the hypothesis that emotional faces
   differentially alter the functional coupling among face- responsive
   regions. Three monkeys viewed conspecific faces with neutral,
   threatening, fearful, and appeasing expressions. Using Bayesian model
   selection, various models of neural interactions between the posterior
   (TEO) and anterior (TE) portions of inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the
   amygdala, the orbitofrontal (OFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   (VLPFC) were tested. The valence effect was mediated by feedback
   connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO, and feedback connections
   from VLPFC to the amygdala and TE. Emotional faces were associated with
   differential effective connectivity: Fearful faces evoked stronger
   modulations in the connections from the amygdala to TE and TEO;
   threatening faces evoked weaker modulations in the connections from the
   amygdala and VLPFC to TE; and appeasing faces evoked weaker modulations
   in the connection from VLPFC to the amygdala. Our results suggest
   dynamic alterations in neural coupling during the perception of
   behaviorally relevant facial expressions that are vital for social
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{Previous memory research has exploited the perceptual similarities
   between lures and targets in order to evoke false memories.
   Nevertheless, while some studies have attempted to use lures that are
   objectively more similar than others, no study has systematically
   controlled for perceptual overlap between target and lure items and its
   role in accounting for false alarm rates or the neural processes
   underlying such perceptual false memories. The current study looked to
   fill this gap in the literature by using a face-morphing program to
   systematically control for the amount of perceptual overlap between
   lures and targets. Our results converge with previous studies in finding
   a pattern of differences between true and false memories. Most
   importantly, expanding upon this work, parametric analyses showed false
   memory activity increases with respect to the similarity between lures
   and targets within bilateral middle temporal gyri and right medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Moreover, this pattern of activation was
   unique to false memories and could not be accounted for by relatedness
   alone. Connectivity analyses further find that activity in the mPFC and
   left middle temporal gyrus co-vary, suggestive of gist-based monitoring
   within the context of false memories. Interestingly, neither the MTL nor
   the fusiform face area exhibited modulation as a function of target-lure
   relatedness. Overall, these results provide insight into the processes
   underlying false memories and further enhance our understanding of the
   role perceptual similarity plays in supporting false memories. (C) 2016

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{52-60}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The majority of human neuroscience research has focussed on
   understanding functional organisation within segregated patches of
   cortex. The ventral visual stream has been associated with the detection
   of physical features such as faces and body parts, whereas the
   theory-of-mind network has been associated with making inferences about
   mental states and underlying character, such as whether someone is
   friendly, selfish, or generous. To date, however, it is largely unknown
   how such distinct processing components integrate neural signals. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging and connectivity analyses, we
   investigated the contribution of functional integration to social
   perception. During scanning, participants observed bodies that had
   previously been associated with trait-based or neutral information.
   Additionally, we independently localised the body perception and
   theory-of-mind networks. We demonstrate that when observing someone who
   cues the recall of stored social knowledge compared to non-social
   knowledge, a node in the ventral visual stream (extrastriate body area)
   shows greater coupling with part of the theory-of-mind network (temporal
   pole). These results show that functional connections provide an
   interface between perceptual and inferential processing components, thus
   providing neurobiological evidence that supports the view that
   understanding the visual environment involves interplay between
   conceptual knowledge and perceptual processing.}},

Title = {{Similar patterns of brain activation abnormalities during emotional and

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{164-174}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Schizophrenia patients have impaired performance and abnormal brain
   activation during facial emotion recognition, which may represent a
   marker of genetic liability to schizophrenia. However, it remains
   unclear whether the impairment is specific to recognizing emotion from
   faces or is instead attributable to more generalized dysfunction. The
   current study aimed to distinguish between specific and generalized
   neural dysfunction underlying impaired facial emotion recognition in
   schizophrenia and examine associations with genetic liability.
   Twenty-eight schizophrenia patients, 27 nonpsychotic first-degree
   relatives, and 27 community controls underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging while making judgments about either the emotion or age
   of emotional faces. Patients had performance deficits during the emotion
   and age discrimination conditions compared to relatives and controls,
   while relatives had intact performance. Patients had hypoactivation
   compared to controls across conditions, mainly in medial prefrontal
   cortex. Unlike controls, patients demonstrated a failure to recruit the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in social cognition and
   decision-making, and relatives had a pattern of recruitment intermediate
   between patients and controls. Compared to controls, relatives had
   greater deactivation of regions associated with the default mode
   network, and patients had similar findings during age discrimination.
   The common patterns of performance deficits and activation abnormalities
   during emotion and age discrimination in schizophrenia suggest that
   generalized cognitive impairment, notably in social cognition and
   decision-making, contributes to impaired facial emotion recognition.
   Similar functional activation patterns in relatives, despite intact
   performance, suggest that brain activation may represent a more
   sensitive marker of genetic liability than behaviour. Hyperdeactivation
   of default mode network regions in relatives may represent cognitive
   inefficiency, or compensatory mechanisms that help maintain intact
   performance.}},

Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{175-183}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by negatively biased
   perception of social cues and deficits in emotion regulation. While
   negatively biased perception is thought to maintain social anxiety,
   emotion regulation represents an ability necessary to overcome both
   biased perception and social anxiety. Here, we used laughter as a social
   threat in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to
   identify cerebral mediators linking SAD with attention and
   interpretation biases and their modification through cognitive emotion
   regulation in the form of reappraisal. We found that reappraisal
   abolished the negative laughter interpretation bias in SAD and that this
   process was directly mediated through activation patterns of the left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) serving as a cerebral pivot
   between biased social perception and its normalization through
   reappraisal. Connectivity analyses revealed reduced prefrontal control
   over threat processing sensory cortices (here: the temporal voice area)
   during cognitive emotion regulation in SAD. Our results indicate a
   central role for the left DLPFC in SAD which might represent a valuable
   target for future research on interventions either aiming to directly
   modulate cognitive emotion regulation in SAD or to evaluate its
   potential as physiological marker for psychotherapeutic interventions
   relying on emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Williams syndrome (WS), a genetic disorder resulting from
   hemizygous microdeletion of chromosome 7q11.23, has emerged as a model
   for identifying the genetic architecture of socioemotional behavior.
   Common polymorphisms in GTF2I, which is found within the WS
   microdeletion, have been associated with reduced social anxiety in the
   general population. Identifying neural phenotypes affected by these
   polymorphisms would help advance our understanding not only of this
   specific genetic association but also of the broader neurogenetic
   mechanisms of variability in socioemotional behavior.
   METHODS: Through an ongoing parent protocol, the Duke Neurogenetics
   Study, we measured threat-related amygdala reactivity to fearful and
   angry facial expressions using functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   assessed trait personality using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory,
   and imputed GTF2I rs13227433 from saliva-derived DNA using custom
   Illumina arrays. Participants included 808 non-Hispanic Caucasian,
   African American, and Asian university students.
   RESULTS: The GTF2I rs13227433 AA genotype, previously associated with
   lower social anxiety, predicted decreased threat-related amygdala
   reactivity. An indirect effect of GTF2I genotype on the warmth facet of
   extraversion was mediated by decreased threat-related amygdala
   reactivity in women but not men.
   CONCLUSIONS: A common polymorphism in the WS gene GTF2I associated with
   reduced social anxiety predicts decreased threat-related amygdala
   reactivity, which mediates an association between genotype and increased
   warmth in women. These results are consistent with reduced
   threat-related amygdala reactivity in WS and suggest that common
   variation in GTF2I contributes to broader variability in socioemotional
   brain function and behavior, with implications for understanding the
   neurogenetic bases of WS as well as social anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Two-person neuroscience, a perspective in understanding human social
   cognition and interaction, involves designing immersive social
   interaction experiments as well as simultaneously recording brain
   activity of two or more subjects, a process termed ``hyperscanning.{''}
   Using newly developed imaging techniques, the interbrain connectivity or
   hyperlink of various types of social interaction has been revealed.
   Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-hyperscanning provides a
   more naturalistic environment for experimental paradigms of social
   interaction and has recently drawn much attention. However, most
   fNIRS-hyperscanning studies have computed hyperlinks using sensor data
   directly while ignoring the fact that the sensor-level signals contain
   confounding noises, which may lead to a loss of sensitivity and
   specificity in hyperlink analysis. In this study, on the basis of
   independent component analysis (ICA), a source-level analysis framework
   is proposed to investigate the hyperlinks in a fNIRS two-person
   neuroscience study. The performance of five widely used ICA algorithms
   in extracting sources of interaction was compared in simulative
   datasets, and increased sensitivity and specificity of hyperlink
   analysis by our proposed method were demonstrated in both simulative and
   real two-person experiments. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{The processing of reward and reinforcement learning seems to be
   important determinants of pain chronicity. However, reward processing is
   already altered early in life and if this is related to the development
   of pain symptoms later on is not known. The aim of this study was first
   to examine whether behavioural and brain-related indicators of reward
   processing at the age of 14 to 15 years are significant predictors of
   pain complaints 2 years later, at 16 to 17 years. Second, we
   investigated the contribution of genetic variations in the opioidergic
   system, which is linked to the processing of both, reward and pain, to
   this prediction. We used the monetary incentive delay task to assess
   reward processing, the Children's Somatization Inventory as measure of
   pain complaints and tested the effects of 2 single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (rs1799971/rs563649) of the human mu-opioid receptor gene.
   We found a significant prediction of pain complaints by responses in the
   dorsal striatum during reward feedback, independent of genetic
   predisposition. The relationship of pain complaints and activation in
   the periaqueductal gray and ventral striatum depended on the T-allele of
   rs563649. Carriers of this allele also showed more pain complaints than
   CC-allele carriers. Therefore, brain responses to reward outcomes and
   higher sensitivity to pain might be related already early in life and
   may thus set the course for pain complaints later in life, partly
   depending on a specific opioidergic genetic predisposition.}},

Abstract = {{Recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies demonstrate that labeling
   one's emotional experiences and perceptions alters those states. Here,
   we used a comprehensive meta-analysis of the neuroimaging literature to
   systematically explore whether the presence of emotion words in
   experimental tasks has an impact on the neural representation of
   emotional experiences and perceptions across studies. Using a database
   of 386 studies, we assessed brain activity when emotionwords (e.g.
   `anger', `disgust') and more general affect words (e.g. `pleasant',
   `unpleasant') were present in experimental tasks vs not present. As
   predicted, when emotion words were present, we observedmore frequent
   activations in regions related to semantic processing. When emotion
   wordswere not present, we observed more frequent activations in the
   amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, bilaterally. The presence of
   affectwords did not have the same effect on the neural representation of
   emotional experiences and perceptions, suggesting that our observed
   effects are specific to emotion words. These findings are consistentwith
   the psychological constructionist prediction that in the absence of
   accessible emotion concepts, the meaning of affective experiences and
   perceptions are ambiguous. Findings are also consistentwith the
   regulatory role of `affect labeling'. Implications of the role of
   language in emotion construction and regulation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the ubiquity of endogenous emotions and their role in both
   resilience and pathology, the processes supporting their generation are
   largely unknown. We propose a neural component processmodel of
   endogenous generation of emotion (EGE) and test it in two functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments (N = 32/293) where
   participants generated and regulated positive and negative emotions
   based on internal representations, usin self-chosen generationmethods.
   EGE activated nodes of salience (SN), defaultmode (DMN) and
   frontoparietal control (FPCN) networks. Component processes implemented
   by these networks were established by investigating their functional
   associations, activation dynamics and integration. SN activation
   correlated with subjective affect, withmidbrain nodes exclusively
   distinguishing between positive and negative affect intensity, showing
   dynamics consistent generation of core affect. Dorsomedial DMN, together
   with ventral anterior insula, formed a pathway supportingmultiple
   generationmethods, with activation dynamics suggesting it is involved in
   the generation of elaborated experiential representations. SN and DMN
   both coupled to left frontal FPCN which in turn was associated with both
   subjective affect and representation formation, consistent with FPCN
   supporting the executive coordination of the generation process. These
   results provide a foundation for research into endogenous emotion in
   normal, pathological and optimal function.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic alliance and perceived social support are important
   predictors of treatment response for post-traumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD). Intranasal oxytocin administration may enhance treatment
   response by increasing sensitivity for social reward and thereby
   therapeutic alliance and perceived social support. As a first step to
   investigate this therapeutical potential, we investigated whether
   intranasal oxytocin enhances neural sensitivity to social reward in PTSD
   patients. Male and female police officers with (n = 35) and without PTSD
   (n = 37) were included in a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled
   cross- over fMRI study. After intranasal oxytocin (40 IU) and placebo
   administration, a social incentive delay task was conducted to
   investigate neural responses during social reward and punishment
   anticipation and feedback. Under placebo, PTSD patients showed reduced
   left anterior insula (AI) responses to social rewards (i. e. happy
   faces) compared with controls. Oxytocin administration increased left AI
   responses during social reward in PTSD patients, such that PTSD patients
   no longer differed from controls under placebo. Furthermore, in PTSD
   patients, oxytocin increased responses to social reward in the right
   putamen. By normalizing abberant insula responses and increasing putamen
   responses to social reward, oxytocin administration may enhance
   sensitivity for social support and therapeutic alliance in PTSD
   patients. Future studies are needed to investigate clinical effects of
   oxytocin.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by
   severe deficits in social communication, whereby the nature of their
   impairments in emotional prosody processing have yet to be specified.
   Here, we investigated emotional prosody processing in individuals with
   ASD and controls with novel, lifelike behavioral and neuroimaging
   paradigms. Compared to controls, individuals with ASD showed reduced
   emotional prosody recognition accuracy on a behavioral task. On the
   neural level, individuals with ASD displayed reduced activity of the
   STS, insula and amygdala for complex vs basic emotions compared to
   controls. Moreover, the coupling between the STS and amygdala for
   complex vs basic emotions was reduced in the ASD group. Finally, groups
   differed with respect to the relationship between brain activity and
   behavioral performance. Brain activity during emotional prosody
   processing was more strongly related to prosody recognition accuracy in
   ASD participants. In contrast, the coupling between STS and anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) activity predicted behavioral task performance
   more strongly in the control group. These results provide evidence for
   aberrant emotional prosody processing of individuals with ASD. They
   suggest that the differences in the relationship between the neural and
   behavioral level of individuals with ASD may account for their observed
   deficits in social communication.}},

Abstract = {{The onset of adolescence is associated with an increased tendency to
   engage in risky behaviors and a developmental shift toward peers that
   contributes to increased prioritization for learning about and achieving
   social status. There is relatively little understanding about the
   specific links between these adolescent-typical phenomena, particularly
   regarding their neural underpinnings. Based on existing models that
   suggest the role of puberty in promoting adolescent status-seeking and
   risk-taking tendencies, we investigated the relation of pubertal
   hormones with behavioral and neural responses to statusrelevant social
   information in the context of risk taking. We used a probabilistic
   decision task in which 11-to 13-year-old girls chose to take a risk, or
   not, while receiving either social rank or monetary performance
   feedback. While feedback type did not differentially influence
   risk-taking behavior, whole-brain imaging results showed that activation
   in the anterior insula was increased for risk taking in the social rank
   feedback condition compared to the monetary feedback condition. This
   heightened activation was more pronounced in girls with higher estradiol
   levels. These findings suggest that brain processes involved in
   adolescent risky decisions may be influenced by the desire for
   social-status enhancement and provide preliminary evidence for the role
   of pubertal hormones in enhancing this adolescent-typical social
   sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Childhood family adversity (CFA) increases the risk for conduct disorder
   (CD) and has been associated with alterations in regions of affective
   processing like ventral striatum (VS) and amygdala. However, no study so
   far has demonstrated neural converging effects of CFA and CD in the same
   sample. At age 25 years, functional MRI data during two affective tasks,
   i. e. a reward (N = 171) and a face-matching paradigm (N = 181) and
   anatomical scans (N = 181) were acquired in right-handed currently
   healthy participants of an epidemiological study followed since birth.
   CFA during childhood was determined using a standardized parent
   interview. Disruptive behaviors and CD diagnoses during childhood and
   adolescence were obtained by diagnostic interview (2-19 years),
   temperamental reward dependence was assessed by questionnaire (15 and 19
   years). CFA predicted increased CD and amygdala volume. Both exposure to
   CFA and CD were associated with a decreased VS response during reward
   anticipation and blunted amygdala activity during face-matching. CD
   mediated the effect of CFA on brain activity. Temperamental reward
   dependence was negatively correlated with CFA and CD and positively with
   VS activity. These findings underline the detrimental effects of CFA on
   the offspring's affective processing and support the importance of early
   postnatal intervention programs aiming to reduce childhood adversity
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Designing persuasive content is challenging, in part because people can
   be poor predictors of their actions. Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
   activation during message exposure reliably predicts downstreambehavior,
   but past work has been largely atheoretical. We replicated past results
   on this relationship and tested two additional framing effects known to
   alter message receptivity. First, we examined gain-vs. loss-framed
   reasons for a health behavior (sunscreen use). Consistent with
   predictions from prospect theory, we observed greater MPFC activity to
   gain-vs. loss-framed messages, and this activity was associated with
   behavior. This relationship was stronger for those who were not
   previously sunscreen users. Second, building on theories of action
   planning, we compared neural activity during messages regarding how vs.
   why to enact the behavior. We observed rostral inferior parietal lobule
   and posterior inferior frontal gyrus activity during action planning
   ({''}how{''} messages), and this activity was associated with behavior;
   this is in contrast to the relationship between MPFC activity during the
   `` why{''} (i. e., gain and loss) messages and behavior. These results
   reinforce that persuasion occurs in part via self-value
   integration-seeing value and incorporating persuasive messages into
   one's self-concept-and extend this work to demonstrate how message
   framing and action planning may influence this process.}},

Abstract = {{Dopamine plays an important role in goal-directed behavior, through its
   modulatory influence on striatal neurons. It is unclear whether tonic
   dopamine levels, which regulate the vigor of acting, interact with the
   phasic dopamine response to reward that drives instrumental behavior. In
   a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, we show
   that methylphenidate, a drug that increases tonic dopamine levels,
   systematically reduced striatal phasic BOLD responses to gain and loss
   in a gambling task as measured with fMRI. It also increased response
   vigor and reward expectancy-related BOLD signals in the ventral
   striatum. These findings suggest that striatal tonic dopamine levels
   constitute an average reward expectation signal that modulates the
   phasic dopaminergic response to reward. This offers opportunities for
   treatment of behavioral disorders associated with abnormal reward

Abstract = {{Eye contact occurs frequently and voluntarily during face-to-face verbal
   communication. However, the neural mechanisms underlying eye contact
   when it is accompanied by spoken language remain unexplored to date.
   Here we used a novel approach, fixation-based event-related functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to simulate the listener making eye
   contact with a speaker during verbal communication. Participants' eye
   movements and fMRI data were recorded simultaneously while they were
   freely viewing a pre-recorded speaker talking. The eye tracking data
   were then used to define events for the fMRI analyses. The results
   showed that eye contact in contrast to mouth fixation involved visual
   cortical areas (cuneus, calcarine sulcus), brain regions related to
   theory of mind/ intentionality processing (temporoparietal junction,
   posterior superior temporal sulcus, medial prefrontal cortex) and the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, increased effective
   connectivity was found between these regions for eye contact in contrast
   to mouth fixations. The results provide first evidence for neural
   mechanisms underlying eye contact when watching and listening to another
   person talking. The network we found might be well suited for processing
   the intentions of communication partners during eye contact in verbal

Abstract = {{Non-verbal communication plays a major role in social interaction
   understanding. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored
   the development of the neural networks involved in social interaction
   recognition based on human motion in children (8-11), adolescents
   (13-17), and adults (20-41). Participants watched point-light videos
   depicting two actors interacting or moving independently and were asked
   whether these agents were interacting or not. All groups successfully
   performed the discrimination task, but children had a lower performance
   and longer response times than the older groups. In all three groups,
   the posterior parts of the superior temporal sulci and middle temporal
   gyri, the inferior frontal gyri and the anterior temporal lobes showed
   greater activation when observing social interactions. In addition,
   adolescents and adults recruited the caudate nucleus and some frontal
   regions that are part of the mirror system. Adults showed greater
   activations in parietal and frontal regions (part of them belonging to
   the social brain) than adolescents. An increased number of regions that
   are part of themirror systemnetwork or the social brain, as well as the
   caudate nucleus, were recruited with age. In conclusion, a shared set of
   brain regions enabling the discrimination of social interactions from
   neutralmovements through humanmotion is already present in 8-year-old
   children. Developmental processes such as refinements in the social
   brain andmirror systemwould help grasping subtle cues in non-verbal
   aspects of social interactions.}},

   use could have important clinical and public health implications;
   however, few investigations have explored individual-level precursors of
   adolescent substance use. This prospective investigation used machine
   learning with demographic, neurocognitive, and neuroimaging data in
   substance-naive adolescents to identify predictors of alcohol use
   initiation by age 18.
   Method: Participants (N=137) were healthy substancenaive adolescents
   (ages 12-14) who underwent neuropsychological testing and structural and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI and fMRI), and then were
   followed annually. By age 18, 70 youths (51\%) initiated moderate to
   heavy alcohol use, and 67 remained nonusers. Random forest
   classification models identified the most important predictors of
   alcohol use from a large set of demographic, neuropsychological, sMRI,
   and fMRI variables.
   Results: Random forest models identified 34 predictors contributing to
   alcohol use by age 18, including several demographic and behavioral
   factors (being male, higher socioeconomic status, early dating, more
   externalizing behaviors, positive alcohol expectancies), worse executive
   functioning, and thinner cortices and less brain activation in diffusely
   distributed regions of the brain.
   Conclusions: Incorporating a mix of demographic, behavioral,
   neuropsychological, and neuroimaging data may be the best strategy for
   identifying youths at risk for initiating alcohol use during
   adolescence. The identified risk factors will be useful for alcohol
   prevention efforts and in research to address brain mechanisms that may
   contribute to early drinking.}},

Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging techniques have transformed our ability to probe
   the neurobiological basis of behaviour and are increasingly being
   applied by the wider neuroscience community. However, concerns have
   recently been raised that the conclusions that are drawn from some human
   neuroimaging studies are either spurious or not generalizable. Problems
   such as low statistical power, flexibility in data analysis, software
   errors and a lack of direct replication apply to many fields, but
   perhaps particularly to functional MRI. Here, we discuss these problems,
   outline current and suggested best practices, and describe how we think
   the field should evolve to produce the most meaningful and reliable
   answers to neuroscientific questions.}},

   antidepressant enhances both reward and effort learning signals}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{To make good decisions, humans need to learn about and integrate
   different sources of appetitive and aversive information. While
   serotonin has been linked to value-based decision-making, its role in
   learning is less clear, with acute manipulations often producing
   inconsistent results. Here, we show that when the effects of a selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, citalopram) are studied over longer
   timescales, learning is robustly improved. We measured brain activity
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in volunteers as they
   performed a concurrent appetitive (money) and aversive (effort) learning
   task. We found that 2 weeks of citalopram enhanced reward and effort
   learning signals in a widespread network of brain regions, including
   ventromedial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex. At a behavioral
   level, this was accompanied by more robust reward learning. This
   suggests that serotonin can modulate the ability to learn via a
   mechanism that is independent of stimulus valence. Such effects may
   partly underlie SSRIs' impact in treating psychological illnesses. Our
   results highlight both a specific function in learning for serotonin and
   the importance of studying its role across longer timescales.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Previous studies suggest that adults with Tourette syndrome
   (TS) can respond unconventionally on tasks involving social cognition.
   We therefore hypothesized that these patients would exhibit different
   neural responses to healthy controls in response to emotionally salient
   expressions of human eyes.
   Method. Twenty-five adults with TS and 25 matched healthy controls were
   scanned using fMRI during the standard version of the Reading the Mind
   in the Eyes Task which requires mental state judgements, and a novel
   comparison version requiring judgements about age.
   Results. During prompted mental state recognition, greater activity was
   apparent in TS within left orbitofrontal cortex, posterior cingulate,
   right amygdala and right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), while reduced
   activity was apparent in regions including left inferior parietal
   cortex. Age judgement elicited greater activity in TS within precuneus,
   medial prefrontal and temporal regions involved in mentalizing. The
   interaction between group and task revealed differential activity in
   areas including right inferior frontal gyrus. Task-related activity in
   the TPJ covaried with global ratings of the urge to tic.
   Conclusions. While recognizing mental states, adults with TS exhibit
   greater activity than controls in brain areas involved in the processing
   of negative emotion, in addition to reduced activity in regions
   associated with the attribution of agency. In addition, increased
   recruitment of areas involved in mental state reasoning is apparent in
   these patients when mentalizing is not a task requirement. Our findings
   highlight differential neural reactivity in response to emotive social
   cues in TS, which may interact with tic expression.}},

Abstract = {{Negative biases in cognition have been documented consistently in major
   depressive disorder (MDD), including difficulties in the ability to
   control the processing of negative material. Although negative
   information-processing biases have been studied using both behavioral
   and neuroimaging paradigms, relatively little research has been
   conducted examining the difficulties of depressed persons with
   inhibiting the retrieval of negative information from long-term memory.
   In this study, we used the think/no-think paradigm and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging to assess the cognitive and neural
   consequences of memory suppression in individuals diagnosed with
   depression and in healthy controls. The participants showed typical
   behavioral forgetting effects, but contrary to our hypotheses, there
   were no differences between the depressed and nondepressed participants
   or between neutral and negative memories. Relative to controls,
   depressed individuals exhibited greater activity in right middle frontal
   gyrus during memory suppression, regardless of the valence of the
   suppressed stimuli, and differential activity in the amygdala and
   hippocampus during memory suppression involving negatively valenced
   stimuli. These findings indicate that depressed individuals are
   characterized by neural anomalies during the suppression of long-term
   memories, increasing our understanding of the brain bases of negative
   cognitive biases in MDD.}},

Abstract = {{The mirror neuron system (MNS) has been mooted as a crucial component
   underlying human social cognition. Initial evidence based on functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) suggests that the MNS plays a role in
   emotion classification, but further confirmation and convergent evidence
   is needed. This study employed electroencephalography (EEG) to examine
   modulations in the mu rhythm associated with the inference of emotions
   from facial expressions. It was hypothesised that mu suppression would
   be associated with classifying the emotion portrayed by facial
   expressions. Nineteen participants viewed pictures of facial expressions
   or emotion words and were asked to either match the stimulus to an
   emotion word or to passively observe. Mu activity following stimulus
   presentation was localised using a 3-D distributed inverse solution, and
   compared between conditions. Subtractive logic was used to isolate the
   specific processes of interest. Comparisons of source localisation
   images between conditions revealed that there was mu suppression
   associated with recognising emotion from faces, thereby supporting our
   hypothesis. Further analyses confirmed that those effects were not due
   to activity associated with the motor response or the observation of
   facial expressions, offering further support for the hypotheses. This
   study provides important convergent evidence for the involvement of the
   MNS in the inference of emotion from facial expressions.}},

Title = {{Expectation influences the interruptive function of pain: Behavioural
   and neural findings}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundExpectations can dramatically influence the perception of
   pain, as has been shown in placebo analgesia or nocebo hyperalgesia.
   Here, we investigated the role of expectation on the interruptive
   function of pain - the negative consequences of pain on cognitive task
   performance - in 42 healthy human subjects.
   MethodsVerbal and written instructions were used to manipulate the
   subjects' expectation of how pain would influence their task performance
   in an established visual categorization task which was performed with or
   without concomitant painful thermal stimulation during 3T fMRI scanning.
   The categorization task was followed by a surprise recognition task.
   ResultsWe observed a significant interaction between stimulation
   (pain/no pain) and expectancy (positive expectation/negative
   expectation): categorization accuracy decreased during painful
   stimulation in the negative expectancy group (N=21), while no difference
   was observed in the positive expectancy group (N=21). On the neural
   level, the positive expectancy group showed stronger activity in the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus during painful
   stimulation compared to the negative group. Moreover, we detected a
   decrease in connectivity between ACC and fusiform gyrus during painful
   stimulation in the negative expectancy group, which was absent in the
   positive expectancy group.
   ConclusionTaken together, our data show that expectation can modulate
   the effect of pain on task performance and that these expectancy effects
   on the interruptive function of pain are mediated by activity and
   connectivity changes in brain areas involved in pain processing and task
   performance. The possibility of changing cognitive task performance by
   verbal information in clinical population warrants further
   investigation.
   SignificanceWe show that the interruptive function of pain on concurrent
   visual task performance is influenced by expectation. Positive
   expectation can abolish the detrimental effects of pain on cognition.
   These expectancy effects on the interruptive function of pain are
   mediated by changes in functional connectivity between rostral ACC,
   posterior fusiform cortex and the hippocampus.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging research involves analyses of huge amounts of biological
   data that might or might not be related with cognition. This
   relationship is usually approached using univariate methods, and,
   therefore, correction methods are mandatory for reducing false
   positives. Nevertheless, the probability of false negatives is also
   increased. Multivariate frameworks have been proposed for helping to
   alleviate this balance. Here we apply multivariate distance matrix
   regression for the simultaneous analysis of biological and cognitive
   data, namely, structural connections among 82 brain regions and several
   latent factors estimating cognitive performance. We tested whether
   cognitive differences predict distances among individuals regarding
   their connectivity pattern. Beginning with 3,321 connections among
   regions, the 36 edges better predicted by the individuals' cognitive
   scores were selected. Cognitive scores were related to connectivity
   distances in both the full (3,321) and reduced (36) connectivity
   patterns. The selected edges connect regions distributed across the
   entire brain and the network defined by these edges supports high-order
   cognitive processes such as (a) (fluid) executive control, (b)
   (crystallized) recognition, learning, and language processing, and (c)
   visuospatial processing. This multivariate study suggests that one
   widespread, but limited number, of regions in the human brain, supports
   high-level cognitive ability differences. Hum Brain Mapp 38:803-816,

Abstract = {{The formation of a coherent and unified self-concept represents a key
   developmental stage during adolescence. Imaging studies on
   self-referential processing in adolescents are rare, and it is not clear
   whether neural structures involved in self-reflection are also involved
   in reflections of familiar others. In the current study, 41 adolescents
   were asked to make judgments about trait adjectives during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): they had to indicate whether the word
   describes themselves, their friends, their teachers or politicians.
   Findings indicate a greater overlap in neural networks for responses to
   self- and friend-related judgments compared to teachers and politicians.
   In particular, classic self-reference structures such as the
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex and medial posterior parietal cortex also
   exhibited higher activation to judgments about friends. In contrast,
   brain responses towards judgments of teachers (familiar others) compared
   to politicians (unfamiliar others) did not significantly differ. Results
   support behavioral findings of a greater relevance of friends for the
   development of a self-concept during adolescence and indicate underlying

Abstract = {{Neurobehavioral models of pedophilia and child sexual offending suggest
   a pattern of temporal and in particular prefrontal disturbances leading
   to inappropriate behavioral control and subsequently an increased
   propensity to sexually offend against children. However, clear empirical
   evidence for such mechanisms is still missing. Using a go/nogo paradigm
   in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we
   compared behavioral performance and neural response patterns among three
   groups of men matched for age and IQ: pedophiles with (N=40) and without
   (N=37) a history of hands-on sexual offences against children as well as
   healthy non-offending controls (N=40). As compared to offending
   pedophiles, non-offending pedophiles exhibited superior inhibitory
   control as reflected by significantly lower rate of commission errors.
   Group-by-condition interaction analysis also revealed inhibition-related
   activation in the left posterior cingulate and the left superior frontal
   cortex that distinguished between offending and non-offending
   pedophiles, while no significant differences were found between
   pedophiles and healthy controls. Both areas showing distinct activation
   pattern among pedophiles play a critical role in linking neural networks
   that relate to effective cognitive functioning. Data therefore suggest
   that heightened inhibition-related recruitment of these areas as well as
   decreased amount of commission errors is related to better inhibitory
   control in pedophiles who successfully avoid committing hands-on sexual
   offences against children. Hum Brain Mapp 38:1092-1104, 2017. (c) 2016

Abstract = {{Background: Large portions of food promote intake, but the mechanisms
   that drive this effect are unclear. Previous neuroimaging studies have
   identified the brain-reward and decision-making systems that are
   involved in the response to the energy density (ED) (kilocalories per
   gram) of foods, but few studies have examined the brain response to the
   food portion size (PS).
   Objective: We used functional MRI (fMRI) to determine the brain response
   to food images that differed in PSs (large and small) and ED (high and
   low).
   Design: Block-design fMRI was used to assess the blood oxygen level
   dependent (BOLD) response to images in 36 children (7-10 y old; girls:
   50\%), which was tested after a 2-h fast. Pre-fMRI fullness and liking
   were rated on visual analog scales. A whole-brain cluster-corrected
   analysis was used to compare BOLD activation for main effects of the PS,
   ED, and their interaction. Secondary analyses were used to associate
   BOLD contrast values with appetitive traits and laboratory intake from
   meals for which the portions of all foods were increased.
   Results: Compared with small-PS cues, large-PS cues were associated with
   decreased activation in the inferior frontal gyms (P < 0.01). Compared
   with low-ED cues, high-ED cues were associated with increased activation
   in multiple regions (e.g., in the caudate, cingulate, and precentral
   gyms) and decreased activation in the insula and superior temporal gyrus
   (P < 0.01 for all). A PS X ED interaction was shown in the superior
   temporal gyms (P < 0.01). BOLD contrast values for high-ED cues compared
   with low-ED cues in the insula, declive, and precentral gyms were
   negatively related to appetitive traits (P < 0.05). There were no
   associations between the brain response to the PS and either appetitive
   traits or intake.
   Conclusions: Cues regarding food PS may be processed in the lateral
   prefrontal cortex, which is a region that is implicated in cognitive
   control, whereas ED activates multiple areas involved in sensory and
   reward processing. Possible implications include the development of
   interventions that target decisionLmaking and reward systems differently
   to moderate overeating.}},

Title = {{Altered time course of amygdala activation during speech anticipation in

Abstract = {{Background: Exaggerated anticipatory anxiety is common in social anxiety
   disorder (SAD). Neuroimaging studies have revealed altered neural
   activity in response to social stimuli in SAD, but fewer studies have
   examined neural activity during anticipation of feared social stimuli in
   SAD. The current study examined the time course and magnitude of
   activity in threat processing brain regions during speech anticipation
   in socially anxious individuals and healthy controls (HC).
   Method: Participants (SAD n=58; HC n=16) underwent functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) during which they completed a 90 s control
   anticipation task and 90 s speech anticipation task. Repeated measures
   multi-level modeling analyses were used to examine group differences in
   time course activity during speech vs. control anticipation for regions
   of interest, including bilateral amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, and
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.
   Results: The time course of amygdala activity was more prolonged and
   less variable throughout speech anticipation in SAD participants
   compared to HCs, whereas the overall magnitude of amygdala response did
   not differ between groups. Magnitude and time course of activity was
   largely similar between groups across other regions of interest.
   Limitations: Analyses were restricted to regions of interest and task
   order was the same across participants due to the nature of deception
   instructions.
   Conclusions: Sustained amygdala time course during anticipation may
   uniquely reflect heightened detection of threat or deficits in emotion
   regulation in socially anxious individuals. Findings highlight the
   importance of examining temporal dynamics of amygdala responding.}},

Title = {{Neonatal Amygdala Functional Connectivity at Rest in Healthy and Preterm
   Infants and Early Internalizing Symptoms}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Alterations in the normal developmental trajectory of
   amygdala resting state functional connectivity (rs-FC) have been
   associated with atypical emotional processes and psychopathology. Little
   is known, however, regarding amygdala rs-FC at birth or its relevance to
   outcomes. This study examined amygdala rs-FC in healthy, full-term (FT)
   infants and in very preterm (VPT) infants, and tested whether
   variability of neonatal amygdala rs-FC predicted internalizing symptoms
   at age 2 years.
   Method: Resting state fMRI data were obtained shortly after birth from
   65 FT infants (gestational age {[}GA] >= 36 weeks) and 57 VPT infants
   (GA <30 weeks) at term equivalent. Voxelwise correlation analyses were
   performed using individual-specific bilateral amygdala regions of
   interest. Total internalizing symptoms and the behavioral inhibition,
   depression/withdrawal, general anxiety, and separation distress
   subdomains were assessed in a subset (n = 44) at age 2 years using the
   Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment.
   Results: In FT and VPT infants, the amygdala demonstrated positive
   correlations with subcortical and limbic structures and negative
   correlations with cortical regions, although magnitudes were decreased
   in VPT infants. Neonatal amygdala rs-FC predicted internalizing symptoms
   at age 2 years with regional specificity consistent with known
   pathophysiology in older populations: connectivity with the anterior
   insula related to depressive symptoms, with the dorsal anterior
   cingulate related to generalized anxiety, and with the medial prefrontal
   cortex related to behavioral inhibition.
   Conclusion: Amygdala rs-FC is well established in neonates. Variability
   in regional neonatal amygdala rs-FC predicted internalizing symptoms at
   2 years, suggesting that risk for internalizing symptoms may be
   established in neonatal amygdala functional connectivity patterns.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{77-83}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Interpersonal space is a nonverbal indicator of affiliation and
   closeness. In this study we investigated the effects of oxytocin (OT), a
   neuropeptide known for its social role in humans, on interpersonal
   space. In a double blind placebo controlled study we measured the effect
   of intranasal OT on the personal distance preferences of different
   familiar (friend) and unfamiliar (stranger) protagonists. Behavioral
   results showed that participants preferred to be closer to,a friend than
   to a stranger. Intranasal OT was associated with an overall distancing
   effect, but this effect was significant for the stranger and not for the
   friend. The imaging results showed interactions between treatment (OT,
   placebo) and protagonist (friend, stranger) in regions that mediate
   social behavior including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), a
   region associated with the mentalizing system. Specifically, OT
   increased activity in the dmPFC when a friend approached the
   participants but not when a stranger approached. The results indicate
   that the effect of OT on interpersonal space greatly depends on the
   participant's relationship with the protagonist. This supports the
   social salience theory, according to which OT increases the salience of
   social cues depending on the context. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Regret results from comparing non-optimal outcomes containing both gain
   and loss parts to better alternatives during decision-making. The
   present fMRI study aimed to explore whether levels of regret could
   change when gain or loss part of a non-optimal outcome was focused
   during a sequential risk taking task, i.e. the effect of an important
   emotional regulation strategy named as attentional deployment on regret.
   Participants were asked to open a series of boxes consecutively and
   decided when to stop. Each box contained a reward, except for one
   containing a devil to zero one's gain in the trial. After participants
   stopped, both collected gains and missed chances were revealed. Besides,
   participants were induced to focus on collected gains (GF) or missed
   chances (MF), by highlighting different parts of the outcome with red
   squares. Behaviorally, participants rated less regret to their decisions
   in GF than MF context. Moreover, participants tended to be less
   risk-taking after GF context relative to MF. At the neural level,
   bilateral straitum showed increased activations in both optimal outcome
   and GF context. However, right MFG and IPL only showed stronger
   activation in GF than MF context. Additionally, pgACC and mPFC
   activations were found only in optimal outcome.}},

Title = {{Brain networks involved in tactile speed classification of moving dot
   patterns: the effects of speed and dot periodicity}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Humans are able to judge the speed of an object's motion by touch.
   Research has suggested that tactile judgment of speed is influenced by
   physical properties of the moving object, though the neural mechanisms
   underlying this process remain poorly understood. In the present study,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to investigate brain
   networks that may be involved in tactile speed classification and how
   such networks may be affected by an object's texture. Participants were
   asked to classify the speed of 2-D raised dot patterns passing under
   their right middle finger. Activity in the parietal operculum, insula,
   and inferior and superior frontal gyri was positively related to the
   motion speed of dot patterns. Activity in the postcentral gyrus and
   superior parietal lobule was sensitive to dot periodicity.
   Psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) analysis revealed that dot
   periodicity modulated functional connectivity between the parietal
   operculum (related to speed) and postcentral gyrus (related to dot
   periodicity). These results suggest that texture-sensitive activity in
   the primary somatosensory cortex and superior parietal lobule influences
   brain networks associated with tactually-extracted motion speed. Such
   effects may be related to the influence of surface texture on tactile
   speed judgment.}},

Abstract = {{Imagery perspective can influence what information is recalled,
   processing style, and emotionality; however, the understanding of
   possible mechanisms mediating these observed differences is still
   limited. We aimed to examine differences between memory recall from a
   field perspective and observer perspective at the neurobiological level,
   in order to improve our understanding of what is underlying the observed
   differences at the behavioral level. We conducted a fMRI study in
   healthy individuals, comparing imagery perspectives during recall of
   neutral and positive autobiographical memories. Behavioral results
   revealed field perspective imagery of positive memories, as compared to
   observer perspective, to be associated with more positive feelings
   afterwards. At the neurobiological level, contrasting observer
   perspective to field perspective imagery was associated with greater
   activity, or less decrease relative to the control visual search task,
   in the right precuneus and in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ).
   Greater activity in the right TPJ during an observer perspective as
   compared to field perspective could reflect performing a greater shift
   of perspective and mental state during observer perspective imagery than
   field perspective imagery. Differential activity in the precuneus may
   reflect that during observer perspective imagery individuals are more
   likely to engage in (self-) evaluative processing and visuospatial
   processing. Our findings contribute to a growing understanding of how
   imagery perspective can influence the type of information that is
   recalled and the intensity of the emotional response. Observer
   perspective imagery may not automatically reduce emotional intensity but
   this could depend on how the imagined situation is evaluated in relation
   to the self-concept. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The posterior STS (pSTS) is an important brain region for perceptual
   analysis of social cognitive cues. This study seeks to characterize the
   pattern of network connectivity emerging from the pSTS in three core
   social perception localizers: biological motion perception, gaze
   recognition, and the interpretation of moving geometric shapes as
   animate. We identified brain regions associated with all three of these
   localizers and computed the functional connectivity pattern between them
   and the pSTS using a partial correlations metric that characterizes
   network connectivity. We find a core pattern of cortical connectivity
   that supports the hypothesis that the pSTS serves as a hub of the social
   brain network. The right pSTS was the most highly connected of the brain
   regions measured, with many long-range connections to pFC. Unlike other
   highly connected regions, connectivity to the pSTS was distinctly
   lateralized. We conclude that the functional importance of right pSTS is
   revealed when considering its role in the large-scale network of brain
   regions involved in various aspects of social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Effective psychiatric treatments ameliorate excessive anxiety and induce
   neuroplasticity immediately after the intervention, indicating that
   emotional components in the human brain are rapidly adaptable. Still,
   the interplay between structural and functional neuroplasticity is
   poorly understood, and studies of treatment-induced long-term
   neuroplasticity are rare. Functional and structural magnetic resonance
   imaging (using 3 T MRI) was performed in 13 subjects with social anxiety
   disorder on 3 occasions over 1 year. All subjects underwent 9 weeks of
   Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy in a randomized
   cross-over design and independent assessors used the Clinically Global
   Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale to determine treatment response.
   Gray matter (GM) volume, assessed with voxel-based morphometry, and
   functional blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responsivity to
   self-referential criticism were compared between treatment responders
   and non-responders using 2 x 2 (group x time; pretreatment to follow-up)
   ANOVA. At 1-year follow-up, 7 (54\%) subjects were classified as CGI-I
   responders. Left amygdala GM volume was more reduced in responders
   relative to non-responders from pretreatment to 1-year follow-up
   (Z=3.67, Family-Wise Error corrected p = 0.02). In contrast to previous
   short-term effects, altered BOLD activations to self-referential
   criticism did not separate responder groups at follow-up. The structure
   and function of the amygdala changes immediately after effective
   psychological treatment of social anxiety disorder, but only reduced
   amygdala GM volume, and not functional activity, is associated with a
   clinical response 1 year after CBT. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Further support for association between GWAS variant for positive
   emotion and reward systems}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a significant
   single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for trait-positive emotion at
   rs322931 on chromosome 1, which was also associated with brain
   activation in the reward system of healthy individuals when observing
   positive stimuli in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study. In the current study, we aimed to further validate the role of
   variation at rs322931 in reward processing. Using a similar fMRI
   approach, we use two paradigms that elicit a strong ventral striatum
   (VS) blood oxygen-level dependency (BOLD) response in a sample of young,
   healthy individuals (N = 82). In the first study we use a similar
   picture-viewing task to the discovery sample (positive>neutral stimuli)
   to replicate an effect of the variant on emotion processing. In the
   second study we use a probabilistic reversal learning procedure to
   identify reward processing during decision-making under uncertainly
   (reward>punishment). In a region of interest (ROI) analysis of the
   bilateral VS, we show that the rs322931 genotype was associated with
   BOLD in the left VS during the positive>neutral contrast (PROI-CORRECTED
   = 0.045) and during the reward4punishment contrast (PROI-CORRECTED =
   0.018), although the effect of passive picture viewing was in the
   opposite direction from that reported in the discovery sample. These
   findings suggest that the recently identified GWAS hit may influence
   positive emotion via individual differences in activity in the key hubs
   of the brain's reward system. Furthermore, these effects may not be
   limited to the passive viewing of positive emotional scenes, but may
   also be observed during dynamic decisionmaking. This study suggests that
   future studies of this GWAS locus may yield further insight into the
   biological mechanisms of psychopathologies characterised by deficits in
   reward processing and positive emotion.}},

Title = {{Individual Differences in Spontaneous Expressive Suppression Predict
   Amygdala Responses to Fearful Stimuli: The Role of Suppression Priming}},
Journal = {{Frontiers in Psychology}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{Though the spontaneous emotion regulation has received long discussions,
   few studies have explored the regulatory effects of spontaneous
   expressive suppression in neural activations, especially in
   collectivistic cultural context. The functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) study aimed to examine whether individual differences in
   the tendency to use suppression are correlated with amygdala responses
   to negative situations when individuals are unconsciously primed with
   expressive suppression. Twenty-three healthy Chinese undergraduates
   completed an fMRI paradigm involving fear processing, and a synonym
   matching task was added to prime participants with the unconscious
   (automatic) expressive suppression goal. Participants completed measures
   of typical emotion regulation use (reappraisal and suppression), trait
   anxiety, and neuroticism. Results indicated that only in emotion
   suppression prime condition, greater use of suppression in everyday life
   was related to decreased amygdala activity. These associations were not
   attributable to variation in trait anxiety, neuroticism, or the habitual
   use of reappraisal. These findings suggest that in collectivistic
   cultural settings, individual differences in expressive suppression do
   not alter fear-related neural activation during suppression-irrelevant
   context. However, unconscious suppression priming facilitates the
   manifestation of individual differences in the neural consequence of
   expressive suppression, as reflected by the priming-specific decrease of
   emotional subcortical activations with more use of expressive
   suppression.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that substance dependence (addiction) is
   accompanied with altered activity patterns of the default mode network

   quid dependence (BQD)-related physiopathological characteristics still
   remain unclear. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   images were obtained from 26 BQD individuals and 28 matched healthy

   analyze the resting state images into spatially independent components.
   Gray matter volume was examined as covariate with voxel-based
   morphometry to rule out its effect on the functional results. The
   severity of BQD was assessed by the BQD Scale (BQDS). We observed
   decreased functional connectivity in anterior part of the DMN including
   ventral medial prefrontal cortex, orbital MPFC (OMPFC)/anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC). Furthermore, the functional connectivity within
   the OMPFC/ACC in BQD individuals was negatively correlated with BQDS (p

Abstract = {{Chinese calligraphic handwriting (CCH) is a traditional art form that
   requires high levels of concentration and motor control. Previous
   research has linked short-term training in CCH to improvements in
   attention and memory. Little is known about the potential impacts of
   longterm CCH practice on a broader array of executive functions and
   their potential neural substrates. In this cross-sectional study, we
   recruited 36 practitioners with at least 5 years of CCH experience and
   50 control subjects with no more than one month of CCH practice and
   investigated their differences in the three components of executive
   functions (i.e., shifting, updating, and inhibition). Valid
   resting-state fMRI data were collected from 31 CCH and 40 control
   participants. Compared with the controls, CCH individuals showed better
   updating (as measured by the Corsi Block Test) and inhibition (as
   measured by the Stroop WordColor Test), but the two groups did not
   differ in shifting (as measured by a cue-target task). The CCH group
   showed stronger resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) than the
   control group in brain areas involved in updating and inhibition. These
   results suggested that long-term CCH training may be associated with
   improvements in specific aspects of executive functions and strengthened
   neural networks in related brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{Previous investigations of vocal expressions of emotion have identified
   acoustic and perceptual distinctions between expressions of different
   emotion categories, and between spontaneous and volitional (or acted)
   variants of a given category. Recent work on laughter has identified
   relationships between acoustic properties of laughs and their perceived
   affective properties (arousal and valence) that are similar across
   spontaneous and volitional types (Bryant \& Aktipis, 2014; Lavan et al.,
   2016). In the current study, we explored the neural correlates of such
   relationships by measuring modulations of the BOLD response in the
   presence of itemwise variability in the subjective affective properties
   of spontaneous and volitional laughter. Across all laughs, and within
   spontaneous and volitional sets, we consistently observed linear
   increases in the response of bilateral auditory cortices (including
   Heschrs gyrus and superior temporal gyrus {[}STG]) associated with
   higher ratings of perceived arousal, valence and authenticity. Areas in
   the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC) showed negative linear
   correlations with valence and authenticity ratings across the full set
   of spontaneous and volitional laughs; in line with previous research
   (McGettigan et al., 2015; Szameitat etal., 2010), we suggest that this
   reflects increased engagement of these regions in response to laughter
   of greater social ambiguity. Strikingly, an investigation of
   higher-order relationships between the entire laughter set and the
   neural response revealed a positive quadratic profile of the BOLD
   response in right-dominant STG (extending onto the dorsal bank of the
   STS), where this region responded most strongly to laughs rated at the
   extremes of the authenticity scale. While previous studies claimed a
   role for right STG in bipolar representation of emotional valence, we
   instead argue that this may in fact exhibit a relatively categorical
   response to emotional signals, whether positive or negative.}},

Title = {{An fMRI investigation of the relationship between future imagination and
   cognitive flexibility}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{156-172}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{While future imagination is largely considered to be a cognitive process
   grounded in default mode network activity, studies have shown that
   future imagination recruits regions in both default mode and
   frontoparietal control networks. In addition, it has recently been shown
   that the ability to imagine the future is associated with cognitive
   flexibility, and that tasks requiring cognitive flexibility result in
   increased coupling of the default mode network with frontoparietal
   control and salience networks. In the current study, we investigated the
   neural correlates underlying the association between cognitive
   flexibility and future imagination in two ways. First, we experimentally
   varied the degree of cognitive flexibility required during future
   imagination by manipulating the disparateness of episodic details
   contributing to imagined events. To this end, participants generated
   episodic details (persons, locations, objects) within three social
   spheres; during fMRI scanning they were presented with sets of three
   episodic details all taken from the same social sphere (Congruent
   condition) or different social spheres (Incongruent condition) and
   required to imagine a future event involving the three details. We
   predicted that, relative to the Congruent condition, future simulation
   in the Incongruent condition would be associated with increased activity
   in regions of the default mode, frontoparietal and salience networks.
   Second, we hypothesized that individual differences in cognitive
   flexibility, as measured by performance on the Alternate Uses Task,
   would correspond to individual differences in the brain regions
   recruited during future imagination. A task partial least squares (PLS)
   analysis showed that the Incongruent condition resulted in an increase
   in activity in regions in salience networks (e.g. the insula) but,
   contrary to our prediction, reduced activity in many regions of the
   default mode network (including the hippocampus). A subsequent
   functional connectivity (within-subject seed PLS) analysis showed that
   the insula exhibited increased coupling with default mode regions during
   the Incongruent condition. Finally, a behavioral PLS analysis showed
   that individual differences in cognitive flexibility were associated
   with differences in activity in a number of regions from frontoparietal,
   salience and default-mode networks during both future imagination
   conditions, further highlighting that the cognitive flexibility
   underlying future imagination is grounded in the complex interaction of
   regions in these networks.}},

Abstract = {{Body language is a powerful indicator of others' emotions in social
   interactions, with positive signals triggering approach and negative
   ones retreat and defensiveness. Intergroup and interracial factors can
   influence these interactions, sometimes leading to aggressive or even
   violent behaviour. Despite its obvious social relevance however, the
   interaction between body expression and race remains unexplored, with
   explanations of the impact of race being almost exclusively based on the
   role of race in face recognition. In the current fMRI study we scanned
   white European participants while they viewed affective (angry and
   happy) body postures of both same race (white) and other race (black)
   individuals. To assess the difference between implicit and explicit
   recognition participants performed either an explicit emotion
   categorisation task, or an irrelevant shape judgement task. Brain
   activity was modulated by race in a number of brain regions across both
   tasks. Race-related activity appeared to be task-as well as
   emotion-specific. Overall, the other-race effects appeared to be driven
   by positive emotions, while same-race effects were observed for negative
   emotions. A race specific effect was also observed in right amygdala
   reflecting increased activation for explicit recognition of angry white
   body expressions. Overall, these results provide the first clear
   evidence that race influences affective body perception.}},

Title = {{Default mode network deactivation during emotion processing predicts
   early antidepressant response}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Several previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
   have demonstrated the predictive value of brain activity during emotion
   processing for antidepressant response, with a focus on clinical outcome
   after 6-8 weeks. However, longitudinal studies emphasize the paramount
   importance of early symptom improvement for the course of disease in
   major depressive disorder (MDD). We therefore aimed to assess whether
   neural activity during the emotion discrimination task (EDT) predicts
   early antidepressant effects, and how these predictive measures relate
   to more sustained response. Twenty-three MDD patients were investigated
   once with ultrahigh-field 7T fMRI and the EDT. Following fMRI, patients
   received Escitalopram in a flexible dose schema and were assessed with
   the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) before, and after 2 and 4
   weeks of treatment. Deactivation of the precuneus and posterior
   cingulate cortex (PCC) during the EDT predicted change in HAMD scores
   after 2 weeks of treatment. Baseline EDT activity was not predictive of
   HAMD change after 4 weeks of treatment. The precuneus and PCC are
   integral components of the default mode network (DMN). We show that
   patients who exhibit stronger DMN suppression during emotion processing
   are more likely to show antidepressant response after 2 weeks. This is,
   to our knowledge, the first study to show that DMN activity predicts
   early antidepressant effects. However, DMN deactivation did not predict
   response at 4 weeks, suggesting that our finding is representative of
   early, likely treatment-related, yet unspecific symptom improvement.
   Regardless, early effects may be harnessed for optimization of treatment
   regimens and patient care.}},

Title = {{Cognitive dissonance resolution depends on episodic memory}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{The notion that past choices affect preferences is one of the most
   influential concepts of social psychology since its first report in the
   50 s, and its theorization within the cognitive dissonance framework. In
   the free-choice paradigm (FCP) after choosing between two similarly
   rated items, subjects reevaluate chosen items as more attractive and
   rejected items as less attractive. However the relations prevailing
   between episodic memory and choice-induced preference change (CIPC)
   remain highly debated: is this phenomenon dependent or independent from
   memory of past choices? We solve this theoretical debate by
   demonstrating that CIPC occurs exclusively for items which were
   correctly remembered as chosen or rejected during the choice stage. We
   used a combination of fMRI and intracranial electrophysiological
   recordings to reveal a modulation of left hippocampus activity, a hub of
   episodic memory retrieval, immediately before the occurrence of CIPC
   during item reevaluation. Finally, we show that contrarily to a previous
   influential report flawed by a statistical artifact, this phenomenon is
   absent in amnesic patients for forgotten items. These results
   demonstrate the dependence of cognitive dissonance on conscious episodic
   memory. This link between current preferences and previous choices
   suggests a homeostatic function of this regulative process, aiming at
   preserving subjective coherence.}},

Title = {{Visual area V5/hMT + contributes to perception of tactile motion
   direction: a TMS study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Human imaging studies have reported activations associated with tactile
   motion perception in visual motion area V5/hMT+, primary somatosensory
   cortex (SI) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC; Brodmann areas 7/40).
   However, such studies cannot establish whether these areas are causally
   involved in tactile motion perception. We delivered double-pulse
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while moving a single tactile
   point across the fingertip, and used signal detection theory to quantify
   perceptual sensitivity to motion direction. TMS over both SI and
   V5/hMT+, but not the PPC site, significantly reduced tactile direction
   discrimination. Our results show that V5/hMT+ plays a causal role in
   tactile direction processing, and strengthen the case for V5/hMT+
   serving multimodal motion perception. Further, our findings are
   consistent with a serial model of cortical tactile processing, in which
   higher-order perceptual processing depends upon information received
   from SI. By contrast, our results do not provide clear evidence that the
   PPC site we targeted (Brodmann areas 7/40) contributes to tactile
   direction perception.}},

   Networks}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has provided qualitative evidence for overlap in a
   number of brain regions across the subjective value network (SVN) and
   the default mode network (DMN). In order to quantitatively assess this
   overlap, we conducted a series of coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA)
   of results from 466 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments on
   task-negative or subjective value-related activations in the human
   brain. In these analyses, we first identified significant overlaps and
   dissociations across activation foci related to SVN and DMN. Second, we
   investigated whether these overlapping subregions also showed similar
   patterns of functional connectivity, suggesting a shared functional
   subnetwork. We find considerable overlap between SVN and DMN in
   subregions of central ventromedial prefrontal cortex (cVMPFC) and dorsal
   posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC). Further, our findings show that
   similar patterns of bidirectional functional connectivity between cVMPFC
   and dPCC are present in both networks. We discuss ways in which our
   understanding of how subjective value (SV) is computed and represented
   in the brain can be synthesized with what we know about the DMN,
   mind-wandering, and self-referential processing in light of our
   findings.}},

Abstract = {{How neural specificity for distinct conceptual knowledge categories
   arises is central for understanding the organization of semantic memory
   in the human brain. Although there is a large body of research on the
   neural processing of distinct object categories, the organization of
   action categories remains largely unknown. In particular, it is unknown
   whether different action categories follow a specific topographical
   organization on the cortical surface analogously to the
   category-specific organization of object knowledge. Here, we tested
   whether the neural representation of action knowledge is organized in
   terms of nonsocial versus social and object-unrelated versus
   object-related actions (sociality and transitivity, respectively,
   hereafter). We hypothesized a major distinction of sociality and
   transitivity along dorsal and ventral lateral occipitotemporal cortex
   (LOTC), respectively. Using fMRI-based multivoxel pattern analysis, we
   identified neural representations of action information associated with
   sociality and transitivity in bilateral LOTC. Representational
   similarity analysis revealed a dissociation between dorsal and ventral
   LOTC. We found that action representations in dorsal LOTC are segregated
   along features of sociality, whereas action representations in ventral
   LOTC are segregated along features of transitivity. In addition,
   representations of sociality and transitivity features were found more
   anteriorly in LOTC than representations of specific subtypes of actions,
   suggesting a posterior-anterior gradient from concrete to abstract
   action features. These findings elucidate how the neural representations
   of perceptually and conceptually diverse actions are organized in
   distinct subsystems in the LOTC.}},

Abstract = {{Expectation of reward can be shaped by the observation of actions and
   expressions of other people in one's environment. A person's apparent
   confidence in the likely reward of an action, for instance, makes
   qualities of their evidence, not observed directly, socially accessible.
   This strategy is computationally distinguished from associative learning
   methods that rely on direct observation, by its use of inference from
   indirect evidence. In twenty-three healthy human subjects, we isolated
   effects of first-hand experience, other people's choices, and the
   mediating effect of their confidence, on decision-making and neural
   correlates of value within ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Value
   derived from first-hand experience and other people's choices
   (regardless of confidence) were indiscriminately represented across
   vmPFC. However, value computed from agent choices weighted by their
   associated confidence was represented with specificity for ventromedial
   area 10. This pattern corresponds to shifts of connectivity and
   overlapping cognitive processes along a posterior-anterior vmPFC axis.
   Task behavior and self-reported self-reliance for decision-making in
   other social contexts correlated. The tendency to conform in other
   social contexts corresponded to increased activation in cortical regions
   previously shown to respond to social conflict in proportion to
   subsequent conformity (Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2010). The tendency
   to self-monitor predicted a selectively enhanced response to accordance
   with others in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). The findings
   anatomically decompose vmPFC value representations according to
   computational requirements and provide biological insight into the
   social transmission of preference and reassurance gained from the
   confidence of others.}},

Title = {{Brain connectivity changes occurring following cognitive behavioural
   therapy for psychosis predict long-term recovery}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about the psychobiological mechanisms of cognitive
   behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) and which specific processes
   are key in predicting favourable long-term outcomes. Following
   theoretical models of psychosis, this proof-of-concept study
   investigated whether the long-term recovery path of CBTp completers can
   be predicted by the neural changes in threatbased social affective
   processing that occur during CBTp. We followed up 22 participants who
   had undergone a social affective processing task during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging along with self-report and
   clinician-administered symptom measures, before and after receiving
   CBTp. Monthly ratings of psychotic and affective symptoms were obtained
   retrospectively across 8 years since receiving CBTp, plus self-reported
   recovery at final follow-up. We investigated whether these long-term
   outcomes were predicted by CBTp-led changes in functional connections
   with dorsal prefrontal cortical and amygdala during the processing of
   threatening and prosocial facial affect. Although long-term psychotic
   symptoms were predicted by changes in prefrontal connections during
   prosocial facial affective processing, long-term affective symptoms were
   predicted by threat-related amygdalo-inferior parietal lobule
   connectivity. Greater increases in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   connectivity with amygdala following CBTp also predicted higher
   subjective ratings of recovery at long-term follow-up. These findings
   show that reorganisation occurring at the neural level following
   psychological therapy can predict the subsequent recovery path of people
   with psychosis across 8 years. This novel methodology shows promise for
   further studies with larger sample size, which are needed to better
   examine the sensitivity of psychobiological processes, in comparison to
   existing clinical measures, in predicting long-term outcomes.}},

Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Caregiver maltreatment induces vulnerability to later-life
   psychopathology. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggest changes in
   prefrontal and limbic circuitry underlie this susceptibility. We
   examined this question using a rat model of maternal maltreatment and
   methods translated from humans, resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (R-fMRI). Rat pups were reared by mothers provided
   with insufficient or abundant bedding for nest building from postnatal
   (PN) days 8 to 12 and underwent behavioral assessments of affect-related
   behaviors (forced swim, sucrose preference and social interaction) in
   adolescence (PN45) and early adulthood (PN60). R-fMRI sessions were
   conducted under light anesthesia at both ages. Offspring reared with
   insufficient bedding (that is, maltreated) displayed enduring negative
   affective behaviors. Amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) functional
   connectivity increased significantly from adolescence to adulthood in
   controls, but not in maltreated animals. We computed the fractional
   amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), an index of intrinsic
   brain activity, and found that fALFF in medial prefrontal cortex and
   anterior cingulate cortex (MPFC/ACC) increased significantly with age in
   controls but remained unchanged in maltreated animals during adolescence
   and adulthood. We used a seed-based analysis to explore changes in
   functional connectivity between this region and the whole brain.
   Compared with controls, maltreated animals demonstrated reduced
   functional connectivity between MPFC/ACC and left caudate/putamen across
   both ages. Functional connectivity between MPFC/ACC and right
   caudate/putamen showed a group by age interaction: decreased in controls
   but increased in maltreated animals. These data suggest that
   maltreatment induces vulnerability to psychopathology and is associated
   with differential developmental trajectories of prefrontal and
   subcortical circuits underlying affect regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Disruptive behavior in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an
   important clinical problem, but its neural basis remains poorly
   understood. The current research aims to better understand the neural
   underpinnings of disruptive behavior in ASD, while addressing whether
   the neural basis is shared with or separable from that of core ASD
   symptoms.
   Methods: Participants consisted of 48 male children and adolescents: 31
   ASD (7 had high disruptive behavior) and 17 typically developing (TD)
   controls, well-matched on sex, age, and IQ. For ASD participants, autism
   symptom severity, disruptive behavior, anxiety symptoms, and ADHD
   symptoms were measured. All participants were scanned while viewing
   biological motion (BIO) and scrambled motion (SCR). Two fMRI contrasts
   were analyzed: social perception (BIO >SCR) and Default Mode Network
   (DMN) deactivation (fixation >BIO). Age and IQ were included as
   covariates of no interest in all analyses.
   Results: First, the between-group analyses on BIO >SCR showed that ASD
   is characterized by hypoactivation in the social perception circuitry,
   and ASD with high or low disruptive behavior exhibited similar patterns
   of hypoactivation. Second, the between-group analyses on fixation >BIO
   showed that ASD with high disruptive behavior exhibited more restricted
   and less DMN deactivation, when compared to ASD with low disruptive
   behavior or TD. Third, the within-ASD analyses showed that (a) autism
   symptom severity (but not disruptive behavior) was uniquely associated
   with less activation in the social perception regions including the
   posterior superior temporal sulcus and inferior frontal gyrus; (b)
   disruptive behavior (but not autism symptom severity) was uniquely
   associated with less DMN deactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex
   (MPFC) and lateral parietal cortex; and (c) anxiety symptoms mediated
   the link between disruptive behavior and less DMN deactivation in both
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and MPFC, while ADHD symptoms mediated
   the link primarily in ACC.
   Conclusions: In boys with ASD, disruptive behavior has a neural basis in
   reduced DMN deactivation, which is distinct and separable from that of
   core ASD symptoms, with the latter characterized by hypoactivation in
   the social perception circuitry. These differential neurobiological
   markers may potentially serve as neural targets or predictors for
   interventions when treating disruptive behavior vs. core symptoms in
   ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Perceived social isolation (PSI), colloquially known as loneliness, is
   associated with selectively altered attentional, cognitive, and
   affective processes in humans, but the neural mechanisms underlying
   these adjustments remain largely unexplored. Behavioral, eye tracking,
   and neuroimaging research has identified associations between PSI and
   implicit hypervigilance for social threats. Additionally, selective
   executive dysfunction has been evidenced by reduced prepotent response
   inhibition in social Stroop and dichotic listening tasks. Given that PSI
   is associated with pre-attentional processes, PSI may also be related to
   altered resting-state functional connectivity (Fe) in the brain.
   Therefore, we conducted the first resting-state fMRI FC study of PSI in
   healthy young adults. Five-minute resting-state scans were obtained from
   55 participants (31 females). Analyses revealed robust associations
   between PSI and increased brain-wide FC in areas encompassing the right
   central operculum and right supramarginal gyros, and these associations
   were not explained by depressive symptomatology, objective isolation, or
   demographics. Further analyses revealed that PSI was associated with
   increased FC between several nodes of the cingulo-opercular network, a
   network known to underlie the maintenance of tonic alertness. These
   regions encompassed the bilateral insula/frontoparietal opercula and
   ACC/pre-SMA. In contrast, FC between the cingulo-opercular network and
   right middle/superior frontal gyrus was reduced, a finding associated
   with diminished executive function in prior literature. We suggest that,
   in PSI, increased within-network cingulo-opercular FC may be associated
   with hypervigilance to social threat, whereas reduced right
   middle/superior frontal gyrus FC to the cingulo-opercular network may be
   associated with diminished impulse control.}},

Abstract = {{In our society, partner choice is often reciprocal and, therefore,
   compromising one's choice may be adaptive depending on one's own market
   price. To reveal the neural mechanisms underlying this adaptive process,
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed on 27 male
   subjects during virtual partner choice tasks involving a dance-partner
   choice or a part-time job choice. Following the evaluation of a rival,
   the subjects chose a partner either in the face of competition with a
   rival (reciprocal choice condition) or during no competition
   (nonreciprocal condition). Irrespective of the type of partner choice
   situation, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and right
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ) were specifically activated during
   reciprocal partner choice. The PCC was also activated during the
   evaluation of a rival relative to the self, which indicates the
   involvement of this region in the processing of one's own market price.
   Activation in the right TPJ was related to the individual tendency to
   avoid choosing a higher-value candidate when the rival-value was high in
   the reciprocal choice condition, which indicates that this region plays
   a role in market-adaptive strategy. Taken together with extant
   anatomical knowledge, the two-component neurobiological structure
   underlying the adaptive mechanism of partner choice identified in this
   study seems to represent the hierarchical evolution of the human
   socio-cognitive system. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging increasingly exploits machine learning techniques in an
   attempt to achieve clinically relevant single-subject predictions. An
   alternative to machine learning, which tries to establish predictive
   links between features of the observed data and clinical variables, is
   the deployment of computational models for inferring on the
   (patho)physiological and cognitive mechanisms that generate behavioural
   and neuroimaging responses. This paper discusses the rationale behind a
   computational approach to neuroimaging-based single-subject inference,
   focusing on its potential for characterising disease mechanisms in
   individual subjects and mapping these characterisations to clinical
   predictions. Following an overview of two main approaches - Bayesian
   model selection and generative embedding- which can link computational
   models to individual predictions, we review how these methods
   accommodate heterogeneity in psychiatric and neurological spectrum
   disorders, help avoid erroneous interpretations of neuroimaging data,
   and establish a link between a mechanistic, model-based approach and the
   statistical perspectives afforded by machine learning. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging techniques have greatly enhanced the understanding of
   neurodiversity (human brain variation across individuals) in both health
   and disease. The ultimate goal of using brain imaging biomarkers is to
   perform individualized predictions. Here we proposed a generalized
   framework that can predict explicit values of the targeted measures by
   taking advantage of joint information from multiple modalities. This
   framework also enables whole brain voxel-wise searching by combining
   multivariate techniques such as ReliefF, clustering, correlation-based
   feature selection and multiple regression models, which is more flexible
   and can achieve better prediction performance than alternative
   atlas-based methods. For 50 healthy controls and 47 schizophrenia
   patients, three kinds of features derived from resting-state fMRI
   (fALFF), sMRI (gray matter) and DTI (fractional anisotropy) were
   extracted and fed into a regression model, achieving high prediction for
   both cognitive scores (MCCB composite r = 0.7033, MCCB social cognition
   r = 0.7084) and symptomatic scores (positive and negative syndrome scale
   {[}PANSS] positive r = 0.7785, PANSS negative r = 0.7804). Moreover, the
   brain areas likely responsible for cognitive deficits of schizophrenia,
   including middle temporal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
   striatum, cuneus and cerebellum, were located with different weights, as
   well as regions predicting PANSS symptoms, including thalamus, striatum
   and inferior parietal lobule, pinpointing the potential neuromarkers.
   Finally, compared to a single modality, multimodal combination achieves
   higher prediction accuracy and enables individualized prediction on
   multiple clinical measures. There is more work to be done, but the
   current results highlight the potential utility of multimodal brain
   imaging biomarkers to eventually inform clinical decision-making. (C)

Abstract = {{Prior research conceptualised action understanding primarily as a
   kinematic matching of observed actions to own motor representations but
   has ignored the role of object information. The current study utilized
   fMRI to identify (a) regions uniquely involved in encoding the goal of
   others' actions, and (b) to test whether these goal understanding
   processes draw more strongly on regions involved in encoding object
   semantics or movement kinematics. Participants watched sequences of
   instrumental actions while attending to either the actions' goal (goal
   task), the movements performed (movement task) or the objects used
   (object task). The results confirmed, first, a unique role of the
   inferior frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and medial frontal gyrus
   in action goal understanding. Second, they show for the first time that
   activation in the goal task overlaps directly with object-but not
   movement-related activation. Moreover, subsequent parametric analyses
   revealed that movement-related regions become activated only when goals
   are unclear, or observers have little action experience. In contrast to
   motor theories of action understanding, these data suggest that
   objects-rather than movement kinematics-carry the key information about
   others' actions. Kinematic information is additionally recruited when
   goals are ambiguous or unfamiliar.}},

Abstract = {{Higher levels of self-control in decision making have been linked to
   better psychosocial and physical health. A similar link to health
   outcomes has been reported for heart-rate variability (HRV), a marker of
   physiological flexibility. Here, we sought to link these two, largely
   separate, research domains by testing the hypothesis that greater HRV
   would be associated with better dietary self-control in humans.
   Specifically, we examined whether total HRV at sedentary rest (measured
   as the SD of normal-to-normal intervals) can serve as a biomarker for
   the neurophysiological adaptability that putatively underlies
   self-controlled behavior. We found that HRV explained a significant
   portion of the individual variability in dietary self-control, with
   individuals having higher HRV being better able to downregulate their
   cravings in the face of taste temptations. Furthermore, HRV was
   associated with activity patterns in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC), a key node in the brain's valuation and decision circuitry.
   Specifically, individuals with higher HRV showed both higher overall
   vmPFC blood-oxygen-level-dependent activity and attenuated taste
   representations when presented with a dietary self-control challenge.
   Last, the behavioral and neural associations with HRV were consistent
   across both our stress induction and control experimental conditions.
   The stability of this association across experimental conditions
   suggests that HRV may serve as both a readily obtainable and robust
   biomarker for self-control ability across environmental contexts.}},

Title = {{On the Relation between the General Affective Meaning and the Basic
   Sublexical, Lexical, and Inter-lexical Features of Poetic Texts-A Case
   Study Using 57 Poems of H. M. Enzensberger}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{The literary genre of poetry is inherently related to the expression and
   elicitation of emotion via both content and form. To explore the nature
   of this affective impact at an extremely basic textual level, we
   collected ratings on eight different general affective meaning
   scalesvalence, arousal, friendliness, sadness, spitefulness, poeticity,
   onomatopoeia, and likingfor 57 German poems (die verteidigung der wolfe)
   which the contemporary author H. M. Enzensberger had labeled as either
   friendly, sad, or spiteful. Following Jakobson's (1960) view on the
   vivid interplay of hierarchical text levels, we used multiple regression
   analyses to explore the specific influences of affective features from
   three different text levels (sublexical, lexical, and inter-lexical) on
   the perceived general affective meaning of the poems using three types
   of predictors: (1) Lexical predictor variables capturing the mean
   valence and arousal potential of words; (2) Inter-lexical predictors
   quantifying peaks, ranges, and dynamic changes within the lexical
   affective content; (3) Sublexical measures of basic affective tone
   according to sound-meaning correspondences at the sublexical level (see
   Aryani et al., 2016). We find the lexical predictors to account for a
   major amount of up to 50\% of the variance in affective ratings.
   Moreover, inter-lexical and sublexical predictors account for a large
   portion of additional variance in the perceived general affective
   meaning. Together, the affective properties of all used textual features
   account for 43-70\% of the variance in the affective ratings and still
   for 23-48\% of the variance in the more abstract aesthetic ratings. In
   sum, our approach represents a novel method that successfully relates a
   prominent part of variance in perceived general affective meaning in
   this corpus of German poems to quantitative estimates of affective
   properties of textual components at the sublexical, lexical, and
   inter-lexical level.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that neurological problems more frequent in those
   born preterm are expressed prior to birth, but owing to technical
   limitations, this has been difficult to test in humans. We applied novel
   fetal resting-state functional MRI to measure brain function in 32 human
   fetuses in utero and found that systems-level neural functional
   connectivity was diminished in fetuses that would subsequently be born
   preterm. Neural connectivity was reduced in a left-hemisphere
   pre-language region, and the degree to which connectivity of this left
   language region extended to right-hemisphere homologs was positively
   associated with the time elapsed between fMRI assessment and delivery.
   These results provide the first evidence that altered functional
   connectivity in the preterm brain is identifiable before birth. They
   suggest that neurodevelopmental disorders associated with preterm birth
   may result from neurological insults that begin in utero.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) is a noninvasive
   neuroimaging method to quantify biochemical metabolites in vivo and it
   can serve as a powerful tool to monitor neurobiochemical profiles in the
   brain. Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a type of autism spectrum disorder,
   which is characterized by impaired social skills and restrictive,
   repetitive patterns of interest and activities, while intellectual
   levels and language skills are relatively preserved. Despite clinical
   aspects have been well-characterized, neurometabolic profiling in the
   brain of AS remains to be clear. The present study used proton magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS) to investigate whether pediatric AS is
   associated with measurable neurometabolic abnormalities that can
   contribute new information on the neurobiological underpinnings of the
   disorder.
   Methods
   Study participants consisted of 34 children with AS (2-12 years old;
   mean age 5.2 (+/- 2.0); 28 boys) and 19 typically developed children
   (2-11 years old; mean age 5.6 (+/- 2.6); 12 boys) who served as the
   normal control group. The H-1 MRS data were obtained from two regions of
   interest: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and left cerebellum.
   Results
   In the ACC, levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), total creatine (tCr),
   total choline-containing compounds (tCho) and myo-Inositol (mI) were
   significantly decreased in children with AS compared to controls. On the
   other hand, no significant group differences in any of the metabolites
   were found in the left cerebellum. Neither age nor sex accounted for the
   metabolic findings in the regions.
   Conclusion
   The finding of decreased levels of NAA, tCr, tCho, and mI in the ACC but
   not in left cerebellar voxels in the AS, suggests a lower ACC neuronal
   density in the present AS cohort compared to controls.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is marked by atypical trajectory of brain
   maturation, yet the developmental abnormalities in brain function remain
   unclear. The current study examined the effect of age on amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in ASD and typical controls (TC) using
   a cross-sectional design. We classified all the participants into three
   age cohorts: child (<11 years, 18ASD/20TC), adolescent (11-18 years,
   28ASD/26TC) and adult (>= 18 years, 18ASD/18TC). Two-way analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) was performed to ascertain main effects and interaction
   effects on whole brain ALFF maps. Results exhibited significant main
   effect of diagnosis in ASD with decreased ALFF in the right precuneus
   and left middle occipital gyrus during all developmental stages.
   Significant diagnosis-by-age interaction was observed in the medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with ALFF lowered in autistic children but
   highered in autistic adolescents and adults. Specifically, remarkable
   quadratic change of ALFF with increasing age in mPFC presented in TC
   group was absent in ASD. Additionally, abnormal ALFF values in
   diagnosis-related brain regions predicted the social deficits in ASD.
   Our findings indicated aberrant developmental patterns of spontaneous
   brain activity associated with social deficits in ASD and highlight the
   crucial role of the default mode network in the development of disease.}},

Title = {{Alerted default mode: functional connectivity changes in the aftermath
   of social stress}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{Stress affects the brain at a network level: the salience network is
   supposedly upregulated, while at the same time the executive control
   network is downregulated. While theoretically described, the effects in
   the aftermath of stress have thus far not been tested empirically. Here,
   we compared for the first time resting-state functional connectivity in
   a large sample of healthy volunteers before and after a mild social
   stressor. Following the theoretical prediction, we focused on
   connectivity of the salience network (SN), the executive control network
   (ECN) and the default mode network (DMN). The DMN exhibited increased
   resting-state functional connectivity following the cyberball task to
   the key nodes of the SN, namely the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (dACC) and the anterior insula, as well as sensorimotor regions and
   higher-order visual areas. We conclude that this increased connectivity
   of the DMN with key nodes of the SN and regions responsible for
   preparatory motor activity and visual motion processing indicates a
   shift towards an `alerted default mode' in the aftermath of stress. This
   brain response may be triggered or aggravated by (social) stress induced
   by the cyberball task, enabling individuals to better reorient
   attention, detect salient external stimuli, and deal with the emotional
   and affective consequences of stress.}},

Title = {{Neural substrates of cue reactivity and craving in gambling disorder}},

Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{Cue reactivity is an established procedure in addictions research for
   examining the subjective experience and neural basis of craving. This
   experiment sought to quantify cue-related brain responses in gambling
   disorder using personally tailored cues in conjunction with subjective
   craving, as well as a comparison with appetitive non-gambling stimuli.
   Participants with gambling disorder (n = 19) attending treatment and 19
   controls viewed personally tailored blocks of gambling-related cues, as
   well as neutral cues and highly appetitive (food) images during a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan performed similar to
   2-3 h after a usual meal. fMRI analysis examined cue-related brain
   activity, cue-related changes in connectivity and associations with
   block-byblock craving ratings. Craving ratings in the participants with
   gambling disorder increased following gambling cues compared with
   non-gambling cues. fMRI analysis revealed group differences in left
   insula and anterior cingulate cortex, with the gambling disorder group
   showing greater reactivity to the gambling cues, but no differences to
   the food cues. In participants with gambling disorder, craving to gamble
   correlated positively with gambling cue-related activity in the
   bilateral insula and ventral striatum, and negatively with functional
   connectivity between the ventral striatum and the medial prefrontal
   cortex. Gambling cues, but not food cues, elicit increased brain
   responses in reward-related circuitry in individuals with gambling
   disorder (compared with controls), providing support for the incentive
   sensitization theory of addiction. Activity in the insula co-varied with
   craving intensity, and may be a target for interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are an increasing societal
   burden. Epidemiological studies indicate that lifestyle factors, e.g.
   physical, cognitive and social activities, correlate with reduced
   dementia risk; moreover, positive effects on cognition of
   physical/cognitive training have been found in cognitively unimpaired
   elders. Less is known about effectiveness and action mechanisms of
   physical/cognitive training in elders already suffering from Mild
   Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a population at high risk for dementia. We
   assessed in 113 MCI subjects aged 65-89 years, the efficacy of combined
   physical-cognitive training on cognitive decline, Gray Matter (GM)
   volume loss and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) in hippocampus and
   parahippocampal areas, and on brain-blood-oxygenation-level-dependent
   (BOLD) activity elicited by a cognitive task, measured by ADAS-Cog
   scale, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL)
   and fMRI, respectively, before and after 7 months of training vs. usual
   life. Cognitive status significantly decreased in MCI-no training and
   significantly increased in MCI-training subjects; training increased
   parahippocampal CBF, but no effect on GM volume loss was evident; BOLD
   activity increase, indicative of neural efficiency decline, was found
   only in MCI-no training subjects. These results show that a non
   pharmacological, multicomponent intervention improves cognitive status
   and indicators of brain health in MCI subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Network neuroscience has become an established paradigm to tackle
   questions related to the functional and structural connectome of the
   brain. Recently, interest has been growing in examining the temporal
   dynamics of the brain's network activity. Although different approaches
   to capturing fluctuations in brain connectivity have been proposed,
   there have been few attempts to quantify these fluctuations using
   temporal network theory. This theory is an extension of network theory
   that has been successfully applied to the modeling of dynamic processes
   in economics, social sciences, and engineering article but it has not
   been adopted to a great extent within network neuroscience. The
   objective of this article is twofold: (i) to present a detailed
   description of the central tenets of temporal network theory and
   describe its measures, and; (ii) to apply these measures to a
   resting-state fMRI dataset to illustrate their utility. Furthermore, we
   discuss the interpretation of temporal network theory in the context of
   the dynamic functional brain connectome. All the temporal network
   measures and plotting functions described in this article are freely
   available as the Python package Teneto.}},

Abstract = {{Globally there is increased presence of pets in the households. This
   non-human relationship, with its dimensions of physical and emotional
   bonds, can get severely jolted on the death of the companion animal. It
   sets a feeling, `our life is now left with a void and the house feels
   utterly empty'. Unlike the loss of a child, spouse or parent which
   become a shared tragedy; others may not understand the depth of sadness
   and a sense of void in a grieving pet owner. Emotional pain and physical
   distress due to the loss of a companion animal are likely to be
   pronounced. A big challenge for the medical community is to anticipate,
   identify and address physical and psychosocial symptom burdens in a
   timely manner.}},

Abstract = {{A small percentage of children shows outstanding cognitive abilities and
   perform at much higher levels than their same age peers. Psychological
   science has absorbed knowledge from different spheres such as
   psychometrics, mathematics, statistics, and psychology to develop
   methods for identifying cognitively gifted children. The study of
   intelligence has a long history and has been influenced by social
   environment, wars, education systems and revolutions. In this paper we
   focus on two main techniques of identifying cognitively gifted children
   (a) intelligence testing and (b) domain specific exams called Olympiads
   (e. g., math and physics). We provide a short historical perspective of
   the evolution of intelligence testing in Europe and the USA and domain
   specific Olympiads in Russia. We discuss advantages and limitations of
   both techniques. Moreover, we highlight that cognitive neuroscientists
   have been trying to understand the brain mechanisms that may drive
   cognitive abilities in highly performing children using neuroimaging
   techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We
   summarize the knowledge we gained to date from fMRI studies and show
   that the majority of studies examine mathematically gifted male
   adolescents with mental rotation tasks. Despite critical advances there
   is still a lot to be done in understanding the semantic brain-behavior
   relations in cognitively gifted children.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that depression and anxiety are associated
   to changes in the recognition of facial expression. In the present
   research, a non-clinical sample was evaluated with respect to trait and

   participants evaluated facial expressions of happiness, anger, sadness,
   and fear, presented at four intensities (25, 50, 75, and 100\%), as well
   as the neutral face. Results showed that the trait anxiety was
   associated with a better recognition of anger, fear, and happiness. For
   depression, we only found differences between groups for emotional
   attribution to neutral faces, in which participants scoring high in
   depression were more likely to attribute fear to neutral faces. Findings
   indicate an improvement of the recognition of happiness, anger, and fear
   in trait anxiety, whereas symptoms of depression and state anxiety were
   associated to changes in the evaluation of neutral faces in non-clinical

Pages = {{281-293}},
Abstract = {{Drawing on the recent concussion litigation from the United States'
   National Football League (NFL), the paper examines the emergence of
   neuroscience knowledge as part of a defining rationale for the
   justification and rationalization of the lawsuit. The paper argues that
   neuroscience knowledge is best understood as a regulatory discourse that
   is attached to larger social, political, and economic realities that
   bring it into being as a legitimate type of knowledge. This larger
   socio-political governance logic is one that scholars call
   `biopolitical' which emphasizes the protection of individual life over
   and above other ways of being. Risk discourses that frame risk-taking
   practices as immoral thus emerge within this biopolitical regime of
   governance that frame morality in terms of public health that individual
   citizens ought to pursue. With this in mind neuroscience knowledge plays
   an important role in concussion litigation. It emerges as a technology
   of biopolitical governance in that it is used to justify legal decisions
   on concussion. This is despite the fact that neuroscience knowledge
   remains nascent and even scientifically uncertain. Because of this, the
   paper argues that scholars ought to not only consider neuroscience
   research skeptically, but also ought to be aware of the dangers of
   neuroscience's emergence as an `anticipatory discourse' that has the
   potential to reduce human behavior to matters of the brain that thus
   transforms our very ontology of ourselves and the practices we perceive
   as `good'.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{730-742}},
Abstract = {{False belief (FB) reasoning is a key Theory of Mind (ToM) competence. By
   4 years of age, children understand that a person's behavior can be
   based on a FB about reality. Children cannot understand that a person's
   emotion can also be based on a FB before the age of six. In order to
   generate hypothesis on basic processes distinguishing these two types of
   belief reasoning, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging
   study in adults directly compares functional activity associated with
   these two FB tasks. Both tasks were associated with activity in the ToM
   network including the medial prefrontal cortex and the left
   temporo-parietal junction. Differential activity was observed in the
   anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for FB-based emotion relative to
   behavior attribution. Contrary to FB behavior attribution, FB-based
   emotion attribution requires the processing of two different mental
   states: a belief and an emotion and their relation to each other. The
   activity pattern may reflect the differential demands on cognitive
   processes associated with the two different belief-based attribution
   processes. These results shed new light on the still ongoing debate
   about the nature of the developmental lag between the two FB tasks.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN INJURY}},

Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{1331-1339}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in significant social
   dysfunction, which is represented by impairment to social-cognitive
   abilities (i.e. social cognition, social attention/executive function
   and communication). This study is aimed to explore brain networks
   mediating the social dysfunction after TBI and its underlying
   mechanisms. Methods: We performed a quantitative meta-analysis using the
   activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach on functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of social-cognitive abilities following
   TBI. Sixteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria resulting in a
   total of 190 patients with TBI and 206 controls enrolled in the ALE
   meta-analysis. Results: The temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were the specific regions that social
   cognition predominantly engaged. The cingulate gyrus, frontal gyrus and
   inferior parietal lobule were the main regions related to social
   attention/executive functions. Communication dysfunction, especially
   related to language deficits, was found to show greater activation of
   the temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus in TBI. Conclusion: The current
   ALE meta-analytic findings provide evidence that patients have
   significant social-cognitive disabilities following TBI. The relatively
   limited pool of literature and the varied fMRI results from published
   studies indicate that social-cognitive abilities following TBI is an
   area that would greatly benefit from further investigation.}},

   enough discussion in neuromarketing-relevant literature, and which we
   consider to be somewhat problematic. These are the dominance of
   event-based designs in neuromarketing, the potential of alternative
   modalities in neuromarketing and the current focus on reverse inference
   in neuromarketing. We argue that, taken together, these points have
   substantive implications for the development of a more reflective
   neuromarketing, which in turn has greater potential to make a positive
   impact on marketing knowledge, marketing practice and public perceptions

Abstract = {{Adolescents with prenatal substance (drug and alcohol) exposure exhibit
   inhibitory control (IC) deficits and aberrations in associated neural
   function. Nearly all research to date examines exposure to individual
   substances, and a minimal amount is known about the effects of
   heterogeneous exposurewhich is more representative of population
   exposure levels. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we
   investigated IC (Go/NoGo) in heterogeneously exposed (n=7) vs. control
   (n=7) at-risk adolescents (ages 13-17). The fMRI results indicated
   multiple IC processing differences consistent with a more immature
   developmental profile for exposed adolescents (Exposed>Nonexposed:
   NoGo>Go: right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, right cuneus, and left
   inferior parietal lobe; NoGo>false alarm: occipital lobe; Go>false
   alarm: right anterior prefrontal cortex). Simple effects suggest exposed
   adolescents exhibited exaggerated correct trial but decreased incorrect
   trial activation. Results provide initial evidence that prenatal
   exposure across substances creates similar patterns of atypical brain
   activation to IC success and failure.}},

Title = {{Spatial Navigation Impairment Is Associated with Alterations in

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Impairment of spatial navigation (SN) skills is one of the features of
   the Alzheimer's disease (AD) already at the stage of mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI). We used a computer-based battery of spatial navigation
   tests to measure the SN performance in 22 MCI patients as well as 21
   normal controls (NC). In order to evaluate intrinsic activity in the
   subcortical regions that may play a role in SN, we measured ALFF, fALFF,
   and ReHo derived within 14 subcortical regions. We observed reductions
   of intrinsic activity in MCI patients. We also demonstrated that the MCI
   versus NC group difference can modulate activity-behavior relationship,
   that is, the correlation slopes between ReHo and allocentric SN task
   total errors were significantly different between NC and MCI groups in
   the right hippocampus (interaction F = 4 44, p = 0 05), pallidum (F = 8
   97, p = 0 005), and thalamus (F = 5 95, p = 0 02), which were negative
   in NC (right hippocampus, r = -0 49; right pallidum, r = -0 50; right
   thalamus, r = -0 45; all p < 0 05) but absent in MCI (right hippocampus,
   r = 0 21; right pallidum, r = 0 32; right thalamus r = 0 28; all p > 0
   2). These findings may provide a novel insight of the brain mechanism
   associated with SN impairment in MCI and indicated a stage specificity
   of brain-behavior correlation in dementia.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the actions of other people is a key component of social

   near infrared spectroscopy (EEG-fNIRS) bimodal system to investigate the
   temporal-spatial features of action intention understanding. We measured
   brain activation while participants observed three actions: 1) grasping
   a cup for drinking; 2) grasping a cup for moving; and 3) no meaningful
   intention. Analysis of EEG maximum standardized current density revealed
   that brain activation transitioned from the left to the right
   hemisphere. EEG-fNIRS source analysis results revealed that both the
   mirror neuron system and theory of mind network are involved in action
   intention understanding, and the extent to which these two systems are
   engaged appears to be determined by the clarity of the observed
   intention. These findings indicate that action intention understanding
   is a complex and dynamic process.}},

Title = {{Impact of automated ICA-based denoising of fMRI data in acute stroke
   patients}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{16}},
Pages = {{23-31}},
Abstract = {{Different strategies have been developed using Independent Component
   Analysis (ICA) to automatically de-noise fMRI data, either focusing on
   removing only certain components (e.g. motion-ICA-AROMA, Pruim et al.,
   2015a) or using more complex classifiers to remove multiple types of
   noise components (e.g. FIX, Salimi-Khorshidi et al., 2014 Griffanti et
   al., 2014). However, denoising data obtained in an acute setting might
   prove challenging: the presence of multiple noise sources may not allow
   focused strategies to clean the data enough and the heterogeneity in the
   data may be so great to critically undermine complex approaches. The
   purpose of this study was to explore what automated ICA based approach
   would better cope with these limitations when cleaning fMRI data
   obtained from acute stroke patients.
   The performance of a focused classifier (ICA-AROMA) and a complex
   classifier (FIX) approaches were compared using data obtained from
   twenty consecutive acute lacunar stroke patients using metrics
   determining RSN identification, RSN reproducibility, changes in the BOLD
   variance, differences in the estimation of functional connectivity and
   loss of temporal degrees of freedom.
   The use of generic-trained FIX resulted in misclassification of
   components and significant loss of signal (< 80\%), and was not explored
   further. Both ICA-AROMA and patient-trained FIX based denoising
   approaches resulted in significantly improved RSN reproducibility (p <
   0.001), localized reduction in BOLD variance consistent with noise
   removal, and significant changes in functional connectivity (p < 0.001).
   Patient-trained FIX resulted in higher RSN identifiability (p < 0.001)
   and wider changes both in the BOLD variance and in functional
   connectivity compared to ICA-AROMA.
   The success of ICA-AROMA suggests that by focusing on selected
   components the full automation can deliver meaningful data for analysis
   even in population with multiple sources of noise. However, the time
   invested to train FIX with appropriate patient data proved valuable,
   particularly in improving the signal-to-noise ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Atypical amygdala responses to emotional stimuli have been consistently
   reported in youth with Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBDs; Conduct
   Disorder/Oppositional Defiant Disorder). However, responding to animacy
   stimuli has not been systematically investigated. Yet, the amygdala is
   known to be responsive to animacy stimuli and impairment in
   responsiveness to animacy information may have implications for social
   cognitive development. Twenty-nine youth with DBDs and 20 typically
   developing youth, matched for IQ, age (M-age = 14.45, SD = 2.05) and
   gender, completed a dot probe task during fMRI. Stimuli consisted of
   negative/faces, negative/ objects, neutral/faces and neutral/objects
   images. Youth with DBDs, relative to typically developing youth, showed:
   i) reduced amygdala and lateral temporal cortex responses to faces
   relative to objects. Moreover, within the group of youth with DBDs,
   increasing callous-unemotional traits were associated with lesser
   amygdala responses to faces relative to objects. These data suggest that
   youth with DBDs, particularly those with high levels of CU traits
   exhibit dysfunction in animacy processing in the amygdala. This
   dysfunction may underpin the asociality reported in these youth.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Depressive symptoms are significant and very common
   psychiatric complications in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD),
   which can aggravate the decline in social function. However, changes in
   the functional connectivity (FC) of the brain in AD patients with
   depressive symptoms (D-AD) remain unclear.
   Objective: To investigate whether any differences exist in the FC of the
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) between D-AD patients and non-depressed
   AD patients (nD-AD).
   Materials and methods: We recruited 15 D-AD patients and 17 age-, sex-,
   educational level-, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)-matched
   nD-AD patients to undergo tests using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory,
   Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and 3.0T resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Bilateral PCC were selected as the regions
   of interest and between-group differences in the PCC FC network were
   assessed using Student's t-test.
   Results: Compared with the nD-AD group, D-AD patients showed increased
   PCC FC in the right amygdala, right parahippocampus, right superior
   temporal pole, right middle temporal lobe, right middle temporal pole,
   and right hippocampus (AlphaSim correction; P, 0.05). In the nD-AD
   group, MMSE scores were positively correlated with PCC FC in the right
   superior temporal pole and right hippocampus (false discovery rate

   Conclusion: Differences were detected in PCC FC between nD-AD and D-AD
   patients, which may be related to depressive symptoms. Our study
   provides a significant enhancement to our understanding of the
   functional mechanisms underlying D-AD.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroeconomics and neuroethics are subfields of cognitive neuroscience
   that address the neural correlates of distinct, although strongly

   investigates the neural mechanisms underlying the maximization of
   personal economic utility, neuroethics integrates such knowledge with
   that provided by social neurosciences, in order to address typical
   questions in ethics and moral philosophy. We review the available
   research to contrast the hypothesis that both individual economic and
   socio-moral choices rely on a common brain network receiving
   domainspecific inputs (Extended Common Currency Schema) and the claim
   that a specific brain network underpins choices in a socio-moral context
   (Social-Valutation-Specific Schema). In line with the former model,
   currently available evidence supports the existence of a single brain
   network associated with both choice types, regardless of the economic
   individual vs. socio-moral decisional context.}},

Abstract = {{In the article, I discussed the features of development and current
   status of a new research area neurosociology. This approach appeared in
   the decade of the brain 1990s, and the first work in this direction was
   published in 2000s. In the moment of the appearance, other multilevel
   research areas cultural neuroscience, social neuroscience,
   neuroeconomics had taken their first steps towards integrating neural,
   cognitive and social levels of organization of different psychological
   phenomena, such as emotion, clinical disorders, self-regulation,
   development, decision making and so on. Sociologists are less intensive
   in their efforts, the neurosociological association is very small, and
   has not yet clearly defined their area of investigation; thus, studies
   under label ``neurosociology{''} are closest to the aforementioned
   integrative research, especially social neuroscience. Sociologists fear
   biological reductionism and elimination of social mechanisms in
   considering social phenomena. Moreover, in contrast to psychologists,
   sociologists have poorer background for conducting experiments by using
   specific neuroscientific methods fMRI, PET, ERP, TMS, etc. And they have
   no institutional connections with the scholars from neuroscience. The
   perspective of neurosociology is research of neurobiological mechanisms
   of social processes represented simultaneously on micro-(social behavior
   and interactions, social perception, decision making, etc.) and
   macro-levels (social institutions, socio-economic differentiation,
   political ideologies, cultural values, etc.).}},

Title = {{Predicting cognitive behavioral therapy response in social anxiety
   disorder with anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala during emotion
   regulation}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{25-34}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for social anxiety
   disorder (SAD) and other internalizing conditions attempts to improve
   emotion regulation. Accumulating data indicate anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC), and to a lesser extent amygdala, activation in various tasks
   predicts treatment outcome. However, little is known about ACC and
   amygdala activation to emotion regulation in predicting clinical
   improvement following CBT in SAD.
   Methods: Before treatment, 38 SAD patients completed implicit and
   explicit emotion regulation paradigms during fMRI. Implicit regulation
   involved attentional control over negative distractors. Explicit
   regulation comprised cognitive reappraisal to negative images. Pre-CBT
   brain activity was circumscribed to anatomicalbased ACC sub-regions
   (rostral, dorsal) and amygdala masks, which were submitted to ROC curves
   to examine predictive validity as well as correlational analysis to
   evaluate prognostic change in symptom severity.
   Results: More rostral (rACC) activity in implicit regulation and less
   rACC activity during explicit regulation distinguished responders (34\%)
   from non-responders. Greater amygdala response in implicit regulation
   also foretold responder status. Baseline rACC and amygdala activity
   during attentional control correlated with pre-topost CBT change in
   symptom severity such that more activation was related to greater
   decline in symptoms. No significant correlations were observed for
   explicit regulation.
   Conclusions: Across forms of regulation, rACC activity predicted
   responder status whereas amygdala as a neuromarker was limited to
   implicit regulation. While the direction of effects (enhanced vs.
   reduced) in rACC activity was task-dependent, results suggest SAD
   patients with deficient regulation benefited more from CBT. Findings
   support previous studies involving patients with depression and suggest
   the rACC may be a viable marker of clinical improvement in SAD.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{80-94}},
Abstract = {{Substance-dependent individuals often lack the ability to adjust
   decisions flexibly in response to the changes in reward contingencies.
   Prediction errors (PEs) are thought to mediate flexible decision-making
   by updating the reward values associated with available actions. In this
   study, we explored whether the neurobiological correlates of PEs are
   altered in alcohol dependence. Behavioral, and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data were simultaneously acquired from 34
   abstinent alcohol-dependent patients (ADP) and 26 healthy controls (HC)
   during a probabilistic reward-guided decision-making task with
   dynamically changing reinforcement contingencies. A hierarchical
   Bayesian inference method was used to fit and compare learning models
   with different assumptions about the amount of task-related information
   subjects may have inferred during the experiment. Here, we observed that
   the best-fitting model was a modified Rescorla-Wagner type model, the
   ``double-update{''} model, which assumes that subjects infer the
   knowledge that reward contingencies are anticorrelated, and integrate
   both actual and hypothetical outcomes into their decisions. Moreover,
   comparison of the best-fitting model's parameters showed that ADP were
   less sensitive to punishments compared to HC. Hence, decisions of ADP
   after punishments were loosely coupled with the expected reward values
   assigned to them. A correlation analysis between the model-generated PEs
   and the fMRI data revealed a reduced association between these PEs and
   the BOLD activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of ADP.
   A hemispheric asymmetry was observed in the DLPFC when positive and
   negative PE signals were analyzed separately. The right DLPFC activity
   in ADP showed a reduced correlation with positive PEs. On the other
   hand, ADP, particularly the patients with high dependence severity,
   recruited the left DLPFC to a lesser extent than HC for processing
   negative PE signals. These results suggest that the DLPFC, which has
   been linked to adaptive control of action selection, may play an
   important role in cognitive inflexibility observed in alcohol dependence
   when reinforcement contingencies change. Particularly, the left DLPFC
   may contribute to this impaired behavioral adaptation, possibly by
   impeding the extinction of the actions that no longer lead to a reward.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Pages = {{112-121}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral research has revealed deficits in the development of joint
   attention (JA) as one of the earliest signs of autism. While the neural
   basis of JA has been studied predominantly in adults, we recently
   demonstrated a protracted development of the brain networks supporting
   JA in typically developing children and adolescents. The present
   eye-tracking/fMRI study now extends these findings to adolescents with
   autism. Our results show that in adolescents with autism JA is subserved
   by abnormal activation patterns in brain areas related to social
   cognition abnormalities which are at the core of ASD including the STS
   and TPJ, despite behavioral maturation with no behavioral differences.
   Furthermore, in the autism group we observed increased neural activity
   in a network of social and emotional processing areas during
   interactions with their mother. Moreover, data indicated that less
   severely affected individuals with autism showed higher frontal
   activation associated with self-initiated interactions. Taken together,
   this study provides first-time data of JA in children/adolescents with
   autism incorporating the interactive character of JA, its reciprocity
   and motivational aspects. The observed functional differences in
   adolescents ASD suggest that persistent developmental differences in the
   neural processes underlying JA contribute to social interaction
   difficulties in ASD. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Title = {{The effect of repetitive subconcussive collisions on brain integrity in
   collegiate football players over a single football season: A multi-modal
   neuroimaging study}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Pages = {{708-718}},
Abstract = {{The cumulative effect of repetitive subconcussive collisions on the
   structural and functional integrity of the brain remains largely
   unknown. Athletes in collision sports, like football, experience a large
   number of impacts across a single season of play. The majority of these
   impacts, however, are generally overlooked, and their long-term
   consequences remain poorly understood. This study sought to examine the
   effects of repetitive collisions across a single competitive season in
   NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision athletes using advanced neuroimaging
   approaches. Players were evaluated before and after the season using
   multiple MRI sequences, including T1 weighted imaging, diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI), arterial spin labeling (ASL), resting-state functional
   MRI (rsfMRI), and susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI). While no
   significant differences were found between pre- and post-season for DTI
   metrics or cortical volumes, seed-based analysis of rs-fMRI revealed
   significant (p < 0.05) changes in functional connections to right
   isthmus of the cingulate cortex (ICC), left ICC, and left hippocampus.
   ASL data revealed significant (p < 0.05) increases in global cerebral
   blood flow (CBF), with a specific regional increase in right postcentral
   gyrus. SWI data revealed that 44\% of the players exhibited outlier
   rates (p < 0.05) of regional decreases in SWI signal. Of key interest,
   athletes in whom changes in rs-fMRI, CBF and SWI were observed were more
   likely to have experienced high G impacts on a daily basis. These
   findings are indicative of potential pathophysiological changes in brain
   integrity arising from only a single season of participation in the NCAA
   Football Bowl Subdivision, even in the absence of clinical symptoms or a
   diagnosis of concussion. Whether these changes reflect compensatory
   adaptation to cumulative head impacts or more lasting alteration of
   brain integrity remains to be further explored.}},

Abstract = {{Risk-taking is purported to be central to addictive behaviors. However,
   for Internet gaming disorder (IGD), a condition conceptualized as a
   behavioral addiction, the neural processes underlying impaired
   decision-making (risk evaluation and outcome processing) related to
   gains and losses have not been systematically investigated. Forty-one
   males with IGD and 27 healthy comparison (HC) male participants were
   recruited, and the cups task was used to identify neural processes
   associated with gain- and loss-related risk- and outcome-processing in
   IGD. During risk evaluation, the IGD group, compared to the HC
   participants, showed weaker modulation for experienced risk within the
   bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (t = -4.07; t = -3.94;
   P-FWE < 0.05) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (t = -4.08; t = -4.08;
   P-FWE < 0.05) for potential losses. The modulation of the left DLPFC and
   bilateral IPL activation were negatively related to addiction severity
   within the IGD group (r = -0.55; r = -0.61; r = -0.51; P-FWE < 0.05).
   During outcome processing, the IGD group presented greater responses for
   the experienced reward within the ventral striatum, ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (t = 5.04, P-FWE <
   0.05) for potential gains, as compared to HC participants. Within the
   IGD group, the increased reward-related activity in the right OFC was
   positively associated with severity of IGD (r = 0.51, P-FWE < 0.05).
   These results provide a neurobiological foundation for decision-making
   deficits in individuals with IGD and suggest an imbalance between
   hypersensitivity for reward and weaker risk experience and self-control
   for loss. The findings suggest a biological mechanism for why
   individuals with IGD may persist in game-seeking behavior despite
   negative consequences, and treatment development strategies may focus on
   targeting these neural pathways in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: We aimed to examine how spontaneous brain activity might be
   related to the pathophysiology of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
   Patients and methods: Using resting-state functional MRI, we examined
   spontaneous regional brain activity in 31 GAD patients (mean age, 36.87
   +/- 9.16 years) and 36 healthy control participants (mean age, 39.53 +/-
   8.83 years) matched for age, education, and sex from December 2014 to
   October 2015. We performed a two-sample t-test on the voxel-based
   analysis of the regional homogeneity (ReHo) maps. We used Pearson
   correlation analysis to compare scores from the Hamilton Anxiety Rating
   Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Scale-Trait
   Scale, and mean ReHo values.
   Results: We found abnormal spontaneous activity in multiple regions of
   brain in GAD patients, especially in the sensorimotor cortex and
   emotional regions. GAD patients showed decreased ReHo values in the
   right orbital middle frontal gyrus, left anterior cingulate cortex,
   right middle frontal gyrus, and bilateral supplementary motor areas,
   with increased ReHo values in the left middle temporal gyrus, left
   superior temporal gyrus, and right superior occipital gyrus. The ReHo
   value of the left middle temporal gyrus correlated positively with the
   Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that altered local synchronization of
   spontaneous brain activity may be related to the pathophysiology of GAD.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{494-505}},
Abstract = {{Motivational interdependence is an organizing principle in Schwartz's
   circumplex model of social values, which has received abundant
   cross-cultural support. We used fMRI to test whether motivational
   relations between social values predict different brain responses in a
   situation of choice between values. We hypothesized that differences in
   brain responses would become evident when the more important value had
   to be selected in pairs of congruent (e.g., wealth and success) as
   opposed to incongruent (e.g., curiosity and stability) values as they
   are described in Schwartz's model, because the former serve mutually
   facilitating motives, whereas the latter serve mutually inhibiting
   motives. Consistent with the model, choosing between congruent values
   led to longer response times and more activation in conflict-related
   brain regions (e.g., the supplementary motor area, dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex) than selecting between incongruent values. These
   results provide novel neural evidence supporting the circumplex model's
   predictions about motivational interdependence between social values. In
   particular, our results show that the neural networks underlying social
   values are organized in a way that allows activation patterns related to
   motivational similarity between congruent values to be dissociated from
   those related to incongruent values.}},

Abstract = {{The mentalizing network is atypically activated in autism and
   schizophrenia spectrum disorders. While these disorders are considered
   diagnostically independent, expressions of both can co-occur in the same
   individual. We examined the concurrent effect of autism traits and
   psychosis proneness on the activity of the mentalizing network in 24
   neurotypical adults while performing a social competitive game.
   Activations were observed in the paracingulate cortex and the right
   temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). Autism traits and psychosis proneness
   did not modulate activity within the paracingulate or the dorsal
   component of the rTPJ. However, diametric modulations of autism traits
   and psychosis proneness were observed in the posterior (rvpTPJ) and
   anterior (rvaTPJ) subdivisions of the ventral rTPJ, which respectively
   constitute core regions within the mentalizing and attention-reorienting
   networks. Within the rvpTPJ, increasing autism tendencies decreased
   activity, and increasing psychosis proneness increased activity. This
   effect was reversed within the rvaTPJ. We suggest that this results from
   an interaction between regions responsible for higher level social
   cognitive processing (rvpTPJ) and regions responsible for domain-general
   attentional processes (rvaTPJ). The observed diametric modulation of
   autism tendencies and psychosis proneness of neuronal activity within
   the mentalizing network highlights the importance of assessing both
   autism and psychosis expressions within the individual.}},

   attenuated sympathetic responses to those violations). We examined
   whether university students who have experienced a mild head injury
   (MHI), and are asymptomatic, present with a similar pattern of
   responding to moral dilemmas. Students reporting a history of MHI
   responded more quickly when making moral choices and exhibited less
   reticence toward the endorsement of personal moral transgressions than
   their non-MHI counterparts. Our results are consistent with studies
   involving persons with more serious, and evident, neuronal injury, and
   emphasize the important relationship between head injury and moral
   decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{As society becomes more reliant on machines and automation,
   understanding how people utilize advice is a necessary endeavor. Our
   objective was to reveal the underlying neural associations during advice
   utilization from expert human and machine agents with fMRI and
   multivariate Granger causality analysis. During an X-ray
   luggage-screening task, participants accepted or rejected good or bad
   advice from either the human or machine agent framed as experts with
   manipulated reliability (high miss rate). We showed that the
   machine-agent group decreased their advice utilization compared to the
   human-agent group and these differences in behaviors during advice
   utilization could be accounted for by high expectations of reliable
   advice and changes in attention allocation due to miss errors. Brain
   areas involved with the salience and mentalizing networks, as well as
   sensory processing involved with attention, were recruited during the
   task and the advice utilization network consisted of attentional
   modulation of sensory information with the lingual gyrus as the driver
   during the decision phase and the fusiform gyrus as the driver during
   the feedback phase. Our findings expand on the existing literature by
   showing that misses degrade advice utilization, which is represented in
   a neural network involving salience detection and self-processing with
   perceptual integration.}},

Abstract = {{Attributing mind to interaction partners has been shown to increase the
   social relevance we ascribe to others' actions and to modulate the
   amount of attention dedicated to them. However, it remains unclear how
   the relationship between higher-order mind attribution and lower-level
   attention processes is established in the brain. In this neuroimaging
   study, participants saw images of an anthropomorphic robot that moved
   its eyes left- or rightwards to signal the appearance of an upcoming
   stimulus in the same (valid cue) or opposite location (invalid cue).
   Independently, participants' beliefs about the intentionality underlying
   the observed eye movements were manipulated by describing the eye
   movements as under human control or preprogrammed. As expected, we
   observed a validity effect behaviorally and neurologically (increased
   response times and activation in the invalid vs. valid condition). More
   importantly, we observed that this effect was more pronounced for the
   condition in which the robot's behavior was believed to be controlled by
   a human, as opposed to be preprogrammed. This interaction effect between
   cue validity and belief was, however, only found at the neural level and
   was manifested as a significant increase of activation in bilateral
   anterior temporoparietal junction.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{361-365}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a perceptual condition in
   which specific visual and auditory stimuli consistently trigger tingling
   sensations on the scalp and neck, sometimes spreading to the back and
   limbs. These triggering stimuli are often social, almost intimate, in
   nature (e.g., hearing whispering, or watching someone brush her hair),
   and often elicit a calm and positive emotional state. Surprisingly,
   despite its prevalence in the general population, no published study has
   examined the neural underpinnings of ASMR. In the current study, the
   default mode network (DMN) of 11 individuals with ASMR was contrasted to
   that of 11 matched controls. The results indicated that the DMN of
   individuals with ASMR showed significantly less functional connectivity
   than that of controls. The DMN of individuals with ASMR also
   demonstrated increased connectivity between regions in the occipital,
   frontal, and temporal cortices, suggesting that ASMR was associated with
   a blending of multiple resting-state networks. This atypical functional
   connectivity likely influences the unique sensory-emotional experiences
   associated with ASMR.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{366-378}},
Abstract = {{It is not uncommon for people to openly admit to pirating information
   from the internet despite the known legal consequences. Those same
   people are often less inclined to steal the same physical item from a
   shop. This raises the question, why do people have fewer reservations
   with stealing intangible items compared to tangible? Using
   questionnaires and fMRI we provide evidence across three studies as to
   the differences between tangible and intangible theft. In a
   questionnaire (Study 1), participants revealed that across different
   conditions they were more willing to steal intangible compared to
   tangible goods. Study 2a used fMRI to reveal that a network involved in
   imagining objects was more active when participants were representing
   intangible versus tangible objects, suggesting people have greater
   difficulty representing intangible items. Study 2b used fMRI to show
   that when stealing tangible objects versus intangible, participants had
   increased activation in left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, an area
   typically activated in response to morally laden situations. The
   findings from the current investigation provide novel insights into the
   higher prevalence of intangible theft and suggest that differential
   neural representation of tangible and intangible items may, in part,
   explain why people are more willing to steal intangible items.}},

   population}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{386-390}},
Abstract = {{Empathic concern has traditionally been conceived of as a spontaneous
   reaction to others experiencing pain or distress. As such, the potential
   role of more deliberate control over empathic responses has frequently
   been overlooked. The present fMRI study evaluated the role of such
   deliberate control in empathic concern by examining the extent to which
   a sample of offenders recruited through probation/parole could
   voluntarily modulate their neural activity to another person in pain.
   Offenders were asked to either passively view pictures of other people
   in painful or non-painful situations, or to actively modulate their
   level of concern for the person in pain. During passive viewing of
   painful versus non-painful pictures, offenders showed minimal neural
   activity in regions previously linked to empathy for pain (e.g., dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula). However, when
   instructed to try to increase their concern for the person in pain,
   offenders demonstrated significant increases within these regions. These
   findings are consistent with recent theories of empathy as motivational
   in nature, and suggest that limitations in empathic concern may include
   a motivational component.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{391-399}},
Abstract = {{This study tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the
   activity of the orbitofrontal cortex, a region implicated in value-based
   decision-making, are associated with the preference for a person with a
   partner, which could lead to mate poaching. During functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), male participants were presented with facial
   photographs of (a) attractive females with a partner, (b) attractive
   females without a partner, (c) unattractive females with a partner, and
   (d) unattractive females without a partner. The participants were asked
   to rate the degree to which they desired a romantic relationship with
   each female using an 8-point scale. The participants rated attractive
   females higher than unattractive females, and this effect was associated
   with ventral striatum activation. The participants also indicated lower
   ratings for females with a partner than for females without a partner,
   and this effect was associated with parietal cortex activation. As
   predicted, the participants characterized by higher orbitofrontal
   activity demonstrated a greater willingness to engage in a romantic
   relationship with females who have a partner compared with females who
   do not have a partner. These results are the first to provide a possible

Abstract = {{Self-report evidence suggests that consumers prefer green products
   (i.e., pro-environmental) to standard products, but this is not
   reflected in purchase behaviors. To understand this disconnect, we
   exposed participants in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to
   green and standard ads. After viewing each ad, participants rated liking
   and perceived sustainability. Ratings were more favorable for green ads
   than for control ads, but the functional MRI data suggested an opposite
   patternparticipants showed greater activation in regions associated with
   personal value and reward (ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral
   striatum) in response to control ads relative to green ads. In addition,
   participants showed greater activity in these regions to the extent that
   they reported liking control ads, but there was no such trend for green
   ads. In line with a neuroeconomic account, we suggest that activity in
   these regions may be indexing a value signal computed during message
   exposure that may influence downstream purchase decisions, in contrast
   to self-reported evaluations that may reflect social desirability
   concerns absent at the point of purchase.}},

   reward}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{419-429}},
Abstract = {{Although goal pursuit is related to both functioning of the brain's
   reward circuits and psychological factors, the literatures surrounding
   these concepts have often been separate. Here, we use the psychological
   construct of regulatory focus to investigate individual differences in
   neural response to reward. Regulatory focus theory proposes two
   motivational orientations for personal goal pursuit: (1) promotion,
   associated with sensitivity to potential gain, and (2) prevention,
   associated with sensitivity to potential loss. The monetary incentive
   delay task was used to manipulate reward circuit function, along with
   instructional framing corresponding to promotion and prevention in a
   within-subject design. We observed that the more promotion oriented an
   individual was, the lower their ventral striatum response to gain cues.
   Follow-up analyses revealed that greater promotion orientation was
   associated with decreased ventral striatum response even to no-value
   cues, suggesting that promotion orientation may be associated with
   relatively hypoactive reward system function. The findings are also
   likely to represent an interaction between the cognitive and
   motivational characteristics of the promotion system with the task
   demands. Prevention orientation did not correlate with ventral striatum
   response to gain cues, supporting the discriminant validity of
   regulatory focus theory. The results highlight a dynamic association
   between individual differences in self-regulation and reward system
   function.}},

Title = {{Resting-state theta band connectivity and graph analysis in generalized
   social anxiety disorder}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{24-32}},
Abstract = {{Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting-state
   studies show generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated
   with disturbances in networks involved in emotion regulation, emotion
   processing, and perceptual functions, suggesting a network framework is
   integral to elucidating the pathophysiology of gSAD. However, fMRI does
   not measure the fast dynamic interconnections of functional networks.
   Therefore, we examined whole-brain functional connectomics with
   electroencephalogram (EEG) during resting-state.
   Methods: Resting-state EEG data was recorded for 32 patients with gSAD
   and 32 demographically-matched healthy controls (HC). Sensor-level
   connectivity analysis was applied on EEG data by using Weighted Phase
   Lag Index (WPLI) and graph analysis based on WPLI was used to determine
   clustering coefficient and characteristic path length to estimate local
   integration and global segregation of networks.
   Results: WPLI results showed increased oscillatory midline coherence in
   the theta frequency band indicating higher connectivity in the gSAD
   relative to HC group during rest. Additionally, WPLI values positively
   correlated with state anxiety levels within the gSAD group but not the
   HC group. Our graph theory based connectomics analysis demonstrated
   increased clustering coefficient and decreased characteristic path
   length in theta-based whole brain functional organization in subjects
   with gSAD compared to HC.
   Conclusions: Theta-dependent interconnectivity was associated with state
   anxiety in gSAD and an increase in information processing efficiency in
   gSAD (compared to controls). Results may represent enhanced baseline
   self-focused attention, which is consistent with cognitive models of
   gSAD and fMRI studies implicating emotion dys-regulation and
   disturbances in task negative networks (e.g., default mode network) in
   gSAD. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

   and facial-emotion recognition abilities in adults with traumatic brain
   injury}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{370-377}},
Abstract = {{Although several studies have demonstrated that facial-affect
   recognition impairment is common following moderate-severe traumatic
   brain injury (TBI), and that there are diffuse alterations in
   large-scale functional brain networks in TBI populations, little is
   known about the relationship between the two. Here, in a sample of 26
   participants with TBI and 20 healthy comparison participants (HC) we
   measured facial-affect recognition abilities and resting-state
   functional connectivity (rs-FC) using fMRI. We then used network-based
   statistics to examine (A) the presence of rs-FC differences between
   individuals with TBI and HC within the facial-affect processing network,
   and (B) the association between inter-individual differences in emotion
   recognition skills and rs-FC within the facial-affect processing
   network. We found that participants with TBI showed significantly lower
   rs-FC in a component comprising homotopic and within-hemisphere,
   anterior-posterior connections with in the facial-affect processing
   network. In addition, within the TBI group, participants with higher
   emotion-labeling skills showed stronger rs-FC within a network comprised
   of intra-and inter-hemispheric bilateral connections. Findings indicate
   that the ability to successfully recognize facial-affect after TBI is
   related to rs-FC within components of facial-affective networks, and
   provide new evidence that further our understanding of the mechanisms
   underlying emotion recognition impairment in TBI. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{As adolescent anxiety is common and costly, identifying effective

   adolescents could learn to use cognitive reappraisal strategies to

   (12-15 years) viewed images of two neutral faces, one which was paired
   with a fearful expression and shrieking scream (conditioned threat
   stimulus) and the other that was never paired with the aversive outcome
   (conditioned safety stimulus) during fear acquisition. Before
   extinction, participants either received cognitive appraisal training,
   which explored alternative, benign meanings associated with the scream
   or a control activity. Self-reported fear ratings in the cognitive
   reappraisal group were significantly lower to both the conditioned
   threat and safety stimuli after extinction than the control group. These
   findings did not characterise fear-potentiated startle data. Potential
   reasons for the lack of consistency between measures are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Poor social networks and decreased levels of social support are

   This study examined functional brain substrates associated with social
   networks using the Social Network Index (SNI) and resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Resting-state fMRI data
   from 28 non-demented older adults were analyzed with independent
   components analyses. As expected, four established resting-state
   networks-previously linked to motor, vision, speech, and other language
   functions-correlated with the quality (SNI-1: total number of
   high-contact roles of a respondent) and quantity (SNI-2: total number of
   individuals in a respondent's social network) of social networks: a
   sensorimotor, a visual, a vestibular/insular, and a left frontoparietal
   network. Moreover, SNI-1 was associated with greater functional
   connectivity in the lateral prefrontal regions of the left
   frontoparietal network, while SNI-2 was associated with greater
   functional connectivity in the medial prefrontal regions of this

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{268-279}},
Abstract = {{We hypothesize that framing effects (risk-averse in the positive frame
   and risk-seeking in the negative frame) are likely to occur when
   ambiguous social contexts result in ambiguous or ambivalent risk
   preferences, leading the decision-maker to search for more subtle cues,
   such as verbal framing. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study, we examined framing effects in both unambiguous
   homogeneous group and more ambiguous heterogeneous group contexts. We
   began by conducting a meta-analysis and identified three regions of
   interest: the right inferior frontal gyrus, the left anterior cingulate
   (ACC)/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and the left amygdala. Our
   own fMRI data were collected while the participants made choices between
   a sure option and a gamble framed in terms of the number of lives to
   either save or die. The framing effect was evident in a heterogeneous
   context with a mixture of kin and strangers, but disappeared in a
   homogeneous group of either all kin-members or all strangers. The fMRI
   results revealed a greater activation in the right middle/inferior
   frontal gyrus under the negative than the positive framing, and less
   ACC/vmPFC deactivation under positive framing in the
   heterogamous/ambiguous context. The activation of the amygdala was
   correlated with greater risk-seeking preference in homogeneous kinship
   contexts.}},

Title = {{Preventing PTSD with oxytocin: effects of oxytocin administration on
   fear neurocircuitry and PTSD symptom development in recently
   trauma-exposed individuals}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating
   psychiatric disorder which develops in approximately 10\% of
   trauma-exposed individuals. Currently, there are few early preventive
   interventions available for PTSD. Intranasal oxytocin administration
   early post-trauma may prevent PTSD symptom development, as oxytocin
   administration was previously found to beneficially impact
   neurobiological (e.g. amygdala reactivity) and socio-emotional PTSD
   vulnerability factors.
   Objective: The overall aim of this dissertation was to investigate the
   potential of intranasal oxytocin administration as early preventive
   intervention for PTSD.
   Methods: We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study to assess the acute effects of a single administration of oxytocin
   on the functional fear neurocircuitry consisting of the amygdala and
   (pre)frontal brain regions - in recently trauma-exposed emergency
   department patients (range n = 37-41). In addition, we performed a
   multicentre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial
   (RCT) to assess the efficacy of repeated intranasal oxytocin
   administration early after trauma for preventing PTSD symptom
   development up to six months posttrauma (n = 107).
   Results: In our fMRI experiments we observed acutely increased amygdala
   reactivity to fearful faces and attenuated amygdala-ventromedial and
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex functional connectivity after a single
   oxytocin administration in recently trauma-exposed individuals. However,
   in our RCT we found that repeated intranasal oxytocin administration
   early posttrauma reduced subsequent PTSD symptom development in recently
   trauma-exposed emergency department patients with high acute PTSD
   symptoms.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that repeated intranasal oxytocin
   is a promising early preventive intervention for PTSD for individuals at
   increased risk for PTSD due to high acute symptom severity.
   Administration frequency dependent effects of oxytocin or the effects of
   oxytocin administration on salience processing may serve as explanatory
   frameworks for the contrasting oxytocin effects on anxiety-related
   measures in our clinical and neuroimaging studies.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Post-stroke motor dysfunction (PSMD) affects the daily
   activities and social life of patients with PSMD. Acupuncture may be
   beneficial for patients with PSMD, but no randomized controlled trial
   has confirmed its effectiveness. We aim to provide study protocol of a
   randomized controlled trial for assessing the effectiveness of
   acupuncture in patients with PSMD and the comparative effectiveness of
   optimal acupuncture versus conventional acupuncture. Methods/design:
   This is a randomized, open label, parallel-controlled trial. A total of
   264 participants with PSMD will be randomly assigned to 3 groups
   (optimal acupuncture group, conventional acupuncture group, waiting-list
   group). Participants in the optimal acupuncture group (the acupuncture
   points will be selected according to a Delphi method) or the
   conventional acupuncture group (the acupuncture points will be selected
   according to textbooks) will receive 4-week acupuncture treatment in
   addition to background treatment. Participants in the waiting-list group
   receive only the background treatment. The primary outcomes include the
   Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and the Berg
   balance scale (BBS). The secondary outcomes include the Modified Barthel
   Index (MBI), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIH-SS), and
   indicators of the blood oxygen level dependent-functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI). Discussion: The study protocol is
   approved by the ethics committee in Traditional Chinese Medicine of
   Fujian University. The result of this study will be published in a
   peer-reviewed journal. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial

Title = {{Restructuring Reward Mechanisms in Nicotine Addiction: A Pilot fMRI
   Study of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement for Cigarette Smokers}},
Journal = {{EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{The primary goal of this pilot feasibility study was to examine the
   effects of Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a
   behavioral treatment grounded in dual-process models derived from
   cognitive science, on frontostriatal reward processes among cigarette
   smokers. Healthy adult (N = 13; mean (SD) age 49 +/- 12.2) smokers
   provided informed consent to participate in a 10-week study testing MORE
   versus a comparison group (CG). All participants underwent two fMRI
   scans: pre-tx and after 8-weeks of MORE. Emotion regulation (ER),
   smoking cue reactivity (CR), and resting-state functional connectivity
   (rsFC) were assessed at each fMRI visit; smoking and mood were assessed
   throughout. As compared to the CG, MORE significantly reduced smoking (d
   = 2.06) and increased positive affect (d = 2.02). MORE participants
   evidenced decreased CR-BOLD response in ventral striatum (VS; d = 1.57)
   and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC; d = 1.7) and increased positive
   ER-BOLD in VS (d(VS) = 2.13) and vPFC (d(vmPFC) = 2.66). Importantly, ER
   was correlated with smoking reduction (r's = .68 to .91) and increased
   positive affect (r's = .52 to .61). These findings provide preliminary
   evidence that MORE may facilitate the restructuring of reward processes
   and play a role in treating the pathophysiology of nicotine addiction.}},

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide S (NPS) system contributes to the pathogenesis of
   anxiety. The more active T allele of the functional rs324981 variant in
   the neuropeptide S receptor gene (NPSR1) is associated with panic
   disorder (PD) and distorted cortico-limbic activity during emotion
   processing in healthy adults and PD patients. This study investigated
   the influence of NPSR1 genotype on fronto-limbic effective connectivity
   within the developing brain. Sixty healthy subjects (8-21 years) were
   examined using an emotional go-nogo task and fMRI. Fronto-limbic
   connectivity was determined using Dynamic Causal Modeling. In A allele
   carriers, connectivity between the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and
   the right amygdalawas higher in older (>= 14 years) than that in younger
   (<14 years) probands, whereas TT homozygotes >= 14 years showed a
   reduction of fronto-limbic connectivity between the MFG and both the
   amygdala and the insula. Fronto-limbic connectivity varied between NPSR1
   genotypes in the developing brain suggesting a risk-increasing effect of
   the NPSR1T allele for anxiety-related traits via impaired
   top-down-control of limbic structures emerging during adolescence.
   Provided robust replication in longitudinal studies, these findings may
   constitute valuable biomarkers for early targeted prevention of anxiety
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal pole (TP) has been associated with diverse functions of
   social cognition and emotion processing. Although the underlying
   mechanism remains elusive, one possibility is that TP acts as
   domain-general hub integrating socioemotional information. To test this,
   26 participants were presented with 60 empathy-evoking film clips during
   fMRI scanning. The film clips were preceded by a linguistic sad or
   neutral context and half of the clips were accompanied by sad music. In
   line with its hypothesized role, TP was involved in the processing of
   sad context and furthermore tracked participants' empathic concern. To
   examine the neuromodulatory impact of TP, we applied nonlinear dynamic
   causal modeling to a multisensory integration network from previous work
   consisting of superior temporal gyrus (STG), fusiform gyrus (FG), and
   amygdala, which was extended by an additional node in the TP. Bayesian
   model comparison revealed a gating of STG and TP on fusiform-amygdalar
   coupling and an increase of TP to FG connectivity during the integration
   of contextual information. Moreover, these backward projections were
   strengthened by emotional music. The findings indicate that during
   social cognition, TP integrates information from different modalities
   and top-down modulates lower-level perceptual areas in the ventral
   visual stream as a function of integration demands.}},

Title = {{The neural correlates of childhood maltreatment and the ability to
   understand mental states of others}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOTRAUMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Emotional abuse and emotional neglect are related to
   impaired interpersonal functioning. One underlying mechanism could be a
   developmental delay in mentalizing, the ability to understand other
   people's thoughts and emotions.
   Objective: This study investigates the neural correlates of mentalizing
   and the specific relationship with emotional abuse and neglect whilst
   taking into account the level of sexual abuse, physical abuse and
   physical neglect.
   Method: The RMET was performed in an fMRI scanner by 46 adolescents
   (Age: M = 18.70, SD = 1.46) who reported a large range of emotional
   abuse and/or emotional neglect. CM was measured using a self-report
   questionnaire (CTQ).
   Results: Neither severity of emotional abuse nor neglect related to RMET
   accuracy or reaction time. The severity of sexual abuse was related to
   an increased activation of the left IFG during mentalization even when
   controlled for psychopathology and other important covariates. This
   increased activation was only found in a group reporting both sexual
   abuse and emotional maltreatment and not when reporting isolated
   emotional abuse or neglect or no maltreatment. Functional connectivity
   analysis showed that activation in the left IFG was associated with
   increased activation in the right insula and right STG, indicating that
   the IFG activation occurs in a network relevant for mentalizing.
   Conclusions: Being sexually abused in the context of emotional abuse and
   neglect is related to an increase in activation of the left IFG, which
   may indicate a delayed development of mirroring other people's thoughts
   and emotions. Even though thoughts and emotions were correctly decoded
   from faces, the heightened activity of the left IFG could be an
   underlying mechanism for impaired interpersonal functioning when social
   situations are more complex or more related to maltreatment experiences.}},

Title = {{Cortical thickness of neural substrates supporting cognitive empathy in
   individuals with schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{179}},
Pages = {{119-124}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cognitive empathy is supported by the medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior mid-cingulate
   cortex (aMCC), insula (INS), supplementary motor area (SMA), right
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and precuneus (PREC). In healthy
   controls, cortical thickness in these regions has been linked to
   cognitive empathy. As cognitive empathy is impaired in schizophrenia, we
   examined whether reduced cortical thickness in these regions was
   associated with poorer cognitive empathy in this population.
   Methods: 41 clinically-stable community-dwelling individuals with
   schizophrenia and 46 healthy controls group-matched on demographic
   variables completed self-report empathy questionnaires, a cognitive
   empathy task, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. We examined
   between-group differences in study variables using t-tests and analyses
   of variance. Next, we used Pearson correlations to evaluate the
   relationship between cognitive empathy and cortical thickness in the
   mPFC, IFG, aMCC, INS, SMA, TPJ, and PREC in both groups.
   Results: Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrated cortical thinning
   in the IFG, INS, SMA, TPJ, and PREC (all p < 0.05) and impaired
   cognitive empathy across all measures (all p < 0.01) relative to
   controls. While cortical thickness in the mPFC, IFC, aMCC, and INS (all
   p < 0.05) was related to cognitive empathy in controls, we did not
   observe these relationships in individuals with schizophrenia (all p >
   0.10).
   Conclusions: Individuals with schizophrenia have reduced cortical
   thickness in empathy-related neural regions and significant impairments
   in cognitive empathy. Interestingly, cortical thickness was related to
   cognitive empathy in controls but not in the schizophrenia group. We
   discuss other mechanisms that may account for cognitive empathy
   impairment in schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD) involves abnormalities in social
   motivation, which may be independent of well-documented differences in
   fear and arousal systems. Yet, the neurobiology underlying motivational
   difficulties in SAD is not well understood. The aim of the current study
   was to spatiotemporally dissociate reward circuitry dysfunction from
   alterations in fear and arousal-related neural activity during
   anticipation and notification of social and non-social reward and
   punishment. During fMRI acquisition, non-depressed adults with social
   anxiety disorder (SAD; N = 21) and age-, sex-and IQ-matched control
   subjects (N = 22) completed eight runs of an incentive delay task,
   alternating between social and monetary outcomes and interleaved in
   alternating order between gain and loss outcomes. Adults with SAD
   demonstrated significantly reduced neural activity in ventral striatum
   during the anticipation of positive but not negative social outcomes. No
   differences between the SAD and control groups were observed during
   anticipation of monetary gain or loss outcomes or during anticipation of
   negative social images. However, consistent with previous work, the SAD
   group demonstrated amygdala hyper-activity upon notification of negative
   social outcomes. Degraded anticipatory processing in bilateral ventral
   striatum in SAD was constrained exclusively to anticipation of positive
   social information and dissociable from the effects of negative social
   outcomes previously observed in the amygdala. Alterations in
   anticipation-related neural signals may represent a promising target for
   treatment that is not addressed by available evidence-based
   interventions, which focus primarily on fear extinction and habituation
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Humans cannot help but attribute human emotions to non-human animals.
   Although such attributions are often regarded as gratuitous
   anthropomorphisms and held apart from the attributions humans make about
   each other's internal states, they may be the product of a general
   mechanism for flexibly interpreting adaptive behavior. To examine this,
   we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to
   compare the neural mechanisms associated with attributing emotions to
   humans and non-human animal behavior. Although undergoing fMRI,
   participants first passively observed the facial displays of human,
   non-human primate and domestic dogs, and subsequently judged the
   acceptability of emotional (e.g. `annoyed') and facial descriptions
   (e.g. `baring teeth') for the same images. For all targets, emotion
   attributions selectively activated regions in prefrontal and anterior
   temporal cortices associated with causal explanation in prior studies.
   These regions were similarly activated by both human and non-human
   targets even during the passive observation task; moreover, the degree
   of neural similarity was dependent on participants' self-reported
   beliefs in the mental capacities of non-human animals. These results
   encourage a non-anthropocentric view of emotion understanding, one that
   treats the idea that animals have emotions as no more gratuitous than
   the idea that humans other than ourselves do.}},

Abstract = {{Appetitive extinction receives attention as an important model for the
   treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, in humans, its underlying
   neural correlates remain unknown. To close this gap, we investigated
   appetitive acquisition and extinction with fMRI in a 2-day monetary
   incentive delay paradigm. During appetitive conditioning, one stimulus
   (CS+) was paired with monetary reward, while another stimulus (CS-) was
   never rewarded. Twenty-four hours later, subjects underwent extinction,
   in which neither CS was reinforced. Appetitive conditioning elicited
   stronger skin conductance responses to the CS+ as compared with the CS-.
   Regarding subjective ratings, the CS+ was rated more pleasant and
   arousing than the CS- after conditioning. Furthermore, fMRI-results (CS+
   - CS-) showed activation of the reward circuitry including amygdala,
   midbrain and striatal areas. During extinction, conditioned responses
   were successfully extinguished. In the early phase of extinction, we
   found a significant activation of the caudate, the hippocampus, the
   dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (dACC and vACC). In the
   late phase, we found significant activation of the nucleus accumbens
   (NAcc) and the amygdala. Correlational analyses with subjective ratings
   linked extinction success to the vACC and the NAcc, while associating
   the dACC with reduced extinction. The results reveal neural correlates
   of appetitive extinction in humans and extend assumptions from models
   for human extinction learning.}},

Abstract = {{Although a growing body of literature suggests that cognitive control
   processes are involved in deception, much about the neural correlates of
   lying remains unknown. In this study, we tested whether brain activation
   associated with deception, as measured by functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), can be detected either in preparation for or during the
   execution of a lie, and whether they depend on the content of the lie.
   We scanned participants while they lied or told the truth about either
   their personal experiences (episodic memories) or personal beliefs.
   Regions in the frontal and parietal cortex showed higher activation when
   participants lied compared with when they were telling the truth,
   regardless of whether they were asked about their past experiences or
   opinions. In contrast, lie-related activation in the right temporal
   pole, precuneus and the right amygdala differed by the content of the
   lie. Preparing to lie activated parietal and frontal brain regions that
   were distinct from those activated while participants executed lies. Our
   findings concur with previous reports on the involvement of frontal and
   parietal regions in deception, but specify brain regions involved in the
   preparation vs execution of deception, and those involved in deceiving
   about experiences vs opinions.}},

Abstract = {{Third-party punishment (TPP) for norm violations is an essential
   deterrent in large-scale human societies, and builds on two essential
   cognitive functions: evaluating legal responsibility and determining
   appropriate punishment. Despite converging evidence that TPP is mediated
   by a specific set of brain regions, little is known about their
   effective connectivity (direction and strength of connections). Applying
   parametric event-related functional MRI in conjunction with multivariate
   Granger causality analysis, we asked healthy participants to estimate
   how much punishment a hypothetical perpetrator deserves for
   intentionally committing criminal offenses varying in levels of harm.
   Our results confirmed that TPP legal decisions are based on two
   domain-general networks: the mentalizing network for evaluating legal
   responsibility and the central-executive network for determining
   appropriate punishment. Further, temporal pole (TP) and dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) emerged as hubs of the mentalizing network,
   uniquely generating converging output connections to ventromedial PFC,
   temporo-parietal junction, and posterior cingulate. In particular,
   dorsomedial PFC received inputs only from TP and both its activation and
   its connectivity to dorsolateral PFC correlated with degree of
   punishment. This supports the hypothesis that dorsomedial PFC acts as
   the driver of the TPP activation pattern, leading to the decision on the
   appropriate punishment. In conclusion, these results advance our
   understanding of the organizational elements of the TPP brain networks
   and provide better insights into the mental states of judges and jurors
   tasked with blaming and punishing legal wrongs.}},

Title = {{Aberrant neural networks for the recognition memory of socially relevant
   information in patients with schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionPatients with schizophrenia exhibit several cognitive
   deficits, including memory impairment. Problems with recognition memory
   can hinder socially adaptive behavior. Previous investigations have
   suggested that altered activation of the frontotemporal area plays an
   important role in recognition memory impairment. However, the cerebral
   networks related to these deficits are not known. The aim of this study
   was to elucidate the brain networks required for recognizing socially
   relevant information in patients with schizophrenia performing an
   old-new recognition task.
   MethodsSixteen patients with schizophrenia and 16 controls participated
   in this study. First, the subjects performed the theme-identification
   task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. In this task,
   pictures depicting social situations were presented with three words,
   and the subjects were asked to select the best theme word for each
   picture. The subjects then performed an old-new recognition task in
   which they were asked to discriminate whether the presented words were
   old or new. Task performance and neural responses in the old-new
   recognition task were compared between the subject groups. An
   independent component analysis of the functional connectivity was
   performed.
   ResultsThe patients with schizophrenia exhibited decreased
   discriminability and increased activation of the right superior temporal
   gyrus compared with the controls during correct responses. Furthermore,
   aberrant network activities were found in the frontopolar and language
   comprehension networks in the patients.
   ConclusionsThe functional connectivity analysis showed aberrant
   connectivity in the frontopolar and language comprehension networks in
   the patients with schizophrenia, and these aberrations possibly
   contribute to their low recognition performance and social dysfunction.
   These results suggest that the frontopolar and language comprehension
   networks are potential therapeutic targets in patients with
   schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Alexithymia is characterized by deficits in the ability to identify,
   differentiate, and describe emotionsabilities that are of importance for
   social interactions, well-being, and, consequently, also for health. The
   aim of this study was to investigate whether achievements in cultural
   activities are associated with alexithymia. Participants from the
   Swedish Twin Registry were 2,279 men and 3,152 women in the ages 27 to
   54. Cultural achievement was measured with the Creative Achievement
   Questionnaire (CAQ) in which participants estimate their achievement in
   the domains writing, music, visual arts, theater, and dance on a 7-point
   scale. Alexithymia was measured with the Toronto Alexithymia Score (TAS
   20). In sex separated, age, and education-adjusted multivariate
   analyses, nonpractitioners, amateurs, and professionals in the 5
   different CAQ domains were compared with regard to alexithymia scores.
   For both men and women, achievement in writing and music contributed
   statistically and independently of one another to a low alexithymia
   score. In addition, achievement in visual arts contributed independently
   to low alexithymia score in men and achievement in theatre to low
   alexithymia score in women. Total creative achievement was calculated as
   a sum score across domains, and the distribution divided into tertile
   groups. These groups were compared with regard to alexithymia scores.
   Large tertile differences were found in both sexes. The results show
   differences between modalities and cumulative effects of multiple
   creative achievements.}},

Abstract = {{Creative objects differ from ordinary objects in that they are created
   by human beings to contain novel, creative information. Previous
   research has demonstrated that ordinary object processing involves both
   a perceptual process for analyzing different features of the visual
   input and a higher-order process for evaluating the relevance of this
   visual information. However, it is unclear how and when these processes
   are influenced by the creative information of the object. This study
   utilized event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the time course
   of creative object processing. Behavioral results revealed that
   participants spent more time processing creative objects than they did
   ordinary objects. Analysis of scalp ERPs further revealed that creative
   objects elicited a more negative ERP deflection between 190 and 340ms
   (N190-340) with an anterior scalp distribution. Additionally, creative
   objects elicited more positive ERP deflection than did ordinary objects
   between 400 and 700ms (P400-700) with a right centro-parietal scalp
   distribution and between 700 and 1000ms (late positive component) with a
   right anterior-central scalp distribution. Such results suggest that the
   processing of creative objects is composed of two distinct stages. The
   early perceptual stage involves the detection of visual differences
   exhibited by the creative objects, while the late stage involves the
   right-lateralized processes of understanding and encoding the creative
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) measures concentration changes in both
   oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin providing three-dimensional images of local
   brain activations. A pilot study, which compares both DOT and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) volumes through t-maps given by
   canonical statistical parametric mapping (SPM) processing for both data
   modalities, is presented. The DOT series were processed using a method
   that is based on a Bayesian filter application on raw DOT data to remove
   physiological changes and minimum description length application index
   to select a number of singular values, which reduce the data
   dimensionality during image reconstruction and adaptation of DOT volume
   series to normalized standard space. Therefore, statistical analysis is
   performed with canonical SPM software in the same way as fMRI analysis
   is done, accepting DOT volumes as if they were fMRI volumes. The results
   show the reproducibility and ruggedness of the method to process DOT
   series on group analysis using cognitive paradigms on the prefrontal
   cortex. Difficulties such as the fact that scalp-brain distances vary
   between subjects or cerebral activations are difficult to reproduce due
   to strategies used by the subjects to solve arithmetic problems are
   considered. T-images given by fMRI and DOT volume series analyzed in SPM
   show that at the functional level, both DOT and fMRI measures detect the
   same areas, although DOT provides complementary information to fMRI
   signals about cerebral activity. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE

Abstract = {{Impaired facial processing may contribute to social dysfunction in
   certain individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Prior studies
   show that electroencephalogram-based and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging-based neurofeedback might help some individuals with ASD learn
   to modulate regional brain activity and thus reduce symptoms. Here, we
   report for the first time the feasibility of employing functional
   near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based neurofeedback training in
   children with ASD. We developed a method to study physiological
   self-regulation of oxy-hemoglobin using real-time feedback. The paradigm
   is illustrated with initial data from four subjects who engaged in a
   facial-identity recognition training program during which an implicit
   reinforcement was given based on the participant's brain activity and
   behavioral performance. Two participants had a confirmed diagnosis of
   ASD, and the other two were typically developing (TD). One participant
   with ASD and one TD participant received real-feedback (real-FB) during
   the training, whereas the other two received sham-feedback (sham-FB).
   After five training sessions, the subjects who received real-FB showed
   more improvement in facial recognition performance compared with those
   receiving sham-FB, particularly in the participant with ASD. These
   results suggest fNIRS-based neurofeedback could enhance therapeutic
   intervention in children with ASD. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DRUG AND ALCOHOL ABUSE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{Background: Many individuals with alcohol-use disorders who had
   experienced alcohol craving before joining Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
   report little or no craving after becoming long-term members. Their use
   of AA prayers may contribute to this. Neural mechanisms underlying this
   process have not been delineated. Objective: To define experiential and
   neural correlates of diminished alcohol craving following AA prayers
   among members with long-term abstinence. Methods: Twenty AA members with
   long-term abstinence participated. Self-report measures and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging of differential neural response to
   alcohol-craving-inducing images were obtained in three conditions: after
   reading of AA prayers, after reading irrelevant news, and with passive
   viewing. Random-effects robust regressions were computed for the main
   effect (prayer > passive + news) and for estimating the correlations
   between the main effect and the self-report measures. Results: Compared
   to the other two conditions, the prayer condition was characterized by:
   less self-reported craving; increased activation in left-anterior middle
   frontal gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, bilateral precuneus, and
   bilateral posterior middle temporal gyrus. Craving following prayer was
   inversely correlated with activation in brain areas associated with
   self-referential processing and the default mode network, and with
   characteristics reflecting AA program involvement. Conclusion: AA
   members prayer was associated with a relative reduction in self-reported
   craving and with concomitant engagement of neural mechanisms that
   reflect control of attention and emotion. These findings suggest neural
   processes underlying the apparent effectiveness of AA prayer.}},

Journal = {{EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{We attempted to investigate whether acupuncture stimulation at HT7 can
   have an effect on brain activation patterns and alcohol abstinence
   self-efficacy. Thirty-four right-handed healthy subjects were recruited
   for this study. They were randomly assigned into two groups: the HT7
   (Shenmen) group and the LI5 (Yangxi) group. Acupuncture stimulation was
   performed using a block paradigm during fMRI scanning. Additionally, the
   Korean version of Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale (AASES) was
   used to determine the effect of acupuncture stimulation on self-efficacy
   to abstain from alcohol use. According to the result of fMRI group
   analysis, the activation induced by HT7 stimulation was found on the
   bilateral postcentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, inferior frontal
   gyrus, claustrum, insula, and anterior lobe of the cerebellum, as well
   as on the left posterior lobe of the cerebellum (p < 0.001,
   uncorrected). According to the AASES analysis, the interaction effect
   for gender and treatment was marginally significant (F (1, 30) = 4.152,
   p = 0.050). For female group, the simple main effect of treatment was
   significant (F(1, 11) = 8.040, p = 0.016), indicating that the mean
   change score was higher in the HT7 stimulation than in the LI5
   stimulation. Therefore, our study has provided evidence to support that
   HT7 stimulation has a positive therapeutic effect on the alcohol-related
   diseases.}},

   stimuli without social significance using a modified Dot-Probe task
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging in high-functioning
   preadolescent children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and age- and
   IQ-matched control children. While the magnitude of attentional bias
   (faster response to probes in the location of solid color patch) to
   visually salient stimuli was similar in the groups, activation
   differences in frontal and temporoparietal regions suggested
   hyper-sensitivity to visual salience or to sameness in ASD children.
   Further, activation in a subset of those regions was associated with
   symptoms of restricted and repetitive behavior. Thus, atypicalities in
   response to visual properties of stimuli may drive attentional orienting
   problems associated with ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Eye-gaze direction plays a fundamental role in the perception of facial
   features and particularly the processing of emotional facial
   expressions. Yet, the neural underpinnings of the integration of eye
   gaze and emotional facial cues are not well understood. The primary aim
   of this study was to delineate the functional networks that subserve the
   recognition of emotional expressions as a function of eye gaze.
   Participants were asked to identify happy, angry, or neutral faces,
   displayed with direct or averted gaze, while their neural responses were
   measured with fMRI. The results showed that recognition of happy
   expressions, irrespective of eye-gaze direction, engaged the critical
   nodes of the default mode network. Recognition of angry faces, on the
   other hand, was gaze-dependent, engaging the critical nodes of the
   salience network when presented with direct gaze, but fronto-parietal
   areas when presented with averted gaze. Functional connectivity analysis
   further showed gaze-dependent engagement of a large-scale network
   connected to bilateral amygdala during the recognition of angry
   expressions. This study provides important insights into the functional
   connectivity between the amygdala and other critical social-cognitive
   brain nodes, which are essential in processing of ambiguous, potentially
   threatening social signals. These findings have implications for
   psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, which are
   characterized by aberrant limbic connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Children with behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperament characterized by
   biologically-based hyper vigilance to novelty, display threat-related
   attention biases (AB) that shape developmental trajectories of risk for
   anxiety. Here we explore the relations between BI, neural function, and
   anxiety. Fifty-six 9-12 year-olds (23 behaviorally inhibited) performed
   the dot-probe task while undergoing fMRI. AB scores were not associated
   with BI group or parent-rated anxiety symptoms. Trials requiting
   attention orienting away from threat engaged an executive and
   threat-attention network (dIPFC, vIPFC, mPFC, and amygdala). Within that
   network, behaviorally inhibited children showed greater activation in
   the right dIPFC. Heightened dIPFC activation related to increased
   anxiety, and BI levels ``accounted for the direct relation between dIPFC
   activation and anxiety. Behaviorally inhibited children may engage the
   executive attention system during threat-related processing as a
   compensatory mechanism. We provide preliminary evidence that the link
   between PFC functioning and anxiety might be attributed to
   early-emerging temperamental vulnerabilities present before the
   emergence of clinical anxiety. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Many previous studies have suggested that various comparisons rely on
   the same cognitive and neural mechanisms. However, little attention has
   been paid to exploring the commonalities and differences between the
   internal comparison based on concepts or rules and the external
   comparison based on perception. In the present experiment, moral beauty
   comparison and facial beauty comparison were selected as the
   representatives of internal comparison and external comparison,
   respectively. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to
   record brain activity while participants compared the level of moral
   beauty of two scene drawings containing moral acts or the level of
   facial beauty of two face photos. In addition, a physical size
   comparison task with the same stimuli as the beauty comparison was
   included. We observed that both the internal moral beauty comparison and
   external facial beauty comparison obeyed a typical distance effect and
   this behavioral effect recruited a common frontoparietal network
   involved in comparisons of simple physical magnitudes such as size. In
   addition, compared to external facial beauty comparison, internal moral
   beauty comparison induced greater activity in more advanced and complex
   cortical regions, such as the bilateral middle temporal gyrus and middle
   occipital gyrus, but weaker activity in the putamen, a subcortical
   region. Our results provide novel neural evidence for the comparative
   process and suggest that different comparisons may rely on both common
   cognitive processes as well as distinct and specific cognitive
   components.}},

Abstract = {{A central aspect of many psychiatric disorders is the disturbance of
   decision-making in social interactions. This disturbance importantly
   contributes to the severe social consequences of these conditions. The
   combination of economic game theory and neuroscience opens up the
   potential to examine dysfunctional social behavior at the computational
   level, including psychological, social and biological information in the
   same model. In current studies, we examine social decision-making in
   patients with depression, bipolar disorder, borderline personality
   disorder and autism spectrum disorder using simple social experiments.
   We found that social decision-making is less consistent in patients with
   borderline personality disorder than in depressed individuals, patients
   with autism and controls. Adult patients with autism spectrum disorders
   showed reduced unconditional altruism in our experiments. Patients with
   major depressive disorder specifically exhibited competition avoidance.
   We currently examine the neural substrate of abnormal social
   decision-making using fMRI.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Bipolar disorder (BD) is highly heritable. Neuroimaging
   studies comparing unaffected youth at high familial risk for BD (i.e.,
   those with a first-degree relative with the disorder; termed
   ``high-risk{''} {[}HR]) to ``low-risk{''} (LR) youth (i.e., those
   without a first-degree relative with BD) and to patients with BD may
   help identify potential brain-based markers associated with risk (i.e.,
   regions where BR+BD not equal LR), resilience (HR not equal BD+LR), or
   illness (BD not equal HR+LR).
   Method: During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 99 youths
   (i.e., adolescents and young adults) aged 9.8 to 24.8 years (36 BD, 22
   HR, 41 LR) performed a task probing face emotion labeling, previously
   shown to be impaired behaviorally in youth with BD and HR youth.
   Results: We found three patterns of results. Candidate risk
   endophenotypes (i.e., where BD and HR shared deficits) included
   dysfunction in higher-order face processing regions (e.g., middle
   temporal gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Candidate resilience
   markers and disorder sequelae (where HR and BD, respectively, show
   unique alterations relative to the other two groups) included different
   patterns of neural responses across other regions mediating face
   processing (e.g., fusiform), executive function (e.g., inferior frontal
   gyrus), and social cognition (e.g., default network, superior temporal
   sulcus, temporoparietal junction).
   Conclusion: If replicated in longitudinal studies and with additional
   populations, neural patterns suggesting risk endophenotypes could be
   used to identify individuals at risk for BD who may benefit from
   prevention measures. Moreover, information about risk and resilience
   markers could be used to develop novel treatments that recruit neural
   markers of resilience and attenuate neural patterns associated with
   risk.}},

Abstract = {{This multi-study analysis (6 fMRI studies; 142 participants) explores
   the functional activation and connectivity of the cerebellum with the
   cerebrum during repeated behavioral information uptake informing about
   personality traits of different persons. The results suggest that trait
   repetition recruits activity in areas belonging to the mentalizing and
   executive control networks in the cerebrum, and the executive control
   areas in the cerebellum. Cerebral activation was observed in the
   executive control network including the posterior medial frontal cortex
   (pmFC), the bilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and bilateral inferior
   parietal cortex (IPC), in the mentalizing network including the
   bilateral middle temporal cortex (MTC) extending to the right superior
   temporal cortex (STC), as well as in the visual network including the
   left cuneus (Cun) and the left inferior occipital cortex. Moreover,
   cerebellar activation was found bilaterally in lobules VI and VII
   belonging to the executive control network. Importantly, significant
   patterns of functional connectivity were found linking these cerebellar
   executive areas with cerebral executive areas in the medial pmFC, the
   left PFC and the left IPC, and mentalizing areas in the left MTC. In
   addition, connectivity was found between the cerebral areas in the left
   hemisphere involved in the executive and mentalizing networks, as well
   as with their homolog areas in the right hemisphere. The discussion
   centers on the role of these cerebello-cerebral connections in matching
   internal predictions generated by the cerebellum with external
   information from the cerebrum, presumably involving the sequencing of
   behaviors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background The functional neuroanatomy for explicit memory in
   conjunction with the major anxiety symptoms in patients with generalized
   anxiety disorder (GAD) has not yet been clearly identified.
   Purpose To investigate the brain activation patterns on the interaction
   between emotional and cognitive function during the explicit memory
   tasks, as well as its correlation with clinical characteristics in GAD.
   Material and Methods The participants comprised GAD patients and
   age-matched healthy controls. The fMR images were obtained while the
   participants performed an explicit memory task with neutral and
   anxiety-inducing words.
   Results Patients showed significantly decreased functional activities in
   the putamen, head of the caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and middle
   cingulate gyrus during the memory tasks with the neutral and
   anxiety-inducing words, whereas the precentral gyrus and ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex were significantly increased only in the memory tasks
   with the anxiety-inducing words. Also, the blood oxygenation
   level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes in the hippocampus were positively
   correlated with the recognition accuracy for both neutral and
   anxiety-inducing words.
   Conclusion This study identified the brain areas associated with the
   interaction between emotional regulation and cognitive function in the
   explicit memory tasks in patients with GAD. These findings would be
   helpful to understand the neural mechanism on the explicit
   memory-related cognitive deficits and emotional dysfunction with GAD
   symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common disorder with a high
   prevalence and significant social and economic impacts. Nevertheless,
   the treatment of MDD is far from satisfactory. Acupuncture treatment has
   emerged as a promising method for treating MDD. However, the neural
   mechanism by which acupuncture reduces depressive symptoms is not fully
   understood. Studies have shown that the corticostriatal reward circuitry
   is associated with the pathophysiology of MDD; thus, we investigated the
   corticostriatal resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) before and
   after real and sham acupuncture treatments combined with the
   antidepressant fluoxetine. Forty-six female major depressive patients
   were assigned to either verum acupuncture plus fluoxetine (n = 22) or
   sham acupuncture plus fluoxetine (n = 24) treatment for 8 weeks, and
   resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were
   collected before the first and after the last treatment sessions. The
   results showed that compared with sham acupuncture, the verum
   acupuncture group showed: (1) significantly increased rsFC between
   inferior ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex, ventral rostral
   putamen and amygdala/para-hippocampus, as well as dorsal caudate and
   middle temporal gyrus; (2) significantly decreased rsFC between right
   ventral rostra] putamen and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and
   right dorsal caudate and bilateral cerebellar tonsil. The increased rsFC
   between the inferior ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex,
   ventral rostral putamen and amygdala/parahippocampus were significantly
   positively associated with decreased clinical scores (Montgomery-Asberg
   Depression Rating Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale scores) at the
   end of the eight-week treatment. Our findings suggest that acupuncture
   may achieve treatment effects by modulating the corticostriatal
   reward/motivation circuitry in MDD patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Bistable perception is a type of subjective perception that
   spontaneously alternates between two perceptual interpretations of an
   ambiguous sensory input. Past functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) studies have examined the activation patterns underlying bistable
   perception, yet the variability between individuals in the alternations
   is not well understood. Therefore, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was
   introduced in this study to correlate the GM of the sensory cortex with
   the alternations of Rubin face-vase illusion in a large group of young
   adults. We found that the GM volume and density (GMV/GMD) of the left
   fusiform face area (FFA) were significantly positively correlated with
   the alternations. Next, Granger causality analysis (GCA) was introduced
   to investigate the top-down modulation from high-level areas to the
   sensory cortex using resting-state fMRI data. Correlations between the
   perceptual alternations and Granger causalities showed that the top-down
   modulations from high-level brain regions, such as the superior parietal
   lobule (SPL) to the left FFA, were positive. Together, these findings
   indicated that the anatomical structure of the face-selective area may
   determine individual alternations of the Rubin face-vase illusion. This
   process may be controlled by a high-level cortex associated with
   attentional modulation, such as the SPL or Posterior Cingulate Cortex
   (PCC). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain is highly dynamic, supporting a remarkable range of
   cognitive abilities that emerge over the course of development. While
   flexible and dynamic coordination between neural systems is firmly
   established for children, our understanding of brain functional
   organization in early life has been built largely on the implicit
   assumption that functional connectivity (FC) is static. Understanding
   the nature of dynamic neural interactions during development is a
   critical issue for cognitive neuroscience, with implications for
   neurodevelopmental pathologies that involve anomalies in brain
   connectivity. In this work, FC dynamics of neurocognitive networks in a
   sample of 146 youth from varied sociodemographic backgrounds were
   delineated. Independent component analysis, sliding time window
   correlation, and k-means clustering were applied to resting-state fMRI
   data. Results revealed six dynamic FC states that re-occur over time and
   that complement, but significantly extend, measures of static FC.
   Moreover, the occurrence and amount of time spent in specific FC states
   are related to the content of self-generated thought during the scan.
   Additionally, some connections are more variable over time than are
   others, including those between inferior parietal lobe and precuneus.
   These regions contribute to multiple networks and likely play a role in
   adaptive processes in childhood. Age-related increases in temporal
   variability of FC among neurocognitive networks were also found. Taken
   together, these findings lay the groundwork for understanding how
   variation in the developing chronnectome is related to risk for
   neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding how brain systems
   reconfigure with development should provide insight into the ontogeny of
   complex, flexible cognitive processes. Hum Brain Mapp 38:97-108, 2017.

Abstract = {{The amygdala is known as a key brain region involved in the explicit and
   implicit processing of emotional faces, and plays a crucial role in
   salience detection. Not until recently was the mismatch negativity
   (MMN), a component of the event-related potentials to an odd stimulus in
   a sequence of stimuli, utilized as an index of preattentive salience
   detection of emotional voice processing. However, their relationship
   remains to be delineated. This study combined the fMRI scanning and
   event-related potential recording by examining amygdala reactivity in
   response to explicit and implicit (backward masked) perception of
   fearful and angry faces, along with recording MMN in response to the
   fearfully and angrily spoken syllables dada in healthy subjects who
   varied in trait anxiety (STAI-T). Results indicated that the amplitudes
   of fearful MMN were positively correlated with left amygdala reactivity
   to explicit perception of fear, but negatively correlated with right
   amygdala reactivity to implicit perception of fear. The fearful MMN
   predicted STAI-T along with left amygdala reactivity to explicit fear,
   whereas the association between fearful MMN and STAI-T was mediated by
   right amygdala reactivity to implicit fear. These findings suggest that
   amygdala reactivity in response to explicit and implicit threatening
   faces exhibits opposite associations with emotional MMN. In terms of
   emotional processing, MMN not only reflects preattentive saliency
   detection but also stands at the crossroads of explicit and implicit
   perception. Hum Brain Mapp 38:140-150, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The hippocampus is a medial temporal lobe structure involved in memory,
   spatial navigation, and regulation of stress responses, making it a
   structure critical to daily functioning. However, little is known about
   the functional development of the hippocampus during childhood due to
   methodological challenges of acquiring neuroimaging data in young
   participants. This is a critical gap given evidence that
   hippocampally-mediated behaviors (e.g., episodic memory) undergo rapid
   and important changes during childhood. To address this gap, the present
   investigation collected resting-state fMRI scans in 97, 4- to
   10-year-old children. Whole brain seed-based analyses of anterior,
   posterior, and whole hippocampal connectivity were performed to identify
   regions demonstrating stable (i.e., age-controlled) connectivity
   profiles as well as age-related differences in connectivity. Results
   reveal that the hippocampus is a highly connected structure of the brain
   and that most of the major components of the adult network are evident
   during childhood, including both unique and overlapping connectivity
   between anterior and posterior regions. Despite widespread
   age-controlled connectivity, the strength of hippocampal connectivity
   with regions of lateral temporal lobes and the anterior cingulate
   increased throughout the studied age range. These findings have
   implications for future investigations of the development of
   hippocampally-mediated behaviors and methodological applications for the
   appropriateness of whole versus segmented hippocampal seeds in
   connectivity analyses. Hum Brain Mapp 38:182-201, 2017. (c) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{In our fMRI experiment, participants completed a learning task in both a
   noncompetitive and a socially competitive learning environment. Despite
   reporting a preference for completing the task while competing,
   participants remembered significantly more during the task and later
   recalled more from the noncompetitive learning environment. Furthermore,
   during working memory maintenance, there was performance-related
   deactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the
   precuneus/PCC. During feedback presentation, there was greater
   activation in the mPFC and the precuneus/PCC while competing.
   Differential activation in the precuneus/PCC predicted worse later
   recall for information learned competitively. Since previous research
   suggests that the mPFC is involved in social-referencing, while the
   precuneus/PCC is implicated in off-task thoughts, our results suggest
   that receiving feedback regarding competition produces more activation
   in brain regions implicated in social interaction, as well as task
   distraction. While competition may make a task more enjoyable, the goal
   of winning may distract from maximizing performance. Hum Brain Mapp

Pages = {{15-25}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests the putative human pheromone Delta
   4,16-androstadien-3-one (androstadienone), a natural component of human
   sweat, increases attention to emotional information when passively
   inhaled, even in minute amounts. However, the neural mechanisms
   underlying androstadienone's impact on the perception of emotional
   stimuli have not been clarified. To characterize how the compound
   modifies neural circuitry while attending to emotional information, 22
   subjects (11 women) underwent two fMRI scanning sessions, one with an
   androstadienone solution and one with a carrier control solution alone
   on their upper lip. During each session, participants viewed blocks of
   emotionally positive, negative, or neutral images. The BOLD response to
   emotional images (relative to neutral images) was greater during
   exposure to androstadienone in right orbitofrontal and lateral
   prefrontal cortex, particularly during positive image blocks.
   Androstadienone did not impact the response to social images, compared
   to nonsocial images, and results were not related to participant sex or
   olfactory sensitivity. To examine how androstadienone influences
   effective connectivity of this network, a dynamic causal model was
   employed with primary visual cortex (V1), amygdala, prefrontal cortex,
   and orbitofrontal cortex on each side. These models indicated that
   emotional images increased the drive from Vi to the amygdala during the
   control session. With androstadienone present, this drive to amygdala
   was decreased specifically for positive images, which drove downstream
   increases in orbitofrontal and prefrontal activity. This evidence
   suggests that androstadienone may act as a chemical signal to increase
   attention to positively valenced information via modifications to
   amygdala connectivity. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The current research expands upon the sparse existing literature on the
   nature of bias against interracial couples. Study 1 demonstrates that
   bias against interracial romance is correlated with disgust. Study 2
   provides evidence that images of interracial couples evoke a neural
   disgust response among observers - as indicated by increased insula
   activation relative to images of same-race couples. Consistent with
   psychological theory indicating that disgust leads to dehumanization,
   Study 3 demonstrates that manipulating disgust leads to implicit
   dehumanization of interracial couples, Overall, the current findings
   provide evidence that interracial couples elicit disgust and are
   dehumanized relative to same-race couples. These findings are
   particularly concerning, given evidence of antisocial reactions (e.g.,
   aggression, perpetration of violence) to dehumanized targets. Findings
   also highlight the role of meaningful social units (e.g., couples) in

Abstract = {{The number of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) is on the rise
   worldwide along with the fascination that they inspire. Problems occur
   when the use of MMOs becomes excessive at the expense of other life
   domains. Although not yet formally included as disorder in common
   diagnostic systems, internet gaming disorder (IGD) is considered a
   ``condition for further study{''} in section III of the DSM-5. The
   current review aims to provide an overview of cognitive and
   neurobiological data currently available on IGD, with a particular focus
   on impulsivity, compulsivity, and sensitivity to reward and punishment.
   Additionally, we also compare these findings on IGD with data from
   studies on pathological gambling (PG)-so far the only condition
   officially classified as a behavioral addiction in the DSM-5.
   Multiple similarities have been observed in the neurobiology of IGD and
   PG, as measured by alterations in brain function and behavior. Both
   patients with IGD and those with PG exhibited decreased loss
   sensitivity; enhanced reactivity to gaming and gambling cues,
   respectively; enhanced impulsive choice behavior; aberrant reward based
   learning; and no changes in cognitive flexibility.
   In conclusion, the evidence base on the neurobiology of gaming and
   gambling disorders is beginning to illuminate the similarities between
   the two. However, as only a few studies have addressed the
   neurobiological basis of IGD, and some of these studies suffer from
   significant limitations, more research is required before IGD's
   inclusion as a second behavioral addiction in the next versions of the
   ICD and DSM can be justified. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Findings for heat pain have shown consistent pain attenuation through
   concurrent cognitive task completion; but only a minimal amount of
   studies have explored that for cold pain. This study investigated the
   direct impact of two well-established cognitive tasks on cold pain
   tolerance. In a within-subject design, 36 female Hong Kong locals were
   required to complete a baseline pain tolerance measurement, induced by
   the well-established Cold Pressor Test. This was followed by the
   counterbalanced presentation of the Colour Stroop or the Judgment of
   Line Orientation task with and without concurrent pain administration.
   As suggested by the Limited Capacity, Multiple Resource, and
   Cognitive-Affective Models, participants were expected to tolerate pain
   for significantly longer durations when they perform either concurrent
   Colour Stroop or concurrent Judgment of Line Orientation tasks compared
   to baseline measures with no concurrent task. The findings clearly
   indicated increased pain tolerance times during task completion compared
   with baseline measures, providing support for the a-priori hypothesis.
   The results contribute to existing literature by confirming increased
   cold pain tolerance during selective attention to cognitive tasks and
   extending this finding to tasks previously established in heat pain but
   not for cold pain research.}},

Abstract = {{The use of a variety of neuroanatomical techniques has led to a greater
   understanding of the adverse effects of stress on psychiatric health.
   One recent advance that has been particularly valuable is the
   development of resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in clinical
   studies. The current study investigates changes in RSFC in F1 adult
   female rats exposed to the early life chronic social stress (ECSS) of
   the daily introduction of a novel male intruder to the cage of their F0
   mothers while the F1 pups are in the cage. This ECSS for the F1 animals
   consists of depressed maternal care from their F0 mothers and exposure
   to conflict between their F0 mothers and intruder males. Analyses of the
   functional connectivity data in ECSS exposed adult females versus
   control females reveal broad changes in the limbic and reward systems,
   the salience and introspective socioaffective networks, and several
   additional stress and social behavior associated nuclei. Substantial
   changes in connectivity were found in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus
   accumbens, hippocampus, and somatosensory cortex. The current rodent
   RSFC data support the hypothesis that the exposure to early life social
   stress has long term effects on neural connectivity in numerous social
   behavior, stress, and depression relevant brain nuclei. Future conscious
   rodent RSFC studies can build on the wealth of data generated from
   previous neuroanatomical studies of early life stress and enhance
   translational connectivity between animal and human fMRI studies in the
   development of novel preventative measures and treatments. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This study aimed to explore the effects of the long-acting antipsychotic
   drug palmitate paliperidone in resting-state brain activity of
   schizophrenia patients. Seventeen schizophrenia outpatients were
   included and received palmitate paliperidone injection (PAL) treatment
   for 13 weeks. These patients were compared to seventeen matched healthy
   controls. All subjects underwent two scan sessions of resting-state
   magnetic resonance imaging (baseline and the 13th week) and regional
   homogeneity (ReHo) at resting-state where compared. After 13 weeks of
   treatment, PAL increased ReHo of the prefrontal cortex, anterior
   cingulate gyrus and orbital frontal gyrus, while PAL decreased ReHo of
   the thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus.
   Furthermore, improvement of psychiatric symptoms correlated with
   changing amplitude of ReHo: positively correlated with postcentral gyrus
   and negatively correlated with the occipital cortex. Baseline ReHo
   values of the middle occipital gyrus were positively correlated with the
   rate of reduction of psychiatric symptoms and improvement of social
   function. These results suggested that PAL might achieve its clinical
   effect in schizophrenia by influencing the resting-state function of the
   occipital cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe. Baseline
   function of the inferior occipital gyrus might potentially predict the
   short-term effect of PAL in schizophrenia.}},

   Activity and Task-Evoked Hyperactivation in the Blind}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{The brain's functional organization can be altered by visual
   deprivation. This is observed by comparing blind and sighted people's
   activation response to tactile discrimination tasks, like braille
   reading. Where, the blind have higher activation than the sighted upon
   tactile discrimination tasks, especially high activation difference is
   seen in ventral occipitotemporal (vOT) cortex. However, it remains
   unknown, whether this vOT hyperactivation is related to alteration of
   spontaneous activity. To address this question, we examined 16 blind
   subjects, 19 low-vision individuals, and 21 normally sighted controls
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects were
   scanned in resting-state and discrimination tactile task. In spontaneous
   activity, when compared to sighted subjects, we found both blind and low
   vision subjects had increased local signal synchronization and increased
   temporal variability. During tactile tasks, compared to sighted
   subjects, blind and low-vision subject's vOT had stronger tactile
   task-induced activation. Furthermore, through inter-subject partial
   correlation analysis, we found temporal variability is more related to
   tactile-task activation, than local signal synchronization's relation to
   tactile-induced activation. Our results further support that vision
   impairment induces vOT cortical reorganization. The hyperactivation in
   the vOT during tactile stimulus processing in the blind may be related
   to their greater dynamic range of spontaneous activity.}},

Title = {{The Neuronal Correlates of Indeterminate Sentence Comprehension: An fMRI
   Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Sentences such as The author started the book are indeterminate because
   they do not make explicit what the subject (the author) started doing
   with the object (the book). In principle, indeterminate sentences allow
   for an infinite number of interpretations. One theory, however, assumes
   that these sentences are resolved by semantic coercion, a linguistic
   process that forces the noun book to be interpreted as an activity
   (e.g., writing the book) or by a process that interpolates this activity
   information in the resulting enriched semantic composition. An
   alternative theory, pragmatic, assumes classical semantic composition,
   whereby meaning arises from the denotation of words and how they are
   combined syntactically, with enrichment obtained via pragmatic
   inferences beyond linguistic-semantic processes. Cognitive neuroscience
   studies investigating the neuroanatomical and functional correlates of
   indeterminate sentences have shown activations either at the
   ventromedial pre-frontal cortex (vmPFC) or at the left inferior frontal
   gyrus (L-IFG). These studies have supported the semantic coercion theory
   assuming that one of these regions is where enriched semantic
   composition takes place. Employing functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI), we found that indeterminate sentences activate bilaterally the
   superior temporal gyrus (STG), the right inferior frontal gyrus (R-IFG),
   and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), more so than control sentences
   (The author wrote the book). Activation of indeterminate sentences
   exceeded that of anomalous sentences (...drank the book) and engaged
   more left-and right-hemisphere areas than other sentence types. We
   suggest that the widespread activations for indeterminate sentences
   represent the deployment of pragmatic-inferential processes, which seek
   to enrich sentence content without necessarily resorting to semantic
   coercion.}},

Title = {{The neural representation of competence traits: An fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Previous neuroimaging studies have revealed that a trait code is mainly
   represented in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). However,
   those studies only investigated the neural code of warmth traits.
   According to the `Big Two' model of impression formation, competence
   traits are the other major dimension when we judge others. The current
   study explored the neural representation of competence traits by using
   an fMRI repetition suppression paradigm, which is a rapid reduction of
   neuronal responses upon repeated presentation of the same implied trait.
   Participants had to infer an agent's trait from brief behavioral
   descriptions that implied a competence trait. In each trial, the
   critical target sentence was preceded by a prime sentence that implied
   the same or opposite competence-related trait, or no trait. The results
   revealed robust repetition suppression from prime to target in the vmPFC
   and precuneus during trait conditions. Critically, the suppression
   effect was much stronger after being primed with a similar and opposite
   competence trait compared with a trait-irrelevant prime. This
   suppression pattern was found nowhere else in the brain. Consistent with
   previous fMRI studies, we suggest that the neural code of competence
   traits is represented in these two brain areas with different levels of
   abstraction.}},

Abstract = {{The primate brain processes objects in the ventral visual pathway. One
   object category, faces, is processed in a hierarchical network of
   interconnected areas along this pathway. It remains unknown whether such
   an interconnected network is specific for faces or whether there are
   similar networks for other object classes. For example, the primate
   inferotemporal cortex also contains a set of body-selective patches,
   adjacent to the face-selective patches, but it is not known whether
   these body-selective patches form a similar discretely connected network
   or whether cross-talk exists between the face-and body-processing
   systems. To address these questions, we combined fMRI with electrical
   microstimulation to determine the effective connectivity of fMRI-defined
   face and body patches. We found that microstimulation of face patches
   caused increased fMRI activation throughout the face-processing system;
   microstimulation of the body patches gave similar results restricted to
   the body-processing system. Critically, our results revealed largely
   segregated connectivity patterns for the body and face patches. These
   results suggest that face and body patches form two interconnected
   hierarchical networks that are largely separated within the monkey
   inferotemporal cortex. Only a restricted number of voxels were activated
   by stimulation of both the body and face patches. The latter regions may
   be important for the integration of face and body information. Our
   findings are not only essential to advance our understanding of the
   neural circuits that enable social cognition, but they also provide
   further insights into the organizing principles of the inferotemporal
   cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Uric acid is a naturally occurring, endogenous compound that impacts
   mental health. In particular, uric acid levels are associated with
   emotion-related psychopathology (e.g., anxiety and depression).
   Therefore, understanding uric acid's impact on the brain would provide
   valuable new knowledge regarding neural mechanisms that mediate the
   relationship between uric acid and mental health. Brain regions
   including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus underlie
   stress reactivity and emotion regulation. Thus, uric acid may impact
   emotion by modifying the function of these brain regions. The present
   study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a
   psychosocial stress task to investigate the relationship between
   baseline uric acid levels (in saliva) and brain function. Results
   demonstrate that activity within the bilateral hippocampal complex
   varied with uric acid concentrations. Specifically, activity within the
   hippocampus and surrounding cortex increased as a function of uric acid
   level. The current findings suggest that uric acid levels modulate
   stress-related hippocampal activity. Given that the hippocampus has been
   implicated in emotion regulation during psychosocial stress, the present
   findings offer a potential mechanism by which uric acid impacts mental
   health. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Selective perturbation of cognitive conflict in the human brain-A
   combined fMRI and rTMS study}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{We investigated if single and double conflicts are processed separately
   in different brain regions and if they are differentially vulnerable to
   TMS perturbation. Fifteen human volunteers performed a single (Flanker
   or Simon) conflict task or a double (Flanker and Simon) conflict task in
   a combined functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Transcranial
   Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) study. The fMRI approach aimed at localizing
   brain regions involved in interference resolution induced by single
   Flanker (stimulus-stimulus, S-S) and Simon (stimulus-response, S-R)
   conflicts as well as regions involved in the double conflict condition.
   The data revealed a distinct activation in the right intraparietal
   sulcus (IPS) for Flanker interference and in the right middle frontal
   gyrus (MFG) for the double interference condition. The causal functional
   role of these brain regions was then examined in the same volunteers by
   using offline TMS over right IPS and right MFG. TMS perturbation of the
   right IPS increased the Flanker effect, but had no effect in the Simon
   or double conflict condition. In contrast, perturbation of the right MFG
   had no effect on any of the conflict types. These findings suggest a
   causal role of the right IPS in the processing of the single conflict of
   Flanker (stimulus-stimulus) interference.}},

Title = {{Investigating the Group-Level Impact of Advanced Dual-Echo fMRI
   Combinations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Multi echo fMRI data acquisition has been widely investigated and
   suggested to optimize sensitivity for detecting the BOLD signal. Several
   methods have also been proposed for the combination of data with
   different echo times. The aim of the present study was to investigate
   whether these advanced echo combination methods provide advantages over
   the simple averaging of echoes when state-of-the-art group level random
   effect analyses are performed. Both resting-state and task-based
   dual-echo fMRI data were collected from 27 healthy adult individuals (14
   male, mean age = 25.75 years) using standard echo-planar acquisition
   methods at 3T. Both resting-state and task-based data were subjected to
   a standard image pre-processing pipeline. Subsequently the two echoes
   were combined as a weighted average, using four different strategies for
   calculating the weights: (1) simple arithmetic averaging, (2) BOLD
   sensitivity weighting, (3) temporal-signal-to-noise ratio weighting and
   (4) temporal BOLD sensitivity weighting. Our results clearly show that
   the simple averaging of data with the different echoes is sufficient.
   Advanced echo combination methods may provide advantages on a
   single-subject level but when considering random-effects group level
   statistics they provide no benefit regarding sensitivity (i.e.,
   group-level t-values) compared to the simple echo-averaging approach.
   One possible reason for the lack of clear advantages may be that apart
   from increasing the average BOLD sensitivity at the single-subject
   level, the advanced weighted averaging methods also inflate the
   inter-subject variance. As the echo combination methods provide very
   similar results, the recommendation is to choose between them depending
   on the availability of time for collecting additional resting-state data
   or whether subject-level or group-level analyses are planned.}},

Abstract = {{Humans and other primates have evolved the ability to represent their
   status in the group's social hierarchy, which is essential for avoiding
   harmand accessing resources. Yet it remains unclear how the human brain
   learns dominance status and adjusts behavior accordingly during dynamic
   social interactions. Here we address this issue with a combination of
   fMRI and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In a first fMRI
   experiment, participants learned an implicit dominance hierarchy while
   playing a competitive game against three opponents of different skills.
   Neural activity in the rostromedial PFC (rmPFC) dynamically tracked and
   updated the dominance status of the opponents, whereas the ventromedial
   PFC and ventral striatum reacted specifically to competitive victories
   and defeats. In a second experiment, we applied anodal tDCS over the
   rmPFC to enhance neural excitability while subjects performed a similar
   competitive task. The stimulation enhanced the relative weight of
   victories over defeats in learning social dominance relationships and
   exacerbated the influence of one's own dominance over competitive
   strategies. Importantly, these tDCS effects were specific to trials in
   which subjects learned about dominance relationships, as they were not
   present for control choices associated with monetary incentives but no
   competitive feedback. Taken together, our findings elucidate the role of
   rmPFC computations in dominance learning and unravel a fundamental
   mechanism that governs the emergence and maintenance of social dominance
   relationships in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Dogs are hypersocial with humans, and their integration into human
   social ecology makes dogs a unique model for studying cross-species
   social bonding. However, the proximal neural mechanisms driving
   dog-human social interaction are unknown. We used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging in 15 awake dogs to probe the neural basis for their
   preferences for social interaction and food reward. In a first
   experiment, we used the ventral caudate as a measure of intrinsic reward
   value and compared activation to conditioned stimuli that predicted
   food, praise or nothing. Relative to the control stimulus, the caudate
   was significantly more active to the reward-predicting stimuli and
   showed roughly equal or greater activation to praise vs food in 13 of 15
   dogs. To confirm that these differences were driven by the intrinsic
   value of social praise, we performed a second imaging experiment in
   which the praise was withheld on a subset of trials. The difference in
   caudate activation to the receipt of praise, relative to its
   withholding, was strongly correlated with the differential activation to
   the conditioned stimuli in the first experiment. In a third experiment,
   we performed an out-of-scanner choice task in which the dog repeatedly
   selected food or owner in a Y-maze. The relative caudate activation to
   food-and praise-predicting stimuli in Experiment 1 was a strong
   predictor of each dog's sequence of choices in the Y-maze. Analogous to
   similar neuroimaging studies of individual differences in human social
   reward, our findings demonstrate a neural mechanism for preference in
   domestic dogs that is stable within, but variable between, individuals.
   Moreover, the individual differences in the caudate responses indicate
   the potentially higher value of social than food reward for some dogs
   and may help to explain the apparent efficacy of social interaction in
   dog training.}},

Abstract = {{Repeated stimulus presentations are commonly used in social and
   affective neuroimaging tasks, but much remains to be known about how the
   brain processes such repetitions. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we found three groups of brain regions with distinct response
   patterns during repeated presentations of natural scene images. One
   group consisted of several limbic, paralimbic, frontoparietal and medial
   prefrontal areas and showed a habituation-like response across pleasant,
   unpleasant, and neutral image categories. A second group of occipital
   and adjacent posterior cortical regions showed a pattern of diminishing
   responses with repeated presentations of affective images but not for
   neutral images, and also plateaued to activation levels above baseline
   for all image categories. A third group involved bilateral frontopolar
   areas and the precuneus and exhibited a novel, non-monotonic response
   pattern. Activity was low on the first presentation, peaked upon the
   second presentation (first repetition) and subsequently diminished.
   These findings indicate that the transition from novel to increasingly
   familiar, and also arousing to less arousing, involves a broad array of
   neural mechanisms alluding to both passive learning and active inference
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of the mask stimulus is crucial in backward masking
   studies and we recently demonstrated such an effect when masking faces.
   Specifically, we showed that activity of the amygdala is increased to
   fearful facial expressions masked with neutral faces and decreased to
   fearful expressions masked with a pattern mask-but critically both
   masked conditions discriminated fearful expressions from happy
   expressions. Given this finding, we sought to test whether masked
   fearful eye whites would produce a similar profile of amygdala response
   in a face vs non-face context. During functional magnetic resonance
   imaging scanning sessions, 30 participants viewed fearful or happy eye
   whites masked with either neutral faces or pattern images. Results
   indicated amygdala activity was increased to fearful vs happy eye whites
   in the face mask condition, but decreased to fearful vs happy eye whites
   in the pattern mask condition-effectively replicating and expanding our
   previous report. Our data support the idea that the amygdala is
   responsive to fearful eye whites, but that the nature of this activity
   observed in a backward masking design depends on the mask stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{One important aspect of metacognition is the ability to accurately
   evaluate one's performance. People vary widely in their metacognitive
   ability and in general are too confident when evaluating their
   performance. This often leads to poor decision making with potentially
   disastrous consequences. To further our understanding of the neural
   underpinnings of these processes, this fMRI study investigated
   inter-individual differences in metacognitive ability and effects of
   trial-by-trial variation in subjective feelings of confidence when
   making metacognitive assessments. Participants (N = 308) evaluated their
   performance in a high-level social and cognitive reasoning task. The
   results showed that higher metacognitive accuracy was associated with a
   decrease in activation in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, an area
   previously linked to metacognition on perception and memory. Moreover,
   the feeling of confidence about one's choices was associated with an
   increase of activation in reward, memory and motor related areas
   including bilateral striatum and hippocampus, while less confidence was
   associated with activation in areas linked with negative affect and
   uncertainty, including dorsomedial prefrontal and bilateral
   orbitofrontal cortex. This might indicate that positive affect is
   related to higher confidence thereby biasing metacognitive decisions
   towards overconfidence. In support, behavioural analyses revealed that
   increased confidence was associated with lower metacognitive accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine differences in the neural
   processing of social information about kin and friends at different
   levels of closeness and social network level. Twenty-five female
   participants engaged in a cognitive social task involving different
   individuals in their social network while undergoing functional magnetic
   resonance imaging scanning to detect BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent)
   signals changes. Greater levels of activation occurred in several
   regions of the brain previously associated with social cognition when
   thinking about friends than when thinking about kin, including the
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the ventral medial prefrontal
   cortex (vMPFC). Linear parametric analyses across network layers further
   showed that, when it came to thinking about friends, activation
   increased in the vMPFC, lingual gyrus, and sensorimotor cortex as
   individuals thought about friends at closer layers of the network. These
   findings suggest that maintaining friendships may be more cognitively
   exacting than maintaining kin relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Negative life events (NLE) contribute to anxiety and depression
   disorders, but their relationship with brain functioning in adolescence
   has rarely been studied. We hypothesized that neural response to social
   threat would relate to NLE in the frontal-limbic emotional regions.
   Participants (N = 685) were drawn from the Imagen database of
   14-year-old community adolescents recruited in schools. They underwent
   functional MRI while viewing angry and neutral faces, as a probe to
   neural response to social threat. Lifetime NLEs were assessed using the
   `distress', `family' and `accident' subscales from a life event
   dimensional questionnaire. Relationships between NLE subscale scores and
   neural response were investigated. Links of NLE subscales scores with
   anxiety or depression outcomes at the age of 16 years were also
   investigated. Lifetime `distress' positively correlated with
   ventral-lateral orbitofrontal and temporal cortex activations during
   angry face processing. `Distress' scores correlated with the
   probabilities of meeting criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder or
   Major Depressive Disorder at the age of 16 years. Lifetime `family' and
   `accident' scores did not relate with neural response or follow-up
   conditions, however. Thus, different types of NLEs differentially
   predicted neural responses to threat during adolescence, and
   differentially predicted a de novo internalizing condition 2 years
   later. The deleterious effect of self-referential NLEs is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Most of our social interaction is naturally based on emotional
   information derived from the perception of faces of other people.
   Negative facial expressions of a counterpart might trigger negative
   emotions and initiate emotion regulatory efforts to reduce the impact of
   the received emotional message in a perceiver. Despite the high adaptive
   value of emotion regulation in social interaction, the neural
   underpinnings of it are largely unknown. To remedy this, this study
   investigated individual differences in emotion regulation effectiveness
   during the reappraisal of angry faces on the underlying functional
   activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as well as
   the underlying functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI. Greater
   emotion regulation ability was associated with greater functional
   activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, greater
   functional coupling between activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex and the amygdala was associated with emotion regulation success.
   Our findings provide a first link between prefrontal cognitive control
   and subcortical emotion processing systems during successful emotion
   regulation in an explicitly social context.}},

Abstract = {{Whenmaking decisions in everyday life, we often have to choose between
   uncertain outcomes. Economic studies have demonstrated that healthy
   people tend to prefer options with known probabilities (risk) than those
   with unknown probabilities (ambiguity), which is referred to as
   ``ambiguity aversion.{''} However, it remains unclear how patients with
   schizophrenia behave under ambiguity, despite growing evidence of their
   altered decision-making under uncertainty. In this study, combining
   economic tools and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we
   assessed the attitudes toward risk/ambiguity and investigated the neural
   correlates during decision-making under risk/ambiguity in schizophrenia.
   Although no significant difference in attitudes under risk was observed,
   patients with schizophrenia chose ambiguity significantly more often
   than the healthy controls. Attitudes under risk and ambiguity did not
   correlate across patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, unlike in the
   healthy controls, activation of the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex
   was not increased during decision-making under ambiguity compared to
   under risk in schizophrenia. These results suggest that ambiguity
   aversion, a well-established subjective bias, is attenuated in patients
   with schizophrenia, highlighting the need to distinguish between risk
   and ambiguity when assessing decision-making under these situations. Our
   findings, comprising important clinical implications, contribute to
   improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying altered
   decision-making in patients with schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Introduction: Navigation is a fundamental and multidimensional cognitive
   function that individuals rely on to move around the environment. In
   this study, we investigated the neural basis of human spatial navigation
   ability.
   Methods: A large cohort of participants (N > 200) was examined on their
   navigation ability behaviorally and structural and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) were then used to explore the corresponding
   neural basis of spatial navigation.
   Results: The gray matter volume (GMV) of the bilateral parahippocampus
   (PHG), retrosplenial complex (RSC), entorhinal cortex (EC), hippocampus
   (HPC), and thalamus (THAL) was correlated with the participants'
   self-reported navigational ability in general, and their sense of
   direction in particular. Further fMRI studies showed that the PHG, RSC,
   and EC selectively responded to visually presented scenes, whereas the
   HPC and THAL showed no selectivity, suggesting a functional division of
   labor among these regions in spatial navigation. The resting-state
   functional connectivity analysis further revealed a hierarchical neural
   network for navigation constituted by these regions, which can be
   further categorized into three relatively independent components (i.e.,
   scene recognition component, cognitive map component, and the component
   of heading direction for locomotion, respectively).
   Conclusions: Our study combined multi-modality imaging data to
   illustrate that multiple brain regions may work collaboratively to
   extract, integrate, store, and orientate spatial information to guide
   navigation behaviors.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Background: There is accumulating evidence on the negative impacts of
   childhood poverty on physical and mental health. Previous work has
   suggested hyperactive neural response to social fear cues, as well as
   impairment in neural regulatory functions. However, despite differences
   found between males and females in stress-related and anxiety disorders,
   possible sex-specific effects of poverty on emotional processing have
   not been explored. Methods: We analyzed data from three previously
   reported experiments of childhood poverty effects on emotional
   processing and regulation, for sex-specific effects. Participants were
   52 healthy Caucasian males and females, from a longitudinal cohort of
   poverty development study, who were recruited for examining the
   long-term effects of childhood poverty and stress. The three functional
   MRI studies included emotion regulation task, emotional face assessment
   task, and shifted attention emotion appraisal task. Brain activations
   that associated with childhood poverty previously were entered into a
   regression analysis with interaction of gender by childhood
   income-to-need ratio as the independent variable, and age and current
   income-to-need ratio as variables of no interest, separately for males
   and females. Results: Amygdala reactivity to implicitly processed
   fearful faces was positively correlated with childhood income-to-need in
   adult females but not males. On the other hand, activation in
   dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal regions during emotion
   regulation by reappraisal was positively correlated with childhood
   income-to-need in males. Conclusion: Childhood poverty may exert
   sex-specific effects in adulthood as presented by hypersensitive
   emotional reactivity of the amygdala in females, and impaired emotion
   regulatory function of the prefrontal cortex in males. Results suggest
   further focus on sex-specific effects of childhood poverty.}},

Abstract = {{In the clinical practice, particularly during therapy sessions with
   psychiatric patients, heightened aggression constitutes a dangerous and
   detrimental situation for both clinicians and patients according to many
   experts. The primary reason for the lack of efficient treatment options
   for pathological aggression is an insufficient and incomplete
   understanding of the multi-factorial working mechanisms underlying
   aggression. In this context, genetic factors provide an important
   insight. Specifically, the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has been
   repeatedly linked to increased impulsiveness and aggression. In the
   present study, we examined for the first time the influence of different
   variants of the MAOA gene on resting-state networks in healthy
   volunteers. In accordance with our hypothesis, we found a substantial
   genetic influence on resting-state networks: participants with the
   low-activity MAOA genotype, which has been previously associated with
   increased aggression, exhibited decreased activity at rest in brain
   areas that are responsible for controlling negative emotions and
   inhibiting impulsive actions. Finally, we discuss possible
   interpretations of the present findings, as well as implications for
   future scientific investigations and treatment of psychiatric disorders.}},

Title = {{Amygdala and auditory cortex exhibit distinct sensitivity to relevant
   acoustic features of auditory emotions}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{116-125}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Discriminating between auditory signals of different affective value is
   critical to successful social interaction. It is commonly held that
   acoustic decoding of such signals occurs in the auditory system, whereas
   affective decoding occurs in the amygdala. However, given that the
   amygdala receives direct subcortical projections that bypass the
   auditory cortex, it is possible that some acoustic decoding occurs in
   the amygdala as well, when the acoustic features are relevant for
   affective discrimination. We tested this hypothesis by combining
   functional neuroimaging with the neurophysiological phenomena of
   repetition suppression (RS) and repetition enhancement (RE) in human
   listeners. Our results show that both amygdala and auditory cortex
   responded differentially to physical voice features, suggesting that the
   amygdala and auditory cortex decode the affective quality of the voice
   not only by processing the emotional content from previously processed
   acoustic features, but also by processing the acoustic features
   themselves, when these are relevant to the identification of the voice's
   affective value. Specifically, we found that the auditory cortex is
   sensitive to spectral high-frequency voice cues when discriminating
   vocal anger from vocal fear and joy, whereas the amygdala is sensitive
   to vocal pitch when discriminating between negative vocal emotions
   (i.e., anger and fear). Vocal pitch is an instantaneously recognized
   voice feature, which is potentially transferred to the amygdala by
   direct subcortical projections. These results together provide evidence
   that, besides the auditory cortex, the amygdala too processes acoustic
   information, when this is relevant to the discrimination of auditory
   emotions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{What's the gist? The influence of schemas on the neural correlates
   underlying true and false memories}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{61-75}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The current study used a novel scene paradigm to investigate the role of
   encoding schemas on memory. Specifically, the study examined the
   influence of a strong encoding schema on retrieval of both schematic and
   non-schematic information, as well as false memories for information
   associated with the schema. Additionally, the separate roles of
   recollection and familiarity in both veridical and false memory
   retrieval were examined. The study identified several novel results.
   First, while many common neural regions mediated both schematic and
   non-schematic retrieval success, schematic recollection exhibited
   greater activation in visual cortex and hippocampus, regions commonly
   shown to mediate detailed retrieval. More effortful cognitive control
   regions in the prefrontal and parietal cortices, on the other hand,
   supported non-schematic recollection, while lateral temporal cortices
   supported familiarity-based retrieval of non-schematic items. Second,
   both true and false recollection, as well as familiarity, were mediated
   by activity in left middle temporal gyrus, a region associated with
   semantic processing and retrieval of schematic gist. Moreover, activity
   in this region was greater for both false recollection and false
   familiarity, suggesting a greater reliance on lateral temporal cortices
   for retrieval of illusory memories, irrespective of memory strength.
   Consistent with previous false memory studies, visual cortex showed
   increased activity for true compared to false recollection, suggesting
   that visual cortices are critical for distinguishing between previously
   viewed targets and related lures at retrieval. Additionally, the absence
   of common visual activity between true and false retrieval suggests
   that, unlike previous studies utilizing visual stimuli, when false
   memories are predicated on schematic gist and not perceptual overlap,
   there is little reliance on visual processes during false memory

Title = {{Mentalizing in schizophrenia: A multivariate functional MRI study}},

Abstract = {{Schizophrenia is associated with mentalizing deficits that impact on
   social functioning and quality of life. Recently, schizophrenia has been
   conceptualized as a disorder of neural dysconnectivity and network level
   analyses offers a means of understanding the underlying deficits leading
   to mentalizing difficulty. Using an established mentalizing task (The
   Triangles Task), functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) were
   acquired from 19 patients with schizophrenia and 17 age-and sex-matched
   healthy controls (HCs). Participants were required to watch short
   animations of two triangles interacting with each other with the
   interactions either random (no interaction), physical (patterned
   movement), or mental (intentional movement). Task-based Partial Least
   Squares (PLS) was used to analyze activation differences and
   commonalities between the three conditions and the two groups.
   Seed-based PLS was used to assess functional connectivity with peaks
   identified in the task based PLS. Behavioural PLS was then performed
   using the accuracy from the mental conditions. Patients with
   schizophrenia performed worse on the mentalizing condition compared to
   HCs. Task-based PLS revealed one significant latent variable (LV) that
   explained 42.9\% of the variance in the task, with theLV separating the
   mental condition from the physical and random conditions in patients
   with schizophrenia, but only the mental from physical in healthy
   controls. The mental animations were associated with increased
   modulation of the inferior frontal gyri bilaterally, left superior
   temporal gyrus, right postcentral gyros, and left caudate nucleus. The
   physical/random animations were associated with increased modulation of
   the right medial frontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyros.
   Seed-based PLS identified increased functional connectivity with the
   left inferior frontal gyrus (liFG) and caudate nucleus in patients with
   schizophrenia, during the mental and physical interactions, with
   functional connectivity with the liFG associated with increased
   performance on the mental animations. The results suggest that
   mentalizing deficits in schizophrenia may arise due to inefficient
   social brain networks.}},

Title = {{A functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation of theory of mind

Abstract = {{Although patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) are known to
   have theory of mind (ToM) impairments, the latter's neural functional
   bases have yet to be explored. We used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to gain insights into the neural dysfunction associated
   with ToM impairments in patients with mTLE.
   Twenty-five patients (12 and 13 with right and left mTLE, respectively)
   and 25 healthy controls performed the ``animated shapes{''} task during
   fMRI. This complex ToM task requires both explicit reasoning about
   mental states and implicit processing of information on biological
   motion and action. The animated shapes evoke both ToM and non-ToM
   interaction perception, and the corresponding neural activation patterns
   were compared. Behavioral performance (i.e. categorization of the
   interactions) was also recorded.
   Relative to healthy controls, both patients with right and left mTLE
   were impaired in categorizing ToM interactions. The fMRI results showed
   that both patients with right and left mTLE had less intense neural
   activation (relative to controls) in regions involved in the implicit
   component of ToM processes (i.e. the fusiform gyrus in patients with
   right mTLE and the supplementary motor area in patients with left mTLE).
   In patients with right mTLE, we also observed more intense activation
   (relative to controls) in regions involved in the explicit component of
   ToM processes (i.e. the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex); age at onset
   of epilepsy also mediated activation in regions involved in the explicit
   component (i.e. the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the
   temporoparietal junction). Patients with left mTLE displayed greater
   activation of the contralateral mesial regions (relative to controls);
   we speculate that this may correspond to the deployment of a
   compensatory mechanism.
   This study provides insights into the disturbances of the
   implicit/explicit ToM neural network in patients with mTLE. These
   impairments in the ToM neural network depend on clinical
   characteristics, such as the laterality (right or left mTLE) and the age
   at onset of epilepsy.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN AND LANGUAGE}},

Volume = {{163}},
Pages = {{42-49}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Research in auditory neuroscience illustrated the importance of superior
   temporal sulcus (STS) for speech sound processing. However, evidence for
   abstract processing beyond the level of phonetics in STS has remained
   elusive. In this study, we follow an underspecification approach
   according to which the phonological representation of vowels is based on
   the presence vs. absence of abstract features. We hypothesized that
   phonological mismatch in a same/different task is governed by
   underspecification: A less specified vowel in second position of
   same/different minimal pairs (e.g. {[}e]) compared to its more specified
   counterpart in first position (e.g. {[}o]) should result in stronger
   activation in STS than in the reverse presentation. Whole-brain analyses
   confirmed this hypothesis in a bilateral cluster in STS. However, this
   effect interacted with the feature-distance between first and second
   vowel and was most pronounced for a minimal, one-feature distance,
   evidencing the benefit of phonological information for processing
   acoustically minimal sound differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The concept of attachment in long-term interpersonal relationships has
   been linked to relationship outcome and social-emotional health. To
   date, no relationship between the structural properties of the human
   amygdala and attachment in romantic relationships (measured through
   self-reported attachment related anxiety and avoidance) has been
   described. The aim of the current study was to investigate the
   relationship between amygdala structure as well as amygdala structural
   and functional connectivity and attachment anxiety and avoidance. To
   this end, we collected self-report attachment data on a sample of female
   young adults. We then examined associations between attachment and mean
   diffusivity, fractional anisotropy and resting state functional
   connectivity MRI (rs-FC) of the amygdala and its white matter
   connections with the prefrontal cortex. We found that lower integrity of
   the left amygdala was linked with attachment avoidance (e.g., being less
   comfortable in seeking proximity with others and depending on others)
   and that greater structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus was
   positively associated with avoidance. Lastly, we found that stronger
   rs-FC between the bilateral amygdala and medial prefrontal regions was
   linked with greater avoidance. Our findings are compatible with and
   expand previous results reported by studies that have taken a
   task-related fMRI approach, furthering our understanding of the
   neurobiological mechanisms of attachment, and in particular implicating
   the system formed by amygdala and prefrontal areas in the patterns of
   behavior that regulate emotional proximity in romantic relationships.
   These findings have the potential to further our understanding of the
   affective mechanisms underlying attachment behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Conduct disorder (CD) is a serious behavioral disorder of childhood and
   adolescence. The default mode network (DMN) is a brain network which
   supports self-referential cognitive processes and is typically
   deactivated during task performance. The aim of this study was to
   investigate DMN connectivity in male adolescents with pure CD compared
   to typically-developing controls. Eighteen male adolescents with CD and
   18 sex-, age- and education-matched typically-developing (TD)
   participants were recruited. Current and lifetime psychiatric disorders
   were assessed using the Chinese version of the Schedule for Affective
   Disorder and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime
   Version. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
   were obtained using a 3.0 T scanner. Independent components analysis
   (ICA) was used to investigate functional connectivity between the DMN
   and related brain regions. DMN activity was observed in medial
   prefrontal, posterior cingulate, and lateral parietal cortices, and
   extended to the brainstem. Adolescents with CD showed significantly
   reduced functional connectivity within the bilateral posterior cingulate
   cortex (PCC), bilateral precuneus and right superior temporal gyrus
   relative to TD controls. CD is associated with reduced functional
   connectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and other regions. These
   preliminary results suggest that deficits in DMN functional connectivity
   may serve as a biomarker of CD.}},

   psychopathy-related limbic brain abnormalities during moral processing;
   however, these studies only examined negatively valenced moral stimuli.
   Here, we aimed to replicate prior psychopathy research on negative moral
   judgments and to extend this work by examining psychopathy-related
   abnormalities in the processing of controversial moral stimuli and
   positive moral processing. Incarcerated adult males (N = 245) completed
   a functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol on a mobile imaging
   system stationed at the prison. Psychopathy was assessed using the Hare
   Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). Participants were then shown
   words describing three types of moral stimuli: wrong (e.g., stealing),
   not wrong (e.g., charity), and controversial (e.g., euthanasia).
   Participants rated each stimulus as either wrong or not wrong. PCL-R
   total scores were correlated with not wrong behavioral responses to
   wrong moral stimuli, and were inversely related to hemodynamic activity
   in the anterior cingulate cortex in the contrast of wrong > not wrong.
   In the controversial > noncontroversial comparison, psychopathy was
   inversely associated with activity in the temporal parietal junction and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that
   psychopathy-related abnormalities are observed during the processing of
   complex, negative, and positive moral stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Some functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have
   reported altered activations in the frontal cortex during working memory
   (WM) performance in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
   but the findings have been mixed. The objective of the present study was
   to utilize near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an alternative imaging
   technique, to examine neural processing during WM performance in
   individuals with MCI. Methods: Twenty-six older adults with MCI (7
   males; mean age 69.15 years) were compared with 26 age-, gender-,
   handedness-, and education-matched older adults with normal cognition
   (NC; 7 males; mean age 68.87 years). All of the participants undertook
   an n-back task with a low (i. e., 0-back) and a high (i. e., 2-back) WM
   load condition while their prefrontal dynamics were recorded by a
   16-channel NIRS system. Results: Although behavioral results showed that
   the two groups had comparable task performance, neuroimaging results
   showed that the MCI group, unlike the NC group, did not exhibit
   significantly increased frontal activations bilaterally when WM load
   increased. Compared to the NC group, the MCI group had similar frontal
   activations at low load (p > 0.05 on all channels) but reduced
   activations at high load (p < 0.05 on 4 channels), thus failing to
   demonstrate WM-related frontal activations (p < 0.05 on 9 channels). In
   addition, we found a positive correlation between the left WM-related
   frontal activations and WM ability primarily in the NC group (r(s) =
   0.42, p = 0.035), suggesting a relationship between frontal
   hypoactivation and WM difficulties. Conclusion: The present findings
   suggest the presence of frontal dysfunction that is dependent on WM load
   in individuals with MCI. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

   differences between these patients and healthy controls at three levels:
   brain regions, the functional connectivity between brain areas, and the

   homogeneities in the left middle temporal gyrus decreased and functional
   connectivity between the left middle temporal gyrus and the stroke area
   increased in the patients. However, there was no significant change in
   the whole-brain functional network. By focusing on stroke located in or

Abstract = {{Historically known for its key contribution to motor behavior, the
   cerebellum continues to break boundaries. Researchers have demonstrated
   the cerebellum also plays a role in learning, memory, and more recent
   evidence for contributions in language, attention, working memory,
   emotions, and social processes. Here, we present a study that adds to
   the list of nonmotor processes of the cerebellum. We used images of
   faces and outdoor scenes to examine the cerebellar response to familiar
   and novel stimuli. Participants were familiarized with a subset of
   stimuli, and then underwent functional MRI (fMRI) where they were
   presented with the previously stimuli and new stimuli while making
   ``old{''} and ``new{''} judgment. In a familiar versus novel contrast,
   familiar stimuli (faces and scenes combined) activated bilateral regions
   of the cerebellum including I-IV, V, VI, Crus I, and Crus II. When
   separated by type, familiar faces had greater activation of bilateral
   I-IV than novel faces. These results demonstrate the cerebellar role in
   determining familiarity and contribute to continuing research supporting
   cerebellar contributions to nonmotor processes.}},

Abstract = {{Dispositional negativity-the propensity to experience and express more
   frequent, intense, or enduring negative affect-is a fundamental
   dimension of childhood temperament and adult personality. Elevated
   levels of dispositional negativity can have profound consequences for
   health, wealth, and happiness, drawing the attention of clinicians,
   researchers, and policymakers. Here, we highlight recent advances in our
   understanding of the psychological and neurobiological processes linking
   stable individual differences in dispositional negativity to momentary
   emotional states. Self-report data suggest that 3 key pathways-increased
   stressor reactivity, tonic increases in negative affect, and increased
   stressor exposure-explain most of the heightened negative affect that
   characterizes individuals with a more negative disposition. Of these 3
   pathways, tonically elevated, indiscriminate negative affect appears to
   be most central to daily life and most relevant to the development of
   psychopathology. New behavioral and biological data provide insights
   into the neural systems underlying these 3 pathways and motivate the
   hypothesis that seemingly ``tonic{''} increases in negative affect may
   actually reflect increased reactivity to stressors that are remote,
   uncertain, or diffuse. Research focused on humans, monkeys, and rodents
   suggests that this indiscriminate negative affect reflects trait-like
   variation in the activity and connectivity of several key brain regions,
   including the central extended amygdala and parts of the prefrontal
   cortex. Collectively, these observations provide an integrative
   psychobiological framework for understanding the dynamic cascade of
   processes that bind emotional traits to emotional states and,
   ultimately, to emotional disorders and other kinds of adverse outcomes.}},

Title = {{The selfless mind: How prefrontal involvement in mentalizing with
   similar and dissimilar others shapes empathy and prosocial behavior}},
Journal = {{COGNITION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{24-38}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Engaging in mentalizing, i.e., reflecting on others' thoughts, beliefs
   and feelings, is known to facilitate later empathy and prosocial
   behavior. Activation in dorsomedial prefrontal (dmPFC) areas during
   mentalizing has been shown to predict the extent of prosocial behavior.
   It is unclear, however, what cognitive process drives these effects: a
   simulation process in which the own mental states are used as a proxy
   for those of others (self-projection) or an effortful other-enhancement
   process in which one's own perspective is overridden. In this fMRI study
   we examined the effects of mentalizing with similar and dissimilar
   others on behavioral and brain measures of empathy and prosocial
   behavior, to assess which cognitive process mediates the facilitative
   effects of mentalizing. Participants had to mentalize with two
   fictitious target persons, one of whom was manipulated to have similar
   thoughts and beliefs as the participant, while the other had dissimilar
   mental states. We then assessed participants' behavioral and neural
   responses during an empathy for pain task and a prosocial behavior task.
   Similarity between participant and target person increased empathy and
   affiliation ratings, and mentalizing with dissimilar persons evoked
   increased activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the extent of
   which was inversely related with bias towards the similar person in
   empathy. Responses in two dmPFC regions were also predictive of later
   variations in subsequent empathy and prosocial behavior, either
   predicting overall prosociality and empathic concern (lateral dmPFC), or
   predicting reduced empathic bias towards the similar person and a lower
   response to self-related stressors in pain matrix areas (medial dmPFC).
   This pattern of results suggests that generating and enhancing
   other-related representations while overcoming one's own perspective,
   rather than enhanced recruitment of self-projection processes, is
   driving the facilitative effects of mentalizing on later empathic and
   prosocial responses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Disordered emotion regulation may affect work efficiency, induce social
   disharmony, and even cause psychiatric diseases. Despite recent
   neurocomputing advances, whether positive and negative emotion networks
   can be voluntarily modulated is still unknown. In the present study, we
   addressed this question through multivariate voxel pattern analysis and
   real-time functional MRI neurofeedback (rtfMRI-nf). During a sustained
   emotion regulation task, participants' emotional states (positive or
   negative) were given to them as feedback. Participants were able to
   increase the percentage of positive emotional states, enhancing emotion
   regulation network activities. Participants showed an improvement on the
   positive subscale of positive and negative affect scale that came close
   to significance. Furthermore, the activation of several emotion-related
   brain regions, including insula, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex,
   and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, was also increased during rtfMRI-nf
   training. These findings suggest that humans are able to voluntarily
   modulate positive emotion networks, leading to exciting applications in
   the treatment of various neurological and psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin is a neuropeptide widely recognized for its role in regulating
   social and reproductive behavior. Increasing evidence from animal models
   suggests that oxytocin also modulates reward circuitry in non-social
   contexts, but evidence in humans is lacking.
   We examined the effects of oxytocin administration on reward circuit
   function in 18 healthy men as they performed a monetary incentive task.
   The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal was measured using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging in the context of a randomized,
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of intranasal
   oxytocin.
   We found that oxytocin increases the BOLD signal in the midbrain
   (substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area) during the late phase of
   the hemodynamic response to incentive stimuli. Oxytocin's effects on
   midbrain responses correlated positively with its effects on positive
   emotional state. We did not detect an effect of oxytocin on responses in
   the nucleus accumbens. Whole-brain analyses revealed that oxytocin
   attenuated medial prefrontal cortical deactivation specifically during
   anticipation of loss.
   Our findings demonstrate that intranasal administration of oxytocin
   modulates human midbrain and medial prefrontal function during motivated
   behavior. These findings suggest that endogenous oxytocin is a
   neurochemical mediator of reward behaviors in humans-even in a
   non-social context-and that the oxytocinergic system is a potential
   target of pharmacotherapy for psychiatric disorders that involve
   dysfunction of reward circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that the mirror neuron system (MNS) plays an
   important role in action understanding. However, whether and how the MNS
   activity is different in individuals with autism spectrum disorders
   (ASD) and typically developed (TD) individuals are still unclear. The
   current study used activation likelihood estimation to conduct a
   meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that
   investigated action observation and imitation in ASD and TD individuals.
   Thirteen studies were selected, and the contrasts focused on the brain
   effects in ASD and TD participants and the differences between the two
   groups. The results showed that compared with TD individuals, ASD
   individuals exhibited stronger effects in the anterior inferior parietal
   lobule, a part of the putative human MNS. In addition, the ASD group
   demonstrated altered effects in the occipital cortex, dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and insula. These results suggest
   that ASD individuals demonstrate dysfunction of the MNS during action
   observation and imitation. Furthermore, brain regions involved in visual
   processing, executive function, and social cognitive function might also
   show dysfunction during action task performance.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies using a recognition memory paradigm examine the neural
   processes that support the ability to consciously recognize past events.
   However, there can also be nonconscious influences from the prior study
   episode that reflect repetition suppression effectsa reduction in the
   magnitude of activity for repeated presentations of stimulithat are
   revealed by comparing neural activity associated with forgotten items to
   correctly rejected novel items. The present fMRI study examined the
   effect of emotional valence (positive vs. negative) on repetition
   suppression effects. Using a standard recognition memory task, 24
   participants viewed line drawings of previously studied negative,
   positive, and neutral photos intermixed with novel line drawings. For
   each item, participants made an old-new recognition judgment and a
   sure-unsure confidence rating. Collapsed across valence, repetition
   suppression effects were found in ventral occipital-temporal cortex and
   frontal regions. Activity levels in the majority of these regions were
   not modulated by valence. However, repetition enhancement of the
   amygdala and ventral occipital-temporal cortex functional connectivity
   reflected nonconscious memory for negative items. In this study, valence
   had little effect on activation patterns but had a larger effect on
   functional connectivity patterns that were markers of nonconscious
   memory. Beyond memory and emotion, these findings are relevant to other
   cognitive and social neuroscientists that utilize fMRI repetition
   effects to investigate perception, attention, social cognition, and
   other forms of learning and memory.}},

Title = {{The impact of aging on the neural networks involved in gaze and
   emotional processing}},
Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{182-194}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Normal adult aging is associated with difficulties in processing social
   cues to emotions such as anger and also altered motivation to focus more
   on positive than negative information. Gaze direction is an important
   modifier of the social signals conveyed by an emotion, for example, an
   angry face looking directly at you is considerably more threatening than
   an angry face looking away. In the present study we tested the
   hypothesis that older adults would show less neural differentiation to
   angry faces with direct and avert gaze compared to younger people, with
   the opposite prediction for happy faces. Healthy older (65-75 years;
   mean = 69.75) and younger (17-27 years; mean = 20.65) adults completed a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment in which they were
   asked to identify happy and angry expressions displayed either with
   direct or averted gaze. While younger adults showed neural sensitivity
   to eye-gaze direction during recognition of angry expressions, older
   adults showed no effect of eye-gaze direction on neural response. In
   contrast, older adults showed sensitivity to eye-gaze direction during
   recognition of happy expressions but younger adults did not.
   Additionally, brain-behavior correlations were conducted to investigate
   the relationships between emotion recognition and mentalizing brain
   network in both age groups. Younger (but not older) adults' social
   cognitive performance was differentially correlated with activation in 2
   brain networks when looking at angry faces with direct compared to
   averted gaze. These novel findings provide evidence for age-related
   differences in the neural substrates underlying the capacity to
   integrate facial affect and eye-gaze cues. The results of this study
   suggest that age-related differences in integrating facial cues may be
   related to engagement of the mentalizing network, with potentially
   important implications for social cognitive functioning in late
   adulthood. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hierarchical organization of human cortical circuits integrates
   information across different timescales via temporal receptive windows,
   which increase in length from lower to higher levels of the cortical
   hierarchy (Hasson et al., 2015). A recent neurobiological model of
   higher-order language processing (Bornkessel-Schlesewsky et al., 2015)
   posits that temporal receptive windows in the dorsal auditory stream
   provide the basis for a hierarchically organized predictive coding
   architecture (Friston and Kiebel, 2009). In this stream, a nested set of
   internal models generates time-based ({''}when{''}) predictions for
   upcoming input at different linguistic levels (sounds, words, sentences,
   discourse). Here, we used naturalistic stories to test the hypothesis
   that multi-sentence, discourse-level predictions are processed in the
   dorsal auditory stream, yielding attenuated BOLD responses for highly
   predicted versus less strongly predicted language input. The results
   were as hypothesized: discourse-related cues, such as passive voice,
   which effect a higher predictability of remention for a character at a
   later point within a story, led to attenuated BOLD responses for
   auditory input of high versus low predictability within the dorsal
   auditory stream, specifically in the inferior parietal lobule, middle
   frontal gyrus, and dorsal parts of the inferior frontal gyrus, among
   other areas. Additionally, we found effects of content-related
   ({''}what{''}) predictions in ventral regions. These findings provide
   novel evidence that hierarchical predictive coding extends to
   discourse-level processing in natural language. Importantly, they ground
   language processing on a hierarchically organized predictive network, as
   a common underlying neurobiological basis shared with other brain
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain undergoes dramatic changes in amygdala-related
   functional connectivity network during adolescence. Given that the
   amygdala is a vital component of the ``social brain{''}, the Amygdala
   Theory of Autism has been proposed to account for atypical patterns of
   socio-emotional behavior in autism. Most of the previous neuroimaging
   evidence has concentrated on local functional or structural
   abnormalities of the amygdala in relation to social deficits in autism,
   rather than on its integrated role as part of larger brain networks. To
   examine whether functional integration pattern of the amygdala is
   altered in autism, the current study examined sixty-five adolescent
   subjects (30 autism and 35 healthy controls, 12-18 years old) from two
   independent datasets (UCLA and Leuven) of the Autism Brain Imaging Data
   Exchange. Whole-brain resting state functional connectivity maps seeded
   in the amygdala were calculated and compared between patient and control
   groups. Compared with healthy controls, adolescents with autism showed
   decreased functional connectivity between the amygdala and subcortical
   regions in both datasets, including the bilateral thalamus and right
   putamen. These findings support the Amygdala Theory of Autism,
   demonstrating altered functional connectivity pattern associated with
   the amygdala in autism, and provide new insights into the
   pathophysiology of autism.}},

Title = {{Memory consolidation reconfigures neural pathways involved in the
   suppression of emotional memories}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{The ability to suppress unwanted emotional memories is crucial for human
   mental health. Through consolidation over time, emotional memories often
   become resistant to change. However, how consolidation impacts the
   effectiveness of emotional memory suppression is still unknown. Using
   event-related fMRI while concurrently recording skin conductance, we
   investigated the neurobiological processes underlying the suppression of
   aversive memories before and after overnight consolidation. Here we
   report that consolidated aversive memories retain their emotional
   reactivity and become more resistant to suppression. Suppression of
   consolidated memories involves higher prefrontal engagement, and less
   concomitant hippocampal and amygdala disengagement. In parallel, we show
   a shift away from hippocampal-dependent representational patterns to
   distributed neocortical representational patterns in the suppression of
   aversive memories after consolidation. These findings demonstrate rapid
   changes in emotional memory organization with overnight consolidation,
   and suggest possible neurobiological bases underlying the resistance to
   suppression of emotional memories in affective disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Psychosocial stressors induce autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses
   in multiple body systems that are linked to health risks. Much work has
   focused on the common effects of stress, but ANS responses in different
   body systems are dissociable and may result from distinct patterns of
   cortical-subcortical interactions. Here, we used machine learning to
   develop multivariate patterns of fMRI activity predictive of heart rate
   (HR) and skin conductance level (SCL) responses during social threat in
   humans(N = 18). Overall, brain patterns predicted both HR and SCL in
   cross-validated analyses successfully (r(HR) = 0.54, r(SCL) = 0.58, both
   p < 0.0001). These patterns partly reflected central stress mechanisms
   common to both responses because each pattern predicted the other signal
   to some degree (r(HR -> SCL) = 0.21and r(SCL -> HR) = 0.22, both p <
   0.01), but they were largely physiological response specific. Both
   patterns included positive predictive weights in dorsal anterior
   cingulate and cerebellum and negative weights in ventromedial PFC and
   local pattern similarity analyses within these regions suggested that
   they encode common central stress mechanisms. However, the predictive
   maps and searchlight analysis suggested that the patterns predictive of
   HR and SCL were substantially different across most of the brain,
   including significant differences in ventromedial PFC, insula, lateral
   PFC, pre-SMA, and dmPFC. Overall, the results indicate that specific
   patterns of cerebral activity track threat-induced autonomic responses
   in specific body systems. Physiological measures of threat are not
   interchangeable, but rather reflect specific interactions among brain
   systems.}},

Title = {{Brain Network Mechanisms Underlying Motor Enhancement by Transcranial
   Entrainment of Gamma Oscillations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{47}},
Pages = {{12053-12065}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Gamma and beta oscillations are routinely observed in motor-related
   brain circuits during movement preparation and execution. Entrainment of
   gamma or beta oscillations via transcranial alternating current
   stimulation (tACS) over primary motor cortex (M1) has opposite effects
   on motor performance, suggesting a causal role of these brain rhythms
   for motor control. However, it is largely unknown which brain mechanisms
   characterize these changes in motor performance brought about by tACS.
   In particular, it is unclear whether these effects result from brain
   activity changes only in the targeted areas or within functionally
   connected brain circuits. Here we investigated this issue by applying
   gamma-band and beta-band tACS over M1 in healthy humans during a
   visuomotor task and concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Gamma tACS indeed improved both the velocity and acceleration of
   visually triggered movements, compared with both beta tACS and sham
   stimulation. Beta tACS induced a numerical decrease in velocity compared
   with sham stimulation, but this was not statistically significant.
   Crucially, gamma tACS induced motor performance enhancements correlated
   with changed BOLD activity in the stimulated M1. Moreover, we found
   frequency-and task-specific neural compensatory activity modulations in
   the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), suggesting a key regulatory
   role of this region in motor performance. Connectivity analyses revealed
   that the dmPFC interacted functionally with M1 and with regions within
   the executive motor system. These results suggest a role of the dmPFC
   for motor control and show that tACS-induced behavioral changes not only
   result from activity modulations underneath the stimulation electrode
   but also reflect compensatory modulation within connected and
   functionally related brain networks. More generally, our results
   illustrate how combined tACS-fMRI can be used to resolve the causal link
   between cortical rhythms, brain systems, and behavior.}},

   Dissimilarity in Functional Patterns during Spoken Communications}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Human behaviour in various circumstances mirrors the corresponding brain
   connectivity patterns, which are suitably represented by functional
   brain networks. While the objective analysis of these networks by graph
   theory tools deepened our understanding of brain functions, the
   multi-brain structures and connections underlying human social behaviour
   remain largely unexplored. In this study, we analyse the aggregate graph
   that maps coordination of EEG signals previously recorded during spoken
   communications in two groups of six listeners and two speakers. Applying
   an innovative approach based on the algebraic topology of graphs, we
   analyse higher-order topological complexes consisting of mutually
   interwoven cliques of a high order to which the identified functional
   connections organise. Our results reveal that the topological
   quantifiers provide new suitable measures for differences in the brain
   activity patterns and inter-brain synchronisation between speakers and
   listeners. Moreover, the higher topological complexity correlates with
   the listener's concentration to the story, confirmed by self-rating, and
   closeness to the speaker's brain activity pattern, which is measured by
   network-to-network distance. The connectivity structures of the frontal
   and parietal lobe consistently constitute distinct clusters, which
   extend across the listener's group. Formally, the topology quantifiers
   of the multi-brain communities exceed the sum of those of the
   participating individuals and also reflect the listener's rated
   attributes of the speaker and the narrated subject. In the broader
   context, the presented study exposes the relevance of higher topological
   structures ( besides standard graph measures) for characterising
   functional brain networks under different stimuli.}},

Title = {{Emotional Empathy and Facial Mimicry for Static and Dynamic Facial
   Expressions of Fear and Disgust}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Facial mimicry is the tendency to imitate the emotional facial
   expressions of others. Increasing evidence suggests that the perception
   of dynamic displays leads to enhanced facial mimicry, especially for
   happiness and anger. However, little is known about the impact of
   dynamic stimuli on facial mimicry for fear and disgust. To investigate
   this issue, facial EMG responses were recorded in the corrugator
   supercilii, levator labii, and lateral frontalis muscles, while
   participants viewed static (photos) and dynamic (videos) facial
   emotional expressions. Moreover, we tested whether emotional empathy
   modulated facial mimicry for emotional facial expressions. In accordance
   with our predictions, the highly empathic group responded with larger
   activity in the corrugator supercilii and levator labii muscles.
   Moreover, dynamic compared to static facial expressions of fear revealed
   enhanced mimicry in the high-empathic group in the frontalis and
   corrugator supercilii muscles. In the low-empathic group the facial
   reactions were not differentiated between fear and disgust for both
   dynamic and static facial expressions. We conclude that highly empathic
   subjects are more sensitive in their facial reactions to the facial
   expressions of fear and disgust compared to low empathetic counterparts.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we integrate recent theoretical and empirical
   developments in predictive coding and active inference accounts of
   interoception (including the Embodied Predictive Interoception Coding
   model) with working hypotheses from the theory of constructed emotion to
   propose a biologically plausible unified theory of the mind that places
   metabolism and energy regulation (i.e. allostasis), as well as the
   sensory consequences of that regulation (i.e. interoception), at its
   core. We then consider the implications of this approach for
   understanding depression. We speculate that depression is a disorder of
   allostasis, whose myriad symptoms result from a `locked in' brain that
   is relatively insensitive to its sensory context. We conclude with a
   brief discussion of the ways our approach might reveal new insights for
   the treatment of depression.

Title = {{The Role of Medial Frontal Cortex in Action Anticipation in Professional
   Badminton Players}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{Some studies show that the medial frontal cortex is associated with more
   skilled action anticipation, while similar findings are not observed in
   some other studies, possibly due to the stimuli employed and the
   participants used as the control group. In addition, no studies have
   investigated whether there is any functional connectivity between the
   medial frontal cortex and other brain regions in more skilled action
   anticipation. Therefore, the present study aimed to re-investigate how
   the medial frontal cortex is involved in more skilled action
   anticipation by circumventing the limitations of previous research and
   to investigate that the medial frontal cortex functionally connected
   with other brain regions involved in action processing in more skilled
   action anticipation. To this end, professional badminton players and
   novices were asked to anticipate the landing position of the shuttlecock
   while watching badminton match videos or to judge the gender of the
   players in the matches. The video clips ended right at the point that
   the shuttlecock and the racket came into contact to reduce the effect of
   information about the trajectory of the shuttlecock. Novices who lacked
   training and watching experience were recruited for the control group to
   reduce the effect of sport-related experience on the medial frontal
   cortex. Blood oxygenation level-dependent activation was assessed by
   means of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Compared to novices,
   badminton players exhibited stronger activation in the left medial
   frontal cortex during action anticipation and greater functional
   connectivity between left medial frontal cortex and some other brain
   regions (e.g., right posterior cingulate cortex). Therefore, the present
   study supports the position that the medial frontal cortex plays a role
   in more skilled action anticipation and that there is a specific brain
   network for more skilled action anticipation that involves right
   posterior cingulate cortex, right fusiform gyrus, right inferior
   parietal lobule, left insula and particularly, and left medial frontal
   cortex.}},

Title = {{Neural Correlates of Contrast and Humor: Processing Common Features of
   Verbal Irony}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Irony is a kind of figurative language used by a speaker to say
   something that contrasts with the context and, to some extent, lends
   humor to a situation. However, little is known about the brain regions
   that specifically support the processing of these two common features of
   irony. The present study had two main aims: (i) investigate the neural
   basis of irony processing, by delivering short ironic spoken sentences
   (and their literal counterparts) to participants undergoing fMRI; and
   (ii) assess the neural effect of two irony parameters, obtained from
   normative studies: degree of contrast and humor appreciation. Results
   revealed activation of the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG),
   posterior part of the left superior temporal gyrus, medial frontal
   cortex, and left caudate during irony processing, suggesting the
   involvement of both semantic and theory-of-mind networks. Parametric
   models showed that contrast was specifically associated with the
   activation of bilateral frontal and subcortical areas, and that these
   regions were also sensitive to humor, as shown by a conjunction
   analysis. Activation of the bilateral IFG is consistent with the
   literature on humor processing, and reflects incongruity
   detection/resolution processes. Moreover, the activation of subcortical
   structures can be related to the reward processing of social events.}},

   children with autism}},
Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common yet complex
   neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by social, communication and
   behavioral deficits. Behavioral interventions have shown favorable
   results-however, the promise of precision medicine in ASD is hampered by
   a lack of sensitive, objective neurobiological markers (neurobiomarkers)
   to identify subgroups of young children likely to respond to specific
   treatments. Such neurobiomarkers are essential because early childhood
   provides a sensitive window of opportunity for intervention, while
   unsuccessful intervention is costly to children, families and society.
   In young children with ASD, we show that functional magnetic resonance
   imaging-based stratification neurobiomarkers accurately predict
   responses to an evidence-based behavioral treatment-pivotal response
   treatment. Neural predictors were identified in the pretreatment levels
   of activity in response to biological vs scrambled motion in the neural
   circuits that support social information processing (superior temporal
   sulcus, fusiform gyrus, amygdala, inferior parietal cortex and superior
   parietal lobule) and social motivation/reward (orbitofrontal cortex,
   insula, putamen, pallidum and ventral striatum). The predictive value of
   our findings for individual children with ASD was supported by a
   multivariate pattern analysis with cross validation. Predicting who will
   respond to a particular treatment for ASD, we believe the current
   findings mark the very first evidence of prediction/stratification
   biomarkers in young children with ASD. The implications of the findings
   are far reaching and should greatly accelerate progress toward more
   precise and effective treatments for core deficits in ASD.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{55-66}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research is routinely
   criticized for being statistically underpowered due to
   characteristically small sample sizes and much larger sample sizes are
   being increasingly recommended. Additionally, various sources of
   artifact inherent in fMRI data can have detrimental impact on effect
   size estimates and statistical power. Here we show how specific removal
   of non-BOLD artifacts can improve effect size estimation and statistical
   power in task-fMRI contexts, with particular application to the
   social-cognitive domain of mentalizing/theory of mind. Non-BOLD
   variability identification and removal is achieved in a biophysical and
   statistically principled manner by combining multi-echo fMRI acquisition
   and independent components analysis (ME-ICA). Without smoothing,
   group-level effect size estimates on two different mentalizing tasks
   were enhanced by ME-ICA at a median rate of 24\% in regions canonically
   associated with mentalizing, while much more substantial boosts
   (40-149\%) were observed in non-canonical cerebellar areas. Effect size
   boosting occurs via reduction of non-BOLD noise at the subject-level and
   consequent reductions in between-subject variance at the group-level.
   Smoothing can attenuate ME-ICA-related effect size improvements in
   certain circumstances. Power simulations demonstrate that ME-ICA-related
   effect size enhancements enable much higher-powered studies at
   traditional sample sizes. Cerebellar effects observed after applying
   ME-ICA may be unobservable with conventional imaging at traditional
   sample sizes. Thus, ME-ICA allows for principled design-agnostic
   non-BOLD artifact removal that can substantially improve effect size
   estimates and statistical power in task-fMRI contexts. ME-ICA could
   mitigate some issues regarding statistical power in fMRI studies and
   enable novel discovery of aspects of brain organization that are
   currently under-appreciated and not well understood. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Neural correlates of envy: Regional homogeneity of resting-state brain
   activity predicts dispositional envy}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{215-220}},

Abstract = {{Envy differs from common negative emotions across cultures. Although
   previous studies have explored the neural basis of episodic envy via
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), little is known about the
   neural processes associated with dispositional envy. In the present
   study, we used regional homogeneity (ReHo) as an index in resting-state
   fMRI (rs-fMRI) to identify brain regions involved in individual
   differences in dispositional envy, as measured by the Dispositional Envy
   Scale (DES). Results showed that ReHo in the inferior/middle frontal
   gyrus (IFG/MFG) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) positively
   predicted dispositional envy. Moreover, of all the personality traits
   measured by the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R), only
   neuroticism was significantly associated with dispositional envy.
   Furthermore, neuroticism mediated the underlying association between the
   ReHo of the IFG/MFG and dispositional envy. Hence, to the best of our
   knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that spontaneous brain
   activity in multiple regions related to self-evaluation, social
   perception, and social emotion contributes to dispositional envy. In
   addition, our findings reveal that neuroticism may play an important
   role in the cognitive processing of dispositional envy. (C) 2016

Title = {{Chronic psychosocial stress in mice leads to changes in brain functional
   connectivity and metabolite levels comparable to human depression}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{544-552}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Human depression, for which chronic psychosocial stress is a major risk
   factor, is characterized by consistent alterations in neurocircuitry.
   For example, there is increased functional connectivity (FC) within and
   between regions comprising the default mode network (DMN) including
   prefrontal cortex and cingulate cortex. Alterations in network FC are
   associated with specific aspects of psychopathology. In mice, chronic
   psychosocial stress (CPS) leads to depression-relevant behavior,
   including increased fear learning, learned helplessness, fatigue and
   decreased motivation for reward. Using multimodal in vivo magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), we investigated CPS
   effects on function and structure in the mouse brain under light
   anesthesia. Mice underwent a baseline MRI/MRS session, followed by
   15-day CPS (n = 26) or control handling (n= 27), and a post-treatment
   MRI/MRS session. In BOLD fMRI, relative to controls, CPS mice exhibited
   robust, reproducible increases in FC within 8 of 9 identified cortical
   networks, including the prefrontal and cingulate cortices that
   contribute to the ``mouse DMN{''}. CPS mice exhibited increases in
   between-network FC, including amygdala -prefrontal cortex and amygdala -
   cingulate cortex. MRS identified metabolic alterations in CPS mice as
   increased inositol levels in amygdala and increased
   glycerophosphorylcholine levels in prefrontal cortex. Diffusion-weighted
   MRI detected increased fractional anisotropic values in the cingulum.
   This study demonstrates that chronic psychosocial stress induces FC
   states in the mouse brain analogous to those observed in depression, as
   well as cerebral metabolism and white matter pathway alterations that
   contribute to understanding of pathological processes. It also
   demonstrates the importance of brain imaging to the establishment of
   valid animal models in translational psychiatry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Whispering - The hidden side of auditory communication}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Pages = {{602-612}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Whispering is a unique expression mode that is specific to auditory
   communication. Individuals switch their vocalization mode to whispering
   especially when affected by inner emotions in certain social contexts,
   such as in intimate relationships or intimidating social interactions.
   Although this context-dependent whispering is adaptive, whispered voices
   are acoustically far less rich than phonated voices and thus impose
   higher hearing and neural auditory decoding demands for recognizing
   their socio-affective value by listeners. The neural dynamics underlying
   this recognition especially from whispered voices are largely unknown.
   Here we show that whispered voices in humans are considerably
   impoverished as quantified by an entropy measure of spectral acoustic
   information, and this missing information needs large-scale neural
   compensation in terms of auditory and cognitive processing. Notably,
   recognizing the socio-affective information from voices was slightly
   more difficult from whispered voices, probably based on missing tonal
   information. While phonated voices elicited extended activity in
   auditory regions for decoding of relevant tonal and time information and
   the valence of voices, whispered voices elicited activity in a complex
   auditory-frontal brain network. Our data suggest that a large-scale
   multidirectional brain network compensates for the impoverished sound
   quality of socially meaningful environmental signals to support their
   accurate recognition and valence attribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a role in complex cognitive

   activation using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Cerebral
   blood flow (CBF) was increased around bilateral Brodmann areas 46 and 10
   during visual and auditory information integration during an occlusal
   force (biting) task. After local anesthesia, CBF values were
   significantly decreased, but occlusal force was similar. In conclusion,
   the effects of peripheral sensory information from the periodontal
   ligament and external information have minimal impacts on occlusal force
   maintenance but are important for PFC activation.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has consistently
   highlighted impaired or aberrant functional connectivity across brain
   regions of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. However, the
   manifestation and neural substrates of these alterations are highly
   heterogeneous and often conflicting. Moreover, their neurobiological
   underpinnings and etiopathological significance remain largely unknown.
   A deeper understanding of the complex pathophysiological cascade leading
   to aberrant connectivity in ASD can greatly benefit from the use of
   model organisms where individual pathophysiological or phenotypic
   components of ASD can be recreated and investigated via approaches that
   are either off limits or confounded by clinical heterogeneity. Despite
   some obvious limitations in reliably modeling the full phenotypic
   spectrum of a complex developmental disorder like ASD, mouse models have
   played a central role in advancing our basic mechanistic and molecular
   understanding of this syndrome. Recent progress in mouse brain
   connectivity mapping via resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) offers the
   opportunity to generate and test mechanistic hypotheses about the
   elusive origin and significance of connectional aberrations observed in
   autism. Here we discuss recent progress toward this goal, and illustrate
   initial examples of how the approach can be employed to establish causal
   links between ASD-related mutations, developmental processes, and brain
   connectional architecture. As the spectrum of genetic and
   pathophysiological components of ASD modeled in the mouse is rapidly
   expanding, the use of rsfMRI can advance our mechanistic understanding
   of the origin and significance of the connectional alterations
   associated with autism, and their heterogeneous expression across
   patient cohorts.}},

Abstract = {{Microblogs is one of the main social networking channels by which
   information is spread. Among them, Sina Weibo is one of the largest
   social networking channels in China. Millions of users repost
   information from Sina Weibo and share embedded emotion at the same time.
   The present study investigated participants' propensity to repost
   microblog messages of positive, negative, or neutral valence, and
   studied the neural correlates during resting state with the reposting
   rate of each type microblog messages. Participants preferred to repost
   negative messages relative to positive and neutral messages. Reposting
   rate of negative messages was positively correlated to the functional
   connectivity of temporoparietal junction (TPJ) with insula, and TPJ with
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that reposting
   negative messages is related to conflict resolution between the feeling
   of pain/disgust and the intention to repost significant information.
   Thus, resposting emotional microblog messages might be attributed to
   participants' appraisal of personal and recipient's interest, as well as
   their cognitive process for decision making.}},

Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that pleasure from artistic music is intellectual
   while that from popular music is physiological, this study investigated
   the different functional mechanisms between aesthetic appreciation of
   artistic and popular music using fMRI. 18 male non-musicians were
   scanned while they performed an aesthetic rating task for excerpts of
   artistic music, popular music and musical notes playing and singing
   (control). The rating scores of artistic and popular music excerpts were
   both significantly higher than that of control materials while the
   scores of them were not different. The fMRI results showed both artistic
   and popular conditions activated the VS and vmPFC, compared with control
   condition. When contrasted popular and artistic condition directly, we
   found popular music activated right putamen, while artistic music
   activated right mPFC. By parametric analysis, we found the activation of
   right putamen tracked the aesthetic ratings of popular music, whereas
   the BOLD signal in right mPFC tracked the aesthetic ratings of artistic
   music. These results indicate the reward induced by popular music is
   closer to a primary reward while that induced by artistic music is
   closer to a secondary reward. We also found artistic music activated ToM
   areas, including PCC/PC, arMFC and TPJ, when compared with popular
   music. And these areas also tracked aesthetic ratings of artistic music
   but not those of popular music. These results imply that the pleasure
   from former comes from cognitive empathy. In conclusion, this study
   gives clear neuronal evidences supporting the view that artistic music
   is of intelligence and social cognition involved while the popular music
   is of physiology.}},

Abstract = {{With new technological advances, advice can come from different sources
   such as machines or humans, but how individuals respond to such advice
   and the neural correlates involved need to be better understood. We
   combined functional MRI and multivariate Granger causality analysis with
   an X-ray luggage-screening task to investigate the neural basis and
   corresponding effective connectivity involved with advice utilization
   from agents framed as experts. Participants were asked to accept or
   reject good or bad advice from a human or machine agent with low
   reliability (high false alarm rate). We showed that unreliable advice
   decreased performance overall and participants interacting with the
   human agent had a greater depreciation of advice utilization during bad
   advice compared to the machine agent. These differences in advice
   utilization can be perceivably due to reevaluation of expectations
   arising from association of dispositional credibility for each agent. We
   demonstrated that differences in advice utilization engaged brain
   regions that may be associated with evaluation of personal
   characteristics and traits (precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex,
   temporoparietal junction) and interoception (posterior insula). We found
   that the right posterior insula and left precuneus were the drivers of
   the advice utilization network that were reciprocally connected to each
   other and also projected to all other regions. Our behavioral and
   neuroimaging results have significant implications for society because
   of progressions in technology and increased interactions with machines.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) play
   important roles in ``emotion dysregulation,{''} which has a profound
   impact on etiologic research of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The
   present study analyzed both eyes-open and eyes-closed resting state
   functional MRI (rs-fMRI) of 43 subjects (21 GAD patients with medicine
   free and 22 matched healthy controls). The amygdala and the DLPFC were
   defined as regions of interest (ROI) to analyze functional connectivity
   (F0) in GAD patients compared with healthy controls. The main findings
   revealed GAD patients had increased FC between the amygdala and the
   temporal pole compared to healthy controls, which was found in both eyes
   open and eyes closed rs-fMRI. And altered FC between the ROls and brain
   regions that mainly belonged to the default mode network (DMN) were
   found. These findings suggest that the abnormal FC between the amygdala
   and the temporal pole may contribute to the pathophysiology of GAD, and
   provide insights into the current understanding of the emotion
   dysregulation of anxiety disorders.}},

Title = {{Neural Correlates of Belief and Emotion Attribution in Schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Impaired mental state attribution is a core social cognitive deficit in
   schizophrenia. With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this
   study examined the extent to which the core neural system of mental
   state attribution is involved in mental state attribution, focusing on
   belief attribution and emotion attribution. Fifteen schizophrenia
   outpatients and 14 healthy controls performed two mental state
   attribution tasks in the scanner. In a Belief Attribution Task, after
   reading a short vignette, participants were asked infer either the
   belief of a character (a false belief condition) or a physical state of
   an affair (a false photograph condition). In an Emotion Attribution
   Task, participants were asked either to judge whether character(s) in
   pictures felt unpleasant, pleasant, or neutral emotion (other condition)
   or to look at pictures that did not have any human characters (view
   condition). fMRI data were analyzing focusing on a priori regions of
   interest (ROIs) of the core neural systems of mental state attribution:
   the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and
   precuneus. An exploratory whole brain analysis was also performed. Both
   patients and controls showed greater activation in all four ROIs during
   the Belief Attribution Task than the Emotion Attribution Task. Patients
   also showed less activation in the precuneus and left TPJ compared to
   controls during the Belief Attribution Task. No significant group
   difference was found during the Emotion Attribution Task in any of ROIs.
   An exploratory whole brain analysis showed a similar pattern of neural
   activations. These findings suggest that while schizophrenia patients
   rely on the same neural network as controls do when attributing beliefs
   of others, patients did not show reduced activation in the key regions
   such as the TPJ. Further, this study did not find evidence for aberrant
   neural activation during emotion attribution or recruitment of
   compensatory brain regions in schizophrenia.}},

Title = {{Anticipation of guilt for everyday moral transgressions: The role of the
   anterior insula and the influence of interpersonal psychopathic traits}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterised by atypical moral
   behaviour likely rooted in atypical affective/motivational processing,
   as opposed to an inability to judge the wrongness of an action. Guilt is
   a moral emotion believed to play a crucial role in adherence to moral
   and social norms, but the mechanisms by which guilt (or lack thereof)
   may influence behaviour in individuals with high levels of psychopathic
   traits are unclear. We measured neural responses during the anticipation
   of guilt about committing potential everyday moral transgressions, and
   tested the extent to which these varied with psychopathic traits. We
   found a significant interaction between the degree to which anticipated
   guilt was modulated in the anterior insula and interpersonal
   psychopathic traits: anterior insula modulation of anticipated guilt was
   weaker in individuals with higher levels of these traits. Data from a
   second sample confirmed that this pattern of findings was specific to
   the modulation of anticipated guilt and not related to the perceived
   wrongness of the transgression. These results suggest a central role for
   the anterior insula in coding the anticipation of guilt regarding
   potential moral transgressions and advance our understanding of the
   neurocognitive mechanisms that may underlie propensity to antisocial
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Patients with schizophrenia show impairment in facial
   emotion processing which is essential for successful social cognition.
   Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study aimed
   to investigate the implicit facial emotion recognition processing in
   participants with high genetic load for schizophrenia (GHR) as a
   possible trait marker of developing schizophrenia.
   Methods: Block design fMRI of implicit facial emotion processing was
   used in 20 participants with GHR aged 16-35, and 17 age, sex, and
   education year-matched healthy controls (HC). During the facial
   emotional processing for fearful, happy, and neutral face stimuli,
   participants were asked to explicitly determine the gender per stimuli.
   Results: Occipito-temporo-limbic area in fearful face condition and
   involvement of broader region including prefrontal cortex in neutral
   face condition revealed significant attenuation of BOLD signal
   activation in GHR compared to HC. The GHR demonstrated less activity in
   right amygdala during fearful and neutral face condition.
   Conclusion: The study presented that GHR displayed abnormal brain
   activity in occipito-temporo-limbic-frontal network implicated in facial
   emotion processing. It indicates that abnormal facial emotion processing
   may be influenced by a genetic factor and could be a trait marker in
   schizophrenia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Goal Directed Worry Rules Are Associated with Distinct Patterns of
   Amygdala Functional Connectivity and Vagal Modulation during
   Perseverative Cognition}},

Abstract = {{Excessive and uncontrollable worry is a defining feature of Generalized
   Anxiety Disorder (GAD). An important endeavor in the treatment of
   pathological worry is to understand why some people are unable to stop
   worrying once they have started. Worry perseveration is associated with
   a tendency to deploy goal directed worry rules (known as ``as many as
   can{''} worry rules; AMA). These require attention to the goal of the
   worry task and continuation of worry until the aims of the ``worry
   bout{''} are achieved. This study examined the association between the
   tendency to use AMA worry rules and neural and autonomic responses to a
   perseverative cognition induction. To differentiate processes underlying
   the AMA worry rule use from trait worry, we also examined the
   relationship between scores on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)
   and neural and autonomic responses following the same induction. We used
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) while
   measuring emotional bodily arousal from heart rate variability (where
   decreased HRV indicates stress-related parasympathetic withdrawal) in 19
   patients with GAD and 21 control participants. Seed based analyses were
   conducted to quantify brain changes in functional connectivity (FC) with
   the amygdala. The tendency to adopt an AMA worry rule was associated
   with validated measures of worry, anxiety, depression and rumination.
   AMA worry rule endorsement predicted a stronger decrease in HRV and was
   positively associated with increased connectivity between right amygdala
   and locus coeruleus (LC), a brainstem noradrenergic projection nucleus.
   Higher AMA scores were also associated with increased connectivity
   between amygdala and rostral superior frontal gyrus. Higher PSWQ scores
   amplified decreases in FC between right amygdala and subcallosal cortex,
   bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and areas of
   parietal cortex. Our results identify neural mechanisms underlying the
   deployment of AMA worry rules. We propose that the relationship between
   AMA worry rules and increased connectivity between the amygdala and
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents attempts by high worriers to maintain
   arousal and distress levels in order to feel prepared for future
   threats. Furthermore, we suggest that neural mechanisms associated with
   the PSWQ represent effortful inhibitory control during worry. These
   findings provide unique information about the neurobiological processes
   that underpin worry perseveration.}},

Title = {{Prediction of Biological Motion Perception Performance from Intrinsic
   Brain Network Regional Efficiency}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Biological motion perception (BMP) refers to the ability to perceive the
   moving form of a human figure from a limited amount of stimuli, such as
   from a few point lights located on the joints of a moving body. BMP is
   commonplace and important, but there is great inter individual
   variability in this ability. This study used multiple regression model
   analysis to explore the association between BMP performance and
   intrinsic brain activity, in order to investigate the neural substrates
   underlying inter-individual variability of BMP performance. The resting
   state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and BMP
   performance data were collected from 24 healthy participants, for whom
   intrinsic brain networks were constructed, and a graph-based network
   efficiency metric was measured. Then, a multiple linear regression model
   was used to explore the association between network regional efficiency
   and BMP performance. We found that the local and global network
   efficiency of many regions was significantly correlated with BMP
   performance. Further analysis showed that the local efficiency rather
   than global efficiency could be used to explain most of the BMP
   inter-individual variability, and the regions involved were
   predominately located in the Default Mode Network (DMN). Additionally,
   discrimination analysis showed that the local efficiency of certain
   regions such as the thalamus could be used to classify BMP performance
   across participants. Notably, the association pattern between network
   nodal efficiency and BMP was different from the association pattern of
   static directional/gender information perception. Overall, these
   findings show that intrinsic brain network efficiency may be considered
   a neural factor that explains BMP inter-individual variability.}},

Abstract = {{Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor (BDNF) genes have been found to interactively influence working
   memory (WM) as well as brain activation during WM tasks. However,
   whether the two genes have interactive effects on resting-state
   activities of the brain and whether these spontaneous activations
   correlate with WM are still unknown. This study included behavioral data
   from WM tasks and genetic data (COMT rs4680 and BDNF Val66Met) from 417
   healthy Chinese adults and resting-state fMRI data from 298 of them.
   Significant interactive effects of BDNF and COMT were found for WM
   performance as well as for resting-state regional homogeneity (ReHo) in
   WM-related brain areas, including the left medial frontal gyrus (lMeFG),
   left superior frontal gyrus (lSFG), right superior and medial frontal
   gyrus (rSMFG), right medial orbitofrontal gyrus (rMOFG), right middle
   frontal gyrus (rMFG), precuneus, bilateral superior temporal gyrus, left
   superior occipital gyrus, right middle occipital gyrus, and right
   inferior parietal lobule. Simple effects analyses showed that compared
   to other genotypes, subjects with COMT-VV/BDNF-VV had higher WM and
   lower ReHo in all five frontal brain areas. The results supported the
   hypothesis that COMT and BDNF polymorphisms influence WM performance and
   spontaneous brain activity (i.e., ReHo).}},

Abstract = {{Because of its accessibility, tractability, evolutionary history, and
   social intelligence, the domestic dog is increasingly used as a model
   animal in behavioral studies. Although this has led to new insights into
   canine cognition, understanding of dog brain function has not advanced
   apace. Practical and ethical concerns have limited the use of the
   invasive brain imaging techniques typically used with primate and rodent
   models. Now, with the advent of awake unrestrained canine functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (Berns et al., 2012), data can be obtained on
   brain function during passive reception of stimuli and even during
   active decision making. Such data have already proven useful for linking
   brain regions with particular cognitive functions, illuminating canine
   socioemotional processes, and grounding behavioral observations of
   phenotypic variability in a neural substrate. Future studies may shed
   new light on brain networks and neural dysfunction in dogs and will
   likely bear relevance for clinical practitioners, dog trainers, and
   comparative psychologists and neuroscientists. This brief review
   discusses prior dog imaging work; addresses the practical and technical
   hurdles to awake unrestrained dog imaging; and discusses the current
   state of the science. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety can have both detrimental and facilitatory cognitive effects.
   This study investigates the neural substrates of a replicated
   facilitatory effect of anxiety on sustained attention and response
   inhibition. This effect consisted of improved performance on the
   Sustained Attention to Response Task (a Go-NoGo task consisting of 91\%
   Go and 9\% NoGo trials) in threat (unpredictable electrical shock) vs
   safe (no shock) conditions. This study uses the same experimental design
   with fMRI and relies on an event-related analysis of BOLD signal
   changes. Findings reveal that threat-related cognitive facilitation
   (improved NoGo accuracy) is associated with greater activation of a
   right-lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated
   in sustained attention and response inhibition. Moreover, these same
   regions show decreased activation in the Go trials preceding NoGo
   errors. During NoGo trials, striatal activity is also greater in the
   threat vs safe condition, consistent with the notion of enhanced
   inhibitory processing under threat. These findings identify potential
   mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate
   distinct cognitive functions. A greater understanding of the complex
   interaction of the anxious state and cognitive processes may have
   critical clinical implications.}},

Abstract = {{The debilitating effects of social dysfunction in many psychiatric
   disorders prompt the need for systems-level biomarkers of social
   abilities that can be applied in clinical populations and longitudinal
   studies. A promising neuroimaging approach is the animated shapes
   paradigm based on so-called Frith-Happ, animations (FHAs) which trigger
   spontaneous mentalizing with minimal cognitive demands. Here, we
   presented FHAs during functional magnetic resonance imaging to 46
   subjects and examined the specificity and sensitivity of the elicited
   social brain responses. Test-retest reliability was additionally
   assessed in 28 subjects within a two-week interval. Specific responses
   to spontaneous mentalizing were observed in key areas of the social
   brain with high sensitivity and independently from the variant low-level
   kinematics of the FHAs. Mentalizing-specific responses were well
   replicable on the group level, suggesting good-to-excellent
   cross-sectional reliability {[}intraclass correlation coefficients
   (ICCs): 0.40-0.99; dice overlap at P-uncorr < 0.001: 0.26-1.0].
   Longitudinal reliability on the single-subject level was more
   heterogeneous (ICCs of 0.40-0.79; dice overlap at P-uncorr < 0.001:
   0.05-0.43). Posterior temporal sulcus activation was most reliable,
   including a robust differentiation between subjects across sessions
   (72\% of voxels with ICC > 0.40). These findings encourage the use of
   FHAs in neuroimaging research across developmental stages and
   psychiatric conditions, including the identification of biomarkers and
   pharmacological interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive worry,
   autonomic dysregulation and functional amygdala dysconnectivity, yet
   these illness markers have rarely been considered together, nor their
   interrelationship tested longitudinally. We hypothesized that an
   individual's capacity for emotion regulation predicts longer-term
   changes in amygdala functional connectivity, supporting the modification
   of GAD core symptoms. Sixteen patients with GAD (14 women) and
   individually matched controls were studied at two time points separated
   by 1 year. Resting-state fMRI data and concurrent measurement of vagally
   mediated heart rate variability were obtained before and after the
   induction of perseverative cognition. A greater rise in levels of worry
   following the induction predicted a stronger reduction in connectivity
   between right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and enhanced
   coupling between left amygdala and ventral tegmental area at follow-up.
   Similarly, amplified physiological responses to the induction predicted
   increased connectivity between right amygdala and thalamus. Longitudinal
   shifts in a distinct set of functional connectivity scores were
   associated with concomitant changes in GAD symptomatology over the
   course of the year. Results highlight the prognostic value of indices of
   emotional dysregulation and emphasize the integral role of the amygdala
   as a critical hub in functional neural circuitry underlying the
   progression of GAD symptomatology.}},

Abstract = {{Being able to infer the thoughts, feelings and intentions of those
   around us is indispensable in order to function in a social world.
   Despite growing interest in social cognition and its neural
   underpinnings, the factors that contribute to successful mental state
   attribution remain unclear. Current knowledge is limited because the
   most widely used tasks suffer from two main constraints: (i) They fail
   to capture individual variability due to ceiling effects and (ii) they
   use highly simplistic, often artificial stimuli inapt to mirror
   real-world socio-cognitive demands. In the present study, we address
   these problems by employing complex depictions of naturalistic social
   interactions that vary in both valence (positive vs negative) and
   ambiguity (high vs low). Thirty-eight healthy participants (20 female)
   made mental state judgments while brain responses were obtained using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Accuracy varied based on
   valence and ambiguity conditions and women were more accurate than men
   with highly ambiguous social stimuli. Activity of the orbitofrontal
   cortex predicted performance in the high ambiguity condition. The
   results shed light on subtle differences in mentalizing abilities and
   associated neural activity.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve our understanding of how pictorial health warning
   labels (HWLs) influence smoking behavior, we examined whether brain
   activity helps to explain smoking behavior above and beyond
   self-reported effectiveness of HWLs. We measured the neural response in
   the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the amygdala while adult
   smokers viewed HWLs. Two weeks later, participants' self-reported
   smoking behavior and biomarkers of smoking behavior were reassessed. We
   compared multiple models predicting change in self-reported smoking
   behavior (cigarettes per day {[}CPD]) and change in a biomarkers of
   smoke exposure (expired carbon monoxide {[}CO]). Brain activity in the
   vmPFC and amygdala not only predicted changes in CO, but also accounted
   for outcome variance above and beyond self-report data. Neural data were
   most useful in predicting behavioral change as quantified by the
   objective biomarker (CO). This pattern of activity was significantly
   modulated by individuals' intention to quit. The finding that both
   cognitive (vmPFC) and affective (amygdala) brain areas contributed to
   these models supports the idea that smokers respond to HWLs in a
   cognitive-affective manner. Based on our findings, researchers may wish
   to consider using neural data from both cognitive and affective networks
   when attempting to predict behavioral change in certain populations
   (e.g. cigarette smokers).}},

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental illness characterized by
   problems with self-perception. Whole-brain neural activations in healthy
   women, women with AN and women in long-term weight recovery following AN
   were compared using two functional magnetic resonance imaging tasks
   probing different aspects of self-perception. The Social Identity-V2
   task involved consideration about oneself and others using socially
   descriptive adjectives. Both the ill and weight-recovered women with AN
   engaged medial prefrontal cortex less than healthy women for
   self-relevant cognitions, a potential biological trait difference.
   Weight-recovered women also activated the inferior frontal gyri and
   dorsal anterior cingulate more for direct self-evaluations than for
   reflected self-evaluations, unlike both other groups, suggesting that
   recovery may include compensatory neural changes related to social
   perspectives. The Faces task compared viewing oneself to a stranger.
   Participants with AN showed elevated activity in the bilateral fusiform
   gyri for self-images, unlike the weight-recovered and healthy women,
   suggesting cognitive distortions about physical appearance are a state
   rather than trait problem in this disease. Because both ill and
   recovered women showed neural differences related to social
   self-perception, but only recovered women differed when considering
   social perspectives, these neurocognitive targets may be particularly
   important for treatment.}},

Abstract = {{A classical model of human attention holds that independent neural
   networks realize stimulus-driven reorienting and executive control of
   attention. Questioning full independence, the two functions do, however,
   engage overlapping networks with activations in cingulo-opercular
   regions such as anterior insula (AI) and a reverse pattern of activation
   (stimulus-driven reorienting), and deactivation (executive control) in
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ). To test for independent versus shared
   neural mechanisms underlying stimulus-driven and executive control of
   attention, we used fMRI and a task that isolates individual from
   concurrent demands in both functions. Results revealed super-additive
   increases of left AI activity and behavioral response costs under
   concurrent demands, suggesting a common bottleneck for stimulus-driven
   reorienting and executive control of attention. These increases were
   mirrored by non-additive decreases of activity in the default mode
   network (DMN), including posterior TPJ, regions where activity increased
   with off-task processes. The deactivations in posterior TPJ were
   spatially separated from stimulus-driven reorienting related activation
   in anterior TPJ, a differentiation that replicated in task-free resting
   state. Furthermore, functional connectivity indicated inhibitory
   coupling between posterior TPJ and AI during concurrent attention
   demands. These results demonstrate a role of AI in stimulus-driven and
   executive control of attention that involves down-regulation of
   internally directed processes in DMN.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of recent convergent evidence indicates that the anterior
   temporal lobe (ATL) has connectivity-derived graded differences in
   semantic function: the ventrolateral region appears to be the
   transmodal, omni-category center-point of the hub whilst secondary
   contributions come from the peripheries of the hub in a manner that
   reflects their differential connectivity to different input/output
   modalities. One of the key challenges for this neurocognitive theory is
   how different types of concept, especially those with less reliance upon
   external sensory experience (such as abstract and social concepts), are
   coded across the graded ATL hub. We were able to answer this key
   question by using distortion-corrected fMRI to detect functional
   activations across the entire ATL region and thus to map the neural
   basis of social and psycholinguistically-matched abstract concepts. Both
   types of concept engaged a core left-hemisphere semantic network,
   including the ventrolateral ATL, prefrontal regions and posterior MTG.
   Additionally, we replicated previous findings of weaker differential
   activation of the superior and polar ATL for the processing of social
   stimuli, in addition to the stronger, omni-category activation observed
   in the vATL. These results are compatible with the view of the ATL as a
   graded transmodal substrate for the representation of coherent concepts.}},

Journal = {{MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging findings in general social anxiety disorder (gSAD)
   have extended our understanding of the neural mechanisms of gSAD beyond
   an amygdala-centric fear-based hyperactivity model to include other
   brain regions and networks relevant to salient cues. In particular,
   higher order areas compromising visual networks that process emotional
   and social information have been implicated. The pulvinar anchors this
   network and is a key regulatory node that mediates complex sensory
   inputs and the integration between limbic and frontal brain systems.
   However, the role of the pulvinar and specifically alteration of its
   effective connectivity with the rest of the brain has not been examined
   in the pathophysiology of gSAD, a disorder characterized by aberrant
   socio-emotional processing. The main aim of this study was to examine
   the pulvinar network effective connectivity in gSAD. In this study, we
   recruited 21 individuals with gSAD and 19 demographically matched
   healthy controls (HC), who performed an emotional face processing task
   while brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI). To examine pulvinar-based network dynamics, Granger
   causality (GC) based effective connectivity (EC) analysis was applied on
   fMRI data to compare gSAD and HC. The EC analysis revealed heightened
   casual influential dynamics between pulvinar in higher order visual and
   frontal regions in gSAD. In conclusion, these preliminary data suggest a
   novel network-based cortico-pulvino-cortical neural mechanism in the
   pathophysiology of gSAD.}},

Abstract = {{This study sought to test whether the neurobiology of self-processing
   differentiated depressed adolescents with high suicidality (HS) from
   those with low suicidality (LS) and healthy controls (HC; N = 119, M-AGE
   = 14.79, SD = 1.64, Min = 11.3, Max = 17.8). Participants completed a
   visual self-recognition task in the scanner during which they identified
   their own or an unfamiliar adolescent face across 3 emotional
   expressions (happy, neutral or sad). A 3-group (HS, LS, HC) by 2
   within-subject factors (2 Self conditions {[}self, other] and 3 Emotions
   {[}happy, neutral, sad]) GLM yielded (a) a main effect of Self condition
   with all participants showing higher activity in the right occipital,
   precuneus and fusiform during the self-versus other-face conditions; (b)
   a main effect of Group where all depressed youth showed higher
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity than HC across all conditions,
   and with HS showing higher cuneus and occipital activity versus both LS
   and HC; and (c) a Group by Self by Emotion interaction with HS showing
   lower activity in both mid parietal, limbic, and prefrontal areas in the
   Happy self versus other-face condition relative to the LS group, who in
   turn had less activity compared to HC youth. Covarying for depression
   severity replicated all results except the third finding; In this
   subsequent analysis, a Group by Self interaction showed that although HC
   had similar midline cortical structure (MCS) activity for all faces, LS
   showed higher MCS activity for the self versus other faces, whereas HS
   showed the opposite pattern. Results suggest that the neurophysiology of
   emotionally charged self-referential information can distinguish
   depressed, suicidal youth versus nonsuicidal depressed and healthy
   adolescents. Neurophysiological differences and implications for the
   prediction of suicidality in youth are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Childhood maltreatment is strongly associated with depression, which is
   characterized by reduced reactivity to reward. Identifying factors that
   mitigate risk for depression in maltreated children is important for
   understanding etiological links between maltreatment and depression as
   well as improving early intervention and prevention. We examine whether
   high reward reactivity at behavioral and neurobiological levels is a
   marker of resilience to depressive symptomology in adolescence following
   childhood maltreatment. A sample of 59 adolescents (21 with a history of
   maltreatment; Mean Age = 16.95 years, SD = 1.44) completed an fMRI task
   involving passive viewing of emotional stimuli. BOLD signal changes to
   positive relative to neutral images were extracted in basal ganglia
   regions of interest. Participants also completed a behavioral
   reward-processing task outside the scanner. Depression symptoms were
   assessed at the time of the MRI and again 2 years later. Greater reward
   reactivity across behavioral and neurobiological measures moderated the
   association of maltreatment with baseline depression. Specifically,
   faster reaction time (RT) to cues paired with monetary reward relative
   to those unpaired with reward and greater BOLD signal in the left
   pallidum was associated with lower depression symptoms in maltreated
   youth. Longitudinally, greater BOLD signal in the left putamen moderated
   change in depression scores over time, such that higher levels of reward
   response were associated with lower increases in depression over time
   among maltreated youths. Reactivity to monetary reward and positive
   social images, at both behavioral and neurobiological levels, is a
   potential marker of resilience to depression among adolescents exposed
   to maltreatment. These findings add to a growing body of work
   highlighting individual differences in reactivity to reward as a core
   neurodevelopmental mechanism in the etiology of depression.}},

Abstract = {{Abnormalities in both time processing and dopamine (DA)
   neurotransmission have been observed in schizophrenia. Time processing
   seems to be linked to DA neurotransmission. The cognitive dysmetria
   hypothesis postulates that psychosis might be a manifestation of the
   loss of coordination of mental processes due to impaired timing. The
   objective of the present study was to analyze timing abilities and their
   corresponding functional neuroanatomy in schizophrenia. We performed a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study using a predictive
   motor timing paradigm in 28 schizophrenia patients and 27 matched
   healthy controls (HC). The schizophrenia patients showed accelerated
   time processing compared to HC; the amount of the acceleration
   positively correlated with the degree of positive psychotic symptoms and
   negatively correlated with antipsychotic dose. This dysfunctional
   predictive timing was associated with BOLD signal activity alterations
   in several brain networks, especially those previously described as
   timing networks (basal ganglia, cerebellum, SMA, and insula) and reward
   networks (hippocampus, amygdala, and NAcc). BOLD signal activity in the
   cerebellar vermis was negatively associated with accelerated time
   processing. Several lines of evidence suggest a direct link between DA
   transmission and the cerebellar vermis that could explain their
   relevance for the neurobiology of schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionObserving someone else perform a movement facilitates motor
   planning, execution, and motor memory formation. Rate, an important
   feature in the execution of repeated movements, has been shown to vary
   following movement observation although the underlying neural mechanisms
   are unclear. In the current study, we examined how the rate of
   self-paced index finger pressing is implicitly modified following
   passive observation of a similar action performed at a different rate.
   MethodsFifty subjects performed a finger pressing sequence with their
   right hand at their own pace before and after passive observation of
   either a 1-min video depicting the task performed at 3Hz by someone else
   or a black screen. An additional set of 15 subjects performed the task
   in an MRI scanner.
   ResultsAcross all 50 subjects, the spontaneous execution rate prior to
   video observation had a bimodal distribution with modes around 2 and
   4Hz. Following video observation, the slower subjects performed the task
   at an increased rate. In the 15 subjects who performed the task in the
   MRI scanner, we found positive correlation between fMRI signal in the
   left primary motor strip during passive video observation and subsequent
   behavioral changes in task performance rate.
   ConclusionWe conclude that observing someone else perform an action at a
   higher rate implicitly increases the spontaneous rate of execution, and
   that this implicit induction is mediated by activity in the
   contralateral primary motor cortex.}},

Title = {{Neurocognitive Effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in
   Arithmetic Learning and Performance: A Simultaneous tDCS-fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{850-858}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: A small but increasing number of studies suggest that
   non-invasive brain stimulation by means of transcranial direct current
   stimulation (tDCS) can modulate arithmetic processes that are essential
   for higher-order mathematical skills and that are impaired in
   dyscalculic individuals. However, little is known about the neural
   mechanisms underlying such stimulation effects, and whether they are
   specific to cognitive processes involved in different arithmetic tasks.
   Methods: We addressed these questions by applying tDCS during
   simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (IMRI) while
   participants were solving two types of complex subtraction problems:
   repeated problems, relying on arithmetic fact learning and
   problem-solving by fact retrieval, and novel problems, requiring
   calculation procedures. Twenty participants receiving left parietal
   anodal plus right frontal cathodal stimulation were compared with 20
   participants in a sham condition.
   Results: We found a strong cognitive and neural dissociation between
   repeated and novel problems. Repeated problems were solved more
   accurately and elicited increased activity in the bilateral angular gyri
   and medial plus lateral prefrontal cortices. Solving novel problems, in
   contrast, was accompanied by stronger activation in the bilateral
   intraparietal sulci and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. Most
   importantly, tDCS decreased the activation of the right inferior frontal
   cortex while solving novel (compared to repeated) problems, suggesting
   that the cathodal stimulation rendered this region unable to respond to
   the task-specific cognitive demand.
   Conclusions: The present study revealed that tDCS during arithmetic
   problem-solving can modulate the neural activity in proximity to the
   electrodes specifically when the current demands lead to an engagement
   of this area. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To explore the specifificity of Tongli (HT 5) and Xuanzhong (GB 39)
   paired acupionts in aspects of Deqi sensation and brain activation
   patterns during electroacupuncture.
   In this study, 15 healthy subjects were enrolled. All participants
   suffered two kinds of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   examinations randomly: Examination A received electro-acupuncture (EA)
   at the bilateral Tongli (HT5) and Xuanzhong (GB 39) acupoints (ACU), and
   examination B received EA at bilateral non-acupoints (NAP). The subjects
   reported the feeling of Deqi at each examination later respectively. A
   multi-voxel pattern analysis method and Statistical Program for Social
   Sciences were used to analyze the data.
   The ACU group (Exam A) reported fullness, heaviness, numbness, soreness
   and throbbing of signifificantly greater intensity than the NAP group
   (Exam B). In addition, there was no statistical signifificance between
   two groups in aching, tingling, deep pressure, sharp pain, dull pain,
   warmness and cold. Meanwhile, fMRI data revealed differences between two
   groups in discriminating accuracy of brain somatosensory cortex and
   language-related cortices.
   Needling HT 5 and GB 39 may modulate language function through a complex
   brain network, suggesting that it may be benefificial to the recovery of
   language function in patients with aphasia.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundExtreme shyness in childhood arising from behavioral
   inhibition (BI) is among the strongest risk factors for developing
   social anxiety. Although no imaging studies of intrinsic brain networks
   in children with BI have been reported, adults with a history of BI
   exhibit altered functioning of frontolimbic circuits and enhanced
   processing of salient, personally relevant information. BI in childhood
   may be marked by increased coupling of salience (insula) and default
   (ventromedial prefrontal cortex {[}vmPFC]) network hubs.
   MethodsWe tested this potential relation in 42 children ages 9-12,
   oversampled for high BI. Participants provided resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. A novel topographical pattern analysis of
   salience network intrinsic functional connectivity was conducted, and
   the impact of salience-default coupling on the relation between BI and
   social anxiety symptoms was assessed via moderation analysis.
   ResultsChildren with high BI exhibit altered salience network
   topography, marked by reduced insula connectivity to dorsal anterior
   cingulate and increased insula connectivity to vmPFC. Whole-brain
   analyses revealed increased connectivity of salience, executive, and
   sensory networks with default network hubs in children higher in BI.
   Finally, the relation between insula-ventromedial prefrontal
   connectivity and social anxiety symptoms was strongest among the
   children highest in BI.
   ConclusionsBI is associated with an increase in connectivity to default
   network hubs that may bias processing toward personally relevant
   information during development. These altered patterns of connectivity
   point to potential biomarkers of the neural profile of risk for anxiety
   in childhood.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is likely to become the
   major tool for studying the neural underpinnings of organizational
   behavior. It is a technique for brain imaging that, according to
   advocates, provides information about which areas of the brain are
   activated during organizational processes (e.g., leadership and
   decision-making). In this article, we take a critical look at this tool
   from a technical perspective. In particular, we take the reader through
   the assumptions that must be made at the three main steps of the
   research process (study design, data capture, and interpretation of
   results) in order to draw conclusions about organizational phenomena
   from fMRI research. Applying this analysis to three case studies
   demonstrates the gap between what fMRI can actually tell us and the
   claims often made about the contribution of fMRI to understanding and
   improving organizational behavior. Our discussion provides researchers
   with a series of recommendations oriented toward optimizing the use of
   fMRI to help it live up to its potential in the field of organizational
   behavior and consumers with a means of evaluating fMRI research in order
   to draw appropriate and warranted conclusions. Copyright (c) 2016 John

Abstract = {{Behavioral studies found greater pain sensitivity in females that
   vanishes fully or partially when controlling for the emotional state.
   Furthermore, pain-related brain activation hints at the role of limbic
   structures in sex differences in pain processing. We aimed to
   investigate the role of pain-related limbic structures in mediating the
   relation between subjects' affective state (i.e., anxiety) and pain.
   Contact heat-evoked potentials (CHEPs) were recorded in 26 healthy
   subjects (13 males) simultaneously with innocuous (42 A degrees C)
   baseline and target noxious (52 A degrees C) series of stimuli
   administered to the left non-dominant volar forearm. The N2 and P2
   components were analyzed, and their generators' activity was estimated
   using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography.
   Thereafter, structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied separately
   for females and males, examining the mediatory role of the CHEPs' limbic
   structures generators {[}posterior midcingulate cortex (pMCC), insula,
   amygdala, and hippocampus] in the anxiety-pain sensitivity association.
   Females exhibited greater P2 amplitudes that were highly associated with
   larger pMCC activity (r = 0.910, p < 0.001). This correlation was also
   evident in males, though with less strength (r = 0.578, p = 0.039).
   Moreover, the P2 amplitudes were associated both in females (r = 0.645,
   p = 0.017) and males (r = 0.608, p = 0.028) with the activity of the
   amygdala\textbackslash{}hippocampus\textbackslash{}insula. SEM revealed
   that the relationship between state anxiety and pain ratings was only in
   females fully mediated via the effect of the pMCC on the P2 amplitude.
   These findings suggest that sexual dimorphism in anxiety-related brain
   activity may explain the differences found in CHEPs and the sex-related
   association between anxiety and pain.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescents are commonly portrayed as highly emotional, with their
   behaviors often hijacked by their emotions. Research on the neural
   substrates of adolescent affective behavior is beginning to paint a more
   nuanced picture of how neurodevelopmental changes in brain function
   influence affective behavior, and how these influences are modulated by
   external factors in the environment. Recent neurodevelopmental models
   suggest that the brain is designed to promote emotion regulation,
   learning, and affiliation across development, and that affective
   behavior reciprocally interacts with age-specific social demands and
   different social contexts. In this review, we discuss current findings
   on neurobiological mechanisms of adolescents' affective behavior and
   highlight individual differences in and social-contextual influences on
   adolescents' emotionality. Neurobiological mechanisms of affective
   processes related to anxiety and depression are also discussed as
   examples. As the field progresses, it will be critical to test new
   hypotheses generated from the foundational empirical and conceptual work
   and to focus on identifying more precisely how and when neural networks
   change in ways that promote or thwart adaptive affective behavior during
   adolescence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Acute cortisol reactivity attenuates engagement of fronto-parietal and

Journal = {{PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{67-78}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Depression and bipolar disorder (negative mood disorders,
   NMD) are associated with dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   (HPA)-axis function and disrupted emotion processing. The neural
   networks involved in attenuation of HPA-axis reactivity overlap with the
   circuitry involved in perception and modulation of emotion; however,
   direct links between these systems are understudied. This study
   investigated whether cortisol activity prior to undergoing fMRI was
   related to neural processing of emotional information in participants
   with NMD.
   Methods: Forty-one adults (M-age =40.33, SD = 15.57) with major
   depression (n = 29) or bipolar disorder (n = 12) and 23 healthy control
   comparisons (M-age = 36.43, SD = 17.33) provided salivary cortisol
   samples prior to completing a facial emotion perception test during
   3-Tesla fMRI.
   Results: Overall, pre-scan cortisol level was positively associated with
   greater engagement of the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC), inferior
   parietal lobule, insula, putamen, precuneus, middle and medial frontal
   and postcentral gyri, posterior cingulate, and inferior temporal gyrus
   during emotion processing of all faces. NMD status moderated this
   effect; in NMD participants' pre-scan cortisol was associated with
   attenuated activation of the insula, postcentral gyrus, precuneus, and
   putamen for fearful faces and the medial frontal gyrus for angry faces
   relative to HCs. Cortisol-related attenuation of activation among NMD
   participants was also observed for facial identification in the dACC,
   putamen, middle temporal gyrus, precuneus, and caudate.
   Conclusions: Across all participants, cortisol was associated with
   greater activation in several regions involved in the perception and
   control of emotion. However, cortisol responsivity was associated with
   hypoactivation of several of these regions in the NMD group, suggesting
   that HPA-axis activity may selectively interfere with the potentially
   adaptive recruitment of circuits supporting emotion perception,
   processing and/or regulation in mood disorders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Blockade of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor I (CRFI) suppresses
   stress-induced alcohol seeking in rodents, but clinical translation
   remains. Here, we first showed that the CRFI antagonist verucerfont
   potently blocks hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activation in
   adrenalectomized rats. We then evaluated verucerfont for its ability to
   block HPA axis activation and reduce stress-induced alcohol craving in
   alcohol-dependent patients. Anxious, alcohol-dependent women (age 21-65
   years, n = 39) were admitted to the NIH Clinical Center and completed
   withdrawal treatment before enrollment if needed. One-week single-blind
   placebo was followed by randomized double-blind verucerfont (350 mg per
   day) or placebo for 3 weeks. Verucerfont effects on the HPA axis were
   evaluated using the dexamethasone-CRF test Craving was evaluated using
   two established protocols, one that combines a social stressor with
   physical alcohol cue exposure, and one that uses guided imagery to
   present personalized stress, alcohol, or neutral stimuli. An fMRI
   session examined brain responses to negative affective stimuli and
   alcohol cues. In contrast to our recent observations with another CRFI
   antagonist, pexacerfont, verucerfont potently blocked the HPA axis
   response to the dexamethasone-CRF test, but left alcohol craving
   unaffected. Right amygdala responses to negative affective stimuli were
   significantly attenuated by verucerfont, but responses to
   alcohol-associated stimuli were increased in some brain regions,
   including left insula. Discontinuation rates were significantly higher
   in the verucerfont group. Our findings provide the first translational

Abstract = {{The neural substrates of pediatric posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
   remain incompletely understood, but likely involve abnormal function and
   development of emotion processing circuitry. Valence-specific and
   age-related abnormalities during emotion processing have not been
   elucidated. We examined implicit emotional face processing in pediatric
   PTSD, predicting abnormalities specific to threat-related emotion. Youth
   (ages 8-18 years) with PTSD (n = 25) and healthy youth (n = 28)
   completed a dynamic emotional face task during fMRI, viewing faces
   changing from neutral to angry or happy, or changing shape control.
   Group and cross-sectional age-related differences in activation and
   functional connectivity were examined in amygdala/hippocampus, medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and whole-brain analyses. The post hoc
   analyses examined the relationship of neural abnormalities with symptom
   measures of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Compared with decreased
   activation with age in healthy youth, PTSD youth showed increased
   amygdala activation to emotional faces with age. In a group by emotion
   interaction, PTSD youth showed dorsal (d)ACC hyperactivation to happy
   faces relative to healthy youth, with no difference for angry faces.
   Connectivity analyses revealed paradoxical coupling in prefrontal
   amygdala circuits, including dACC-dorsomedial (dm)PFC, amygdala-dmPFC,
   and amygdala ventrolateral (vl)PFC. In each case, PTSD youth showed
   reduced connectivity to angry faces, but increased connectivity to happy
   faces, the reverse of healthy youth. Valence-abnormal recruitment was
   associated with greater symptom severity, implicating a role in
   trauma-related psychopathology in youth. Notably, impaired recruitment
   during angry faces and heightened recruitment to happy faces may reflect
   increased salience and ambiguity of positive emotional expressions in
   pediatric PTSD. Finally, age-related findings suggest a developmental
   sensitization of the amygdala across emotional expressions in youth with
   PTSD. These findings provide novel insights into the underlying
   pathophysiology of pediatric PTSD, extending beyond abnormal neural
   responses to canonical threat.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{204}},
Pages = {{9-15}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: The current study sought to determine the relationship
   between self-reported dimensions of affect and activation in brain
   regions associated with emotion regulation in PTSD during a task of non
   conscious emotional processing in interpersonal trauma survivors with
   PTSD and healthy controls.
   Methods: Participants included 52 women diagnosed with PTSD and 18
   female healthy controls. All participants completed a clinical
   assessment including the SCID, CAPS, and PANAS followed by a functional
   MRI assessment including a task of implicit emotional conflict.
   Results: When PTSD participants were oriented to fearful faces, negative
   affect (NA) was inversely related to activation in the left amygdala and
   positive affect (PA) was inversely related to activation in the right
   amygdala. When ignoring fearful faces, NA was positively associated with
   activation in the right parahippocampal gyrus and PA was inversely
   related to activation in the left hippocampus. Similar results were
   observed in healthy controls regarding PA. However, NA was not
   significantly related to any region of interest in healthy controls.
   Limitations: Limitations include the homogeneity of the healthy controls
   with regard to racial diversity, results may only be specific to female
   interpersonal trauma survivors with PTSD, and neutral faces within the
   conflict task may be perceived as negative by clinical samples.
   Conclusions: Persistent, increased NA may represent a proxy for
   disruptions in emotional processing in interpersonal trauma survivors
   with PTSD. As such, clinicians may prioritize increasing emotional
   awareness through emotion regulation and/or distress tolerance
   strategies in this population. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{141}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The ability to predict when an event will occur allows us to respond
   optimally to that event. Temporal predictability can be either fixed
   (prior probability) or evolving (posterior probability), in which case
   it is dynamically updated as a function of the elapse of time itself
   ({''}hazard function{''}). We used fMRI to identify the brain regions
   involved in either form of temporal prediction, within a single
   experimental paradigm. Participants performed a cued reaction time (RT)
   task, in which the target appeared after one of four intervals
   ({''}foreperiods{''}) that was either predictable (temporal condition)
   or variable (neutral condition). As expected, RTs were faster in
   temporal versus neutral conditions, indicating the behavioural benefit
   of fixed temporal predictability. RTs also got faster as a function of
   foreperiod in the neutral, but not temporal, condition, reflecting the
   evolving temporal predictability of the hazard function. We confirmed
   that left inferior parietal cortex was preferentially activated by the
   fixed temporal predictability of temporal (versus neutral) cues. Then,
   by directly comparing how activity varied as a function of foreperiod in
   the neutral versus time conditions, we identified the neural substrates
   of the changes in temporal probability defined by the hazard function,
   while simultaneously controlling for changes related simply to the
   elapse of time itself. Whole-brain fMRI analyses (independently
   confirmed by anatomically guided ROI analyses) showed that activity in
   left inferior parietal cortex tracked the evolving temporal
   probabilities of the hazard function. ROI analysis further revealed a
   similar role for right inferior frontal cortex. Our data highlight a key
   role for left parietal cortex in instantiating the behavioural benefits
   of temporal predictability, whether predictions are fixed or dynamically
   evolving. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Facing mixed emotions: Analytic and holistic perception of facial
   emotion expressions engages separate brain networks}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{141}},
Pages = {{154-173}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The ability to decode facial emotions is of primary importance for human
   social interactions; yet, it is still debated how we analyze faces to
   determine their expression. Here we compared the processing of emotional
   face expressions through holistic integration and/or local analysis of
   visual features, and determined which brain systems mediate these
   distinct processes.
   Behavioral, physiological, and brain responses to happy and angry faces
   were assessed by presenting congruent global configurations of
   expressions (e.g., happy top + happy bottom), incongruent composite
   configurations (e.g., angry top + happy bottom), and isolated features
   (e.g. happy top only). Top and bottom parts were always from the same
   individual. Twenty-six healthy volunteers were scanned using fMRI while
   they classified the expression in either the top or the bottom face part
   but ignored information in the other non-target part.
   Results indicate that the recognition of happy and anger expressions is
   neither strictly holistic nor analytic Both routes were involved, but
   with a different role for analytic and holistic information depending on
   the emotion type, and different weights of local features between happy
   and anger expressions. Dissociable neural pathways were engaged
   depending on emotional face configurations. In particular, regions
   within the face processing network differed in their sensitivity to
   holistic expression information, which predominantly activated fusiform,
   inferior occipital areas and amygdala when internal features were
   congruent (i.e. template matching), whereas more local analysis of
   independent features preferentially engaged STS and prefrontal areas
   (IFG/OFC) in the context of full face configurations, but early visual
   areas and pulvinar when seen in isolated parts. Collectively, these
   findings suggest that facial emotion recognition recruits separate, but
   interactive dorsal and ventral routes within the face processing
   networks, whose engagement may be shaped by reciprocal interactions and
   modulated by task demands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{How does our brain allow us comprehend abstract/symbolic descriptions of
   human action? Whereas past research suggested that processing action
   language relies on sensorimotor brain regions, recent work suggests that
   sensorimotor activation depends on participants' task goals, such that
   focusing on abstract (vs. concrete) aspects of an action activates
   ``default mode network{''} (rather than sensorimotor) regions. Following
   a Piagetian framework, we hypothesized that for actions acquired at an
   age wherein abstract/symbolic cognition is fully-developed, even when
   participants focus on the concrete aspects of an action, they should
   retrieve abstract-symbolic mental representations. In two studies,
   participants processed the concrete (i.e., ``how{''}) and abstract
   (i.e., ``why{''}) aspects of late-acquired and early-acquired actions.
   Consistent with previous research, focusing on the abstract (vs.
   concrete) aspects of an action resulted in greater activation in the
   ``defaultmode network{''}. Importantly, the activation in these regions
   was higher when processing later-acquired (vs. earlier acquired)
   actions-also when participants' goal was to focus on the concrete
   aspects of the action. We discuss the implications of the current
   findings to research on the involvement of concrete representations in
   abstract cognition. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   in Humor Appreciation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 28}},
Abstract = {{Hostile jokes (HJs) provide aggressive catharsis and a feeling of
   superiority. Behavioral research has found that HJs are perceived as
   funnier than non-hostile jokes (NJs). The purpose of the present study
   was to identify the neural correlates of the interaction between type
   and humor by comparing HJs. NJs, and their corresponding hostile
   sentences (HSs) and non-hostile sentences (NSs). HJs primarily showed
   activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and midbrain
   compared with the corresponding hostile baseline. Conversely. NJs
   primarily revealed activation in the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), amygdala,
   midbrain, ventral anterior cingulate cortex, and nucleus accumbens
   (NAcc) compared with the corresponding non-hostile baseline. These
   results support the critical role of the medial PFC (mPFC) for the
   neural correlates of social cognition and socio-emotional processing in
   response to different types of jokes. Moreover, the processing of HJs
   showed increased activation in the dmPFC, which suggested cognitive
   operations of social motivation, whereas the processing of NJs displayed
   increased activation in the vmPFC, which suggested social-affective
   engagement. HJs versus NJs primarily showed increased activation in the
   dmPFC and midbrain, whereas NJs versus HJs primarily displayed greater
   activation in the amygdala and midbrain. The psychophysiological
   interaction (PPI) analysis demonstrated functional coupling of the
   dmPFC-dIPFC and midbrain-dmPFC for HJs and functional coupling of the
   vmPFC- midbrain and amygdala-midbrain-NAcc for NJs. Surprisingly, HJs
   were not perceived as funnier than NJs. Future studies could further
   investigate the neural correlates of potentially important traits of
   high-hostility tendencies in humor appreciation based on the
   psychoanalytic and superiority theories of humor.}},

Title = {{Different Neural Mechanisms for the Comparison and Priming Distance
   Effects: An fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study examined
   whether the comparison distance effect (CDE) and the priming distance
   effect (PDE) in number processing had the same underlying neural
   mechanisms. 24 healthy participants completed a number comparison task
   and a number priming task in the scanner. Imaging data were examined for
   brain regions selected based on a meta-analysis of previous studies of
   number processing. Results revealed robust CDE and PDE at both
   behavioral and neural levels. The CDE had a significant hemodynamic
   signature in the right parietal cortex but not in the left parietal
   cortex, although a direct test of this hemispheric laterality did not
   reach statistical significance. In contrast, the PDE showed significant
   left-hemisphere laterality with a significant hemodynamic signature in
   the left parietal cortex but not in the right parietal cortex. These
   results suggested that the CDE and PDE had different underlying neural
   mechanisms.}},
