Abstract = {{Attributing mind to interaction partners has been shown to increase the
   social relevance we ascribe to others' actions and to modulate the
   amount of attention dedicated to them. However, it remains unclear how
   the relationship between higher-order mind attribution and lower-level
   attention processes is established in the brain. In this neuroimaging
   study, participants saw images of an anthropomorphic robot that moved
   its eyes left- or rightwards to signal the appearance of an upcoming
   stimulus in the same (valid cue) or opposite location (invalid cue).
   Independently, participants' beliefs about the intentionality underlying
   the observed eye movements were manipulated by describing the eye
   movements as under human control or preprogrammed. As expected, we
   observed a validity effect behaviorally and neurologically (increased
   response times and activation in the invalid vs. valid condition). More
   importantly, we observed that this effect was more pronounced for the
   condition in which the robot's behavior was believed to be controlled by
   a human, as opposed to be preprogrammed. This interaction effect between
   cue validity and belief was, however, only found at the neural level and
   was manifested as a significant increase of activation in bilateral
   anterior temporoparietal junction.}},

Abstract = {{The present study (N=55) used an event-related potential paradigm to

   enhanced central-parietal late positive potential (LPP) (400-800ms
   post-stimulus) responses to affective stimuli when instructed to do so,
   whereas East Asians (N=26) did not. We observed cultural differences in
   the ability to enhance central-parietal LPP responses for both
   positively and negativelyvalenced stimuli, and the ability to enhance
   these two types of responses was positively correlated for Americans but
   negatively for East Asians. These results are consistent with the notion
   that cultural variations in norms and values regarding affective
   expression and experiences shape how the brain regulates emotions.}},

Abstract = {{The oxytocin system plays a prominent role in social behavior across
   species, and numerous genetic studies in humans have reported
   associations between polymorphisms on the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene
   and phenotypes related to social cognition, affiliation, perspective
   taking, and sociability in healthy subjects and in patients with
   atypical social behavior, such as in autism spectrum disorders (ASD).
   Recently, the first study demonstrating altered agonist-induced OXTR
   internalization and recycling for the exonic variant rs35062132 emerged.
   Beside this, there has been no further demonstration of the
   functionality of the OXTR variants especially there does not exist any
   for the regulatory units. To address this gap in the literature, we
   tested the functionality of the promoter flanking single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) rs2268498, which has proven an interesting candidate
   for predicting social behavior in recent association studies. Results of
   genetic expression analyses in human hippocampal tissue showed a twofold
   difference in messenger RNA transcription, dependent on the presence or
   absence of the C-allele. This finding was corroborated by cloning, i.e.,
   in vitro reporter gene expression analysis after transfection of OXTR
   promoter plasmids into HEK-293 cells. Our results underline the
   importance of OXTR rs2268498 for genetic research in social behavior and

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{361-365}},
Abstract = {{Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a perceptual condition in
   which specific visual and auditory stimuli consistently trigger tingling
   sensations on the scalp and neck, sometimes spreading to the back and
   limbs. These triggering stimuli are often social, almost intimate, in
   nature (e.g., hearing whispering, or watching someone brush her hair),
   and often elicit a calm and positive emotional state. Surprisingly,
   despite its prevalence in the general population, no published study has
   examined the neural underpinnings of ASMR. In the current study, the
   default mode network (DMN) of 11 individuals with ASMR was contrasted to
   that of 11 matched controls. The results indicated that the DMN of
   individuals with ASMR showed significantly less functional connectivity
   than that of controls. The DMN of individuals with ASMR also
   demonstrated increased connectivity between regions in the occipital,
   frontal, and temporal cortices, suggesting that ASMR was associated with
   a blending of multiple resting-state networks. This atypical functional
   connectivity likely influences the unique sensory-emotional experiences
   associated with ASMR.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{366-378}},
Abstract = {{It is not uncommon for people to openly admit to pirating information
   from the internet despite the known legal consequences. Those same
   people are often less inclined to steal the same physical item from a
   shop. This raises the question, why do people have fewer reservations
   with stealing intangible items compared to tangible? Using
   questionnaires and fMRI we provide evidence across three studies as to
   the differences between tangible and intangible theft. In a
   questionnaire (Study 1), participants revealed that across different
   conditions they were more willing to steal intangible compared to
   tangible goods. Study 2a used fMRI to reveal that a network involved in
   imagining objects was more active when participants were representing
   intangible versus tangible objects, suggesting people have greater
   difficulty representing intangible items. Study 2b used fMRI to show
   that when stealing tangible objects versus intangible, participants had
   increased activation in left lateral orbitofrontal cortex, an area
   typically activated in response to morally laden situations. The
   findings from the current investigation provide novel insights into the
   higher prevalence of intangible theft and suggest that differential
   neural representation of tangible and intangible items may, in part,
   explain why people are more willing to steal intangible items.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{379-385}},
Abstract = {{Criminal offenders (CO) are characterized by antisocial and impulsive
   lifestyles and reduced empathy competence. According to Zaki and
   Ochsner, empathy is a process that can be divided into three components:
   mentalizing, emotional sharing and prosocial concern. The aim of our
   study was to evaluate these competences in 74 criminal subjects compared
   to 65 controls.The CO group demonstrated a lower ability in measures of
   mentalizing and sharing, especially in recognizing the mental and
   emotional states of other people by observing their eyes and sharing
   other people's emotions. Conversely, CO subjects showed better abilities
   in prosocial concern measures, such as judging and predicting the
   emotions and behavior of other people, but they were not able to
   evaluate the gravity of violations of social rules as well as the
   control group.In addition, logistic regression results show that the
   higher the deficits in the mentalizing component are, the higher the
   probability of committing a crime against another person. Taken
   together, our results suggest that criminal subjects are able to judge
   and recognize other people's behavior as right or wrong in a social
   context, but they are not able to recognize and share the suffering of
   other people.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{386-390}},
Abstract = {{Empathic concern has traditionally been conceived of as a spontaneous
   reaction to others experiencing pain or distress. As such, the potential
   role of more deliberate control over empathic responses has frequently
   been overlooked. The present fMRI study evaluated the role of such
   deliberate control in empathic concern by examining the extent to which
   a sample of offenders recruited through probation/parole could
   voluntarily modulate their neural activity to another person in pain.
   Offenders were asked to either passively view pictures of other people
   in painful or non-painful situations, or to actively modulate their
   level of concern for the person in pain. During passive viewing of
   painful versus non-painful pictures, offenders showed minimal neural
   activity in regions previously linked to empathy for pain (e.g., dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula). However, when
   instructed to try to increase their concern for the person in pain,
   offenders demonstrated significant increases within these regions. These
   findings are consistent with recent theories of empathy as motivational
   in nature, and suggest that limitations in empathic concern may include
   a motivational component.}},

Abstract = {{This study tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the
   activity of the orbitofrontal cortex, a region implicated in value-based
   decision-making, are associated with the preference for a person with a
   partner, which could lead to mate poaching. During functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI), male participants were presented with facial
   photographs of (a) attractive females with a partner, (b) attractive
   females without a partner, (c) unattractive females with a partner, and
   (d) unattractive females without a partner. The participants were asked
   to rate the degree to which they desired a romantic relationship with
   each female using an 8-point scale. The participants rated attractive
   females higher than unattractive females, and this effect was associated
   with ventral striatum activation. The participants also indicated lower
   ratings for females with a partner than for females without a partner,
   and this effect was associated with parietal cortex activation. As
   predicted, the participants characterized by higher orbitofrontal
   activity demonstrated a greater willingness to engage in a romantic

Pages = {{400-408}},
Abstract = {{Self-report evidence suggests that consumers prefer green products
   (i.e., pro-environmental) to standard products, but this is not
   reflected in purchase behaviors. To understand this disconnect, we
   exposed participants in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to
   green and standard ads. After viewing each ad, participants rated liking
   and perceived sustainability. Ratings were more favorable for green ads
   than for control ads, but the functional MRI data suggested an opposite
   patternparticipants showed greater activation in regions associated with
   personal value and reward (ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral
   striatum) in response to control ads relative to green ads. In addition,
   participants showed greater activity in these regions to the extent that
   they reported liking control ads, but there was no such trend for green
   ads. In line with a neuroeconomic account, we suggest that activity in
   these regions may be indexing a value signal computed during message
   exposure that may influence downstream purchase decisions, in contrast
   to self-reported evaluations that may reflect social desirability
   concerns absent at the point of purchase.}},

Abstract = {{The personal/impersonal distinction of moral decision-making postulates
   intuitive emotional responses from medial frontal activity and rational
   evaluation from lateral frontal activity. This model can be analyzed in
   behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a disorder
   characterized by impaired emotional intuitions, ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC) involvement, and relative sparing of lateral frontal
   regions. Moral dilemmas were presented to 10 bvFTD, 11 Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), and 9 healthy control (HC) participants while recording
   skin conductance responses, a measure of emotional arousal. We evaluated
   their personal versus impersonal conflict, subjective discomfort, and
   adherence to social norms. Replicating prior work, bvFTD participants
   were more willing to harm in the personal, but not the impersonal,
   dilemma compared to AD and HC groups. BvFTD participants had lower
   arousal and less of an increase in conflict on the personal versus the
   impersonal dilemma, in contrast to increased arousal and conflict for
   the AD and HC groups. Furthermore, bvFTD participants verbalized less
   discomfort, a correlate of low adherence to social norms. These findings
   support impaired emotional reactions to moral dilemmas in bvFTD and
   vmPFC lesions and the personal/impersonal model. It suggests a reversion
   to utilitarian-like considerations when emotional intuition is impaired
   in the brain.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{419-429}},
Abstract = {{Although goal pursuit is related to both functioning of the brain's
   reward circuits and psychological factors, the literatures surrounding
   these concepts have often been separate. Here, we use the psychological
   construct of regulatory focus to investigate individual differences in
   neural response to reward. Regulatory focus theory proposes two
   motivational orientations for personal goal pursuit: (1) promotion,
   associated with sensitivity to potential gain, and (2) prevention,
   associated with sensitivity to potential loss. The monetary incentive
   delay task was used to manipulate reward circuit function, along with
   instructional framing corresponding to promotion and prevention in a
   within-subject design. We observed that the more promotion oriented an
   individual was, the lower their ventral striatum response to gain cues.
   Follow-up analyses revealed that greater promotion orientation was
   associated with decreased ventral striatum response even to no-value
   cues, suggesting that promotion orientation may be associated with
   relatively hypoactive reward system function. The findings are also
   likely to represent an interaction between the cognitive and
   motivational characteristics of the promotion system with the task
   demands. Prevention orientation did not correlate with ventral striatum
   response to gain cues, supporting the discriminant validity of
   regulatory focus theory. The results highlight a dynamic association
   between individual differences in self-regulation and reward system
   function.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{448-457}},
Abstract = {{Observers of sports can reliably estimate who is leading or trailing
   based on nonverbal cues. Most likely, this is due to an adaptive
   mechanism of detecting motivationally relevant signals such as high
   status, superiority, and dominance. We reasoned that the relevance of
   leading athletes should lead to a sustained attentional prioritization.
   To test this idea, we recorded electroencephalography while 45
   participants saw brief stills of athletes and estimated whether they
   were leading or trailing. Based on these recordings, we assessed
   event-related potentials and focused on the late positive complex (LPC),
   a well-established signature of controlled attention to motivationally
   relevant visual stimuli. Confirming our expectation, we found that LPC
   amplitude was significantly enhanced for leading as compared to trailing
   athletes. Moreover, this modulation was significantly related to
   behavioral performance on the score-estimation task. The present data
   suggest that subtle cues related to athletic supremacy are reliably
   differentiated in the human brain, involving a strong attentional
   orienting toward leading athletes. This mechanism might be part of an
   adaptive cognitive strategy that guides human social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of prior exposure to disgusting imagery and the conscious

   was enhanced for disgusted over neutral expressions. Prior disgust
   exposure modulated the middle phase of the LPP in response to disgusted
   but not neutral expressions, but only when the emotion of the face was
   explicitly evaluated. The late LPP was enhanced independently of stimuli

Abstract = {{Perceivers rapidly process social category information and form
   stereotypic impressions of unfamiliar others. However, a goal to
   individuate a target or to accurately predict their behavior can result
   in individuated impressions. It is unknown how the combination of both
   accuracy and individuation goals affects perceptual category processing.
   To explore this, participants were given both the goal to individuate
   targets and accurately predict behavior. We then recorded event-related
   brain potentials while participants viewed photos of black and white
   males along with four pieces of individuating information in the form of
   descriptions of past behavior. Even with explicit individuation and
   accuracy task goals, participants rapidly differentiated targets by race
   within 200ms. Importantly, this rapid categorical processing did not
   influence behavioral outcomes as participants made individuated
   predictions. These findings indicate that individuals engage in category
   processing even when provided with individuation and accuracy goals, but
   that this processing does not necessarily result in category-based

Abstract = {{Human beings process perceptual and affective information of racial
   out-groups in a degraded manner. Relative to racial in-group members, we
   lack perceptual individuation of racial out-group members and empathize
   their pain to a less degree. To date, however, the relationship between
   the deficiency of individuation and the impairment of empathy in
   responding to racial out-groups remains elusive. By recording
   event-related brain potentials in response to racial in-group and
   out-group faces portraying pain and neutral expressions, we
   simultaneously measured neural activity that underpinned individuation
   and empathy. Deficiency in individuating members of racial out-groups,
   manifesting as reduced reactivity of face-sensitive N170 in the
   occipitotemporal region of the brain, predicted attenuation of
   fronto-central empathic response to the suffering of racial out-groups.
   Further, the individuation bias mediated the influence of racial
   prejudice on racial in-group bias in empathic neural responses. These
   findings suggest an interplay between degraded perceptual and affective

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is thought to play a key role
   in the cognitive control of emotion and has therefore, unsurprisingly,
   been implicated in the regulation of physical pain perception. This
   brain region may also influence the experience of social pain, which has
   been shown to activate similar neural networks as seen in response to
   physical pain. Here, we applied sham or active low-frequency (1 Hz)
   repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the left DLPFC,
   previously shown to exert bilateral effects in pain perception, in
   healthy participants. Following stimulation, participants played the
   ``Cyberball Task{''}; an online ball-tossing game in which the subject
   participant is included or excluded. Compared to sham, rTMS did not
   modulate behavioural response to social exclusion. However, within the
   active rTMS group only, greater trait personal distress was related to
   enhanced negative outcomes to social exclusion. These results add
   further support to the notion that the effect of brain stimulation is
   not homogenous across individuals, and indicates the need to consider
   baseline individual differences when assessing response to brain
   stimulation. This seems particularly relevant in social neuroscience
   investigations, where trait factors may have a meaningful effect.}},

   A resting-state fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{242-252}},
Abstract = {{Poor social networks and decreased levels of social support are
   associated with worse mood, health, and cognition in younger and older
   adults. Yet, we know very little about the brain substrates associated
   with social networks and social support, particularly in older adults.
   This study examined functional brain substrates associated with social
   networks using the Social Network Index (SNI) and resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Resting-state fMRI data
   from 28 non-demented older adults were analyzed with independent
   components analyses. As expected, four established resting-state
   networks-previously linked to motor, vision, speech, and other language
   functions-correlated with the quality (SNI-1: total number of
   high-contact roles of a respondent) and quantity (SNI-2: total number of
   individuals in a respondent's social network) of social networks: a
   sensorimotor, a visual, a vestibular/insular, and a left frontoparietal
   network. Moreover, SNI-1 was associated with greater functional
   connectivity in the lateral prefrontal regions of the left
   frontoparietal network, while SNI-2 was associated with greater
   functional connectivity in the medial prefrontal regions of this
   network. Thus, lateral prefrontal regions may be particularly linked to
   the quality of social networks while medial prefrontal regions may be
   particularly linked to the quantity of social networks.}},

Title = {{Highways of the emotional intellect: white matter microstructural
   correlates of an ability-based measure of emotional intelligence}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{253-267}},
Abstract = {{Individuals differ in their ability to understand emotional information
   and apply that understanding to make decisions and solve problems
   effectively - a construct known as Emotional Intelligence (EI). While
   considerable evidence supports the importance of EI in social and
   occupational functioning, the neural underpinnings of this capacity are
   relatively unexplored. We used Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to
   determine the white matter correlates of EI as measured by the
   ability-based Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT).
   Participants included 32 healthy adults (16 men; 16 women), aged 18-45
   years. White matter integrity in key tracts was positively correlated
   with the Strategic Area branches of the MSCEIT (Understanding Emotions
   and Managing Emotions), but not the Experiential branches (Perceiving
   and Facilitating Emotions). Specifically, the Understanding Emotions
   branch was associated with greater fractional anisotropy (FA) within
   somatosensory and sensory-motor fiber bundles, particularly those of the
   left superior longitudinal fasciculus and corticospinal tract. Managing
   Emotions was associated with greater FA within frontal-affective
   association tracts including the anterior forceps and right uncinate
   fasciculus, along with frontal-parietal cingulum and interhemispheric
   corpus callosum tracts. These findings suggest that specific components
   of EI are directly related to the structural microarchitecture of major
   axonal pathways.}},

   meta-analytical approach}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{268-279}},
Abstract = {{We hypothesize that framing effects (risk-averse in the positive frame
   and risk-seeking in the negative frame) are likely to occur when
   ambiguous social contexts result in ambiguous or ambivalent risk
   preferences, leading the decision-maker to search for more subtle cues,
   such as verbal framing. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study, we examined framing effects in both unambiguous
   homogeneous group and more ambiguous heterogeneous group contexts. We
   began by conducting a meta-analysis and identified three regions of
   interest: the right inferior frontal gyrus, the left anterior cingulate
   (ACC)/ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and the left amygdala. Our
   own fMRI data were collected while the participants made choices between
   a sure option and a gamble framed in terms of the number of lives to
   either save or die. The framing effect was evident in a heterogeneous
   context with a mixture of kin and strangers, but disappeared in a
   homogeneous group of either all kin-members or all strangers. The fMRI
   results revealed a greater activation in the right middle/inferior
   frontal gyrus under the negative than the positive framing, and less
   ACC/vmPFC deactivation under positive framing in the
   heterogamous/ambiguous context. The activation of the amygdala was
   correlated with greater risk-seeking preference in homogeneous kinship
   contexts.}},

Title = {{Structural integrity of frontostriatal connections predicts longitudinal
   changes in self-esteem}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{280-286}},
Abstract = {{Diverse neurological and psychiatric conditions are marked by a
   diminished sense of positive self regard, and reductions in self- esteem
   are associated with risk for these disorders. Recent evidence has shown
   that the connectivity of frontostriatal circuitry reflects individual
   differences in self-esteem. However, it remains an open question as to
   whether the integrity of these connections can predict self-esteem
   changes over larger timescales. Using diffusion magnetic resonance
   imaging and probabilistic tractography, we demonstrate that the
   integrity of white matter pathways linking the medial prefrontal cortex
   to the ventral striatum predicts changes in self-esteem 8 months after
   initial scanning in a sample of 30 young adults. Individuals with
   greater integrity of this pathway during the scanning session at Time 1
   showed increased levels of self-esteem at follow-up, whereas individuals
   with lower integrity showed stifled or decreased levels of self-esteem.
   These results provide evidence that frontostriatal white matter
   integrity predicts the trajectory of self-esteem development in early
   adulthood, which may contribute to blunted levels of positive
   self-regard seen in multiple psychiatric conditions, including
   depression and anxiety.}},

   impairment in semantic dementia}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{287-302}},
Abstract = {{Using structural MRI, we investigated the brain substrates of both
   affective and cognitive theory of mind (ToM) in 19 patients with
   semantic dementia. We also ran intrinsic connectivity analyses to
   identify the networks to which the substrates belong and whether they
   are functionally disturbed in semantic dementia. In line with previous
   studies, we observed a ToM impairment in patients with semantic dementia
   even when semantic memory was regressed out. Our results also
   highlighted different neural bases according to the nature (affective or
   cognitive) of the representations being inferred. The affective ToM
   deficit was associated with atrophy in the amygdala, suggesting the
   involvement of emotion-processing deficits in this impairment. By
   contrast, cognitive ToM performances were correlated with the volume of
   medial prefrontal and parietal regions, as well as the right frontal
   operculum. Intrinsic connectivity analyses revealed decreased functional
   connectivity, mainly between midline cortical regions and temporal
   regions. They also showed that left medial temporal regions were
   functionally isolated, a further possible hindrance to normal social
   cognitive functioning in semantic dementia. Overall, this study
   addressed for the first time the neuroanatomical substrates of both
   cognitive and affective ToM disruption in semantic dementia,
   highlighting disturbed connectivity within the networks that sustain
   these abilities.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have
   been shown to experience significant problems in facial affect
   recognition (FAR). However, it is not known how these impairments relate
   to overall functioning and quality of life (QoL) following TBI. The aim
   of the current study was to test the hypothesis that worse performance
   on an FAR task would be associated with reduced QoL (related to social
   and emotional functioning), worse mood, and increased fatigue.
   Forty-seven individuals with TBI and 27 healthy controls (HCs) completed
   the facial emotion identification task (FEIT), as well as questionnaires
   assessing social and emotional QoL, mood, and fatigue. The TBI group
   performed significantly worse than HCs on the FEIT. A significant
   relationship between FAR and fatigue and QoL related to social and
   emotional functioning was documented, but in an unexpected direction:
   individuals who performed better on the FEIT reported poorer QoL and
   greater fatigue. Individuals who have better FAR may require increased
   effort to perform this task, and thus experience greater fatigue and
   poorer social and emotional QoL.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Childhood maltreatment leads to neuroendocrine changes, which
   may be associated with an increased vulnerability for psychopathology,
   such as depression and anxiety in later life. This study aimed to
   investigate the relationship between childhood maltreatment and orexin A
   levels in patients with depression and anxiety. The study consisted of
   27 female outpatients who presented with depressive and/or anxiety
   symptoms, and 27 healthy female controls. Childhood trauma history was
   assessed using the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ-28) in patients
   and controls. Serum levels of orexin and cortisol were measured in all
   subjects. There were positive correlations between serum orexin levels
   and CTQ total score and between orexin levels and some CTQ subscale
   scores, such as physical and emotional neglect, in patients. Orexin
   levels in patients with a positive history of physical and emotional
   neglect were higher than those in patients with a negative history of
   them. In the controls, there was a positive correlation between
   emotional neglect score and serum orexin level. There were no
   differences in serum levels of orexin and cortisol between patients and
   controls. Orexin levels may be associated with childhood maltreatment
   per se, rather than psychopathology, such as depression or anxiety.}},

Title = {{Effects of parental emotional warmth on the relationship between

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Pages = {{337-348}},
Abstract = {{The depression-related personality trait is associated with the severity
   of patients' current depressive symptoms and with the vulnerability to
   depression within the nonclinical groups. However, little is known about
   the anatomical structure associated with the depression-related
   personality traits within the nonclinical sample. Parenting behavior is
   associated with the depression symptoms; however, whether or not
   parenting behavior influence the neural basis of the depression-related
   personality traits is unclear. Thus in current study, first, we used
   voxel-based morphometry to identify the brain regions underlying
   individual differences in depression-related personality traits, as
   measured by the revised Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Personality
   Inventory, in a large sample of young healthy adults. Second, we use
   mediation analysis to investigate the relationship between parenting
   behavior and neural basis of depression-related personality traits. The
   results revealed that depression-related personality traits were
   positively correlated with gray matter volume mainly in medial frontal
   gyrus (MFG) that is implicated in the self-referential processing and
   emotional regulation. Furthermore, parental emotional warmth acted as a
   mediational mechanism underlying the association between the MFG volume
   and the depression-related personality trait. Together, our findings
   suggested that the family environment might play an important role in
   the acquisition and process of the depression-related personality
   traits.}},

Pages = {{349-360}},
Abstract = {{In order to determine if highly negative stigma is a more salient cue
   than other negative emotional, non-stigmatized cues, participants
   underwent electroencephalography while passively viewing or actively
   regulating their emotional response to images of highly negative
   stigmatized (e.g., homeless individuals, substance abusers) or highly
   negative non-stigmatized (e.g., a man holding a gun, an injured person)
   individuals. Event-related potential (ERP) analyses focused on the N2
   (associated with detecting novelty), the early positive potential
   (associated with processing emotion), and a sustained late positive
   potential (associated with modulating regulatory goals). A salience
   effect for highly negative stigma was revealed in the early positive
   potential, with higher magnitude ERP responses to images of highly
   negative stigmatized as compared to highly negative non-stigmatized
   individuals 355ms poststimulus onset. Moreover, the amplitude of this
   effect was predicted by individual differences in implicit bias. Our
   results also demonstrated that the late positivity response was not
   modulated by regulatory goals (passively view versus to reappraise) for
   images of highly negative stigmatized individuals, but was for images of
   highly negative, non-stigmatized individuals (replicating previous
   findings). Our findings suggest that the neural response to highly

Abstract = {{In this debate with Lisa Feldman Barrett, I defend a view of emotions as
   biological functional states. Affective neuroscience studies emotions in
   this sense, but it also studies the conscious experience of emotion
   ('feelings'), our ability to attribute emotions to others and to animals
   ('attribution', `anthropomorphizing'), our ability to think and talk
   about emotion ('concepts of emotion', `semantic knowledge of emotion')
   and the behaviors caused by an emotion ('expression of emotions',
   `emotional reactions'). I think that the most pressing challenge facing
   affective neuroscience is the need to carefully distinguish between
   these distinct aspects of `emotion'. I view emotion states as evolved
   functional states that regulate complex behavior, in both people and
   animals, in response to challenges that instantiate recurrent
   environmental themes. These functional states, in turn, can also cause
   conscious experiences (feelings), and their effects and our memories for
   those effects also contribute to our semantic knowledge of emotions
   (concepts). Cross-species studies, dissociations in neurological and
   psychiatric patients, and more ecologically valid neuroimaging designs
   should be used to partly separate these different phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to recognize one's own reflection is shared by humans and
   only a few other species, including chimpanzees. However, this ability
   is highly variable across individual chimpanzees. In humans,
   self-recognition involves a distributed, right-lateralized network
   including frontal and parietal regions involved in the production and
   perception of action. The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) is a
   system of white matter tracts linking these frontal and parietal
   regions. The current study measured mirror self-recognition (MSR) and
   SLF anatomy in 60 chimpanzees using diffusion tensor imaging. Successful
   self-recognition was associated with greater rightward asymmetry in the
   white matter of SLFII and SLFIII, and in SLFIII's gray matter
   terminations in Broca's area. We observed a visible progression of
   SLFIII's prefrontal extension in apes that show negative, ambiguous, and
   compelling evidence of MSR. Notably, SLFIII's terminations in Broca's
   area are not right-lateralized or particularly pronounced at the
   population level in chimpanzees, as they are in humans. Thus,
   chimpanzees with more human-like behavior show more human-like SLFIII
   connectivity. These results suggest that self-recognition may have
   co-emerged with adaptations to frontoparietal circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{Observers frequently form impressions of other people based on complex
   or conflicting information. Rather than being objective, these
   impressions are often biased by observers' motives. For instance,
   observers often downplay negative information they learn about ingroup
   members. Here, we characterize the neural systems associated with biased
   impression formation. Participants learned positive and negative
   information about ingroup and outgroup social targets. Following this
   information, participants worsened their impressions of outgroup, but
   not ingroup, targets. This tendency was associated with a failure to
   engage neural structures including lateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex, temporoparietal junction, Insula and
   Precuneus when processing negative information about ingroup (but not
   outgroup) targets. To the extent that participants engaged these regions
   while learning negative information about ingroup members, they
   exhibited less ingroup bias in their impressions. These data are
   consistent with a model of `effortless bias', under which perceivers

Abstract = {{Ideas spread across social networks, but not everyone is equally
   positioned to be a successful recommender. Do individuals with more
   opportunities to connect otherwise unconnected others-high information
   brokers-use their brains differently than low information brokers when
   making recommendations? We test the hypothesis that those with more
   opportunities for information brokerage may use brain systems implicated
   in considering the thoughts, perspectives, and mental states of others
   (i.e. `mentalizing') more when spreading ideas. We used social network
   analysis to quantify individuals' opportunities for information
   brokerage. This served as a predictor of activity
   withinmeta-analytically defined neural regions associated with
   mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, temporal parietal junction,
   medial prefrontal cortex, /posterior cingulate cortex, middle temporal
   gyrus) as participants received feedback about peer opinions of mobile
   game apps. Higher information brokers exhibited more activity in
   thismentalizing network when receiving divergent peer feedback and
   updating their recommendation. These data support the idea that those in
   different network positions may use their brains differently to perform
   social tasks. Different social network positions might provide more
   opportunities to engage specific psychological processes. Or those who
   tend to engage such processes more may place themselves in
   systematically different network positions. These data highlight the
   value of integrating levels of analysis, from brain networks to social

Abstract = {{Relative to the general population, individuals with psychotic disorders

   offenders. Thus, psychotic-disordered individuals with antisocial
   tendencies may form an especially high-risk group. We built upon prior
   risk analyses by examining whether neurobehavioral correlates of social
   cognition were associated with suicidal behavior in criminal offenders
   with psychotic disorders. We assessed empathic accuracy and brain
   structure in four groups: (i) incarcerated offenders with psychotic
   disorders and past suicide attempts, (ii) incarcerated offenders with
   psychotic disorders and no suicide attempts, (iii) incarcerated
   offenders without psychotic disorders and (iv) community non-offenders
   without psychotic disorders. Established suicide risk variables were
   examined along with empathic accuracy and gray matter in brain regions
   implicated in social cognition. Relative to the other groups, offenders
   with psychotic disorders and suicide attempts had lower empathic
   accuracy and smaller temporal pole volumes. Empathic accuracy and
   temporal pole volumes were significantly associated with suicide
   attempts independent of other risk variables. The results indicate that
   brain and behavioral correlates of social cognition may add incremental
   value to models of suicide risk.}},

Abstract = {{Social anxiety disorder (SAD) involves abnormalities in social
   motivation, which may be independent of well-documented differences in
   fear and arousal systems. Yet, the neurobiology underlying motivational
   difficulties in SAD is not well understood. The aim of the current study
   was to spatiotemporally dissociate reward circuitry dysfunction from
   alterations in fear and arousal-related neural activity during
   anticipation and notification of social and non-social reward and
   punishment. During fMRI acquisition, non-depressed adults with social
   anxiety disorder (SAD; N = 21) and age-, sex-and IQ-matched control
   subjects (N = 22) completed eight runs of an incentive delay task,
   alternating between social and monetary outcomes and interleaved in
   alternating order between gain and loss outcomes. Adults with SAD
   demonstrated significantly reduced neural activity in ventral striatum
   during the anticipation of positive but not negative social outcomes. No
   differences between the SAD and control groups were observed during
   anticipation of monetary gain or loss outcomes or during anticipation of
   negative social images. However, consistent with previous work, the SAD
   group demonstrated amygdala hyper-activity upon notification of negative
   social outcomes. Degraded anticipatory processing in bilateral ventral
   striatum in SAD was constrained exclusively to anticipation of positive
   social information and dissociable from the effects of negative social
   outcomes previously observed in the amygdala. Alterations in
   anticipation-related neural signals may represent a promising target for
   treatment that is not addressed by available evidence-based
   interventions, which focus primarily on fear extinction and habituation
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Humans cannot help but attribute human emotions to non-human animals.
   Although such attributions are often regarded as gratuitous
   anthropomorphisms and held apart from the attributions humans make about
   each other's internal states, they may be the product of a general
   mechanism for flexibly interpreting adaptive behavior. To examine this,
   we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans to
   compare the neural mechanisms associated with attributing emotions to
   humans and non-human animal behavior. Although undergoing fMRI,
   participants first passively observed the facial displays of human,
   non-human primate and domestic dogs, and subsequently judged the
   acceptability of emotional (e.g. `annoyed') and facial descriptions
   (e.g. `baring teeth') for the same images. For all targets, emotion
   attributions selectively activated regions in prefrontal and anterior
   temporal cortices associated with causal explanation in prior studies.
   These regions were similarly activated by both human and non-human
   targets even during the passive observation task; moreover, the degree
   of neural similarity was dependent on participants' self-reported
   beliefs in the mental capacities of non-human animals. These results
   encourage a non-anthropocentric view of emotion understanding, one that
   treats the idea that animals have emotions as no more gratuitous than
   the idea that humans other than ourselves do.}},

Abstract = {{Appetitive extinction receives attention as an important model for the
   treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, in humans, its underlying
   neural correlates remain unknown. To close this gap, we investigated
   appetitive acquisition and extinction with fMRI in a 2-day monetary
   incentive delay paradigm. During appetitive conditioning, one stimulus
   (CS+) was paired with monetary reward, while another stimulus (CS-) was
   never rewarded. Twenty-four hours later, subjects underwent extinction,
   in which neither CS was reinforced. Appetitive conditioning elicited
   stronger skin conductance responses to the CS+ as compared with the CS-.
   Regarding subjective ratings, the CS+ was rated more pleasant and
   arousing than the CS- after conditioning. Furthermore, fMRI-results (CS+
   - CS-) showed activation of the reward circuitry including amygdala,
   midbrain and striatal areas. During extinction, conditioned responses
   were successfully extinguished. In the early phase of extinction, we
   found a significant activation of the caudate, the hippocampus, the
   dorsal and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (dACC and vACC). In the
   late phase, we found significant activation of the nucleus accumbens
   (NAcc) and the amygdala. Correlational analyses with subjective ratings
   linked extinction success to the vACC and the NAcc, while associating
   the dACC with reduced extinction. The results reveal neural correlates
   of appetitive extinction in humans and extend assumptions from models
   for human extinction learning.}},

Abstract = {{Although a growing body of literature suggests that cognitive control
   processes are involved in deception, much about the neural correlates of
   lying remains unknown. In this study, we tested whether brain activation
   associated with deception, as measured by functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), can be detected either in preparation for or during the
   execution of a lie, and whether they depend on the content of the lie.
   We scanned participants while they lied or told the truth about either
   their personal experiences (episodic memories) or personal beliefs.
   Regions in the frontal and parietal cortex showed higher activation when
   participants lied compared with when they were telling the truth,
   regardless of whether they were asked about their past experiences or
   opinions. In contrast, lie-related activation in the right temporal
   pole, precuneus and the right amygdala differed by the content of the
   lie. Preparing to lie activated parietal and frontal brain regions that
   were distinct from those activated while participants executed lies. Our
   findings concur with previous reports on the involvement of frontal and
   parietal regions in deception, but specify brain regions involved in the
   preparation vs execution of deception, and those involved in deceiving
   about experiences vs opinions.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Besides the prefrontal cortex, the insula and medial structures of the
   temporal lobe are thought to be involved in risky decision-making.
   However, their respective contributions to decision processes remain
   unclear due to the lack of studies involving patients with isolated
   insular damage. We assessed adult patients who underwent resection of
   the insula (n = 13) or of the anterior temporal lobe (including medial
   structures) (n = 13) as part of their epilepsy surgery, and a group of
   healthy volunteers (n = 20), on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and on the
   Cups Task. Groups were matched on sociodemographic, estimated-IQ and
   surgery-related factors. On the IGT, patients with temporal lobe
   resection performed significantly worse than both the insular and
   healthy control groups, as they failed to learn which decks were
   advantageous on the long-term. On the Cups Task, the insular and
   temporal groups both showed impaired sensitivity to expected value in
   the loss domain, when compared with healthy controls. These findings
   provide clinical evidence that the insula and mesiotemporal structures
   are specifically involved in risky decision-making when facing a
   potential loss, and that temporal structures are also involved in
   learning the association between behavior and consequences in the
   long-term.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion of responsibility across agents has been proposed to underlie

   few studies have directly investigated effects of the presence of other

   study investigated whether diffusion of responsibility simply reflects a
   post-hoc self-serving bias, or rather has direct effects on how we
   process the outcomes of our actions, and our experience of agency over
   them. Participants made voluntary actions whose outcomes were more or
   less negative. Presence of another potential agent reduced participants'
   sense of agency over those outcomes, even though it was always obvious
   who caused each outcome. Further, presence of another agent reduced the
   amplitude of feedback-related negativity evoked by outcome stimuli,
   suggesting reduced outcome monitoring. The presence of other agents may
   lead to diffusion of responsibility by weakening the neural linkage
   between one's actions and their outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation and attention constitute major determinants of human
   perception and action. Nonetheless, it remains a matter of debate
   whether motivation effects on the visual cortex depend on the spatial
   attention system, or rely on independent pathways. This study
   investigated the impact of motivation and spatial attention on the
   activity of the human primary and extrastriate visual cortex by
   employing a factorial manipulation of the two factors in a cued pattern
   discrimination task. During stimulus presentation, we recorded
   event-related potentials and pupillary responses. Motivational relevance
   increased the amplitudes of the C1 component at similar to 70ms after
   stimulus onset. This modulation occurred independently of spatial
   attention effects, which were evident at the P1 level. Furthermore,
   motivation and spatial attention had independent effects on preparatory
   activation as measured by the contingent negative variation; and pupil
   data showed increased activation in response to incentive targets. Taken
   together, these findings suggest independent pathways for the influence
   of motivation and spatial attention on the activity of the human visual
   cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Cortical networks underpinning attentional control and mentalizing
   converge at the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). It is debated
   whether the rTPJ is fractionated in neighboring, but separate functional
   modules underpinning attentional control and mentalizing, or whether one
   overarching cognitive mechanism explains the rTPJ's role in both
   domains. Addressing this question, we combined attentional control and
   mentalizing in a factorial design within one task. We added a social
   context condition, in which another individual's mental states became
   apparently task-relevant, to a spatial cueing paradigm. This allowed for
   assessing cue validity-and context-dependent functional activity and
   effective connectivity of the rTPJ within corresponding cortical
   networks. We found two discriminable rTPJ subregions, an anterior and a
   posterior one. Yet, we did not observe a sharp functional dissociation
   between these two, as both regions responded to attention cueing and
   social context manipulation. The results suggest that the rTPJ is part
   of both the ventral attention and the ToM network and that its function
   is defined by context-dependent coupling with the respective network. We
   argue that the rTPJ as a functional unit underpins an overarching
   cognitive mechanism in attentional control and mentalizing and discuss
   how the present results help to further specify this mechanism.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{113-123}},
Abstract = {{Intranasal oxytocin (OT) affects a suite of human social behaviors,
   including trust, eye contact, and emotion recognition. However, it is
   unclear where oxytocin receptors (OXTR) and the structurally related
   vasopressin 1a receptors (AVPR1a) are expressed in the human brain. We
   have previously described a reliable, pharmacologically informed
   receptor autoradiography protocol for visualizing these receptors in
   postmortem primate brain tissue. We used this technique in human
   brainstem tissue to identify the neural targets of OT and vasopressin.
   To determine binding selectivity of the OXTR radioligand and AVPR1a
   radioligand, sections were incubated in four conditions: radioligand
   alone, radioligand with the selective AVPR1a competitor SR49059, and
   radioligand with a low or high concentration of the selective OXTR
   competitor ALS-II-69. We found selective OXTR binding in the spinal
   trigeminal nucleus, a conserved region of OXTR expression in all primate
   species investigated to date. We found selective AVPR1a binding in the
   nucleus prepositus, an area implicated in eye gaze stabilization. The
   tissue's postmortem interval (PMI) was not correlated with either the
   specific or nonspecific binding of either radioligand, indicating that
   it will not likely be a factor in similar postmortem studies. This study
   provides critical data for future studies of OXTR and AVPR1a in human
   brain tissue.}},

Title = {{Effective connectivity of brain regions underlying third-party
   punishment: Functional MRI and Granger causality evidence}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{124-134}},
Abstract = {{Third-party punishment (TPP) for norm violations is an essential
   deterrent in large-scale human societies, and builds on two essential
   cognitive functions: evaluating legal responsibility and determining
   appropriate punishment. Despite converging evidence that TPP is mediated
   by a specific set of brain regions, little is known about their
   effective connectivity (direction and strength of connections). Applying
   parametric event-related functional MRI in conjunction with multivariate
   Granger causality analysis, we asked healthy participants to estimate
   how much punishment a hypothetical perpetrator deserves for
   intentionally committing criminal offenses varying in levels of harm.
   Our results confirmed that TPP legal decisions are based on two
   domain-general networks: the mentalizing network for evaluating legal
   responsibility and the central-executive network for determining
   appropriate punishment. Further, temporal pole (TP) and dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex (PFC) emerged as hubs of the mentalizing network,
   uniquely generating converging output connections to ventromedial PFC,
   temporo-parietal junction, and posterior cingulate. In particular,
   dorsomedial PFC received inputs only from TP and both its activation and
   its connectivity to dorsolateral PFC correlated with degree of
   punishment. This supports the hypothesis that dorsomedial PFC acts as
   the driver of the TPP activation pattern, leading to the decision on the
   appropriate punishment. In conclusion, these results advance our
   understanding of the organizational elements of the TPP brain networks
   and provide better insights into the mental states of judges and jurors
   tasked with blaming and punishing legal wrongs.}},

Abstract = {{Greater obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptom severity may be associated
   with poor social adjustment. Rather than possessing deficits in social
   skill per se, OCD patients may be more socially isolative in the
   presence of normal controls. We aimed to apply a novel social
   interaction challenge (SIC) to an established animal model of OCD, viz.,
   the deer mouse, to assess complex social behavior in animals by
   investigating group sociability and its response to chronic escitalopram
   treatment (50mg/kg/dayx28days), both within and between non (N)- (viz.,
   normal) and high (H)- (viz., OCD-like) stereotypical cohorts. Using
   automated screening, we scored approach behavior, episodes of proximity,
   duration of proximity, and relative net weighted movement. H animals
   socialized more with one another within cohort in all of the above
   parameters compared to the within-cohort behavior of N animals.
   Furthermore, the social behavior of H animals toward one another, both
   within and between cohort demonstrated significant improvements
   following chronic escitalopram treatment. However, the study also
   demonstrates that the social interaction between H and N animals remain
   poor even after chronic escitalopram treatment. To conclude, findings
   from the current investigation support clinical data demonstrating
   altered sociability in patients with OCD.}},

Abstract = {{Adult appropriate responding to salient infant signals is vital to child
   healthy psychological development. Here we investigated how infant

   cerebral activation of the default mode network (DMN) and reaction times
   (RTs) while listeners engaged in self-referential decision and syllabic
   counting tasks, which, respectively, require the activation or
   deactivation of the DMN. Sounds affect women and men differently. In
   women, infant crying deactivated the DMN during the self-referential
   decision task; in men, female adult crying interfered with the DMN
   during the syllabic counting task. These findings point to different
   brain processes underlying responsiveness to crying in women and men and

Abstract = {{Differences in striatal dopamine (DA) function may be related to
   differences in the degree of social attachment to others. Using positron
   emission tomography (PET), socially detached persons demonstrate reduced
   DA D-2/3 receptor (D2/3R) availability in the striatum. However,
   previous PET studies have only used antagonist radiotracers for D2/3R
   and have not specifically examined regions of interest (ROIs) such as
   the ventral striatum (VS). In 32 healthy persons, we investigated the
   relationship between self-reported attachment and DA D2/3R availability
   in striatal and extrastriatal ROIs as measured using the agonist
   radiotracer {[}C-11]-(+)-PHNO. Surprisingly, more social attachmentas
   measured by the attachment subscale of the temperament and character
   inventorywas related to less {[}C-11]-(+)-PHNO binding in the VS
   (r(30)=-.43, p=.01). This relationship held in a subsample who also
   completed the detachment subscale of the Karolinska Scales of
   Personality (r(10)=.62, p=.03). However, no relationships were observed
   with BPND in the dorsal striatum or D3R-specific ROIs. One potential
   explanation for these findings is that persons who are more socially
   detached have less endogenous DA occupying D2/3R in the VS. This
   interpretation warrants investigation by future research. These findings
   may help us better understand the neurochemical basis of attachment.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research suggests that prosocial outcomes in sharing games arise
   from prefrontal control of self-maximizing impulses. We used continuous
   theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to disrupt the functioning of two
   prefrontal areas, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and
   the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC). We used cTBS in the right
   MT/V5, as a control area. We then tested subjects' prosocial
   inclinations with an unsupervised Dictator Game in which they allocated
   real money anonymously between themselves and low and high socioeconomic
   status (SES) players. cTBS over the two prefrontal sites made subjects
   more generous compared to MT/V5. More specifically, cTBS over DLPFC
   increased offers to high-SES players, while cTBS over DMPFC caused
   increased offers to low-SES players. These data, the first to
   demonstrate an effect of disruptive neuromodulation on costly sharing,
   suggest that DLPFC and MPFC exert inhibitory control over prosocial
   inclinations during costly sharing, though they may do so in different
   ways. DLPFC may implement contextual control, while DMPFC may implement
   a tonic form of control. This study demonstrates that humans' prepotent
   inclination is toward prosocial outcomes when cognitive control is
   reduced, even when prosocial decisions carry no strategic benefit and
   concerns for reputation are minimized.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{182-193}},
Abstract = {{Insults always sting, but the context in which they are delivered can
   make the effects even worse. Here we test how the brain processes
   insults, and whether and how the neurocognitive processing of insults is
   changed by the presence of a laughing crowd. Event-related potentials
   showed that insults, compared to compliments, evoked an increase in N400
   amplitude (indicating increased lexical-semantic processing) and LPP
   amplitude (indicating emotional processing) when presented in isolation.
   When insults were perceived in the presence of a laughing crowd, the
   difference in N400 amplitude disappeared, while the difference in LPP
   activation increased. These results show that even without laughter,
   verbal insults receive additional neural processing over compliments,
   both at the lexical-semantic and emotional level. The presence of a
   laughing crowd has a direct effect on the neurocognitive processing of
   insults, leading to stronger and more elongated emotional processing.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{194-206}},
Abstract = {{The current study measured adults' P350 and N170 ERPs while they
   interacted with a character in a virtual reality paradigm. Some
   participants believed the character was controlled by a human (avatar
   condition, n=19); others believed it was controlled by a computer
   program (agent condition, n=19). In each trial, participants initiated
   joint attention in order to direct the character's gaze toward a target.
   In 50\% of trials, the character gazed toward the target (congruent
   responses), and in 50\% of trials the character gazed to a different
   location (incongruent response). In the avatar condition, the
   character's incongruent gaze responses generated significantly larger
   P350 peaks at centro-parietal sites than congruent gaze responses. In
   the agent condition, the P350 effect was strikingly absent. Left
   occipitotemporal N170 responses were significantly smaller in the agent
   condition compared to the avatar condition for both congruent and
   incongruent gaze shifts. These data suggest that beliefs about human
   agency may recruit mechanisms that discriminate the social outcome of a
   gaze shift after approximately 350ms, and that these mechanisms may
   modulate the early perceptual processing of gaze. These findings also
   suggest that the ecologically valid measurement of social cognition may
   depend upon paradigms that simulate genuine social interactions.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{207-217}},
Abstract = {{Neuroimaging research has demonstrated that the temporo-parietal
   junction (TPJ) is activated when unexpected stimuli appear in spatial
   reorientation tasks as well as during thinking about the beliefs of
   other people triggered by verbal scenarios. While the role of potential
   common component processes subserved by the TPJ has been extensively
   studied to explain this common activation, the potential confounding
   role of input modality (spatial vs. verbal) has been largely ignored. To
   investigate the role of input modality apart from task processes, we
   developed a novel spatial false belief task based on moving shapes. We
   explored the overlap in TPJ activation across this novel task and
   traditional tasks of spatial reorientation (Posner) and verbal belief
   (False Belief vs. Photo stories). The results show substantial overlap
   across the same spatial input modality (both reorientation and false
   belief) as well as across the common task process (verbal and spatial
   belief), but no triple overlap. This suggests the potential for an
   overarching function of the TPJ, with some degree of specialization in
   different subregions due to modality, function and connectivity. The
   results are discussed with respect to recent theoretical models of the
   TPJ.}},

   intergroup face processing}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{218-231}},
Abstract = {{Power is thought to increase discrimination toward subordinate groups,
   yet its effect on different forms of implicit bias remains unclear. We
   tested whether power enhances implicit racial stereotyping, in addition
   to implicit prejudice (i.e., evaluative associations), and examined the
   effect of power on the automatic processing of faces during implicit
   tasks. Study 1 showed that manipulated high power increased both forms
   of implicit bias, relative to low power. Using a neural index of visual
   face processing (the N170 component of the ERP), Study 2 revealed that
   power affected the encoding of White ingroup vs. Black outgroup faces.
   Whereas high power increased the relative processing of outgroup faces
   during evaluative judgments in the prejudice task, it decreased the
   relative processing of outgroup faces during stereotype trait judgments.
   An indirect effect of power on implicit prejudice through enhanced
   processing of outgroup versus ingroup faces suggested a potential link
   between face processing and implicit bias. Together, these findings
   demonstrate that power can affect implicit prejudice and stereotyping as
   well as early processing of racial ingroup and outgroup faces.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{232-236}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies have documented that expectancy-violating (EV) behavior
   (i.e., behavior that violates existing person impressions) elicits more
   effortful cognitive processing compared to expectancy-consistent (EC)
   behavior. Some studies also have shown that this effect is modulated by
   the valence of behavior, though this finding is inconsistent with some
   extant models of expectancy processes. The current research investigated
   whether the valence of EV information affects very rapid attentional
   processes thought to tag goal-relevant information for more elaborative
   processing at later stages. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were
   recorded while participants read depictions of behavior that either were
   consistent with or violated established impressions about fictitious
   characters. Consistent with predictions, a very early attention-related
   ERP component, the frontal P2, differentiated negative from positive EV
   behavior but was unaffected by the valence of EC behavior. This effect
   occurred much earlier in processing than has been demonstrated in prior
   reports of EV effects on neural response, suggesting that impression
   formation goals tune attention to information that might signal the need
   to modify existing impressions.}},

   on HPA and oxytocin activity}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{8-21}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has demonstrated that before puberty, parents are able
   to buffer, and often completely block, cortisol responses to social
   evaluative stressors (e.g., Trier Social Stress Test; TSST). However,
   after puberty, parents no longer provide a powerful buffer of the HPA
   axis from a social-evaluative stressor. The current study investigates
   whether friends can buffer the HPA axis in both children and adolescents
   compared to parents and whether similar stress-ameliorating patterns can
   also be observed in oxytocin activity. A total of 109 participants (54
   children aged 9-10 and 55 adolescents aged 15-16; half of each sex)
   completed the TSST and were randomly assigned to prepare for their
   speech with their parent or friend for 5minutes beforehand. Salivary
   cortisol and urinary oxytocin were measured before and after the TSST.
   For children, cortisol responses were comparable regardless of who
   helped the child prepare the speech. For adolescents, however, friends
   actually amplified the cortisol response compared to parents. In
   addition, adolescents produced less oxytocin than children, as did males
   compared to females. Notably, for boys, oxytocin levels decreased across
   the session if participants prepared with a friend rather than their
   parent. The mean change was in the same direction but not significant
   for girls. These results indicate that friends do not take over the
   social buffering role by age 15-16, which may inform interventions in
   at-risk children and adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{Parental availability influences fear expression and learning across
   species, but the effect of maternal buffering on fear learning in humans
   is unknown. Here we investigated the effect of maternal availability
   during fear conditioning in a group of children (ages 8-10) and
   adolescents (ages 11-13) from a low-income population with a range of
   trauma exposure. Acoustic startle response data were collected to
   measure fear-potentiated startle (FPS) in 104 participants. A total of
   62 participants were tested with the mother available and 42 when the
   mother was not in the testing room. We observed that maternal
   availability during fear conditioning interacted with age to affect FPS
   discrimination between CS+ and CS-. In line with previous findings
   suggesting an absence of maternal buffering in adolescents, fear
   discrimination was affected by maternal availability only in children.
   Second, we observed that the effect of maternal buffering on FPS
   discrimination in children was not influenced by maternally reported
   warmth. In conclusion, we demonstrated that maternal availability
   improved discrimination in children, regardless of the quality of the
   relationship. Adolescents discriminated irrespective of maternal status,
   suggesting that childhood may be a sensitive period for environmental
   influences on key processes such as learning of danger and safety
   signals.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal presence has a potent buffering effect on infant fear and
   stress responses in primates. We previously reported that maternal
   presence is not effective in buffering the endocrine stress response in
   infant rhesus monkeys reared by maltreating mothers. We have also
   reported that maltreating mothers show low maternal responsiveness and
   permissiveness/secure-base behavior. Although still not understood, it
   is possible that this maternal buffering effect is mediated, at least
   partially, through deactivation of amygdala response circuits when
   mothers are present. Here, we studied rhesus monkey infants that
   differed in the quality of early maternal care to investigate how this
   early experience modulated maternal buffering effects on behavioral
   responses to novelty during the weaning period. We also examined the
   relationship between these behavioral responses and structural
   connectivity in one of the underlying regulatory neural circuits:
   amygdala-prefrontal pathways. Our findings suggest that infant
   exploration in a novel situation is predicted by maternal responsiveness
   and structural integrity of amygdala-prefrontal white matter depending
   on maternal presence (positive relationships when mother is absent).
   These results provide evidence that maternal buffering of infant
   behavioral inhibition is dependent on the quality of maternal care and
   structural connectivity of neural pathways that are sensitive to early
   life stress.}},

Abstract = {{Psychosocial stressors appear to promote the onset of depressive illness
   through activation and sensitization of inflammatory mechanisms. Here,
   adult male rhesus monkeys brought from large outdoor social groups to
   indoor housing for 8 days reliably exhibited a hunched, depressive-like
   posture. When rehoused indoors a second 8days about 2weeks later,
   monkeys housed alone, but not those with an affiliative partner, showed
   sensitization of the depressive-like hunched posture. Housing indoors
   also affected circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-1 showed
   increased responsiveness to immune challenge, and IL-1 and TNF- showed
   reduced suppression by dexamethasone. Sensitivity of the
   anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 to immune challenge exhibited a
   relative increase from the first to the second round of indoor housing
   in animals housed in pairs, and a relative decrease in animals housed
   alone. Cytokine levels during indoor housing were positively correlated
   with duration of depressive-like behavior. Plasma cortisol levels
   increased but did not differentiate housing conditions or rounds.
   Results demonstrate a rapid induction and sensitization of
   depressive-like behavior to indoor individual housing, social buffering
   of sensitization, and associated inflammatory responses. This paradigm
   may provide a practical nonhuman primate model for examining
   inflammatory-mediated consequences of psychosocial stressors on
   depression and possible social buffering of these effects.}},

Title = {{Over-generalization in youth with anxiety disorders}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-85}},
Abstract = {{Over-generalization of dangerous stimuli is a possible etiological
   account of anxiety. Recently, we demonstrated it could result from
   alterations in early perceptual mechanisms, i.e., a fundamental change
   in the way the stimulus is perceived. Yet it is still unclear if these
   mechanisms already exist in youth, or develop only later. The purpose of
   this study was therefore to explore the mechanism of generalization in
   youth suffering from anxiety disorders. Children and adolescents with
   anxiety disorders and age-matched control participants underwent a
   conditioning task where a loss or gain outcome was associated with two
   well-separated tones. A generalization probe then followed in which
   different surrounding tones were presented and classified.
   Generalization curves and changes in discrimination abilities were
   compared between groups and according to the background variables. We
   found that patients had lower perceptual discrimination thresholds after
   conditioning, and tended to have wider generalization curve. Relative
   enhanced generalization was observed in adolescents with anxiety, in
   males, and as the level of anxiety rose. Our results suggest that
   over-generalization in anxiety can start already during adolescence, and
   may suggest that an early perceptual source can give rise to later more
   cognitive over-generalization during adult anxiety.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{86-91}},
Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that social support can buffer the
   physiological stress response, specifically cortisol reactivity. We use
   a developmental framework to review the importance of social buffering
   in early childhood, a period of heightened plasticity for programming of
   the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The social environment,
   in which parents play the largest role in early life, is a critical
   agent in the developmental trajectory of the HPA axis. A prevailing
   model of social buffering primarily focuses on the role of social
   support in the context of acute stressors and cortisol response. This
   review expands this model to provide evidence of the mechanism of social
   buffering, or lack thereof, across periods of chronic stress by applying
   the social buffer model to children involved in the child welfare
   system. We also highlight current interventions that capitalize on the
   mechanism of social buffering to modify HPA axis functioning across
   childhood. Last, we synthesize our findings using the social buffering
   framework to inform future targeted interventions.}},

Title = {{Associations between early life experience, chronic HPA axis activity,
   and adult social rank in rhesus monkeys}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{92-101}},
Abstract = {{Early life experience and socioeconomic status (SES) are
   well-established predictors of health outcomes in people. Both factors
   likely influence health outcomes via hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
   (HPA) axis regulation. However, it is unclear how early experience and
   HPA axis activity influence adult social status. We studied
   differentially reared female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta, N=90) as
   models to test the hypothesis that chronic HPA axis activity assessed
   via hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs) mediated the relationship
   between early life experience and adult social rank. We found that
   mother-peer-reared (MPR) monkeys acquired higher social ranks than
   either of the two nursery-reared (NR) groups (peer-reared, PR, or
   surrogate-peer-reared, SPR monkeys) (=-0.07, t((89))=-2.16, p=0.034). We
   also found that MPR HCCs were lower during the juvenile period at
   18months (F-(2,F-25)=3.49, p=0.047). Furthermore, for MPR but not NR
   monkeys, changes in HCCs from 18 to 24months (r((s))=-0.627, p=0.039)
   and adult HCCs (r((s))=-0.321, p=0.03) were negatively correlated with
   adult social rank. These findings suggest that chronic HPA axis
   regulation in juvenility, and perhaps in adulthood, may influence adult
   social status for primates that experience typical early rearing.
   However, early life adversity may result in dissociation between
   neuroendocrine stress regulation and adult social competence, which may
   be risk factors for adverse health outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Dogs are hypersocial with humans, and their integration into human
   social ecology makes dogs a unique model for studying cross-species
   social bonding. However, the proximal neural mechanisms driving
   dog-human social interaction are unknown. We used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging in 15 awake dogs to probe the neural basis for their
   preferences for social interaction and food reward. In a first
   experiment, we used the ventral caudate as a measure of intrinsic reward
   value and compared activation to conditioned stimuli that predicted
   food, praise or nothing. Relative to the control stimulus, the caudate
   was significantly more active to the reward-predicting stimuli and
   showed roughly equal or greater activation to praise vs food in 13 of 15
   dogs. To confirm that these differences were driven by the intrinsic
   value of social praise, we performed a second imaging experiment in
   which the praise was withheld on a subset of trials. The difference in
   caudate activation to the receipt of praise, relative to its
   withholding, was strongly correlated with the differential activation to
   the conditioned stimuli in the first experiment. In a third experiment,
   we performed an out-of-scanner choice task in which the dog repeatedly
   selected food or owner in a Y-maze. The relative caudate activation to
   food-and praise-predicting stimuli in Experiment 1 was a strong
   predictor of each dog's sequence of choices in the Y-maze. Analogous to
   similar neuroimaging studies of individual differences in human social
   reward, our findings demonstrate a neural mechanism for preference in
   domestic dogs that is stable within, but variable between, individuals.
   Moreover, the individual differences in the caudate responses indicate
   the potentially higher value of social than food reward for some dogs
   and may help to explain the apparent efficacy of social interaction in
   dog training.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional-intensity is a core characteristic of affective events that
   strongly determines how individuals choose to regulate their emotions.
   Our conceptual framework suggests that in high emotional-intensity
   situations, individuals prefer to disengage attention using distraction,
   which can more effectively block highly potent emotional information, as
   compared with engagement reappraisal, which is preferred in low
   emotional-intensity. However, existing supporting evidence remains
   indirect because prior intensity categorization of emotional stimuli was
   based on subjective measures that are potentially biased and only
   represent the endpoint of emotional-intensity processing. Accordingly,
   this study provides the first direct evidence for the role of online
   emotional-intensity processing in predicting behavioral
   regulatory-choices. Utilizing the high temporal resolution of
   event-related potentials, we evaluated online neural processing of
   stimuli's emotional-intensity (late positive potential, LPP) prior to
   regulatory-choices between distraction and reappraisal. Results showed
   that enhanced neural processing of intensity (enhanced LPP amplitudes)
   uniquely predicted (above subjective measures of intensity) increased
   tendency to subsequently choose distraction over reappraisal.
   Additionally, regulatory-choices led to adaptive consequences,
   demonstrated in finding that actual implementation of distraction
   relative to reappraisal-choice resulted in stronger attenuation of LPPs
   and self-reported arousal.}},

Abstract = {{Moral judgments are produced through the coordinated interaction of
   multiple neural systems, each of which relies on a characteristic set of
   neurotransmitters. Genes that produce or regulate these
   neurotransmitters may have distinctive influences on moral judgment. Two
   studies examined potential genetic influences on moral judgment using
   dilemmas that reliably elicit competing automatic and controlled
   responses, generated by dissociable neural systems. Study 1 (N = 228)
   examined 49 common variants (SNPs) within 10 candidate genes and
   identified a nominal association between a polymorphism (rs237889) of
   the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and variation in deontological vs
   utilitarianmoral judgment (that is, judgments favoring individual rights
   vs the greater good). An association was likewise observed for rs1042615
   of the arginine vasopressin receptor gene (AVPR1A). Study 2 (N = 322)
   aimed to replicate these findings using the aforementioned dilemmas as
   well as a new set of structurally similar medical dilemmas. Study 2
   failed to replicate the association with AVPR1A, but replicated the OXTR
   finding using both the original and new dilemmas. Together, these
   findings suggest that moral judgment is influenced by variation in the
   oxytocin receptor gene and, more generally, that single genetic
   polymorphisms can have a detectable effect on complex decision
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent brain imaging research has revealed oxytocin (OT) effects on an
   individual's brain activity during social interaction but tells little
   about whether and how OT modulates the coherence of inter-brain activity
   related to two individuals' coordination behavior. We developed a new
   real-time coordination game that required two individuals of a dyad to
   synchronize with a partner (coordination task) or with a computer
   (control task) by counting in mind rhythmically. Electroencephalography
   (EEG) was recorded simultaneously from a dyad to examine OT effects on
   inter-brain synchrony of neural activity during interpersonal
   coordination. Experiment 1 found that dyads showed smaller interpersonal
   time lags of counting and greater inter-brain synchrony of alpha-band
   neural oscillations during the coordination (vs control) task and these
   effects were reliably observed in female but not male dyads. Moreover,
   the increased alpha-band inter-brain synchrony predicted better
   interpersonal behavioral synchrony across all participants. Experiment
   2, using a double blind, placebo-controlled between-subjects design,
   revealed that intranasal OT vs placebo administration in male dyads
   improved interpersonal behavioral synchrony in both the coordination and
   control tasks but specifically enhanced alpha-band interbrain neural
   oscillations during the coordination task. Our findings provide first
   evidence that OT enhances inter-brain synchrony in male adults to
   facilitate social coordination.}},

Abstract = {{Interpersonal distance is central to communication and complex social
   behaviors but the neural correlates of interpersonal distance
   preferences are not defined. Previous studies suggest that damage to the
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is associated with impaired interpersonal
   behavior. To examine whether the OFC is critical for maintaining
   appropriate interpersonal distance, we tested two groups of patients
   with OFC damage: Patients with OFC lesions and patients with behavioral
   variant frontotemporal dementia. These two groups were compared to
   healthy controls and to patients with lesions restricted to the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Only patients with OFC damage showed
   abnormal interpersonal distance preferences, which were significantly
   different from both controls and patients with dorsolateral prefrontal
   damage. The comfortable distances these patients chose with strangers
   were significantly closer than the other groups and resembled distances
   normally used with close others. These results shed light on the role of
   the OFC in regulating social behavior and may serve as a simple
   diagnostic tool for dementia or lesion patients.}},

Abstract = {{Paying attention to others' faces and eyes is a cornerstone of human
   social behavior. The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system, central to social
   reward-processing in rodents and primates, has been proposed to mediate
   the capacity for affiliative reward in humans. We assessed the role of
   the human MOR system in visual exploration of faces and eyes of
   conspecifics. Thirty healthy males received a novel, bidirectional
   battery of psychopharmacological treatment (an MOR agonist, a
   nonselective opioid antagonist, or placebo, on three separate days).
   Eye-movements were recorded while participants viewed facial
   photographs. We predicted that the MOR system would promote visual
   exploration of faces, and hypothesized that MOR agonism would increase,
   whereas antagonism decrease overt attention to the information-rich eye
   region. The expected linear effect of MOR manipulation on visual
   attention to the stimuli was observed, such that MOR agonism increased
   while antagonism decreased visual exploration of faces and overt
   attention to the eyes. The observed effects suggest that the human MOR
   system promotes overt visual attention to socially significant cues, in
   line with theories linking reward value to gaze control and target
   selection. Enhanced attention to others' faces and eyes represents a
   putative behavioral mechanism through which the human MOR system
   promotes social interest.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity to suppress inappropriate thoughts, emotions and actions in
   favor of appropriate ones shows marked changes throughout childhood and
   adolescence. Most research has focused on pre-frontal circuit
   development to explain these changes. Yet, subcortical circuitry
   involving the amygdala and ventral striatum (VS) has been shown to
   modulate cue-triggered motivated behaviors in rodents. The nature of the
   interaction between these two subcortical regions in humans is less well
   understood, especially during development when there appears to be
   heightened sensitivity to emotional cues. In the current study, we
   tested how task-based cortico-subcortical and subcortico-subcortical
   functional connectivity in 155 participants ages from 5 to 32 impacted
   cognitive control performance on an emotional go/nogo task. Functional
   connectivity between the amygdala and VS was inversely correlated with
   age and predicted cognitive control to emotional cues, when controlling
   for performance to neutral cues. In contrast, increased medial
   pre-frontal-amygdala connectivity was associated with better cognitive
   control to emotional cues and this cortical-subcortical connectivity
   mediated the association between amygdala-VS connectivity and emotional
   cognitive control. These findings suggest a dissociation in how
   subcortical-subcortical and cortical-subcortical connectivity impact
   cognitive control across development.}},

Abstract = {{Repeated stimulus presentations are commonly used in social and
   affective neuroimaging tasks, but much remains to be known about how the
   brain processes such repetitions. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we found three groups of brain regions with distinct response
   patterns during repeated presentations of natural scene images. One
   group consisted of several limbic, paralimbic, frontoparietal and medial
   prefrontal areas and showed a habituation-like response across pleasant,
   unpleasant, and neutral image categories. A second group of occipital
   and adjacent posterior cortical regions showed a pattern of diminishing
   responses with repeated presentations of affective images but not for
   neutral images, and also plateaued to activation levels above baseline
   for all image categories. A third group involved bilateral frontopolar
   areas and the precuneus and exhibited a novel, non-monotonic response
   pattern. Activity was low on the first presentation, peaked upon the
   second presentation (first repetition) and subsequently diminished.
   These findings indicate that the transition from novel to increasingly
   familiar, and also arousing to less arousing, involves a broad array of
   neural mechanisms alluding to both passive learning and active inference
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of the mask stimulus is crucial in backward masking
   studies and we recently demonstrated such an effect when masking faces.
   Specifically, we showed that activity of the amygdala is increased to
   fearful facial expressions masked with neutral faces and decreased to
   fearful expressions masked with a pattern mask-but critically both
   masked conditions discriminated fearful expressions from happy
   expressions. Given this finding, we sought to test whether masked
   fearful eye whites would produce a similar profile of amygdala response
   in a face vs non-face context. During functional magnetic resonance
   imaging scanning sessions, 30 participants viewed fearful or happy eye
   whites masked with either neutral faces or pattern images. Results
   indicated amygdala activity was increased to fearful vs happy eye whites
   in the face mask condition, but decreased to fearful vs happy eye whites
   in the pattern mask condition-effectively replicating and expanding our
   previous report. Our data support the idea that the amygdala is
   responsive to fearful eye whites, but that the nature of this activity
   observed in a backward masking design depends on the mask stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{One important aspect of metacognition is the ability to accurately
   evaluate one's performance. People vary widely in their metacognitive
   ability and in general are too confident when evaluating their
   performance. This often leads to poor decision making with potentially
   disastrous consequences. To further our understanding of the neural
   underpinnings of these processes, this fMRI study investigated
   inter-individual differences in metacognitive ability and effects of
   trial-by-trial variation in subjective feelings of confidence when
   making metacognitive assessments. Participants (N = 308) evaluated their
   performance in a high-level social and cognitive reasoning task. The
   results showed that higher metacognitive accuracy was associated with a
   decrease in activation in the anterior medial prefrontal cortex, an area
   previously linked to metacognition on perception and memory. Moreover,
   the feeling of confidence about one's choices was associated with an
   increase of activation in reward, memory and motor related areas
   including bilateral striatum and hippocampus, while less confidence was
   associated with activation in areas linked with negative affect and
   uncertainty, including dorsomedial prefrontal and bilateral
   orbitofrontal cortex. This might indicate that positive affect is
   related to higher confidence thereby biasing metacognitive decisions
   towards overconfidence. In support, behavioural analyses revealed that
   increased confidence was associated with lower metacognitive accuracy.}},

   participants engaged in a cognitive social task involving different

   resonance imaging scanning to detect BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent)
   signals changes. Greater levels of activation occurred in several
   regions of the brain previously associated with social cognition when
   thinking about friends than when thinking about kin, including the
   posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the ventral medial prefrontal
   cortex (vMPFC). Linear parametric analyses across network layers further
   showed that, when it came to thinking about friends, activation
   increased in the vMPFC, lingual gyrus, and sensorimotor cortex as
   individuals thought about friends at closer layers of the network. These
   findings suggest that maintaining friendships may be more cognitively
   exacting than maintaining kin relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Negative life events (NLE) contribute to anxiety and depression
   disorders, but their relationship with brain functioning in adolescence
   has rarely been studied. We hypothesized that neural response to social
   threat would relate to NLE in the frontal-limbic emotional regions.
   Participants (N = 685) were drawn from the Imagen database of
   14-year-old community adolescents recruited in schools. They underwent
   functional MRI while viewing angry and neutral faces, as a probe to
   neural response to social threat. Lifetime NLEs were assessed using the
   `distress', `family' and `accident' subscales from a life event
   dimensional questionnaire. Relationships between NLE subscale scores and
   neural response were investigated. Links of NLE subscales scores with
   anxiety or depression outcomes at the age of 16 years were also
   investigated. Lifetime `distress' positively correlated with
   ventral-lateral orbitofrontal and temporal cortex activations during
   angry face processing. `Distress' scores correlated with the
   probabilities of meeting criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder or
   Major Depressive Disorder at the age of 16 years. Lifetime `family' and
   `accident' scores did not relate with neural response or follow-up
   conditions, however. Thus, different types of NLEs differentially
   predicted neural responses to threat during adolescence, and
   differentially predicted a de novo internalizing condition 2 years
   later. The deleterious effect of self-referential NLEs is suggested.}},

Abstract = {{It has recently been argued that symbolic systems evolve while they are
   being transmitted across generations of learners, gradually adapting to
   the relevant brain structures and processes. In the context of this
   hypothesis, little is known on whether individual differences in neural
   processing capacity account for aspects of `variation' observed in
   symbolic behavior and symbolic systems. We addressed this issue in the
   domain of auditory processing. We conducted a combined behavioral and
   EEG study on 2 successive days. On day 1, participants listened to
   standard and deviant five-tone sequences: as in previous oddball
   studies, an mismatch negativity (MMN) was elicited by deviant tones. On
   day 2, participants learned an artificial signaling system from a
   trained confederate of the experimenters in a coordination game in which
   five-tone sequences were associated to affective meanings (emotion-laden
   pictures of human faces). In a subsequent game with identical structure,
   participants transmitted and occasionally changed the signaling system
   learned during the first game. The MMN latency from day 1 predicted
   learning, transmission and structural modification of signaling systems
   on day 2. Our study introduces neurophysiological methods into research
   on cultural transmission and evolution, and relates aspects of variation
   in symbolic systems to individual differences in neural information
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Most of our social interaction is naturally based on emotional
   information derived from the perception of faces of other people.
   Negative facial expressions of a counterpart might trigger negative
   emotions and initiate emotion regulatory efforts to reduce the impact of
   the received emotional message in a perceiver. Despite the high adaptive
   value of emotion regulation in social interaction, the neural
   underpinnings of it are largely unknown. To remedy this, this study
   investigated individual differences in emotion regulation effectiveness
   during the reappraisal of angry faces on the underlying functional
   activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as well as
   the underlying functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI. Greater
   emotion regulation ability was associated with greater functional
   activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, greater
   functional coupling between activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex and the amygdala was associated with emotion regulation success.
   Our findings provide a first link between prefrontal cognitive control
   and subcortical emotion processing systems during successful emotion
   regulation in an explicitly social context.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies demonstrated that excitatory (high frequency) offline
   transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left and right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) modulates attention allocation on
   threatening stimuli in non-clinical samples. These studies only employed
   offline TMS protocol that did not allow investigating the effect of the
   stimulation on the early stage of threat processing. In this study, the
   role of the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in early
   threat processing was investigated in high and low anxious individuals
   by means of an inhibitory single-pulse online TMS protocol. Our results
   demonstrated the role of the left DLPFC in an early stage of threat
   processing and that this effect is modulated by individuals' anxiety
   level. The inhibitory stimulation of the left DLPFC determined a
   disengagement bias in high anxious individuals, while the same
   stimulation determined an attentional avoidance in low anxious
   individuals. The findings of the present study suggest that right and
   left DLPFC are differently involved in early threat processing of
   healthy individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Judgments of facial attractiveness are central to decision-making in
   various domains, but little is known about the extent to which they
   aremalleable. In this study, we used EEG/ERP methods to examine two
   novel influences on neural and subjective responses to facial
   attractiveness: an observer's expectation and repetition. In each trial
   of our task, participants viewed either an ordinary or attractive face.
   To alter expectations, the faces were preceded by a peer-rating that
   ostensibly reflected the overall attractiveness value assigned to that
   face by other individuals. To examine the impact of repetition, trials
   were presented twice throughout the experimental session. Results showed
   that participants' expectations about a person's attractiveness level
   powerfully altered both the neural response (i.e. the late positive
   potential; LPP) and self-reported attractiveness ratings. Intriguingly,
   repetition enhanced both the LPP and self-reported attractiveness as
   well. Exploratory analyses further suggested that both observer
   expectation and repetitionmodulated early neural responses (i.e. the
   early posterior negativity; EPN) elicited by facial attractiveness.
   Collectively, these results highlight novel influences on a core social
   judgment that underlies individuals' affective lives.}},

Abstract = {{Brain circuitry underlying defensive behaviors includes forebrain
   modulatory sites, e.g. the amygdala and hypothalamus, and midbrain
   effector regions, such as the deep/intermediate layers of the superior
   colliculus (DLSC). When disinhibited, this network biases behavior
   towards reflexive defense reactions. While well characterized in rodent
   models, little is known about this system in the primate brain.
   Employing focal pharmacological manipulations, we have previously shown
   that activation of the DLSC triggers reflexive defensive responses,
   including cowering, escape behaviors and defensive vocalizations. Here,
   we show that activation of the DLSC also disrupts normal dyadic social
   interactions between familiar pairs of monkeys. When the basolateral
   complex of the amygdala (BLA) was inhibited concurrent with DLSC
   activation, cowering behavior was attenuated, whereas escape behaviors
   and defensive vocalizations were not. Moreover, inhibition of the BLA,
   previously shown to produce a profound increase in dyadic social
   interactions, was unable to normalize the decrease in social behavior
   resulting from DLSC activation. Together these data provide an
   understanding of forebrain-midbrain interactions in a species and
   circuit with translational relevance for the psychiatry of anxiety and
   post-traumatic stress disorders.}},

   scientists. The focal point of this article is arguably his most
   influential paper on cerebellar classical conditioning entitled ``The
   Neurobiology of Learning and Memory{''} that appeared in Science in 1986
   and has been cited 700 times since its publication. Here, a summary of
   the initial Thompson laboratory research leading up to an understanding
   of the cerebellum and its critical role in memory traces will be
   discussed, along with conclusions from the Science article pertinent to
   cerebellar classical conditioning. The summary will also discuss how the
   original 1986 article continues to stimulate and influence new research
   and provide further insights into the role of the cerebellum in the
   neurobiology of learning and memory function relevant to studies of

Abstract = {{Averaging artifacts inherent in group acquisition curves can mask
   behavioral phenomena that are potentially revealing in terms of
   underlying neural mechanisms. To address this, we implemented a
   behavioral analysis of 106 rabbits trained over 4 sessions using delay
   eyelid conditioning. Group results showed the typical monotonic increase
   in conditioned responses (CRs). For most subjects CRs first appeared (as
   indexed by the criterion of 8 CRs in 9 trials) during the first 18
   trials of the second training session. Subdividing subjects according to
   the training block at which they met criterion revealed systematic
   differences in the subsequent rate that CR amplitudes increased, but not
   in asymptotic CR amplitudes. Subjects meeting criterion early in
   sessions showed more rapid increases in CR amplitude than those meeting
   criterion later in sessions. This effect was solely dependent on how
   early within a session criterion was met, as subjects meeting criterion
   at the beginning of the third and fourth sessions showed more rapid
   increases in CR amplitude than those meeting criterion after the first
   18 trials of the second session. The exceptions were the 7\% of the
   subjects that met criterion late in the first session. Their CR
   amplitudes increased at a rate similar to subjects meeting criterion
   early in sessions. These results suggest an interplay between
   consolidation processes and a previously reported short-term plasticity
   process that makes CR acquisition a nonmonotonic and complex function of
   the point during training sessions at which CRs first appear.}},

Abstract = {{Protein kinase M zeta (PKM-zeta), a constitutively active N-terminal
   truncated form of PKC-zeta, has long been implicated in a cellular
   correlate of learning, long-term potentiation (LTP). Inhibition of
   PKM-zeta with zeta-inhibitory peptide (ZIP) has been shown in many brain
   structures to disrupt maintenance of AMPA receptors, irreversibly
   disrupting numerous forms of learning and memory that have been
   maintained for weeks. Delay eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is an
   established model for the assessment of cerebellar learning; here, we
   show that PKC-zeta and PKM-zeta are highly expressed in the cerebellar
   cortex, with highest expression found in Purkinje cell (PC) nuclei.
   Despite being highly expressed in the cerebellar cortex, no studies have
   examined how regulation of cerebellar PKM-zeta may affect
   cerebellar-dependent learning and memory. Given its disruption of
   learning in other brain structures, we hypothesized that ZIP would also
   disrupt delay EBC. We have shown that infusion of ZIP into the lobulus
   simplex of the rat cerebellar cortex can indeed significantly disrupt
   delay EBC.}},

Abstract = {{Effective learning results not only in improved performance on a

   knowledge to novel, similar tasks. Using a modified serial reaction time
   (RT) task, the authors examined the ability to transfer to novel
   sequences after practicing sequences in a repetitive order versus a
   nonrepeating interleaved order. Interleaved practice resulted in better
   performance on new sequences than repetitive practice. In a second
   study, participants practiced interleaved sequences in a functional MRI
   (fMRI) scanner and received a transfer test of novel sequences. Transfer
   ability was positively correlated with cerebellar blood oxygen level
   dependent activity during practice, indicating that greater cerebellar
   engagement during training resulted in better subsequent transfer
   performance. Interleaved practice may thus result in a more generalized
   representation that is robust to interference, and the degree of
   activation in the cerebellum may be a reflection of the instantiation
   and engagement of internal models.}},

Abstract = {{Historically known for its key contribution to motor behavior, the
   cerebellum continues to break boundaries. Researchers have demonstrated
   the cerebellum also plays a role in learning, memory, and more recent
   evidence for contributions in language, attention, working memory,
   emotions, and social processes. Here, we present a study that adds to
   the list of nonmotor processes of the cerebellum. We used images of
   faces and outdoor scenes to examine the cerebellar response to familiar
   and novel stimuli. Participants were familiarized with a subset of
   stimuli, and then underwent functional MRI (fMRI) where they were
   presented with the previously stimuli and new stimuli while making
   ``old{''} and ``new{''} judgment. In a familiar versus novel contrast,
   familiar stimuli (faces and scenes combined) activated bilateral regions
   of the cerebellum including I-IV, V, VI, Crus I, and Crus II. When
   separated by type, familiar faces had greater activation of bilateral
   I-IV than novel faces. These results demonstrate the cerebellar role in
   determining familiarity and contribute to continuing research supporting
   cerebellar contributions to nonmotor processes.}},

Abstract = {{We recently showed that ventral striatal (VS) lesions abolished reward
   prediction errors that reflect changes in reward timing while leaving
   relatively unaffected errors that reflect changes in reward number. Here
   we extended those results by examining whether normal learning-related
   changes in firing to the reward-predictive cues in the same dopamine
   neurons were also disrupted by VS lesions. This analysis revealed that
   dopamine neurons recorded in VS-lesioned rats failed to show
   value-related changes in firing to the cues in timing but showed normal
   changes in number blocks. This effect suggests that the loss of
   reward-evoked error signals in the timing blocks impaired encoding of
   the cue value in downstream areas, which then supply these predictions
   to dopamine neurons at the time of cue presentation.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental task of sensory systems is to extract relevant social
   information from a range of environmental stimuli in the face of
   changing behavioral contexts and reproductive states. Neuromodulatory
   pathways that interact with such contextual variables are 1 mechanism
   for achieving this. In the mouse inferior colliculus (IC), a midbrain
   auditory region, the neuromodulator serotonin increases in females
   interacting with courting males, but events downstream of serotonin
   release have not been investigated. Here, we manipulated serotonin
   levels in female mice with the serotonin releaser fenfluramine or the
   serotonin depleter para-chlorophenylalaninemethyl ester (pCPA). Females
   were then exposed to an empty cage, a male partner, or a playback of
   courtship vocalizations, and the numbers of neurons in the IC with
   positive immunoreactivity for the immediate early gene product c-Fos
   were measured. The effects of drug treatments depended on social context
   and estrous state. Fenfluramine had greater effects in the nonsocial
   than in the partner social treatments. Females in proestrus or estrus
   and given fenfluramine had higher densities of c-Fos immunoreactive
   neurons, while females in diestrus had fewer immunoreactive neurons. The
   drug pCPA had the expected opposite effect of fenfluramine, causing a
   decreased response in pro/estrus females and an increased response in
   diestrus females. These findings show that the effects of serotonin on
   c-Fos activity in the IC of females is dependent on both external
   context and reproductive state, and suggest that these effects occur
   downstream of serotonin release.}},

Abstract = {{The first-line psychological treatment for anxiety disorders is exposure
   therapy, which can be modeled in the laboratory using fear extinction.
   In healthy women, estradiol levels predict return of fear following
   extinction, whereas low levels are associated with greater return of
   fear. Investigating whether estradiol is similarly associated with
   extinction in clinically anxious women may provide insight to mechanisms
   underlying symptom relapse following exposure therapy. In the present
   study, women with spider phobia and healthy women participated in a
   2-day fear conditioning and extinction procedure during a period of high
   or low estradiol levels. Skin conductance responses, shock expectancy,
   and valence ratings were measured throughout. Women exhibited comparable
   decreases in physiological arousal from conditioning to the end of
   extinction training on Day 1. However, compared to women with high
   estradiol, and irrespective of clinical status, women with low estradiol
   exhibited significant return of physiological arousal at extinction
   recall on Day 2, despite accurate ratings regarding the likelihood of
   shock. Low estradiol women also reported heightened threat expectancy
   and physiological responding during presentation of safety cues. These
   results may point to novel means of enhancing exposure therapy in women
   by timing treatment delivery during periods of higher estradiol levels.}},

Title = {{Participation of Progesterone Receptors in Facilitation and Sequential

Volume = {{130}},

Abstract = {{Sexual receptivity in female rodents induced by the sequential injection
   of estrogen and progesterone is followed by a period in which females do
   not respond behaviorally to a second administration of progesterone (P);
   this is known as sequential inhibition. It has been proposed that the
   induction of sequential inhibition by progesterone in rats depends on
   down regulation of the progesterone receptor (PR) in brain areas
   involved in the expression of female sexual receptivity. P is rapidly
   metabolized to a variety of 5 alpha- or 5 beta-ring A-reduced progestins
   (RPrg). These RPrg have little or no affinity for the PR. They stimulate
   sexual receptivity (lordosis) more potently than P itself in
   estrogen-primed rats and do not induce sequential inhibition. The
   purpose of the current study was to test the role of the PR in the
   facilitation of lordosis and sequential inhibition induced by P and the
   following RPrg: 5 alpha-pregnandione (5 alpha-DHP), 5 alpha,3
   beta-pregnanolone (5 alpha,3 beta-Pgl), 5 beta-pregnanedione (5
   beta-DHP), and 5 beta,3 alpha-pregnanolone (5 beta,3 alpha-Pgl) in
   ovariectomized (ovx) female mice primed with estradiol benzoate. The
   RPrg were tested in C57BL/6 mice and in a strain lacking the
   progesterone receptor expression (PRKO). Our results show that both
   facilitation and sequential inhibition of lordosis induced by
   progesterone require the presence of the progesterone receptor.
   Interestingly, some RPrg facilitate lordosis but do not induce
   sequential inhibition in female mice. Sexual receptivity induced by RPrg
   does not require the progesterone receptor. Thus, RPrg induce sexual
   receptivity, but they probably exert their effects through a different
   cellular mechanism that does not involve the progesterone receptor.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the studies focusing on the effect of stress on false memories
   by using psychosocial and physiological stressors yielded diverse
   results. In the present study, we systematically tested the effect of
   exogenous hydrocortisone using a false memory paradigm. In this
   placebo-controlled study, 37 healthy men and 38 healthy women (mean age
   24.59 years) received either 10 mg of hydrocortisone or placebo 75 min
   before using the false memory, that is, Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM),
   paradigm. We used emotionally charged and neutral DRM-based word lists
   to look for false recognition rates in comparison to true recognition
   rates. Overall, we expected an increase in false memory after
   hydrocortisone compared to placebo. No differences between the cortisol
   and the placebo group were revealed for false and for true recognition
   performance. In general, false recognition rates were lower compared to
   true recognition rates. Furthermore, we found a valence effect (neutral,
   positive, negative, disgust word stimuli), indicating higher rates of
   true and false recognition for emotional compared to neutral words. We
   further found an interaction effect between sex and recognition. Post
   hoc t tests showed that for true recognition women showed a
   significantly better memory performance than men, independent of
   treatment. This study does not support the hypothesis that cortisol
   decreases the ability to distinguish between old versus novel words in
   young healthy individuals. However, sex and emotional valence of word
   stimuli appear to be important moderators.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates to what extent social and competence traits are
   represented in a similar or different neural trait code. To localize
   these trait codes, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
   repetition suppression, which is a rapid reduction of neuronal responses
   upon repeated presentation of the same implied trait. Participants had
   to infer an agent's trait from brief trait-implying behavioral
   descriptions. In each trial, the critical target sentence was preceded
   by a prime sentence that implied the same trait or a different
   competence-related trait which was also opposite in valence. The results
   revealed robust repetition suppression from prime to target in the
   ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) given a similar (social) as well
   as a dissimilar (competence) prime. The suppression given a similar
   prime confirms earlier research demonstrating that a trait code is
   represented in the ventral mPFC. The suppression given a dissimilar
   prime is interpreted as indicating that participants categorize a
   combination of competence and social information into novel
   subcategories, reflecting nice (but incompetent) or nerdy (but socially
   awkward) traits. A multi-voxel pattern analysis broadly confirmed these
   results, and pinpointed the inferior parietal cortex, cerebellum,
   temporo-parietal junction and mPFC as areas that differentiate between
   social and competence traits.}},

Abstract = {{Endogenous opioids have complex social effects that may depend on
   specific receptor actions and vary depending on the stage of social
   behavior (e.g., seeking vs. responding to social stimuli). We tested the
   effects of a nonspecific opioid antagonist, naltrexone (NTX), on social
   processing in humans. NTX is used to treat alcohol and opiate
   dependence, and may affect both mu and kappa-opioid systems. We assessed
   attention (seeking), and subjective and psychophysiological responses
   (responding) to positive and negative social stimuli. Based on
   literature suggesting mu-opioid blockade impairs positive social
   responses, we hypothesized that NTX would decrease responses to positive
   social stimuli. We also tested responses to negative stimuli, which
   might be either increased by NTX's mu-opioid effects or decreased by its
   kappa-opioid effects. Thirty-four healthy volunteers received placebo,
   25mg, or 50mg NTX across three sessions under double-blind conditions.
   At each session, participants completed measures of attention,
   identification, and emotional responses for emotional faces and scenes.
   NTX increased attention to emotional expressions, slowed identification
   of sadness and fear, and decreased ratings of arousal for social and
   nonsocial emotional scenes. These findings are more consistent with
   anxiolytic kappa-antagonist than mu-blocking effects, suggesting effects
   on kappa receptors may contribute to the clinical effects of NTX.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) enhances desire to
   socialize and feelings of empathy, which are thought to be related to
   increased oxytocin levels. Thus, variation in the oxytocin receptor gene
   (OXTR) may influence responses to the drug. Here, we examined the
   influence of a single OXTR nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on responses to
   MDMA in humans. Based on findings that carriers of the A allele at
   rs53576 exhibit reduced sensitivity to oxytocin-induced social behavior,
   we hypothesized that these individuals would show reduced subjective
   responses to MDMA, including sociability. In this three-session, double
   blind, within-subjects study, healthy volunteers with past MDMA
   experience (N=68) received a MDMA (0, 0.75mg/kg, and 1.5mg/kg) and
   provided self-report ratings of sociability, anxiety, and drug effects.
   These responses were examined in relation to rs53576. MDMA (1.5mg/kg)
   did not increase sociability in individuals with the A/A genotype as it
   did in G allele carriers. The genotypic groups did not differ in
   responses at the lower MDMA dose, or in cardiovascular or other
   subjective responses. These findings are consistent with the idea that
   MDMA-induced sociability is mediated by oxytocin, and that variation in
   the oxytocin receptor gene may influence responses to the drug.}},

Abstract = {{We are sensitive to valence intensity in negative emotional stimuli, but
   not in positive emotional stimuli, a phenomenon known as the valence
   intensity effect. However, whether this valence intensity effect is
   processed similarly within different negative stimuli, e.g.,
   fear-inducing and disgust-inducing, remains unclear. In the present
   study, we investigated whether the valence intensity effects for fearful
   and disgusting stimuli were perceived in a unique way by using
   event-related potentials (ERPs). Electroencephalogram was recorded from
   22 participants as they performed a standard/deviant categorization task
   using extremely disgusting pictures, moderately disgusting pictures,
   extremely fearful pictures, moderately fearful pictures, and neutral
   pictures. The ERP analysis revealed that the extremely fearful stimuli
   elicited a larger amplitude N2 than moderately fearful stimuli, whereas
   the extremely disgusting stimuli elicited a smaller amplitude late
   positive component than moderately disgusting stimuli. This study is the
   first to provide evidence that fear and disgust may have different
   valence intensity effects, which was revealed at early attention
   allocation stages for fearful stimuli and at late emotional evaluation
   stages for disgusting stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Our prior research showed that faces and bodies activate overlapping
   regions of the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC). However, faces
   and bodies were nonetheless discriminable in these same overlapping
   regions when their spatial patterns of activity were classified using
   multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). Here we investigated whether these
   spatial patterns and their time courses were influenced by different
   categorization tasks. Participants viewed pictures of faces or headless
   bodies depicting a happy or fearful emotion. In one task, they
   categorized the picture as a face or a body regardless of emotion. In
   the other task, they categorized the emotion regardless of whether it
   was depicted by a face or body. Using a classifier trained on
   independent data, we found higher face-body classification accuracy for
   the emotion categorization task. The classifier was applied to each
   post-stimulus time-point to characterize the temporal course of
   classification. Accuracy initially rose equivalently above chance for
   both tasks, but then increased over a longer duration when participants
   categorized emotions. Thus, the temporal course of pattern differences
   between faces and bodies in VOTC was modulated by the behavioral goal of
   the observer, suggesting the top-down modulatory effect of task context
   on the category-selectivity activity in the VOTC.}},

Abstract = {{The use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) as a form of social
   interaction has become increasingly prevalent, yet few studies examine
   individual differences that may shed light on implications of CMC for
   adjustment. The current study examined neurocognitive individual
   differences associated with preferences to use technology in relation to
   social-emotional outcomes. In Study 1 (N=91), a self-report measure, the
   Social Media Communication Questionnaire (SMCQ), was evaluated as an
   assessment of preferences for communicating positive and negative
   emotions on a scale ranging from purely via CMC to purely face-to-face.
   In Study 2, SMCQ preferences were examined in relation to event-related
   potentials (ERPs) associated with early emotional attention capture and
   reactivity (the frontal N1) and later sustained emotional processing and
   regulation (the late positive potential (LPP)). Electroencephalography
   (EEG) was recorded while 22 participants passively viewed emotional and
   neutral pictures and completed an emotion regulation task with
   instructions to increase, decrease, or maintain their emotional
   responses. A greater preference for CMC was associated with reduced size
   of and satisfaction with social support, greater early (N1) attention
   capture by emotional stimuli, and reduced LPP amplitudes to unpleasant
   stimuli in the increase emotion regulatory task. These findings are
   discussed in the context of possible emotion- and social-regulatory
   functions of CMC.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined possible neural mechanisms underlying
   increased social interest in persons with Williams syndrome (WS). Visual
   event-related potentials (ERPs) during passive viewing were used to
   compare incidental memory traces for repeated vs. single presentations
   of previously unfamiliar social (faces) and nonsocial (houses) images in
   26 adults with WS and 26 typical adults. Results indicated that
   participants with WS developed familiarity with the repeated faces and
   houses (frontal N400 response), but only typical adults evidenced the
   parietal old/new effect (previously associated with stimulus
   recollection) for the repeated faces. There was also no evidence of
   exceptional salience of social information in WS, as ERP markers of
   memory for repeated faces vs. houses were not significantly different.
   Thus, while persons with WS exhibit behavioral evidence of increased
   social interest, their processing of social information in the absence
   of specific instructions may be relatively superficial. The ERP evidence
   of face repetition detection in WS was independent of IQ and the earlier
   perceptual differentiation of social vs. nonsocial stimuli. Large
   individual differences in ERPs of participants with WS may provide
   valuable information for understanding the WS phenotype and have
   relevance for educational and treatment purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety can have both detrimental and facilitatory cognitive effects.
   This study investigates the neural substrates of a replicated
   facilitatory effect of anxiety on sustained attention and response
   inhibition. This effect consisted of improved performance on the
   Sustained Attention to Response Task (a Go-NoGo task consisting of 91\%
   Go and 9\% NoGo trials) in threat (unpredictable electrical shock) vs
   safe (no shock) conditions. This study uses the same experimental design
   with fMRI and relies on an event-related analysis of BOLD signal
   changes. Findings reveal that threat-related cognitive facilitation
   (improved NoGo accuracy) is associated with greater activation of a
   right-lateralized frontoparietal group of regions previously implicated
   in sustained attention and response inhibition. Moreover, these same
   regions show decreased activation in the Go trials preceding NoGo
   errors. During NoGo trials, striatal activity is also greater in the
   threat vs safe condition, consistent with the notion of enhanced
   inhibitory processing under threat. These findings identify potential
   mechanisms by which threat of unpredictable shock can facilitate
   distinct cognitive functions. A greater understanding of the complex
   interaction of the anxious state and cognitive processes may have
   critical clinical implications.}},

Abstract = {{The debilitating effects of social dysfunction in many psychiatric
   disorders prompt the need for systems-level biomarkers of social
   abilities that can be applied in clinical populations and longitudinal
   studies. A promising neuroimaging approach is the animated shapes
   paradigm based on so-called Frith-Happ, animations (FHAs) which trigger
   spontaneous mentalizing with minimal cognitive demands. Here, we
   presented FHAs during functional magnetic resonance imaging to 46
   subjects and examined the specificity and sensitivity of the elicited
   social brain responses. Test-retest reliability was additionally
   assessed in 28 subjects within a two-week interval. Specific responses
   to spontaneous mentalizing were observed in key areas of the social
   brain with high sensitivity and independently from the variant low-level
   kinematics of the FHAs. Mentalizing-specific responses were well
   replicable on the group level, suggesting good-to-excellent
   cross-sectional reliability {[}intraclass correlation coefficients
   (ICCs): 0.40-0.99; dice overlap at P-uncorr < 0.001: 0.26-1.0].
   Longitudinal reliability on the single-subject level was more
   heterogeneous (ICCs of 0.40-0.79; dice overlap at P-uncorr < 0.001:
   0.05-0.43). Posterior temporal sulcus activation was most reliable,
   including a robust differentiation between subjects across sessions
   (72\% of voxels with ICC > 0.40). These findings encourage the use of
   FHAs in neuroimaging research across developmental stages and
   psychiatric conditions, including the identification of biomarkers and
   pharmacological interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Much of human learning happens in the social world. A person's social
   identity-the groups to which they belong, the people with whom they
   identify-is a powerful cue that can affect our goal-directed behaviors,
   often implicitly. In the present experiment, we explored the underlying
   neural mechanisms driving these processes, testing hypotheses derived
   from social identity theory. In a within-subjects design, participants
   underwent a minimal group manipulation where they were randomly assigned
   to an arbitrary ingroup. In two blocks of the experiment, participants
   were asked to complete a task for money while being observed by an
   ingroup member and outgroup member separately. Results revealed that
   being observed by an ingroup or outgroup member led to divergent
   patterns of neural activity associated with feedback monitoring, namely
   the feedback-related negativity (FRN). Receiving feedback in the
   presence of an ingroup member produced a typical FRN signal, but the FRN
   was dampened while receiving feedback in the presence of an outgroup
   member. Further, this differentiated neural pattern was exaggerated in
   people who reported greater intergroup bias. Together, the mere presence
   of a person can alter how the brain adaptively monitors feedback,
   impairing the reinforcement learning signal when the person observing is
   an outgroup member.}},

Abstract = {{The cross-generational transmission of mammalian sociality, initiated by
   the parent's postpartum brain plasticity and species-typical behavior
   that buttress offspring's socialization, has not been studied in humans.
   In this longitudinal study, we measured brain response of 45
   primary-caregiving parents to their infant's stimuli, observed
   parent-infant interactions, and assayed parental oxytocin (OT). Intra-
   and inter-network connectivity were computed in three main networks of
   the human parental brain: core limbic, embodied simulation and
   mentalizing. During preschool, two key child social competencies were
   observed: emotion regulation and socialization. Parent's network
   integrity in infancy predicted preschoolers' social outcomes, with
   subcortical and cortical network integrity foreshadowing simple
   evolutionary-based regulatory tactics vs complex self-regulatory
   strategies and advanced socialization. Parent-infant synchrony mediated
   the links between connectivity of the parent's embodied simulation
   network and preschoolers' ability to use cognitive/executive emotion
   regulation strategies, highlighting the inherently dyadic nature of this
   network and its long-term effects on tuning young to social life.
   Parent's inter-network core limbic-embodied simulation connectivity
   predicted children's OT as moderated by parental OT. Findings challenge
   solipsistic neuroscience perspectives by demonstrating how the
   parent-offspring interface enables the brain of one human to profoundly
   impact long-term adaptation of another.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive worry,
   autonomic dysregulation and functional amygdala dysconnectivity, yet
   these illness markers have rarely been considered together, nor their
   interrelationship tested longitudinally. We hypothesized that an
   individual's capacity for emotion regulation predicts longer-term
   changes in amygdala functional connectivity, supporting the modification
   of GAD core symptoms. Sixteen patients with GAD (14 women) and
   individually matched controls were studied at two time points separated
   by 1 year. Resting-state fMRI data and concurrent measurement of vagally
   mediated heart rate variability were obtained before and after the
   induction of perseverative cognition. A greater rise in levels of worry
   following the induction predicted a stronger reduction in connectivity
   between right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and enhanced
   coupling between left amygdala and ventral tegmental area at follow-up.
   Similarly, amplified physiological responses to the induction predicted
   increased connectivity between right amygdala and thalamus. Longitudinal
   shifts in a distinct set of functional connectivity scores were
   associated with concomitant changes in GAD symptomatology over the
   course of the year. Results highlight the prognostic value of indices of
   emotional dysregulation and emphasize the integral role of the amygdala
   as a critical hub in functional neural circuitry underlying the
   progression of GAD symptomatology.}},

Abstract = {{Friendships play a major role in cognitive, emotional and social
   development in middle childhood. We employed the online Cyberball social
   exclusion paradigm to understand the neural correlates of dyadic social
   exclusion among best friends assessed simultaneously. Each child played
   with their friend and an unfamiliar player. Event-related potentials
   (ERPs) were assessed via electroencephalogram during exclusion by friend
   and unfamiliar peer. Data were analyzed with hierarchical linear
   modeling to account for nesting of children within friendship dyads.
   Results showed that stranger rejection was associated with larger P2 and
   positive slow wave ERP responses compared to exclusion by a friend.
   Psychological distress differentially moderated the effects of friend
   and stranger exclusion such that children with greater psychological
   distress were observed to have larger neural responses (larger P2 and
   slow wave) to exclusion by a stranger compared to exclusion by a friend.
   Conversely, children with lower levels of psychological distress had
   larger neural responses for exclusion by a friend than by a stranger.
   Psychological distress within the dyad differentially predicted the P2
   and slow wave response. Findings highlight the prominent, but
   differential role of individual and dyadic psychological distress levels

Abstract = {{Being able to infer the thoughts, feelings and intentions of those
   around us is indispensable in order to function in a social world.
   Despite growing interest in social cognition and its neural
   underpinnings, the factors that contribute to successful mental state
   attribution remain unclear. Current knowledge is limited because the
   most widely used tasks suffer from two main constraints: (i) They fail
   to capture individual variability due to ceiling effects and (ii) they
   use highly simplistic, often artificial stimuli inapt to mirror
   real-world socio-cognitive demands. In the present study, we address
   these problems by employing complex depictions of naturalistic social
   interactions that vary in both valence (positive vs negative) and
   ambiguity (high vs low). Thirty-eight healthy participants (20 female)
   made mental state judgments while brain responses were obtained using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Accuracy varied based on
   valence and ambiguity conditions and women were more accurate than men
   with highly ambiguous social stimuli. Activity of the orbitofrontal
   cortex predicted performance in the high ambiguity condition. The
   results shed light on subtle differences in mentalizing abilities and
   associated neural activity.}},

Abstract = {{Decreased executive ability elicits racial bias. We clarified the neural
   correlates of how executive ability contributes to race perception by
   comparing young adults (YA) to a population with highly variable
   executive ability: older adults (OA). After replicating work showing
   higher race bias in OA vs YA and a negative association between bias and
   executive ability, a subsample of White YA and OA perceived Black and
   White faces and cars during functional magnetic resonance imaging. YA
   had higher executive ability than OA, and OA had higher variability in
   executive ability. When perceiving Black vs White faces, YA exhibited
   more dorsolateral prefrontal cortex recruitment-a region previously
   implicated in regulating prejudiced responses-than OA. Moreover, OA with
   relatively impaired executive ability had more amygdala activity toward
   Black faces vs OA with relatively intact executive ability, whereas
   responses to White faces did not differ. Both YA and OA with relatively
   intact executive ability had stronger amygdala-ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex connectivity when perceiving Black vs White faces. These findings
   are the first to disentangle age from executive ability differences in
   neural recruitment when perceiving race, potentially informing past
   behavioral work on aging and race perception.}},

Abstract = {{Given the spike in risky behaviors that accompanies adolescence, the
   need to examine the processes and contextual factors that influence
   disinhibition for adolescents is of great import. Using an emotionally
   salient cognitive control task, we examined how socially appetitive and
   aversive cues differentially affect behavioral inhibition across
   development. In Study 1 (N = 94, ages 8-30 years), we found that
   socially appetitive cues were particularly detrimental to inhibition, a
   finding driven by our adolescent sample. In Study 2 (N = 35, ages 12-17
   years), we sought to explore the neural processes implicated in
   suboptimal inhibition during adolescence. Replicating our behavioral
   findings from Study 1, socially appetitive cues again caused detriments
   to inhibition compared with socially aversive cues. At the neural level,
   increased activation in affective regions (amygdala and ventral
   striatum) while viewing socially appetitive relative to socially
   aversive cues was correlated with increases in disinhibition.
   Furthermore, both whole-brain and functional connectivity analyses
   suggest recruitment of affective and social-detection networks
   (fusiform, bilateral temporoparietal junction) may account for the
   increased focus on appetitive relative to aversive cues. Together, our
   findings suggest that adolescents show detriments in inhibition to
   socially appetitive contexts, which is related to increased recruitment
   of affective and social processing neural regions.}},

Abstract = {{Fearful faces are believed to be prioritized in visual perception.
   However, it is unclear whether the processing of low-level facial
   features alone can facilitate such prioritization or whether
   higher-level mechanisms also contribute. We examined potential biases
   for fearful face perception at the levels of perceptual decision-making
   and perceptual confidence. We controlled for lower-level visual
   processing capacity by titrating luminance contrasts of backward masks,
   and the emotional intensity of fearful, angry and happy faces. Under
   these conditions, participants showed liberal biases in perceiving a
   fearful face, in both detection and discrimination tasks. This effect
   was stronger among individuals with reduced density in dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex, a region linked to perceptual decision-making.
   Moreover, participants reported higher confidence when they accurately
   perceived a fearful face, suggesting that fearful faces may have
   privileged access to consciousness. Together, the results suggest that
   mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex contribute to making fearful face
   perception special.}},

Abstract = {{Mind-wandering, an ubiquitous expression of humans' mental life,
   reflects a drift of attention away from the current task towards
   self-generated thoughts, and has been associated with activity in the
   brain default network. To date, however, little is understood about the
   contribution of individual nodes of this network to mind-wandering.
   Here, we investigated whether the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
   is critically involved in mind-wandering, by studying the propensity to
   mind-wander in patients with lesion to the vmPFC (vmPFC patients),
   control patients with lesions not involving the vmPFC, and healthy
   individuals. Participants performed three tasks varying in cognitive
   demands while their thoughts were periodically sampled, and a
   self-report scale of daydreaming in daily life. vmPFC patients exhibited
   reduced mind-wandering rates across tasks, and claimed less frequent
   daydreaming, than both healthy and brain-damaged controls. vmPFC damage
   reduced off-task thoughts related to the future, while it promoted those
   about the present. These results indicate that vmPFC critically supports
   mind-wandering, possibly by helping to construct future-related
   scenarios and thoughts that have the potential to draw attention inward,
   away from the ongoing tasks.}},

   within the anterior DMN. On the other hand, remitted depressed

   algorithm correctly classified 92\% of the subjects into their

Abstract = {{In order to improve our understanding of how pictorial health warning
   labels (HWLs) influence smoking behavior, we examined whether brain
   activity helps to explain smoking behavior above and beyond
   self-reported effectiveness of HWLs. We measured the neural response in
   the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the amygdala while adult
   smokers viewed HWLs. Two weeks later, participants' self-reported
   smoking behavior and biomarkers of smoking behavior were reassessed. We
   compared multiple models predicting change in self-reported smoking
   behavior (cigarettes per day {[}CPD]) and change in a biomarkers of
   smoke exposure (expired carbon monoxide {[}CO]). Brain activity in the
   vmPFC and amygdala not only predicted changes in CO, but also accounted
   for outcome variance above and beyond self-report data. Neural data were
   most useful in predicting behavioral change as quantified by the
   objective biomarker (CO). This pattern of activity was significantly
   modulated by individuals' intention to quit. The finding that both
   cognitive (vmPFC) and affective (amygdala) brain areas contributed to
   these models supports the idea that smokers respond to HWLs in a
   cognitive-affective manner. Based on our findings, researchers may wish
   to consider using neural data from both cognitive and affective networks
   when attempting to predict behavioral change in certain populations
   (e.g. cigarette smokers).}},

Abstract = {{The ability to recognise the identity of others is a key requirement for
   successful communication. Brain regions that respond selectively to
   voices exist in humans from early infancy on. Currently, it is unclear
   whether dysfunction of these voice-sensitive regions can explain voice
   identity recognition impairments. Here, we used two independent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to investigate voice
   processing in a population that has been reported to have no
   voice-sensitive regions: autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our results
   refute the earlier report that individuals with ASD have no responses in
   voice-sensitive regions: Passive listening to vocal, compared to
   non-vocal, sounds elicited typical responses in voice-sensitive regions
   in the high-functioning ASD group and controls. In contrast, the ASD
   group had a dysfunction in voice-sensitive regions during voice identity
   but not speech recognition in the right posterior superior temporal
   sulcus/gyrus (STS/STG)-a region implicated in processing complex
   spectrotemporal voice features and unfamiliar voices. The right anterior
   STS/STG correlated with voice identity recognition performance in
   controls but not in the ASD group. The findings suggest that right
   STS/STG dysfunction is critical for explaining voice recognition
   impairments in high-functioning ASD and show that ASD is not
   characterised by a general lack of voice-sensitive responses.}},

Abstract = {{Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental illness characterized by
   problems with self-perception. Whole-brain neural activations in healthy
   women, women with AN and women in long-term weight recovery following AN
   were compared using two functional magnetic resonance imaging tasks
   probing different aspects of self-perception. The Social Identity-V2
   task involved consideration about oneself and others using socially
   descriptive adjectives. Both the ill and weight-recovered women with AN
   engaged medial prefrontal cortex less than healthy women for
   self-relevant cognitions, a potential biological trait difference.
   Weight-recovered women also activated the inferior frontal gyri and
   dorsal anterior cingulate more for direct self-evaluations than for
   reflected self-evaluations, unlike both other groups, suggesting that
   recovery may include compensatory neural changes related to social
   perspectives. The Faces task compared viewing oneself to a stranger.
   Participants with AN showed elevated activity in the bilateral fusiform
   gyri for self-images, unlike the weight-recovered and healthy women,
   suggesting cognitive distortions about physical appearance are a state
   rather than trait problem in this disease. Because both ill and
   recovered women showed neural differences related to social
   self-perception, but only recovered women differed when considering
   social perspectives, these neurocognitive targets may be particularly
   important for treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Neural habituation allows familiar information to be ignored in favor of
   salient or novel stimuli. In contrast, failure to rapidly habituate
   likely reflects deficits in the ability to learn that an environment is
   predictable, familiar and safe. Differences in habituation rate may
   underlie individual differences in the tendency to approach or avoid
   novelty; however, many questions remain unanswered. Given the importance
   of adaptive social functioning, here we tested whether habituation
   differences to social stimuli are associated with differences in social
   fearfulness, a trait that ranges from low social fear-the adaptive
   tendency to approach novel social stimuli-to high social fear-the
   maladaptive tendency to avoid novel social stimuli. Higher social
   fearfulness was associated with slower habituation across regions of the
   social brain, including the hippocampus, amygdala, ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, fusiform face area,
   primary visual cortex, and extrastriate visual cortex. Interestingly,
   habituation differences were driven by sustained amygdala-visual cortex
   interactions, but not deficient amygdala-prefrontal cortex interactions.
   Together, these findings provide evidence that a failure to filter
   social stimuli is associated with a key social trait. In light of the
   link between social fear and dysfunction, individual differences in
   habituation may provide an important neurobiological marker for risk for
   psychiatric illness, such as social anxiety disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Childhood maltreatment (CM) has been associated with altered brain
   morphology, which may partly be due to a direct impact on neural growth,
   e.g. through the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway.
   Findings on CM, BDNF and brain volume are inconsistent and have never
   accounted for the entire BDNF pathway. We examined the effects of CM,
   BDNF (genotype, gene expression and protein level) and their
   interactions on hippocampus, amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex
   (ACC) morphology. Data were collected from patients with depression
   and/or an anxiety disorder and healthy subjects within the Netherlands
   Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) (N = 289). CM was assessed using
   the Childhood Trauma Interview. BDNF Val66Met genotype, gene expression
   and serum protein levels were determined in blood and T1 MRI scans were
   acquired at 3T. Regional brain morphology was assessed using FreeSurfer.
   Covariate-adjusted linear regression analyses were performed. Amygdala
   volume was lower in maltreated individuals. This was more pronounced in
   maltreated met-allele carriers. The expected positive relationship
   between BDNF gene expression and volume of the amygdala is attenuated in
   maltreated subjects. Finally, decreased cortical thickness of the ACC
   was identified in maltreated subjects with the val/val genotype. CM was
   associated with altered brain morphology, partly in interaction with
   multiple levels of the BNDF pathway. Our results suggest that CM has
   different effects on brain morphology in met-carriers and
   val-homozygotes and that CM may disrupt the neuroprotective effect of
   BDNF.}},

   striking and distinctive theory of mind (ToM) deficit. More
   specifically, they had an inability to take into account someone else's
   belief unless they were explicitly instructed to tell what that other
   person thinks or what that person will do. These patients offer a unique
   insight into the causal link between a specific subregion of the TPJ and
   a specific cognitive facet of ToM.}},

Abstract = {{The current study utilized resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to examine how two important noncognitive skills, grit
   and growth mindset, are associated with cortico-striatal networks
   important for learning. Whole-brain seed-to-voxel connectivity was
   examined for dorsal and ventral striatal seeds. While both grit and
   growth mindset were associated with functional connectivity between
   ventral striatal and bilateral prefrontal networks thought to be
   important for cognitive-behavioral control. There were also clear
   dissociations between the neural correlates of the two constructs. Grit,
   the long-termperseverance towards a goal or set of goals, was associated
   with ventral striatal networks including connectivity to regions such as
   the medial prefrontal and rostral anterior cingulate cortices implicated
   in perseverance, delay and receipt of reward. Growth mindset, the belief
   that effort can improve talents, notably intelligence, was associated
   with both ventral and dorsal striatal connectivity with regions thought
   to be important for error-monitoring, such as dorsal anterior cingulate
   cortex. Our findings may help construct neurocognitive models of these
   non-cognitive skills and have critical implications for character
   education. Such education is a key component of social and emotional

Abstract = {{Introduction: Historically, emotion regulation problems have been
   reported as a common consequence of right prefrontal cortex (rPFC)
   damage. It has been proposed that the rPFC, particularly the rIFG, has a
   key role inhibiting prepotent reflexive actions, thus contributing to
   emotion regulation and self-regulation. This study is the first to
   directly explore this hypothesis, by testing whether damage to the rIFG
   compromises the voluntary modulation of emotional responses, and whether
   performance on inhibition tasks is associated with emotion regulation.
   Method: 10 individuals with unilateral right prefrontal damage and 15
   matched healthy controls were compared on a well-known response
   modulation task. During the task participants had to amplify and
   suppress their facial emotional expressions, while watching film clips
   eliciting amusement. Measures of executive control, emotion regulation
   strategies usage and symptomatology were also collected. Results: As a
   group, individuals with rPFC damage presented a significantly reduced
   range of response modulation compared with controls. In addition,
   performance in the suppression task was associated with measures of
   cognitive inhibition and suppression usage. Interestingly, these effects
   were driven primarily by a subgroup of individuals with rPFC damage, all
   of whom also had damage to the right posterior insula, and who presented
   a marked impairment in suppressing facial emotional expressions}},

   safety)) or aversive reinforcement (CS + (vic reinf)). During
   extinction, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) responses to the CS +
   (vic reinf) increased but decreased to the CS + (vic safety). This
   pattern of vmPFC activity was reversed during a subsequent fear
   reinstatement test, suggesting a temporal shift in the involvement of
   the vmPFC. Moreover, only the CS + (vic reinf) association recovered.
   Our data suggest that vicarious extinction prevents the return of
   conditioned fear responses, and that this efficacy is reflected by
   diminished vmPFC involvement during extinction learning. The present
   findings may have important implications for understanding how social
   information influences the persistence of fear memories in individuals
   suffering from emotional disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation theories posit that strategies like reappraisal
   should impact both the intensity and duration of emotional responses.
   However, research on reappraisal to date has examined almost exclusively
   its effect on the intensity of responses while failing to examine its
   effect on the duration of responses. To address this, we used inverse
   logit functions to estimate the height and duration of hemodynamic
   responses to negative pictures when individuals with recent life stress
   were instructed to use reappraisal either to decrease their negative
   emotion or to increase their positive emotion (relative to unregulated
   viewing of negative pictures). Several emotion-generative regions such
   as the amygdala, thalamus and midbrain exhibited decreases in duration
   of activation, even when controlling for differences in height of
   activation. In addition, whereas the amygdala exhibited both decreased
   activation height and duration when participants reappraised to decrease
   their negative emotion, it only exhibited decreased duration when
   participants reappraised to increase their positive emotion. These
   results indicate that emotion regulation alters the temporal dynamics of
   emotional responding and that models of reappraisal should accommodate
   whether reappraisal influences the height of activation, duration of
   activation or both, which may change based on the goal of the
   reappraisal strategy being used.}},

Abstract = {{The on-going (self-)monitoring of our behaviour is inextricably
   intertwined with the surrounding social context. In this study, we
   investigated whether a minimal group paradigm assigning individuals to
   arbitrary group categories is powerful enough to induce changes in
   behavioural, psychophysiological and event-related potential correlates
   of performance monitoring. Following arbitrary group assignment based on
   ostensible task performance and a group identification task, 22
   volunteers performed a flanker-task during both in-group and out-group
   contexts, while electroencephalography was performed. More errors were
   committed in the out-group compared with the in-group context.
   Error-related negativity amplitudes were larger for in-group compared
   with out-group errors. However, subsequent processing reflected in late
   Pe amplitudes and stimulus-driven conflict reflected in N2 amplitudes
   were not affected by the group context. Heart rate deceleration (during
   both correct and incorrect trials) tended to be more pronounced during
   the out-group compared with the in-group context. This surprising
   observation was corroborated by subjective ratings of performance
   satisfaction, in which participants reported higher satisfaction with
   their out-group performance. This study identified specific stimulus
   evaluation processes to be affected by a minimal group manipulation and
   demonstrated thereby transient top-down effects of a social context
   manipulation on performance monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{We adopted a cultural neuroscience approach to the investigation of
   self-enhancement. Western and Eastern participants made self-referent
   judgments on positive and negative traits while we recorded their
   electroencephalography signals. At the judgmental level, we assessed
   trait endorsement (judgments of traits self-descriptiveness) and
   reaction times (speed of such judgments). Participants endorsed more
   positive traits as self-descriptive and more negative traits as
   non-self-descriptive, although the magnitude of this effect (level of
   self-positivity) was higher in the Western than Eastern sample.
   Moreover, all participants responded faster to positive self-descriptive
   traits and to negative non-self-descriptive traits, indicating that the
   self-enhancement motive is equally potent across cultures. At the
   neurophysiological level, we assessed N170 and LPP. Negative traits
   elicited larger N170 among Easterners, indicating initial allocation of
   attentional resources to the processing of negative information.
   However, negative compared to positive self-descriptive traits elicited
   a larger LPP, whereas negative and positive non-self-descriptive traits
   did not differ in the LPP they elicited. This pattern generalized across
   samples, pointing to a pancultural physiological correlate of the
   self-enhancement motive.}},

Abstract = {{The oxytocin (OT) system, critically involved in social bonding, may

   Midlife male participants (N = 83) were randomly assigned to receive
   intranasal OT or placebo. In exploratory analyses, participants were
   also genotyped for polymorphisms in two genes critical for OT signaling,
   the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR rs53576) and CD38 (rs6449182 and
   rs3796863). Results showed that intranasal OT increased self-reported
   spirituality on two separate measures and this effect remained
   significant a week later. It also boosted participants' experience of
   specific positive emotions during meditation, at both explicit and
   implicit levels. Furthermore, the effect of OT on spirituality was
   moderated by OT-related genotypes. These results provide the first
   experimental evidence that spirituality, endorsed by millions worldwide,

Abstract = {{To not harm others is widely considered the most basic element of human
   morality. The aversion to harm others can be either rooted in the
   outcomes of an action (utilitarianism) or reactions to the action itself
   (deontology). We speculated that the human moral judgments rely on the
   integration of neural computations of harm and visceral reactions. The
   present research examined whether utilitarian or deontological aspects
   of moral judgment are associated with cardiac vagal tone, a
   physiological proxy for neuro-visceral integration. We investigated the
   relationship between cardiac vagal tone and moral judgment by using a
   mix of moral dilemmas, mathematical modeling and psychophysiological
   measures. An index of bipolar deontology-utilitarianism was correlated
   with resting heart rate variability (HRV)-an index of cardiac vagal
   tone-such that more utilitarian judgments were associated with lower
   HRV. Follow-up analyses using process dissociation, which independently
   quantifies utilitarian and deontological moral inclinations, provided
   further evidence that utilitarian (but not deontological) judgments were
   associated with lower HRV. Our results suggest that the functional
   integration of neural and visceral systems during moral judgments can
   restrict outcome-based, utilitarian moral preferences. Implications for
   theories of moral judgment are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Socioeconomic disadvantage such as poverty can increase distress levels,
   which may further make low-income mothers more vulnerable to
   difficulties in the transition to parenthood. However, little is known
   about the neurobiological processes by which poverty and maternal
   distress are associated with risks for adaptations to motherhood. Thus,
   the current study examined the associations between income and neural
   responses to infant cry sounds among first-time new mothers (N = 28)
   during the early postpartum period. Lower income was associated with
   reduced responses to infant cry in the medial prefrontal gyrus (involved
   in evaluating emotional values of stimuli), middle prefrontal gyrus
   (involved in affective regulation) and superior temporal gyrus (involved
   in sensory information processing). When examining the role of maternal
   distress, we found a mediating role of perceived stress, but not
   depressive symptoms, in the links between income and prefrontal
   responses to infant cry. Reduced neural responses to infant cry in the
   right middle frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus were further
   associated with less positive perceptions of parenting. The results
   demonstrate that perceived stress associated with socioeconomic
   disadvantages may contribute to reduced neural responses to infant cry,
   which is further associated with less positive perceptions of
   motherhood.}},

Abstract = {{The rejection of unfair offers in the ultimatum game (UG) indicates
   negative reciprocity. The model of strong reciprocity claims that
   negative reciprocity reflects prosociality because the rejecting
   individual is sacrificing resources in order to punish unfair behavior.
   However, a recent study found that the rejection rate of unfair offers
   is linked to assertiveness (status defense model). To pursue the
   question what drives negative reciprocity, the present study
   investigated individual differences in the rejection of unfair offers
   along with their behavioral and neuronal determinants. We measured
   fairness preferences and event-related potentials (ERP) in 200 healthy
   participants playing a computerized version of the UG with pictures of
   unfair and fair proposers. Structural equation modeling (SEM) on the
   behavioral data corroborated both the strong reciprocity and the status
   defense models of human cooperation: Not only more prosocial but also
   more assertive individuals were more likely to show negative reciprocity
   by rejecting unfair offers. Experimental ERP results confirmed the
   feedback negativity (FN) as a neural signature of fairness processing.
   Multilevel SEM of brain-behavior relationships revealed that negative
   reciprocity was significantly associated with individual differences in
   FN amplitudes in response to proposers. Our results confirm stable
   individual differences in fairness processing at the behavioral and
   neuronal level.}},

Abstract = {{Self-control is key to success in life. Initial acts of self-control
   temporarily impair subsequent self-control performance. Why such
   self-control failures occur is unclear, with prominent models
   postulating a loss of a limited resource vs a loss of motivation,
   respectively. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to
   identify the neural correlates of motivation-induced benefits on
   self-control. Participants initially exerted or did not exert
   self-control. In a subsequent Stroop task, participants performed worse
   after exerting self-control, but not if they were motivated to perform
   well by monetary incentives. On the neural level, having exerted
   self-control resulted in decreased activation in the left inferior
   frontal gyrus. Increasing motivation resulted in a particularly strong
   activation of this area specifically after exerting self-control. Thus,
   after self-control exertion participants showed more prefrontal neural
   activity without improving performance beyond baseline level. These
   findings suggest that impaired performance after self-control exertion
   may not exclusively be due to a loss of motivation.}},

Abstract = {{Social groups are organized along dominance hierarchies, which determine
   how we respond to threats posed by dominant and subordinate others. The
   persuasive impact of these dominance threats on mental and physical
   well-being has been well described but it is unknown how dominance rank
   of others bias our experience and learning in the first place. We
   introduce a model of conditioned social dominance threat in humans,
   where the presence of a dominant other is paired with an aversive event.
   Participants first learned about the dominance rank of others by
   observing their dyadic confrontations. During subsequent fear learning,
   the dominant and subordinate others were equally predictive of an
   aversive consequence (mild electric shock) to the participant. In three
   separate experiments, we show that participants' eye-blink startle
   responses and amygdala reactivity adaptively tracked dominance of others
   during observation of confrontation. Importantly, during fear learning
   dominant vs subordinate others elicited stronger and more persistent
   learned threat responses as measured by physiological arousal and
   amygdala activity. Our results characterize the neural basis of learning
   through observing conflicts between others, and how this affects
   subsequent learning through direct, personal experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Human voices consist of specific patterns of acoustic features that are
   considerably enhanced during affective vocalizations. These acoustic
   features are presumably used by listeners to accurately discriminate
   between acoustically or emotionally similar vocalizations. Here we used
   high-field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging in human listeners
   together with a so-called experimental `feature elimination approach' to
   investigate neural decoding of three important voice features of two
   affective valence categories (i.e. aggressive and joyful vocalizations).
   We found a valence-dependent sensitivity to vocal pitch (f0) dynamics
   and to spectral high-frequency cues already at the level of the auditory
   thalamus. Furthermore, pitch dynamics and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR)
   showed overlapping, but again valence-dependent sensitivity in tonotopic
   cortical fields during the neural decoding of aggressive and joyful
   vocalizations, respectively. For joyful vocalizations we also revealed
   sensitivity in the inferior frontal cortex (IFC) to the HNR and pitch
   dynamics. The data thus indicate that several auditory regions were
   sensitive to multiple, rather than single, discriminative voice
   features. Furthermore, some regions partly showed a valence-dependent
   hypersensitivity to certain features, such as pitch dynamic sensitivity
   in core auditory regions and in the IFC for aggressive vocalizations,
   and sensitivity to high-frequency cues in auditory belt and parabelt
   regions for joyful vocalizations.}},

Abstract = {{Video ads promoting condom use are a key component of media campaigns to
   stem the HIV epidemic. Recent neuroimaging studies in the context of
   smoking cessation, point to personal relevance as one of the key
   variables that determine the effectiveness of public health messages.
   While minority men who have sex with men (MSM) are at the highest risk
   of HIV infection, most safe-sex ads feature predominantly Caucasian
   actors in heterosexual scenarios. We compared brain respons of 45
   African American MSM to safe sex ads that were matched (i.e. `Targeted')
   to participants' sexual orientation and race, and `Untargeted' ads that
   were un matched for these characteristics. Ad recall, perceived
   `convincingness' and attitudes towards condom use were also assessed. We
   found that Targeted ads were better remembered than the Untargeted ads
   but perceived as equally convincing. Targeted ads engaged brain regions
   involved in self-referential processing and memory, including the
   amygdala, hippocampus, temporal and medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC)
   and the precuneus. Connectivity between MPFC and precuneus and middle
   temporal gyrus was stronger when viewing Targeted ads. Our results
   suggest that targeting may increase cognitive processing of safe sex ads
   and justify further prospective studies linking brain response to media
   public health interventions and clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The neurobiological alterations resulting from adverse childhood
   experiences that subsequently may lead to neglectful mothering are
   poorly understood. Maternal neglect of an infant's basic needs is the
   most prevalent type of child maltreatment. We tested white matter
   alterations in neglectful mothers, the majority of whom had also
   suffered maltreatment in their childhood, and compared them to a matched
   control group. The two groups were discriminated by a structural brain
   connectivity pattern comprising inferior fronto-temporo-occipital
   connectivity, which constitutes a major portion of the face-processing
   network and was indexed by fewer streamlines in neglectful mothers.
   Mediation and regression analyses showed that fewer streamlines in the
   right inferior longitudinal fasciculus tract (ILF-R) predicted a poorer
   quality of mother-child emotional availability observed during
   cooperative play and that effect depended on the respective interactions
   with left and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (IFO-R/L), with
   no significant impact of psychopathological and cognitive conditions.
   Volume alteration in ILF-R but not in IFO-L modulated the impact of
   having been maltreated on emotional availability. The findings suggest
   the altered inferior fronto-temporal-occipital connectivity, affecting
   emotional visual processing, as a possible common neurological substrate
   linking a history of childhood maltreatment with maternal neglect.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the brain correlates of decisionmaking and
   outcome evaluation of generalized trust (i.e. trust in unfamiliar social
   agents)-a core component of social capital which facilitates civic
   cooperation and economic exchange. We measured 18 (9male) Chinese
   participants' event-related potentials while they played the role of the
   trustor in a one-shot trust game with unspecified social agents
   (trustees) allegedly selected from a large representative sample. At the
   decisionmaking phase, greater N2 amplitudes were found for trustors'
   distrusting decisions compared to trusting decisions, which may reflect
   greater cognitive control exerted to distrust. Source localization
   identified the precentral gyrus as one possible neuronal generator of
   this N2 component. At the outcome evaluation phase, principal components
   analysis revealed that the so called feedback-related negativity was in
   fact driven by a reward positivity, which was greater in response to
   gain feedback compared to loss feedback. This reduced reward positivity
   following loss feedback may indicate that the absence of reward for
   trusting decisions was unexpected by the trustor. In addition, we found
   preliminary evidence suggesting that the decisionmaking processes may
   differ between high trustors and low trustors.}},

Abstract = {{Dopamine and serotonin have opponent interactions on aspects of
   impulsivity. Therefore we wanted to test the hypothesis that dopamine
   and serotonin would have opposing effects on speed-accuracy trade offs
   in a perceptual decision making task. Unlike other behavioral measures
   of impulsivity, perceptual decision making allows us to determine
   whether decreasing premature responses, often interpreted as decreased
   impulsivity, corresponds to increased behavioral performance. We
   administered GBR-12909 (a dopamine transporter blocker), escitalopram (a
   serotonin transporter blocker), or saline in separate sessions to 3
   rhesus macaques. We found that animals had slower reaction times (RTs)
   on escitalopram than on GBR-12909 or saline. However, they were also
   least accurate on escitalopram. Animals were faster, although
   nonsignificantly, on GBR than saline and had equivalent accuracy.
   Administration of GBR-12909 did cause animals to be faster in error
   trials than correct trials. Therefore, from the point of view of RTs the
   animals were less impulsive on escitalopram. However, the decreased

Abstract = {{The transcription factor deltaFosB (Delta FosB) is induced in the
   nucleus accumbens (NAc) by repeated exposure to drugs of abuse and
   natural rewards. Less is known about its role in other brain areas.
   Here, we compared the effects of mating versus cocaine history on
   induction of Delta FosB in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), an integral
   site for reproductive behavior, and in the NAc. Delta FosB
   immunoreactivity (ir) was increased in the MPOA of previously naive and
   experienced male rats that mated the day before euthanasia, compared to
   unmated controls and experienced males with recent mating abstinence.
   Western immunoblots confirmed that the 35-37-kDa isoform of Delta FosB
   was increased more in recently mated males. Conversely, previous plus
   recent cocaine did not increase Delta FosB-ir in the MPOA, despite an
   increase in the NAc. Next, a viral vector expressing Delta FosB, its
   dominant negative antagonist Delta JunD, or green fluorescent protein
   (GFP) control, were microinjected bilaterally into the MPOA. Delta FosB
   overexpression impaired copulation and promoted female-directed
   aggression, compared to Delta JunD and control males. These data suggest
   that Delta FosB in the mPOA is expressed in an experience-dependent
   manner and affects systems that coordinate mating and aggression.}},

Abstract = {{The nonapeptides oxytocin and vasopressin have been implicated in a
   variety of social behaviors. In zebra finches, oxytocin antagonists
   decrease pairing in both sexes, and pairing, in turn, increases
   expression of both mesotocin (the avian homologue of oxytocin) and
   vasotocin (the avian homologue of vasopressin). Increases in mesotocin
   and vasotocin mRNA are correlated with the amount of directed singing by
   males. Thus, in the present study, we examined the hypothesis that
   activation of cells containing nonapeptide receptors in song-related
   regions (ventral tegmental area, lateral septum, and medial preoptic
   nucleus) would also be correlated with directed singing in males. To
   rule out the possibility that these regions are involved in general
   pairing motivation, we also included females as subjects. In the ventral
   tegmental area, males had higher ZENK and V1aR than females and paired
   animals (regardless of sex) had higher ZENK and V1aR than did unpaired
   animals. In the medial preoptic nucleus, paired animals had higher ZENK
   than did unpaired animals, and there were no sex or pairing effects in
   the lateral septum. Only ZENK + V1aR in the medial preoptic nucleus was
   correlated with singing in males. These findings suggest that pairing is
   associated activation of nonapeptide receptors in the ventral tegmental
   area and the medial preoptic nucleus, but there is only partial evidence
   that courtship singing accounts for these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Sexually experienced female rats return to the male more quickly after
   intromissions, exhibit shorter interintromission intervals, and spend
   more time with the male rat during a test of paced mating behavior in
   comparison to naive rats. The present study tested whether these changes
   reflect heightened sexual motivation independent of receipt of
   vaginocervical stimulation and/or neurochemical changes in the medial
   preoptic area (mPOA). Ovariectomized, female rats were given estradiol
   benzoate and progesterone, and then received either 6 paced mating
   encounters (experienced) or 6 control exposures to an empty paced mating
   arena (naive). Experienced and naive rats received a no-contact partner
   preference test under oil vehicle and then under hormone on a different
   day. Hormonal status and sexual experience led to significantly higher
   preference for the male. Brains were collected 1 hr after both
   experienced and naive rats received paced mating to compare mPOA levels
   of Fos, a marker of neural activity, in response to copulation and
   nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme responsible for production of
   nitric oxide (NO). Expression of NOS was higher in experienced relative
   to naive rats, whereas Fos was comparable between the groups. The data
   are consistent with the idea that both sexual motivation and changes to
   the mPOA contribute to the shift in paced mating behavior induced by
   sexual experience.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{130}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{500-510}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence suggests that discrete neural networks that mediate
   emotion processing are activated when mothers respond to infant's images
   or cries. Accumulating data also indicate that natural variation in
   maternal caregiving behavior is related to maternal oxytocin (OT)
   levels. However, brain activation to infant cues has not been studied
   comparing mothers at disparate ends of the ``maternal sensitivity{''}
   spectrum. Based on observed mother-infant play interaction at 4-6 months
   postpartum in 80 antenatally recruited mothers, 15 mothers with the
   highest sensitivity (HSMs) and 15 mothers with the lowest sensitivity
   (LSMs) were followed at 7-9 months using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to examine brain responses to viewing videos of their
   ``own{''} versus an ``unknown{''} infant in 3 affect states (neutral,
   happy, and sad). Plasma OT measurements were taken from mothers
   following play interactions with their infant. Compared with LSMs, HSMs
   showed significantly greater brain activation in right superior temporal
   gyrus (STG) in response to own versus unknown neutral infant and to own
   happy versus neutral control. Changes in brain activation were
   significantly negatively correlated with plasma OT responses in HSMs
   mothers. Conversely, compared with HSMs, LSMs showed no significant
   activation difference in response to own infant separately or in
   contrast to unknown infant. Activation of STG may index sensitive
   maternal response to own infant stimuli. Sensitive parenting may have
   its unique profile in relation to brain responses which can act as
   biomarkers for future intervention studies that enhance sensitivity of
   maternal care.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence has shown that pups exposed to maternal separation
   exhibit profound changes in their emotional development, for example,
   early emergence of adult-like fear retention and fear inhibition
   (Callaghan \& Richardson, 2011; Callaghan \& Richardson, 2012). Numerous
   studies have shown that maternal separation is also a significant
   stressor for the mother. However, no studies have examined how a
   mother's prior parenting experience affects emotion development of pups
   in her subsequent litters. In this study female rats were bred and were
   then separated from their pups (maternal separation, MS) or remained
   with their pups (standard rearing, SR). After those pups were weaned,
   females were bred again with all pups from the subsequent litters being
   standard reared. Hence, these subsequent litter pups had mothers that
   were either previously separated (MSSUB) or not (SRSUB) from their prior
   litter. Those pups underwent fear conditioning at postnatal Day 17 and
   tested for fear retention, or had their fear extinguished and then
   tested for the renewal effect. The results show that the MSSUB infants
   respond similarly to infants that had been directly exposed to MS. That
   is, the MSSUB infants exhibited better retention of fear and more
   relapse after extinction compared with SRSUB infants. Further
   experiments demonstrated that MSSUB rats were not more anxious than
   SRSUB infants. Taken together, these experiments are the first to
   demonstrate that infant offspring exhibit atypical emotional development
   of fear conditioning (but not anxiety) as a consequence of their
   mother's prior exposure to stress.}},

Abstract = {{Cortisol release in a stressful situation can be beneficial for memory
   encoding and memory consolidation. Stimuli, such as odors, related to
   the stressful episode may successfully cue memory contents of the stress
   experience. The current investigation aimed at testing the potency of
   stress to influence startle responsivity 24 hr later and to implicitly
   reactivate emotional memory traces triggered by an odor involved.
   Participants were assigned to either a stress (Trier Social Stress Test
   {[}TSST]) or control (friendly TSST {[}f-TSST]) condition featuring an
   ambient odor. On the next day, participants underwent an auditory
   startle paradigm while their eyeblink reflex was recorded by an
   electrooculogram. Three different olfactory stimuli were delivered, one
   being the target odor presented the day before. Additionally, negative,
   positive, and pictures of the committee members were included for
   comparing general startle responsivity and fear-potentiated startle.
   Participants of the stress group demonstrated an enhanced startle
   response across all stimuli compared to participants of the control
   group. There were no specific effects with regard to the target odor.
   The typical fear-potentiated startle response occurred. Stressed
   participants tended to rate the target odor more aversive than control
   participants. Odor recognition memory did not differ between the groups,
   suggesting an implicit effect on odor valence. Our results show that
   acute stress exposure enhances startle responsivity 24 hr later. This
   effect might be caused by a shift of amygdala function causing
   heightened sensitivity, but lower levels of specificity.}},

Abstract = {{Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder
   (BD) are highly comorbid and share executive function and emotion
   processing deficits, complicating diagnoses despite distinct clinical
   features. We compared performance on an oculomotor task that assessed
   these processes to capture subtle differences between ADHD and BD. The
   interaction between emotion processing and executive functioning may be
   informative because, although these processes overlap anatomically,
   certain regions that are compromised in each network are different in
   ADHD and BD. Adults, aged 18-62, with ADHD (n = 22), BD (n = 20), and
   healthy controls (n = 21) performed an interleaved pro-and antisaccade
   task (looking toward vs. looking away from a visual target,
   respectively). Task irrelevant emotional faces (fear, happy, sad,
   neutral) were presented on a subset of trials either before or with the
   target. The ADHD group made more direction errors (looked in the wrong
   direction) than controls. Presentation of negatively valenced (fear,
   sad) and ambiguous (neutral) emotional faces increased saccadic reaction
   time in BD only compared to controls, whereas longer presentation of sad
   faces modestly increased group differences. The antisaccade task
   differentiated ADHD from controls. Emotional processing further impaired
   processing speed in BD. We propose that the dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex is critical in both processing systems, but the inhibitory signal
   this region generates is impacted by dysfunction in the emotion
   processing network, possibly at the orbitofrontal cortex, in BD. These
   results suggest there are differences in how emotion processing and
   executive functioning interact, which could be utilized to improve
   diagnostic specificity.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of group membership on brain responses to social exclusion
   have been investigated in adults, revealing greater anterior cingulate
   responses to exclusion by members of one's in-group (e.g., same-gender).
   However, social exclusion is a critical aspect of peer relations in
   youth and reaches heightened salience during adolescence, a time when
   social anxiety disorders are also emergent. While the behavioral and
   neural correlates of social exclusion in adolescence have been
   extensively explored, the effects of group membership on peer rejection
   are less clear. The current study used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) to investigate the differential neural correlates of
   being excluded by peers of one's same- versus opposite-gender during an
   online ball-toss game. Participants were a group of typically developing
   children and adolescents (7-17years). As predicted, anterior cingulate
   cortex showed a main effect of social exclusion versus fair play.
   However, unlike a previous adult study, this region did not show
   increased activation to same-gender exclusion. Instead, several regions
   differentiating same- versus opposite-gender exclusion were exclusively
   more sensitive to exclusion by one's opposite gender. These results are
   discussed in the context of adolescent socio-emotional development.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with genotypes that code for reduced dopaminergic brain
   activity often exhibit a predisposition toward aggression. However, it
   remains largely unknown how dopaminergic genotypes may increase
   aggression. Lower-functioning dopamine systems motivate individuals to
   seek reward from external sources such as illicit drugs and other risky
   experiences. Based on emerging evidence that aggression is a rewarding
   experience, we predicted that the effect of lower-functioning
   dopaminergic functioning on aggression would be mediated by tendencies
   to seek the environment for rewards. Caucasian female and male
   undergraduates (N=277) were genotyped for five polymorphisms of the
   dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene; they reported their previous history
   of aggression and their dispositional reward-seeking. Lower-functioning
   DRD2 profiles were associated with greater sensation-seeking, which then
   predicted greater aggression. Our findings suggest that
   lower-functioning dopaminergic activity puts individuals at risk for
   violence because it motivates them to experience aggression's
   hedonically rewarding qualities.}},

Abstract = {{Processing emotional body expressions has become recently an important
   topic in affective and social neuroscience along with the investigation
   of facial expressions. The objective of the study is to review the
   literature on emotional body expressions in order to discuss the current
   state of knowledge on this topic and identify directions for future
   research. The following electronic databases were searched: PsychINFO,
   Ebsco, ERIC, ProQuest, Sagepub, and SCOPUS using terms such as body,
   bodily expression, body perception, emotions, posture, body recognition
   and combinations of them. The synthesis revealed several research
   questions that were addressed in neuroimaging, electrophysiological and
   behavioral studies. Among them, one important question targeted the
   neural mechanisms of emotional processing of body expressions to
   specific subsections regarding the time course for the integration of
   emotional signals from face and body, as well as the role of context in
   the perception of emotional signals. Processing bodily expression of
   emotion is similar to processing facial expressions, and the holistic
   processing is extended to the whole person. The current state-of-the-art
   in processing emotional body expressions may lead to a better
   understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms of social behavior. At
   the end of the review, suggestions for future research directions are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have shown there exist attention biases for
   self-related and negative stimuli. Few studies, however, have been
   carried out to compare the effects of such stimuli on the neural
   mechanisms of early attentional alertness and subsequent cognitive
   processing. The purpose of the present study was to examine the temporal
   primacy of both self-related stimuli and negative stimuli in the
   neurophysiologic level. In a modified oddball task, event-related
   potentials of the deviant stimuli (i.e., self-face, negative face and
   neutral face) were recorded. Results revealed that larger P2 amplitudes
   were elicited by self-related and negative stimuli than by neutral
   stimuli. Negative stimuli, however, elicited shorter P2 latencies than
   self-related and neutral stimuli. As for the N2 component, self-related
   and negative stimuli elicited smaller amplitudes and shorter latencies
   than neutral stimuli, but otherwise did not differ. Self-related stimuli
   also elicited larger P3 and late positive component (LPC) amplitudes
   than negative and neutral stimuli. The pattern of results suggests that
   the primacy of negative stimuli occurred at an early attention stage of
   processing, while the primacy of self-related stimuli occurred at the
   subsequent cognitive evaluation and memory stage.}},

   polymorphism and its interaction with a self-report measure of childhood
   adversity as an index of negative environment. Outcomes were several
   personality measures relevant to social connection. Significant
   interactions were obtained, such that the negative impact of childhood

Abstract = {{Joint engagement (JE) is a state in which two people attend to a common
   target. By supporting an infant's attention to the target, JE promotes
   encoding of information. This process has not been studied in toddlers
   despite the fact that language and social interaction develop rapidly in
   this period. We asked whether JE modulates object discrimination in
   typically developing toddlers. In a pilot evaluation of a novel,
   naturalistic paradigm, toddlers (n=11) were introduced to toys by an
   examiner with or without JE. Toddlers then viewed images of the toys
   while high-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Analysis
   focused on the differential neural response to objects presented in the
   two conditions. EEG components of interest included frontal positive
   component (Pb), negative component (Nc), and positive slow wave.
   Toddlers discriminated between conditions with a larger Pb peak
   amplitude to stimuli presented with JE and a larger Nc mean amplitude to
   the stimuli presented without JE, reflecting greater familiarity with
   the toys presented socially. Our findings suggest that JE supports
   object learning in toddlers, and supports the potential utility of this
   novel paradigm in both the assessment and the potential to detect
   impairment in social learning among toddlers.}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests that heart rate variability (HRV) is a physiological
   indicator of the flexibility of the autonomic nervous system and can
   provide an objective measure of an individual's ability to appropriately
   match emotional responses to environmental demands. The present study
   investigated whether angry response to emotional stimuli was related to
   HRV, and whether manipulation of HRV using biofeedback could change the
   anger response in a healthy adult population. Fifty-eight participants
   received HRV biofeedback (n=29) or an active control condition (n=29).
   HRV measures included standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals
   (SDNN), low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) power, and was
   recorded across three sessions: baseline, training, and anger induction.
   The anger induction procedure resulted in increased subjective
   experience of anger, as well as physiological changes. The biofeedback
   group had higher HRV than active controls both during the training
   session (SDNN and LF HRV) and during anger induction (LF HRV). HRV
   during anger induction was significantly associated with self-reported
   emotional response for participants receiving biofeedback but not for
   active controls. Results provide support for HRV as an index of emotion
   regulation, specifically anger. Further research is needed to determine
   whether long-term HRV biofeedback can have a lasting effect on managing
   anger.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, cortisol has been suggested to moderate the positive
   relationship between testosterone and antisocial behavior. More
   precisely, high testosterone levels have been found to be related to
   aggressive or dominant behavior especially when cortisol levels were
   low. In the present study, we aimed to extend these findings to
   pro-environmental behavior as an indicator of prosocial behavior. In a
   first step, 147 male participants provided information on their everyday
   pro-environmental behavior by completing an online questionnaire on
   various energy-saving behaviors. In a second step, subjects provided two
   saliva samples for the assessment of testosterone and cortisol on two
   subsequent mornings after awakening. We found that testosterone was
   negatively related to pro-environmental behavior, but only in men with
   low cortisol. In conclusion, our findings provide first evidence for the
   joint association of testosterone and cortisol with everyday
   pro-environmental behavior. These results further reinforce the
   importance of considering interdependent hormone systems simultaneously
   rather than focusing on a single hormone.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation theories of empathy hypothesize that empathizing with others'
   pain shares some common psychological computations with the processing
   of one's own pain. Support for this perspective has largely relied on
   functional neuroimaging evidence of an overlap between activations
   during the experience of physical pain and empathy for other people's
   pain. Here, we extend the functional overlap perspective to the
   neurochemical level and test whether a common physical painkiller,
   acetaminophen (paracetamol), can reduce empathy for another's pain. In
   two double-blind placebo-controlled experiments, participants rated
   perceived pain, personal distress and empathic concern in response to
   reading scenarios about another's physical or social pain, witnessing
   ostracism in the lab, or visualizing another study participant receiving
   painful noise blasts. As hypothesized, acetaminophen reduced empathy in
   response to others' pain. Acetaminophen also reduced the unpleasantness
   of noise blasts delivered to the participant, which mediated
   acetaminophen's effects on empathy. Together, these findings suggest
   that the physical painkiller acetaminophen reduces empathy for pain and
   provide a new perspective on the neurochemical bases of empathy. Because
   empathy regulates prosocial and antisocial behavior, these drug-induced
   reductions in empathy raise concerns about the broader social side
   effects of acetaminophen, which is taken by almost a quarter of adults
   in the United States each week.}},

Abstract = {{Although children's social development is embedded in social
   interaction, most developmental neuroscience studies have examined
   responses to non-interactive social stimuli (e.g. photographs of faces).
   The neural mechanisms of real-world social behavior are of special
   interest during middle childhood (roughly ages 7-13), a time of
   increased social complexity and competence coinciding with structural
   and functional social brain development. Evidence from adult
   neuroscience studies suggests that social interaction may alter neural
   processing, but no neuroimaging studies in children have directly
   examined the effects of live social-interactive context on social
   cognition. In the current study of middle childhood, we compare the
   processing of two types of speech: speech that children believed was
   presented over a real-time audio-feed by a social partner and speech
   that they believed was recorded. Although in reality all speech was
   prerecorded, perceived live speech resulted in significantly greater
   neural activation in regions associated with social cognitive
   processing. These findings underscore the importance of using
   ecologically-valid and interactive methods to understand the developing
   social brain.}},

Abstract = {{Flexibility of associative learning can be revealed by establishing and
   then reversing cue-outcome discriminations. Here, we used functional MRI
   to examine whether neurobehavioral correlates of reversal-learning are
   impaired in White and Asian volunteers when initial learning involves
   fear-conditioning to a racial out-group. For one group, the picture of a
   Black male was initially paired with shock (threat) and a White male was
   unpaired (safe). For another group, the White male was a threat and the
   Black male was safe. These associations reversed midway through the
   task. Both groups initially discriminated threat from safety, as
   expressed through skin conductance responses (SCR) and activity in the
   insula, thalamus, midbrain and striatum. After reversal, the group
   initially conditioned to a Black male exhibited impaired reversal of
   SCRs to the new threat stimulus (White male), and impaired reversals in
   the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, midbrain and thalamus. In
   contrast, the group initially conditioned to a White male showed
   successful reversal of SCRs and successful reversal in these brain
   regions toward the new threat. These findings provide new evidence that
   an aversive experience with a racial out-group member impairs the
   ability to flexibly and appropriately adjust fear expression towards a
   new threat in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibitory control (IC) is a critical neurocognitive skill for
   successfully navigating challenges across domains. Several studies have
   attempted to use training to improve neurocognitive skills such as IC,
   but few have found that training generalizes to performance on
   non-trained tasks. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   to investigate the effect of IC training on a related but untrained
   emotion regulation (ER) task with the goal of clarifying how training
   alters brain function and why its effects typically do not transfer
   across tasks. We suggest hypotheses for training-related changes in
   activation relevant to transfer effects: the strength model and several
   plausible alternatives (shifting priorities, stimulus-response
   automaticity, scaffolding). Sixty participants completed three weeks of
   IC training and underwent fMRI scanning before and after. The training
   produced pre- to post-training changes in neural activation during the
   ER task in the absence of behavioral changes. Specifically, individuals
   in the training group demonstrated reduced activation during ER in the
   left inferior frontal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus, key regions in the
   IC neural network. This result is less consistent with the strength
   model and more consistent with a motivational account. Implications for
   future work aiming to further pinpoint mechanisms of training transfer

Abstract = {{Although the processes that underlie sharing others' emotions (empathy)
   and understanding others' mental states (mentalizing, Theory of Mind)
   have received increasing attention, it is yet unclear how they relate to
   each other. For instance, are people who strongly empathize with others
   also more proficient in mentalizing? And (how) do the neural networks
   supporting empathy and mentalizing interact? Assessing both functions
   simultaneously in a large sample (N = 178), we show that people's
   capacities to empathize and mentalize are independent, both on a
   behavioral and neural level. Thus, strong empathizers are not
   necessarily proficient mentalizers, arguing against a general capacity
   of social understanding. Second, we applied dynamic causal modeling to
   investigate how the neural networks underlying empathy and mentalizing
   are orchestrated in naturalistic social settings. Results reveal that in
   highly emotional situations, empathic sharing can inhibit
   mentalizing-related activity and thereby harm mentalizing performance.
   Taken together, our findings speak against a unitary construct of social
   understanding and suggest flexible interplay of distinct social
   functions.}},

   Fifty-six patients with BTE (27 patients with binge eating disorder and
   29 with bulimia nervosa) and 55 matched healthy control participants
   underwent event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging while
   performing both food and monetary incentive delay tasks. BTE patients
   exhibited reduced brain activation in the posterior cingulate cortex
   during the expectation of food and increased activity in the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex, anterior medial prefrontal cortex and posterior
   cingulate cortex during the receipt of food reward. These findings were
   relevant to food because we found no significant group differences
   related to monetary reward. In the patients, higher brain activity in
   the medial orbitofrontal cortex during the receipt of food reward was
   related to higher levels of trait food craving and external eating. BTE
   patients exhibited increased hedonic processing during the receipt of
   food reward. These findings corroborate the notion that an altered
   responsiveness of the reward network to food stimuli is associated with
   BTE.}},

Abstract = {{Human communication relies on the ability to process linguistic
   structure and to map words and utterances onto our environment.
   Furthermore, as what we communicate is often not directly encoded in our
   language (e.g. in the case of irony, jokes or indirect requests), we
   need to extract additional cues to infer the beliefs and desires of our
   conversational partners. Although the functional interplay between
   language and the ability to mentalise has been discussed in theoretical
   accounts in the past, the neurobiological underpinnings of these
   dynamics are currently not well understood. Here, we address this issue
   using functional imaging (fMRI). Participants listened to question-reply
   dialogues. In these dialogues, a reply is interpreted as a direct reply,
   an indirect reply or a request for action, depending on the question. We
   show that inferring meaning from indirect replies engages parts of the
   mentalising network (mPFC) while requests for action also activate the
   cortical motor system (IPL). Subsequent connectivity analysis using
   Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) revealed that this pattern of activation
   is best explained by an increase in effective connectivity from the
   mentalising network (mPFC) to the action system (IPL). These results are
   an important step towards a more integrative understanding of the
   neurobiological basis of indirect speech processing.}},

Abstract = {{Return of fear is a serious problem in exposure-based treatments of
   anxiety disorders. Renewal of the fear response may occur when
   re-encountering the conditioned stimulus within a novel context.
   Findings in rodents underpin the hippocampus' role in conditioned fear
   renewal in novel contexts, but it has yet to be investigated in humans.
   Forty-six healthy men took part in a 2-day, context-dependent, cued fear
   conditioning paradigm with fear acquisition, extinction learning (day 1)
   and extinction recall in the acquisition, extinction and a novel context
   one day later. Conditioned evaluative, skin conductance responses (SCRs)
   and blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses served as dependent
   variables. Context-dependent fear renewal was reflected in stronger
   conditioned SCRs. In the acquisition context, individuals with a higher
   renewal of conditioned SCRs showed stronger activation of the fear
   circuit. Hippocampal activation distinguished conditioned responding in
   the novel compared with the extinction context. Individuals with a
   stronger renewal of conditioned SCRs in the novel context showed
   increased effective connectivity of hippocampal activation foci with
   structures in the fear and extinction network. These results outline the
   pivotal role of the hippocampus and its connectivity in conditioned fear
   renewal in a novel context in humans and might have important
   implications for exposure therapy in anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Although social situations regularly involve multiple persons acting
   together, research on the mirror neuron system has focused on situations
   in which a single agent is observed. Therefore, the goal of the current
   study was to explore the role of the mirror mechanism in situations
   involving multiple agents. Specifically, we used transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) to investigate whether mirror activation is modulated
   by the number of observed agents. Based on group contagion research, we
   hypothesized that multiple agents would provide a stronger trigger to
   the motor system and would therefore produce a stronger mirror response
   than a single agent. Participants observed movements performed by a
   single hand or by two hands while TMS was applied to the primary motor
   cortex. The results confirmed that activation in the motor system was
   stronger for two hands. This suggests that input to the motor system
   increases as the number of agents grows. Relating back to group
   contagion, our study suggests that groups may be more contagious simply
   because their actions resonate louder. Given that the mirror mechanism
   has been linked to a variety of social skills, our findings additionally
   have important implications for the understanding of social interaction
   at the group level.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the brain processes underlying
   emotions during natural music listening. To address this, we recorded
   high-density electroencephalography (EEG) from 22 subjects while
   presenting a set of individually matched whole musical excerpts varying
   in valence and arousal. Independent component analysis was applied to
   decompose the EEG data into functionally distinct brain processes. A
   k-means cluster analysis calculated on the basis of a combination of
   spatial (scalp topography and dipole location mapped onto the Montreal
   Neurological Institute brain template) and functional (spectra)
   characteristics revealed 10 clusters referring to brain areas typically
   involved in music and emotion processing, namely in the proximity of
   thalamic-limbic and orbitofrontal regions as well as at frontal,
   fronto-parietal, parietal, parieto-occipital, temporo-occipital and
   occipital areas. This analysis revealed that arousal was associated with
   a suppression of power in the alpha frequency range. On the other hand,
   valence was associated with an increase in theta frequency power in
   response to excerpts inducing happiness compared to sadness. These
   findings are partly compatible with the model proposed by Heller,
   arguing that the frontal lobe is involved in modulating valenced
   experiences (the left frontal hemisphere for positive emotions) whereas
   the right parieto-temporal region contributes to the emotional arousal.}},

Abstract = {{Facial threat is associated with changes in limbic activity as well as
   modifications in the cortical face-related N170. It remains unclear if
   task-irrelevant threat modulates the response to a subsequent facial
   stimulus, and whether the amygdala's role in early threat perception is
   independent and direct, or modulatory. In 19 participants, crowds of
   emotional faces were followed by target faces and a rating task while
   simultaneous EEG-fMRI were recorded. In addition to conventional
   analyses, fMRI-informed EEG analyses and fMRI dynamic causal modeling
   (DCM) were performed. Fearful crowds reduced EEG N170 target face
   amplitudes and increased responses in a fMRI network comprising insula,
   amygdala and inferior frontal cortex. Multimodal analyses showed that
   amygdala response was present similar to 60 ms before the right fusiform
   gyrus-derived N170. DCM indicated inhibitory connections from amygdala
   to fusiform gyrus, strengthened when fearful crowds preceded a target
   face. Results demonstrated the suppressing influence of task-irrelevant
   fearful crowds on subsequent face processing. The amygdala may be
   sensitive to task-irrelevant fearful crowds and subsequently strengthen
   its inhibitory influence on face-responsive fusiform N170 generators.
   This provides spatiotemporal evidence for a feedback mechanism of the
   amygdala by narrowing attention in order to focus on potential threats.}},

Abstract = {{Hundreds of studies have found that humans' decisions are strongly
   influenced by the opinions of others, even when making simple perceptual
   decisions. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether this effect can be
   explained by social influence biasing (early) perceptual processes. We
   employed stimulus evoked potentials, lateralized readiness potentials
   (LRPs) and a diffusion model analysis of reaction time data to uncover
   the neurocognitive processes underlying social conformity in perceptual
   decision-making. The diffusion model analysis showed that social
   conformity was due to a biased uptake of stimulus information and
   accompanied by more careful stimulus processing. As indicated by larger
   N1-amplitudes, social influence increased early attentional resources
   for stimulus identification and discrimination. Furthermore, LRP
   analyses revealed that stimulus processing was biased even in cases of
   non-conformity. In conclusion, our results suggest that the opinion of
   others can cause individuals to selectively process stimulus information
   supporting this opinion, thereby inducing social conformity. This effect
   is present even when individuals do not blindly follow the majority but
   rather carefully process stimulus information.}},

   and cortisol levels during pregnancy predict cord blood DNA methylation
   of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR). We collected cord blood of 39 babies
   born to mothers participating in a cross-sectional study (N = 100)
   conducted in Basel, Switzerland (2007-10). Mothers completed the
   Inventory of Life Events (second trimester: T2), the Edinburgh Postnatal
   Depression Scale (EPDS, third trimester: T3), the Trier Inventory of
   Chronic Stress (TICS-K, 1-3 weeks postpartum) and provided saliva
   samples (T2, T3) for maternal cortisol profiles, as computed by the area
   under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) or increase (AUCi) for the
   cortisol awakening response (CAR) and for diurnal cortisol profiles
   (DAY). OXTR DNA methylation was quantified using Sequenom EpiTYPER. The
   number of stressful life events (P = 0.032), EPDS score (P = 0.007) and
   cortisol AUCgs at T2 (CAR: P = 0.020; DAY: P = 0.024) were negatively
   associated with OXTR DNA methylation. Our findings suggest that distinct
   prenatal adversities predict decreased DNA methylation in a gene that is
   relevant for childbirth, maternal behavior and wellbeing of mother and
   offspring. If a reduced OXTR methylation increases OXTR expression, our
   findings could suggest an epigenetic adaptation to an adverse early
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of evidence in animals and humans implicates the amygdala
   in promoting memory for arousing experiences. Although the amygdala can
   trigger threat-related noradrenergic-sympathetic arousal, in humans
   amygdala activation and noradrenergic-sympathetic arousal do not always
   concur. This raises the question how these two processes play a role in
   enhancing emotional declarative memory. This study was designed to
   disentangle these processes in a combined
   subsequent-memory/fear-conditioning paradigm with neutral items
   belonging to two conceptual categories as conditioned stimuli.
   Functional MRI, skin conductance (index of sympathetic activity), and
   pupil dilation (indirect index of central noradrenergic activity) were
   acquired throughout procedures. Recognition memory for individual items
   was tested 24 h later. We found that pupil dilation and skin conductance
   responses were higher on CS+ (associated with a shock) compared with CS-
   trials, irrespective of later memory for those items. By contrast,
   amygdala activity was only higher for CS+ items that were later
   confidently remembered compared with CS+ items that were later
   forgotten. Thus, amygdala activity and not noradrenergic-sympathetic
   arousal, predicted enhanced declarative item memory. This dissociation
   is in line with animal models stating that the amygdala integrates
   arousal-related neuromodulatory changes to alter mnemonic processes
   elsewhere in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Reward feedback following visual search causes the visual
   characteristics of targets to become salient and attention-drawing, but
   little is known about the mechanisms underlying this value-driven
   capture effect. Here, we use transcranial random noise stimulation
   (tRNS) to demonstrate that such reward potentiation involves induced
   plasticity in visual cortex. Human participants completed a
   feature-search reward-learning task involving the selection of a red or
   green colored target presented among distractors of various color. Each
   correct trial garnered reward and the magnitude of reward was determined
   by the color of the target. Three groups completed this task: two groups
   received tRNS over either occipital or frontal cortex, and the third
   group received sham stimulation as a control. In a subsequent test phase
   of the experiment participants searched for a unique shape presented
   among colored distractors. During the test phase, no tRNS was applied
   and no reward was available. However, in some trials a single distractor
   had color matching that associated with reward during training. Search
   for the target was impacted by the presence of such reward-associated
   distractors in the occipital stimulation group, demonstrating that
   plasticity in visual cortex contributes to value-driven attentional

Abstract = {{Recent neuroimaging work has identified a network of regions that work
   in concert to update impressions of other people, particularly in
   response to inconsistent behavior. However, the specific functional
   contributions of these regions to the updating process remain unclear.
   Using fMRI, we tested whether increases in activity triggered by
   inconsistent behavior reflect changes in the stored representations of
   other people in response to behavioral inconsistency, or merely a
   response to the inconsistency itself. Participants encountered a series
   of individuals whose behavior either changed in an attributionally
   meaningful fashion or was merely inconsistent with the immediately
   preceding behavior. We observed that left ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex (vlPFC) and left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) were preferentially
   recruited in response to unexpected, immoral behavior, whereas a
   separate set of regions (including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex,
   posterior cingulate cortex and temporoparietal junction/inferior
   parietal lobule) was preferentially recruited in response to more
   mundane inconsistencies in behavior. These results shed light on the
   distributed systems supporting impression updating. Specifically, while
   many regions supporting updating may primarily respond to
   moment-to-moment changes in behavior, a subset of regions (e.g. vlPFC
   and IFG) may contribute to updating person representations in response
   to trait-relevant changes in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in 26 right-handed
   students while they detected pictures of animals intermixed with those
   of familiar objects, faces and faces-in-things (FITs). The face-specific
   N170 ERP component over the right hemisphere was larger in response to
   faces and FITs than to objects. The vertex positive potential (VPP)
   showed a difference in FIT encoding processes between males and females
   at frontal sites; while for men, the FIT stimuli elicited a VPP of
   intermediate amplitude (between that for faces and objects), for women,
   there was no difference in VPP responses to faces or FITs, suggesting a
   marked anthropomorphization of objects in women. SwLORETA source
   reconstructions carried out to estimate the intracortical generators of
   ERPs in the 150-190 ms time window showed how, in the female brain, FIT
   perception was associated with the activation of brain areas involved in
   the affective processing of faces (right STS, BA22; posterior cingulate
   cortex, BA22; and orbitofrontal cortex, BA10) in addition to regions
   linked to shape processing (left cuneus, BA18/30). Conversely, in the
   men, the activation of occipito/parietal regions was prevalent, with a
   considerably smaller activation of BA10. The data suggest that the
   female brain is more inclined to anthropomorphize perfectly real objects
   compared to the male brain.}},

Abstract = {{Theory of mind, or mental state reasoning, may be particularly useful
   for making sense of unexpected events. Here, we investigated unexpected
   behavior across both social and non-social contexts in order to
   characterize the precise role of theory of mind in processing unexpected
   events. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine how
   people respond to unexpected outcomes when initial expectations were
   based on (i) an object's prior behavior, (ii) an agent's prior behavior
   and (iii) an agent's mental states. Consistent with prior work, brain
   regions for theory of mind were preferentially recruited when people
   first formed expectations about social agents vs non-social objects.
   Critically, unexpected vs expected outcomes elicited greater activity in
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which also discriminated in its spatial
   pattern of activity between unexpected and expected outcomes for social
   events. In contrast, social vs non-social events elicited greater
   activity in precuneus across both expected and unexpected outcomes.
   Finally, given prior information about an agent's behavior, unexpected
   vs expected outcomes elicited an especially robust response in right
   temporoparietal junction, and the magnitude of this difference across
   participants correlated negatively with autistic-like traits. Together,
   these findings illuminate the distinct contributions of brain regions

Abstract = {{Both self-control and emotion regulation enable individuals to adapt to
   external circumstances and social contexts, and both are assumed to rely
   on the overlapping neural resources. Here, we tested whether high
   self-reported self-control is related to successful emotion regulation
   on the behavioral and neural level. One hundred eight participants
   completed three self-control questionnaires and regulated their negative
   emotions during functional magnetic resonance imaging using reappraisal
   (distancing). Trait self-control correlated positively with successful
   emotion regulation both subjectively and neurally, as indicated by
   online ratings of negative emotions and functional connectivity strength
   between the amygdala and prefrontal areas, respectively. This stronger
   overall connectivity of the left amygdala was related to more successful
   subjective emotion regulation. Comparing amygdala activity over time
   showed that high self-controllers successfully maintained
   down-regulation of the left amygdala over time, while low
   self-controllers failed to down-regulate towards the end of the
   experiment. This indicates that high self-controllers are better at
   maintaining a motivated state supporting emotion regulation over time.
   Our results support assumptions concerning a close relation of
   self-control and emotion regulation as two domains of behavioral
   control. They further indicate that individual differences in functional
   connectivity between task-related brain areas directly relate to
   differences in trait self-control.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally the mirror neuron system (MNS) only includes premotor and
   posterior parietal cortices. However, somatosensory cortices, BA1/2 in
   particular, are also activated during action execution and observation.
   Here, we examine whether BA1/2 and the parietofrontal MNS integrate
   information by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)guided
   continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to perturb BA1/2. Measuring
   brain activity using fMRI while participants are under the influence of
   cTBS shows local cTBS effects in BA1/2 varied, with some participants
   showing decreases and others increases in the BOLD response to viewing
   actions vs control stimuli. We show how measuring cTBS effects using
   fMRI can harness this variance using a whole-brain regression. This
   analysis identifies brain regions exchanging action-specific information
   with BA1/2 by mapping voxels away from the coil with cTBS-induced,
   action-observation-specific BOLD contrast changes that mirror those
   under the coil. This reveals BA1/2 exchanges action-specific information
   with premotor, posterior parietal and temporal nodes of the MNS during
   action observation. Although anatomical connections between BA1/2 and
   these regions are well known, this is the first demonstration that these
   connections carry action-specific signals during observation and hence,
   that BA1/2 plays a causal role in the human MNS.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in oxytocin (OXT) signaling is associated with individual
   differences in sex-specific social behavior across species. The effects
   of OXT signaling on social behavior are, in part, mediated through its
   modulation of amygdala function. Here, we use imaging genetics to
   examine sex-specific effects of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in
   the human oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR; rs1042778, rs53576 and
   rs2254298) on threat-related amygdala reactivity and social behavior in
   406 Caucasians. Analyses revealed that among men but not women, OXTR
   rs1042778 TT genotype was associated with increased right amygdala
   reactivity to angry facial expressions, which was uniquely related to
   higher levels of antisocial behavior among men. Moderated meditation
   analysis suggested a trending indirect effect of OXTR rs1042778 TT
   genotype on higher antisocial behavior via increased right amygdala
   reactivity to angry facial expressions in men. Our results provide
   evidence linking genetic variation in OXT signaling to individual
   differences in amygdala function. The results further suggest that these
   pathways may be uniquely important in shaping antisocial behavior in
   men.}},

Abstract = {{Distraction and rumination are distinct response styles that determine
   how an individual deals with negative thoughts and feelings. Rumination
   is accompanied by an elevated self-focus, which is associated with
   increased resting state functional connectivity and decreased reactivity
   within the default mode network. Interestingly, the NMDA receptor
   antagonist ketamine reduces functional connectivity in this network,
   while its effects on blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD) responses
   during stimulus perception are not known. Ketamine might lead to a more
   variable processing of the external world with an attenuated self-focus
   by reducing the resting state connectivity. Here, we used an emotional
   picture-viewing task in combination with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to test the hypothesis that a single ketamine administration to
   healthy subjects increases BOLD reactivity to negative stimuli. We found
   a region specific increase in BOLD reactivity in the pregenual anterior
   cingulate cortex and not in a posterior control region after ketamine
   compared with placebo administration. Moreover, a linear regression
   revealed that the increase in BOLD reactivity was more pronounced for
   subjects with a low ability to apply distraction during negative
   experiences. Our results implicate that ketamine attenuates a
   potentially pathological increased self-focus during negative
   experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Competitive decisionmakingmay require controlling and calculative
   mind-sets. Weexamined this possibility in repeated predator-prey
   contests by up-or down-regulating the individual's right inferior
   frontal gyrus (rIFG), a brain region involved in impulse inhibition and
   mentalizing. Following brain stimulation, subjects invested as predator
   or prey against a non-treated antagonist. Relative to sham-treatment (i)
   prey-defense was relatively frequent, strong and unaffected by
   stimulation, (ii) down-regulating predator rIFG produced a high-firing
   strategy-predators earned more because they attacked more frequently,
   while (iii) up-regulating predator rIFG produced a track-and-attack
   strategy-predators earned more because they attacked especially when
   their (non-stimulated) antagonist lowered its prey-defense. Results
   suggest that calculative mindsets are not needed to compete effectively,
   especially not when the goal is to survive. Enhanced prefrontal control
   enables individuals to appear less aggressive without sacrificing
   competitive effectiveness-it provides human predators with an iron fist
   in a velvet glove.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with high anxiety sensitivity (AS) have an increased risk of
   developing anxiety disorders and are more biased in how they process
   fear-related stimuli. This study investigates the neural correlates of
   fear-related words and word associations in high-and low-AS individuals.
   We used a semantic priming paradigm during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging in which three types of target words (fear symptoms, e.g.
   `dizziness'; neutral, e.g. `drink'; and pseudowords, e.g. `salkom') were
   preceded by two types of prime words (fear-triggers, e.g. `elevator';
   and neutral, e.g. `bottle'). Subjects with high AS rated fear-symptom
   words (vs neutral words) as more unpleasant than low-AS individuals;
   they also related these words more strongly to fear-triggers and showed
   prolonged reaction times. During the processing of fear-symptom words,
   greater activation in the left anterior insula was observed in high-AS
   subjects than in low-AS subjects. Lower activation in the left inferior
   frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, fusiform gyrus and bilateral amygdalae was
   found in high-AS subjects when fear-symptom words were preceded by
   fear-trigger words. The findings suggest that cognitive biases and the
   anterior insula play a crucial role in high-AS individuals. Furthermore,
   semantic processes may contribute to high AS and the risk of developing
   anxiety disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Establishing the neural bases of individual differences in personality
   has been an enduring topic of interest. However, while a growing
   literature has sought to characterize grey matter correlates of
   personality traits, little attention to date has been focused on
   regional white matter correlates of personality, especially for the
   personality traits agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness. To
   rectify this gap in knowledge we used a large sample (n>550) of older
   adults who provided data on both personality (International Personality
   Item Pool) and white matter tract-specific fractional anisotropy (FA)
   from diffusion tensor MRI. Results indicated that conscientiousness was
   associated with greater FA in the left uncinate fasciculus (b=0.17, P <
   0.001). We also examined links between FA and the personality meta-trait
   `stability', which is defined as the common variance underlying
   agreeableness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism/emotional stability.
   We observed an association between left uncinate fasciculus FA and
   stability (b = 0.27, P< 0.001), which fully accounted for the link
   between left uncinate fasciculus FA and conscientiousness. In sum, these
   results provide novel evidence for links between regional white matter
   microstructure and key traits of human personality, specifically

Abstract = {{Parental depression is a significant risk factor for adolescents'
   engagement in risk taking. Yet the neural processes that mediate the
   link between parental depression and adolescents' functioning remain
   unknown. Using a longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
   design, we investigated how parental depression is associated with
   changes in adolescents' neural reactivity to rewards during a
   risk-taking task, and how such changes in neural reactivity are
   associated with changes in risk-taking behavior. Greater parental
   depressive symptoms were associated with increases in their adolescent
   child's risk taking and self-reported externalizing behavior over time.
   At the neural level, adolescents of parents with greater depressive
   symptoms showed longitudinal increases in the ventral striatum and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to rewards during risk taking.
   Longitudinal increases in adolescents' ventral striatum activation
   mediates the link between greater parental depression and increases in
   adolescents' risk taking and externalizing behavior. These findings
   provide novel evidence that parental depression may contribute to
   changes in adolescents' neural reactivity to rewards over time, which is
   associated with greater increases in their risk taking and externalizing
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with social anxiety are characterized by a high degree of
   social sensitivity, which can coincide with impairments in social
   cognitive functioning (e.g. theory of mind). Oxytocin (OT) and
   vasopressin (AVP) have been shown to improve social cognition, and OT
   has been theorized as a potential therapeutic agent for individuals with
   social anxiety disorder. However, no study has investigated whether
   these neuropeptides improve social cognitive ability among socially
   anxious individuals. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
   between-subjects design we investigated whether social anxiety moderated
   the effects of OT or AVP (vs placebo) on social working memory (i.e.
   working memory that involves manipulating social information) and
   non-social working memory. OT vs placebo impaired social working memory
   accuracy in participants with higher levels of social anxiety. No
   differences were found for non-social working memory or for AVP vs
   placebo. Results suggest that OT administration in individuals with
   higher levels of social anxiety may impair social cognitive functioning.

Abstract = {{Several theories have been proposed to account for the medial frontal
   activity that is elicited during the evaluation of outcomes.
   Respectively, these theories claim that the medial frontal response
   reflects (i) the absolute deviation between the value of an outcome and
   its expected value (i.e. an absolute prediction error); (ii) the
   deviation between actual and expected outcomes, with a specific
   sensitivity to outcomes that are worse than expected (i.e. a negative
   prediction error); (iii) a binary evaluation in terms of good and bad
   outcomes. In the current electroencephalography study, participants were
   presented with cues that induced specific predictions for the values of
   trial outcomes (a gain or loss of points). The actual outcomes
   occasionally deviated from the predicted values, producing prediction
   errors with parametrically varying size. Analysis of the medial frontal
   theta activity in response to the outcomes demonstrated a specific
   sensitivity to the occurrence of a loss of points when a gain had been
   predicted. However, the absolute deviation with respect to the predicted
   value did not modulate the theta response. This finding is consistent
   with the idea that outcome monitoring activity measured over medial
   frontal cortex is sensitive to the binary distinction between good and
   bad outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex
   (sgACC) has emerged as a new therapeutic option in patients with
   treatment resistant depression (TRD). At the same time, DBS offers a
   unique opportunity as an innovative research tool to study brain
   function in vivo. Indirect measures of brain function such as
   positron-emission-tomography imaging findings have revealed a
   hypermetabolism in the sgACC area in patients with TRD that normalizes
   in parallel with treatment response to DBS. We used direct intracranial
   recordings via implanted DBS electrodes to study the neuronal
   oscillatory activity in the sgACC area during a picture viewing task
   including emotional and neutral stimuli in eight patients with TRD who
   underwent DBS.
   We found a stimulus-induced decrease in beta-band and increase in
   gamma-band activity, with a main effect of valence for event-related
   desynchronisation in the beta-frequency range (14-30 Hz). Unpleasant
   stimuli induced the strongest and most sustained beta-power decrease.
   The degree of beta-band modulation upon emotional stimuli correlated
   with the patients' rating of stimulus valence. Our findings confirm the
   involvement of the sgACC area in emotional processing that was more
   enhanced for unpleasant stimuli. Moreover, stimulus evaluation may be
   encoded by modulations of beta-band activity.}},

Abstract = {{The neural basis of emotion perception has mostly been investigated with
   single face or body stimuli. However, in daily life one may also
   encounter affective expressions by groups, e.g. an angry mob or an
   exhilarated concert crowd. In what way is brain activity modulated when
   several individuals express similar rather than different emotions? We
   investigated this question using an experimental design in which we
   presented two stimuli simultaneously, with same or different emotional
   expressions. We hypothesized that, in the case of two same-emotion
   stimuli, brain activity would be enhanced, while in the case of two
   different emotions, one emotion would interfere with the effect of the
   other. The results showed that the simultaneous perception of different
   affective body expressions leads to a deactivation of the amygdala and a
   reduction of cortical activity. It was revealed that the processing of
   fearful bodies, compared with different-emotion bodies, relied more
   strongly on saliency and action triggering regions in inferior parietal
   lobe and insula, while happy bodies drove the occipito-temporal cortex
   more strongly. We showed that this design could be used to uncover
   important differences between brain networks underlying fearful and
   happy emotions. The enhancement of brain activity for unambiguous
   affective signals expressed by several people simultaneously supports
   adaptive behaviour in critical situations.}},

Abstract = {{The reinforcement-sensitivity theory proposes that behavioural
   activation and inhibition systems (BAS and BIS, respectively) guide
   approach and avoidance behaviour in potentially rewarding and punishing
   situations. Their baseline activity presumably explains individual
   differences in behavioural dispositions when a person encounters signals
   of reward and harm. Yet, neurochemical bases of BAS and BIS have
   remained poorly understood. Here we used in vivo positron emission
   tomography with a m-opioid receptor (MOR) specific ligand {[}C-11]
   carfentanil to test whether individual differences in MOR availability
   would be associated with BAS or BIS. We scanned 49 healthy subjects and
   measured their BAS and BIS sensitivities using the BIS/BAS scales. BAS
   but not BIS sensitivity was positively associated with MOR availability
   in frontal cortex, amygdala, ventral striatum, brainstem, cingulate
   cortex and insula. Strongest associations were observed for the BAS
   subscale `Fun Seeking'. Our results suggest that endogenous opioid
   system underlies BAS, and that differences in MOR availability could
   explain inter-individual differences in reward seeking behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Despite functional brain imaging research pointing to the role of
   prefrontal cortex in cognitive reappraisal, the structural correlates of
   habitual engagement of reappraisal are unclear. Functional imaging
   studies of reappraisal have shown broad engagement of bilateral middle
   frontal cortex (MFC) and left superior frontal cortex (SFC), and
   specific engagement of the right SFC. However, volumetric studies have
   not identified clear associations between reappraisal and these regions.
   This discrepancy between functional and structural studies suggests that
   broad functional engagement associated with reappraisal might not be
   detectable at a structural level using highly localized volumetric
   measures. This study addressed the discrepant structural findings by
   assessing the relation between reappraisal and grey matter volume, using
   methods that allow both region-level broad/diffuse assessments
   (surface-based morphometry), and voxel-level specific/localized
   (voxel-based morphometry) measures. Results were consistent with diffuse
   positive volumetric associations with reappraisal in the right MFC and
   left SFC, and a localized positive volumetric association in the right
   SFC, thus resolving the discrepancy between functional and structural
   studies. This study provides novel evidence supporting the idea that
   functional engagement related to transient manipulations of reappraisal
   can be linked to structural associations related to habitual engagement
   of similar operations, within the same brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{Criminal behaviour poses a big challenge for society. A thorough
   understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying criminality
   could optimize its prevention and management. Specifically, elucidating
   the neural mechanisms underpinning reward expectation might be pivotal
   to understanding criminal behaviour. So far no study has assessed reward
   expectation and its mechanisms in a criminal sample. To fill this gap,
   we assessed reward expectation in incarcerated, psychopathic criminals.
   We compared this group to two groups of non-criminal individuals: one
   with high levels and another with low levels of impulsive/antisocial
   traits. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify
   neural responses to reward expectancy. Psychophysiological interaction
   analyses were performed to examine differences in functional
   connectivity patterns of reward-related regions. The data suggest that
   overt criminality is characterized, not by abnormal reward expectation
   per se, but rather by enhanced communication between reward-related
   striatal regions and frontal brain regions. We establish that
   incarcerated psychopathic criminals can be dissociated from non-criminal
   individuals with comparable impulsive/antisocial personality tendencies
   based on the degree to which reward-related brain regions interact with
   brain regions that control behaviour. The present results help us
   understand why some people act according to their impulsive/antisocial
   personality while others are able to behave adaptively despite
   reward-related urges.}},

Abstract = {{Negative self-evaluation is an important psychological characteristic of
   depression. In order to study the underlying neural mechanisms, we
   examined event-related potentials (ERPs) during a self-evaluation task
   in a community sample (N = 150) of adults reporting a range of
   depressive symptoms. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to
   separate processes that overlap in the average ERP, and neural source
   analysis was applied to localize the ERP components, with a particular
   focus on the frontal networks that are thought to be critical to
   affective self-regulation in depression. Consistent with previous
   research, individuals reporting greater depression showed enhanced
   negativity over medial frontal regions as well as attenuation of the
   late positive potential over parietal regions. Examining loadings of
   frontal sources on the ERP components showed that activity in the right
   inferior frontal region may be particularly important for depressed
   individuals: activity in this region declined as symptoms became more
   severe. Characterizing brain mechanisms of self-evaluation on the
   timescale of cognitive events may provide insight into the neural
   mechanisms of self-regulation that are important in cognitive therapy,
   and that could be made more amenable to change through increasing
   neuroplasticity with targeted non-invasive neuromodulation.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction error (PE) plays a critical role in most modern theories of
   associative learning, by determining the effectiveness of conditioned
   stimuli (CS) or unconditioned stimuli (US). Here, we examined the
   effects of lesions of central (CeA) or basolateral (BLA) amygdala on
   performance in overexpectation tasks. In 2 experiments, after 2 CSs were
   separately paired with the US, they were combined and followed by the
   same US. In a subsequent test, we observed losses in strength of both
   CSs, as expected if the negative PE generated on reinforced compound
   trials encouraged inhibitory learning. CeA lesions, known to interfere
   with PE-induced enhancements in CS effectiveness, reduced those losses,
   suggesting that normally the negative PE also enhances cue associability
   in this task. BLA lesions had no effect. When a novel cue accompanied
   the reinforced compound, it acquired net conditioned inhibition, despite
   its consistent pairings with the US, consonant with US effectiveness
   models. That acquisition was unaffected by either CeA or BLA lesions,
   suggesting different rules for assignment of credit of changes in cue
   strength and cue associability. Finally, we examined a puzzling
   autoshaping phenomenon previously attributed to overexpectation effects.
   When a previously food-paired auditory cue was combined with the
   insertion of a lever and paired with the same food US, the auditory cue
   not only failed to block conditioning to the lever, but also lost
   strength, as in an overexpectation experiment. This effect was abolished
   by BLA lesions but unaffected by CeA lesions, suggesting it was
   unrelated to other overexpectation effects.}},

Abstract = {{In an autoshaping task, a single conditioned stimulus (CS; lever
   insertion) was repeatedly followed by the delivery of an unconditioned
   stimulus (US; food pellet into an adjacent food magazine) irrespective
   of the rats' behavior. After repeated training trials, some rats
   responded to the onset of the CS by approaching and pressing the lever
   (sign-trackers). Lesions of dorsolateral striatum almost completely
   eliminated responding to the lever CS while facilitating responding to
   the food magazine (US). Lesions of the dorsomedial striatum attenuated
   but did not eliminate responding to the lever CS. Lesions of the
   basolateral or central nucleus of the amygdala had no significant
   effects on sign-tracking, but combined lesions of the 2 structures
   impaired sign-tracking by significantly increasing latency to the first
   lever press without affecting the number of lever presses. Lesions of
   the dorsal hippocampus had no effect on any of the behavioral measures.
   The findings suggest that sign-tracking with a single lever insertion as
   the CS may consist of 2 separate behaviors learned in parallel: An
   amygdala-mediated conditioned orienting and approach response and a
   dorsal striatum-mediated instrumental response.}},

Abstract = {{Psychophysical experiments seek to measure the limits of perception.
   While straightforward in humans, in animals they are time consuming.
   Choosing an appropriate task and interpreting measurements can be
   challenging. We investigated the localization of high-frequency auditory
   signals in noise using an ``approach-to-target{''} task in ferrets, how
   task performance should be interpreted in terms of perception, and how
   the measurements relate to other types of tasks. To establish their
   general ability to localize, animals were first trained to discriminate
   broadband noise from 12 locations. Subsequently we tested their ability
   to discriminate between band-limited targets at 2 or 3 more widely
   spaced locations, in a continuous background noise. The ability to
   discriminate between 3 possible locations (-90 degrees, 0 degrees, 90
   degrees) of a 10-kHz pure tone decreased gradually over a wide range
   (>30 dB) of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Location discrimination
   ability was better for wide band noise targets (0.5 and 2 octave). These
   results were consistent with localization ability limiting performance
   for pure tones. Discrimination of pure tones at 2 locations (-90/left,
   90/right) was robust at positive SNRs, yielding psychometric functions
   which fell steeply at negative SNRs. Thresholds for discrimination were
   similar to previous tone-in-noise thresholds measured in ferrets using a
   yes/no task. Thus, using an approach-to-target task, sound
   ``localization{''} in noise can reflect detectability or the ability to
   localize, depending on the stimulus configuration.
   Signal-detection-theory-based models were able to account for the
   results when discriminating between pure tones from 2- and 3-source
   locations.}},

Abstract = {{Rodents display characteristic defense responses to predators that are
   influenced by predatory imminence. The midbrain periaqueductal gray
   (PAG) serves an important role controlling these responses. The most
   influential model states that variations in defensive topography are due
   to distinct PAG regions: ventrolateral PAG (VLPAG) controls
   postencounter defense, such as freezing and immobility, whereas lateral
   PAG (LPAG) controls circa-strike defense, such as escape and flight.
   Here we used channel rhodopsin (ChR2) stimulation to probe the structure
   of defensive behavior controlled by LPAG and VLPAG. Suprathreshold LPAG
   stimulation evoked circa-strike defense that was replaced by freezing at
   stimulation offset. Suprathreshold VLPAG stimulation evoked
   postencounter-freezing and immobility-but never circa-strike defense.
   More interestingly, the topography of defensive behavior evoked from
   LPAG scaled with variations in 465 nm light power. As light power
   increased, LPAG animals expressed the full defensive syntax of freezing
   then activity then flight characteristic of increasing predatory
   imminence. In contrast, the frequency, not topography, of defensive
   behavior evoked from VLPAG scaled with variations in light power. These
   findings suggest that LPAG and VLPAG can control variations in defense
   with increasing predatory imminence in 2 ways. First, consistent with
   past models, topographical variation can be assembled from different
   defensive responses controlled by the LPAG (circa-strike) and VLPAG
   (postencounter). Second, topographical variation can be assembled from
   variations in LPAG activity itself.}},

Title = {{Modulation of 22-kHz Postejaculatory Vocalizations by Conditioning to

Abstract = {{It has been assumed that the 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are
   emitted by adult rats as a result of a negative emotional state.
   However, emission of the 22-kHz vocalizations by male rats has been also
   observed following ejaculation, which has a high rewarding value as
   shown by a conditioned place preference test. These observations suggest
   that 22-kHz USVs may also occur in response to a positive emotional
   state. The aim of this study was to determine whether the
   postejaculatory 22-kHz USVs are related to conditioning processes. The
   22 kHz USVs were recorded in Sprague-Dawley males in the postejaculatory
   refractory period during conditioning processes to a new chamber
   unrelated to copulation. During the first session in the clean recording
   chamber, males vocalized marginally and exhibited intensive rearing
   behavior. From the second to fourth sessions, vocalization duration
   increased and the number of rearing decreased. Following established
   conditioning process, odor cues from foreign males, but not the familiar
   ones, resulted in decreased duration of 22-kHz USVs and increased the
   number of rearing. On the other hand, in the presence of mating cues
   (copulatory chamber and presence of the female), males exhibited
   increased duration of postejaculatory 22-kHz USVs and reduced number of
   rearing. These results demonstrated that the conditioning to the cues,
   both unrelated and related to copulation, is important for evoking
   postejaculatory 22-kHz USVs as well as the relaxation state.
   Furthermore, these results confirmed the postejaculatory 22-kHz USVs'
   involvement in expression of the positive emotional state.}},

Title = {{A Role for Puberty in Water Maze Performance in Male and Female Rats}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{130}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Adolescence is characterized by neuroanatomical changes that coincide
   with increased cognitive performance. This developmental period is
   particularly important for the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which
   mediates higher-order cognitive functioning. The authors' laboratory has
   shown that puberty is associated with sex-specific changes in neuron
   number and the dendritic tree in the rat mPFC, but the effects of
   pubertal onset on cognitive performance remain relatively unexplored.
   Here, we use a water maze task to assess spatial memory for the location
   of an escape platform, followed by a test of reversal learning, when the
   platform is moved to an alternate quadrant in the maze. For both males
   and females, 2 groups of prepubertal animals were tested (postnatal day
   {[}P]30 and P33 for females, P40 and P43 for males), along with 1 group
   of newly (2 days) postpubertal animals and 1 group of young adults
   (P60). There were no group differences in learning the initial location
   of the platform or when the platform location changed, although grouping
   pre- and postpubertal ages did result in significantly better
   performance in postpubertal animals. In addition after the platform
   location changed, individual prepubertal males and females spent a
   significantly greater percentage of time in the quadrant of the maze
   where the platform was formerly located than the postpubertal animals.
   This collectively implies that pubertal onset in both males and females
   coincides with improved performance on a reversal task, which may be
   linked with the neuroanatomical changes occurring in the mPFC during
   this time.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical studies indicate that up to 70\% of cancer patients who receive
   chemotherapy experience cognitive impairment. The present study
   investigated environmental enrichment as a protective factor against the
   adverse effects of anticancer drugs on cognitive and biological
   processes in an animal model. Adult rats were housed in group cages with
   environmental stimulation or in standard cages for 3 months, before
   receiving 3 weekly injections of methotrexate + 5-fluorouracil, or equal
   volumes of saline. Rats were then administered tests of learning and
   memory that are sensitive to hippocampal or frontal lobe dysfunction.
   The relationship between cognitive performance and hippocampal
   neurogenesis was examined through sensitive time-dependent measures of
   neuronal maturation. Chemotherapy-treated rats in the standard
   environment were impaired on tests of spatial memory,
   nonmatching-to-sample (NMTS) rule learning, and delayed-NMTS.
   Chemotherapy-treated rats in the enriched environment performed at or
   near normal levels. The performance of the chemotherapy groups on the
   hippocampus-sensitive, spatial memory and delayed-NMTS tests correlated
   with neurogenesis levels. The results show that environmental enrichment
   can reduce the risk of chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment, in
   part by promoting neuronal differentiation and growth during cell
   maturation. As well, they point to the importance of lifestyle factors
   in treating or preventing adverse effects of anticancer drugs on
   cognitive function.}},

Abstract = {{Social play is a fundamental aspect of behavioral development in many
   species. Social play deprivation in rats alters dendritic morphology in
   the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and we have shown that this
   brain region regulates responses to social defeat stress in Syrian
   hamsters. In this study, we tested whether play deprivation during the
   juvenile period disrupts dendritic morphology in the prefrontal cortex
   and potentiates the effects of social defeat stress. At weaning, male
   hamsters were either group-housed with peers or pair-housed with their
   mother, with whom they do not play. In adulthood, animals received acute
   social defeat stress or no-defeat control treatment. The hamsters were
   then tested for a conditioned defeat response in a social interaction
   test with a novel intruder, and were also tested for social avoidance of
   a familiar opponent. Brains were collected for Golgi-Cox staining and
   analysis of dendritic morphology in the infralimbic (IL), prelimbic
   (PL), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Play-deprived animals showed an
   increased conditioned defeat response and elevated avoidance of a
   familiar opponent compared with play-exposed animals. Furthermore,
   play-deprived animals showed increased total length and branch points in
   apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the IL and PL cortices, but not
   in the OFC. These findings suggest that social play deprivation in
   juvenile hamsters disrupts neuronal development in the vmPFC and
   increases vulnerability to the effects of social stress in adulthood.
   Overall, these results suggest that social play is necessary for the
   natural dendritic pruning process during adolescence and promotes coping
   with stress in adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{The etiology of abnormal eating behaviors, including binge-eating
   disorder, is poorly understood. The neural circuits modulating the
   activities of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin are proposed
   to be dysfunctional in individuals suffering from eating disorders.
   Prader-Willi syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes
   extreme food seeking and binge-eating behaviors together with reduced
   satiety. One of the genes implicated in Prader-Willi syndrome, Magel2,
   is highly expressed in the regions of the brain that control appetite.
   Our objective was to examine behaviors relevant to feeding and the
   neural circuits controlling feeding in a mouse model of Prader-Willi
   syndrome that lacks expression of the Magel2 gene. We performed
   behavioral tests related to dopaminergic function, measuring
   cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion, binge eating, and saccharin-induced
   anhedonia in Magel2-deficient mice. Next, we analyzed dopaminergic
   neurons in various brain regions and compared these findings between
   genotypes. Finally, we examined biochemical markers in the brain under
   standard diet, high-fat diet, and withdrawal from a high-fat diet
   conditions. We identified abnormal behaviors and biomarkers reflecting
   dopaminergic dysfunction in mice lacking Magel2. Our results provide a
   biological framework for clinical studies of dopaminergic function in
   children with Prader-Willi syndrome, and may also provide insight into
   binge-eating disorders that occur in the general population.}},

Abstract = {{Children diagnosed with a Disruptive Behavior Disorder (DBD, i.e.
   Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder), especially those
   with psychopathic traits, are at risk of developing persistent and
   severe antisocial behavior. Reduced fear conditioning has been proposed
   to underlie persistent antisocial development. However, we have recently
   shown that both DBD persisters and desisters are characterized by
   increased fear conditioning compared with healthy controls (HCs). In
   this study, we investigated whether brain function during fear
   extinction is associated with DBD subgroup-membership and psychopathic
   traits. Adolescents from a childhood arrestee cohort (mean age 17.6
   years, s.d. 1.4) who met criteria for a DBD diagnosis during previous
   assessments were re-assessed and categorized as persistent DBD (n = 25)
   or desistent DBD ( = 25). Functional MRI during the extinction phase of
   a classical fear-conditioning task was used to compare regional brain
   function between these subgroups and 25 matched controls. Both DBD
   persisters and desisters showed hyperreactivity during fear extinction,
   when compared with HCs. Impulsive-irresponsible psychopathic traits were
   positively associated with responses in the fear neurocircuitry and
   mediated the association between neural activation and group membership.
   These results suggest that fear acquisition and fear extinction deficits
   may provide an endophenotype for an emotionally hyperreactive subtype of
   antisocial development.}},

Abstract = {{Narcissism is characterized by the search for affirmation and admiration
   from others. Might this motivation to find external sources of acclaim
   exist to compensate for neurostructural deficits that link the self with
   reward? Greater structural connectivity between brain areas that process
   self-relevant stimuli (i.e. the medial prefrontal cortex) and reward
   (i.e. the ventral striatum) is associated with fundamentally positive
   self-views. We predicted that narcissism would be associated with less
   integrity of this frontostriatal pathway. We used diffusion tensor
   imaging to assess the frontostriatal structural connectivity among 50
   healthy undergraduates (32 females, 18 males) who also completed a
   measure of grandiose narcissism. White matter integrity in the
   frontostriatal pathway was negatively associated with narcissism. Our
   findings, while purely correlational, suggest that narcissism arises, in
   part, from a neural disconnect between the self and reward. The
   exhibitionism and immodesty of narcissists may then be a regulatory
   strategy to compensate for this neural deficit.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional concept of `categorical' psychiatric disorders has been
   challenged as many of the symptoms display a continuous distribution in
   the general population. We suggest that this is the case for emotional
   dysregulation, a key component in several categorical psychiatric
   disorder constructs. We used voxel-based magnetic resonance imaging
   morphometry in healthy human subjects (n = 87) to study how
   self-reported subclinical symptoms associated with emotional
   dysregulation relate to brain regions assumed to be critical for emotion
   regulation. To measure a pure emotional dysregulation, we also corrected
   for subclinical symptoms of non-emotional attentional dysregulation. We
   show that such subclinical emotional symptoms correlate negatively with
   the grey matter volume of lateral orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally-a
   region assumed to be critical for emotion regulation and dysfunctional
   in psychiatric disorders involving emotional dysregulation. Importantly,
   this effect is mediated both by a decrease in volume associated with
   emotional dysregulation and an increase in volume due to non-emotional
   attentional dysregulation. Exploratory analysis suggests that other
   regions involved in emotional processing such as insula and ventral
   striatum also show a similar reduction in grey matter volume mirroring
   clinical disorders associated with emotional dysregulation. Our findings
   support the concept of continuous properties in psychiatric
   symptomatology.}},

Abstract = {{Social support benefits health and well-being in older individuals,
   however the mechanism remains poorly understood. One proposal, the
   stress-buffering hypothesis states social support `buffers' the effects
   of stress on health. Alternatively, the main effect hypothesis suggests
   social support independently promotes health. We examined the combined
   association of social support and stress on the aging brain. Forty
   healthy older adults completed stress questionnaires, a social network
   interview and structural MRI to investigate the amygdala-medial
   prefrontal cortex circuitry, which is implicated in social and emotional
   processing and negatively affected by stress. Social support was
   positively correlated with right medial prefrontal cortical thickness
   while amygdala volume was negatively associated with social support and
   positively related to stress. We examined whether the association
   between social support and amygdala volume varied across stress level.
   Stress and social support uniquely contribute to amygdala volume, which
   is consistent with the health benefits of social support being
   independent of stress.}},

Abstract = {{Neurocognitive studies of psychopathy have predominantly focused on male
   samples. Studies have shown that female psychopaths exhibit similar
   affective deficits as their male counterparts, but results are less
   consistent across cognitive domains including response modulation. As
   such, there may be potential gender differences in error-related
   processing in psychopathic personality. Here we investigate
   response-locked event-related potential (ERP) components {[}the
   error-related negativity (ERN/Ne) related to early error-detection
   processes and the error-related positivity (Pe) involved in later
   post-error processing] in a sample of incarcerated adult female
   offenders (n = 121) who performed a response inhibition Go/NoGo task.
   Psychopathy was assessed using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised
   (PCL-R). The ERN/Ne and Pe were analyzed with classic windowed ERP
   components and principal component analysis (PCA). Consistent with
   previous research performed in psychopathic males, female psychopaths
   exhibited specific deficiencies in the neural correlates of post-error
   processing (as indexed by reduced Pe amplitude) but not in error
   monitoring (as indexed by intact ERN/Ne amplitude). Specifically,
   psychopathic traits reflecting interpersonal and affective dysfunction
   remained significant predictors of both time-domain and PCA measures
   reflecting reduced Pe mean amplitude. This is the first evidence to
   suggest that incarcerated female psychopaths exhibit similar
   dysfunctional post-error processing as male psychopaths.}},

Abstract = {{People sometimes experience an emotional state known as `nostalgia',
   which involves experiencing predominantly positive emotions while
   remembering autobiographical events. Nostalgia is thought to play an
   important role in psychological resilience. Previous neuroimaging
   studies have shown involvement of memory and reward systems in such
   experiences. However, it remains unclear how these two systems are
   collaboratively involved with nostalgia experiences. Here, we conducted
   a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of healthy females to
   investigate the relationship between memory-reward co-activation and
   nostalgia, using childhood-related visual stimuli. Moreover, we examined
   the factors constituting nostalgia and their neural correlates. We
   confirmed the presence of nostalgia-related activity in both memory and
   reward systems, including the hippocampus (HPC), substantia
   nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), and ventral striatum (VS). We
   also found significant HPC-VS co-activation, with its strength
   correlating with individual `nostalgia tendencies'. Factor analyses
   showed that two dimensions underlie nostalgia: emotional and personal
   significance and chronological remoteness, with the former correlating
   with caudal SN/VTA and left anterior HPC activity, and the latter
   correlating with rostral SN/VTA activity. These findings demonstrate the
   cooperative activity of memory and reward systems, where each system has
   a specific role in the construction of the factors that underlie the
   experience of nostalgia.}},

Abstract = {{Affective prosody is that aspect of speech that conveys a speaker's
   emotional state through modulations in various vocal parameters, most
   prominently pitch. While a large body of research implicates the
   cingulate vocalization area in controlling affective vocalizations in
   monkeys, no systematic test of functional homology for this area has yet
   been reported in humans. In this study, we used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging to compare brain activations when subjects produced
   affective vocalizations in the form of exclamations vs non-affective
   vocalizations with similar pitch contours. We also examined the
   perception of affective vocalizations by having participants make
   judgments about either the emotions being conveyed by recorded affective
   vocalizations or the pitch contours of the same vocalizations.
   Production of affective vocalizations and matched pitch contours
   activated a highly overlapping set of brain areas, including the
   larynx-phonation area of the primary motor cortex and a region of the
   anterior cingulate cortex that is consistent with the macro-anatomical
   position of the cingulate vocalization area. This overlap contradicts
   the dominant view that these areas form two distinct vocal pathways with
   dissociable functions. Instead, we propose that these brain areas are
   nodes in a single vocal network, with an emphasis on pitch modulation as
   a vehicle for affective expression.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that physiological arousal and attentional
   responses to eye contact are modulated by one's knowledge of whether
   they are seen by another person. Recently it was shown that this `eye
   contact effect' can be elicited without seeing another person's eyes at
   all. We aimed to investigate whether the eye contact effect is actually
   triggered by the mere knowledge of being seen by another individual,
   i.e. even in a condition when the perceiver does not see the other
   person at all. We measured experienced self-awareness and both autonomic
   and brain activity responses while participants were facing another
   person (a model) sitting behind a window. We manipulated the visibility
   of the model and the participants' belief of whether or not the model
   could see them. When participants did not see the model but believed
   they were seen by the model, physiological responses were attenuated in
   comparison to when both parties saw each other. However, self-assessed
   public self-awareness was not attenuated in this condition. Thus, two
   requirements must be met for physiological responses to occur in
   response to eye contact: an experience of being seen by another
   individual and an experience of seeing the other individual.}},

Abstract = {{Loneliness is a distressing state indicating that one's basic need for
   social connection is not being met. In an effort to satisfy the need for
   social connection, loneliness may increase the processing of social cues
   and desire to connect with others. Yet the neural substrates that
   contribute to the drive for increased connection in response to
   loneliness are not known. The ventral striatum (VS), previously shown to
   increase in response to craving food and other rewarding stimuli, may
   contribute to ``social craving{''} when one is lonely. That is, the VS
   may track one's `hunger' for reconnection much as it tracks hunger for
   food. To examine this, participants reported on their feelings of
   loneliness before undergoing an fMRI scan where they viewed cues of
   potential social reconnection (images of a close other). Consistent with
   the hypothesis that loneliness stems from an unmet need for connection,
   loneliness was associated with reduced feelings of connection with the
   close other. Furthermore, greater reported loneliness was associated
   with increased VS activity to viewing a close other (vs stranger).
   Results extend the current literature by showing that lonely individuals
   show increased activity in reward-related regions to their closest loved
   ones, possibly reflecting an increased desire for social connection.}},

Abstract = {{Externalizing proneness, or trait disinhibition, is a concept relevant
   to multiple high-impact disorders involving impulsive-aggressive
   behavior. Its mechanisms remain disputed: major models posit
   hyperresponsive reward circuitry or heightened threat-system reactivity
   as sources of disinhibitory tendencies. This study evaluated alternative
   possibilities by examining relations between trait disinhibition and
   brain reactivity during preparation for and processing of visual
   affective stimuli. Forty females participated in a functional
   neuroimaging procedure with stimuli presented in blocks containing
   either pleasurable or aversive pictures interspersed with neutral, with
   each picture preceded by a preparation signal. Preparing to view
   elicited activation in regions including nucleus accumbens, whereas
   visual regions and bilateral amygdala were activated during viewing of
   emotional pictures. High disinhibition predicted reduced nucleus
   accumbens activation during preparation within pleasant/neutral picture
   blocks, along with enhanced amygdala reactivity during viewing of
   pleasant and aversive pictures. Follow-up analyses revealed that the
   augmented amygdala response was related to reduced preparatory
   activation. Findings indicate that participants high in disinhibition
   are less able to process implicit cues and mentally prepare for upcoming
   stimuli, leading to limbic hyperreactivity during processing of actual
   stimuli. This outcome is helpful for integrating findings from studies
   suggesting reward-system hyperreactivity and others suggesting
   threat-system hyperreactivity as mechanisms for externalizing proneness.}},

Abstract = {{Some healthy older adults show departures from standard decision-making
   patterns exhibited by younger adults. We asked if such departures are
   uniform or if heterogeneous aging processes can designate which older
   adults show differing decision patterns. Thirty-three healthy older
   adults with varying decision-making patterns on a complex decision task
   (the Iowa Gambling Task) completed an intertemporal choice task while
   undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. We examined whether
   value representation in the canonical valuation network differed across
   older adults based on complex decision-making ability. Older adults with
   advantageous decision patterns showed increased activity in the
   valuation network, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC)
   and striatum. In contrast, older adults with disadvantageous decision
   patterns showed reduced or absent activation in the VMPFC and striatum,
   and these older adults also showed greater blood oxygen level dependent
   signal temporal variability in the striatum. Our results suggest that a
   reduced representation of value in the brain, possibly driven by
   increased neural noise, relates to suboptimal decision-making in a
   subset of older adults, which could translate to poor decision-making in
   many aspects of life, including finance, health and long-term care.
   Understanding the connection between suboptimal decision-making and
   neural value signals is a step toward mitigating age-related
   decision-making impairments.}},

Abstract = {{Human prosociality is often assumed to emerge from exerting reflective
   control over initial, selfish impulses. However, recent findings suggest
   that prosocial actions can also stem from processes that are fast,
   automatic and intuitive. Here, we attempt to clarify when prosocial
   behavior may be intuitive by examining prosociality as a form of reward
   seeking. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we explored whether a
   neural signature that rapidly encodes the motivational salience of an
   event-the P300-can predict intuitive prosocial motivation. Participants
   allocated varying amounts of money between themselves and charities they
   initially labelled as high- or low-empathy targets under conditions that
   promoted intuitive or reflective decision making. Consistent with our
   predictions, P300 amplitude over centroparietal regions was greater when
   giving involved high-empathy targets than low-empathy targets, but only
   when deciding under intuitive conditions. Reflective conditions,
   alternatively, elicited an earlier frontocentral positivity related to
   response inhibition, regardless of target. Our findings suggest that
   during prosocial decision making, larger P300 amplitude could (i) signal
   intuitive prosocial motivation and (ii) predict subsequent engagement in
   prosocial behavior. This work offers novel insight into when
   prosociality may be driven by intuitive processes and the roots of such
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{With congruent stimulation of one's limb together with a fake
   counterpart, an illusory self-attribution of the fake limb can be
   induced. Such illusions have brought profound insights into the
   cognitive and neuronal mechanisms underlying temporary changes in body
   representation, but to put them in perspective, they need to be compared
   with ownership as experienced for one's real body. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the neuronal correlates of
   touch under different degrees of body ownership. Participants' left and
   right arms were stimulated either alone or together with a fake
   counterpart while this stimulation was synchronous, ambiguous or
   asynchronous. Synchronous stimulation induced illusory fake arm
   ownership, but the brain still differentiated between touch to one's
   real arm and to an illusory `owned' arm: the degree of arm ownership was
   encoded positively by activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and
   lateral occipitotemporal cortex and negatively in the temporoparietal
   cortex. Conversely, the ventral premotor cortex responded more strongly
   to synchronous stimulation compared with asynchronous stimulation and
   with real arm only stimulation. These results offer new insights into
   the differential representation of the real body vs a body that is
   temporarily self-attributed following the resolution of multisensory
   conflict.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{People can conceptualize the same action (e.g. `riding a bike') at
   different levels of abstraction (LOA), where higher LOAs specify the
   abstract motives that explain why the action is performed (e.g. `getting
   exercise'), while lower LOAs specify the concrete steps that indicate
   how the action is performed (e.g. `gripping handlebars'). Prior
   neuroimaging studies have shown that why and how questions about actions
   differentially activate two cortical networks associated with
   mental-state reasoning and action representation, respectively; however,
   it remains unknown whether this is due to the differential demands of
   the questions per se or to the shifts in LOA those questions produce. We
   conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants
   judged pairs of action phrases that varied in LOA and that could be
   framed either as a why question (Why ride a bike? Get exercise.) or a
   how question (How to get exercise? Ride a bike.). Question framing (why
   vs how) had no effect on activity in regions of the two networks.
   Instead, these regions uniquely tracked parametric variation in LOA,
   both across and within trials. This suggests that the human capacity to
   understand actions at different LOA is based in the relative activity of
   two cortical networks.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to detect emotional changes is of primary importance for
   social living. Though emotional signals are often conveyed by multiple
   modalities, how emotional changes in vocal and facial modalities
   integrate into a unified percept has yet to be directly investigated. To
   address this issue, we asked participants to detect emotional changes
   delivered by facial, vocal and facial-vocal expressions while behavioral
   responses and electroencephalogram were recorded. Behavioral results
   showed that bimodal emotional changes were detected with higher accuracy
   and shorter response latencies compared with each unimodal condition.
   Moreover, the detection of emotional change, regardless of modalities,
   was associated with enhanced amplitudes in the N2 and P3 component, as
   well as greater theta synchronization. More importantly, the P3
   amplitudes and theta synchronization were larger for the bimodal
   emotional change condition than for the sum of the two unimodal
   conditions. The superadditive responses in P3 amplitudes and theta
   synchronization were both positively correlated with the magnitude of
   the bimodal superadditivity in accuracy. These behavioral and
   electrophysiological data consistently illustrated an effect of
   audiovisual integration during the detection of emotional changes, which
   is most likely mediated by the P3 activity and theta oscillations in
   brain responses.}},

Abstract = {{Action observation leads to a representation of both the motor aspect of
   an observed action (motor simulation) and its somatosensory consequences
   (action-based somatosensory simulation) in the observer's brain. In the
   current electroencephalography-study, we investigated the neuronal
   interplay of action-based somatosensory simulation and felt touch. We
   presented index or middle finger tapping movements of a human or a
   wooden hand, while simultaneously presenting `tap-like' tactile
   sensations to either the corresponding or non-corresponding fingertip of
   the participant. We focused on an early stage of somatosensory
   processing {[}P50, N100 and N140 sensory evoked potentials (SEPs)] and
   on a later stage of higher-order processing (P3-complex). The results
   revealed an interaction effect of animacy and congruency in the early
   P50 SEP and an animacy effect in the N100/N140 SEPs. In the P3-complex,
   we found an interaction effect indicating that the influence of
   congruency was larger in the human than in the wooden hand. We argue
   that the P3-complex may reflect higher-order self-other distinction by
   signaling simulated action-based touch that does not match own tactile
   information. As such, the action-based somatosensory congruency paradigm
   might help understand higher-order social processes from a somatosensory
   point of view.}},

Abstract = {{Most of daily life hums along peacefully but provocations tip the
   balance toward aggression. Negative feelings are often invoked to
   explain why people lash out after an insult. Yet people might retaliate
   because provocation makes aggression hedonically rewarding. To test this
   alternative hypothesis, 69 participants underwent functional
   neuroimaging while they completed a behavioral aggression task that
   repeatedly manipulated whether aggression was preceded by an instance of
   provocation or not. After provocation, greater activity in the nucleus
   accumbens (NAcc) (a brain region reliably associated with reward) during
   aggressive decisions predicted louder noise blasts administered in
   retaliation. Greater NAcc activation was also associated with
   participants' history of real-world violence. Functional connectivity
   between the NAcc and a regulatory region in the lateral prefrontal
   cortex related to lower retaliatory aggression. These findings suggest
   that provocation tips the neural balance towards hedonic reward, which
   fosters retaliatory aggression. Although such pleasure of inflicting
   pain may promote retaliatory aggression, self-regulatory processes can
   keep such aggressive urges at bay. Implications for theory and violence
   reduction are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Human altruism is often expressed through charitable donation-supporting
   a cause that benefits others in society, at cost to oneself. The
   underlying mechanisms of this other-regarding behavior remain
   imperfectly understood. By recording event-related-potential ( ERP)
   measures of brain activity from human participants during a social
   gambling task, we identified markers of differential responses to
   receipt of monetary outcomes for oneself vs for a charitable cause. We
   focused our ERP analyses on the frontocentral feedback-related
   negativity ( FRN) and three subcomponents of the attention-related P300
   ( P3) brain wave: the frontocentral P2 and P3a and the parietal P3b. The
   FRN distinguished between gains and losses for both self and charity
   outcomes. Importantly, this effect of outcome valence was greater for
   self than charity for both groups and was independent of two
   altruism-related measures: participants' pre-declared intended donations
   and the actual donations resulting from their choices. In contrast,
   differences in P3 subcomponents for outcomes for self vs charity
   strongly predicted both of our laboratory measures of altruism-as well
   as self-reported engagement in real-life altruistic behaviors. These
   results indicate that individual differences in altruism are linked to
   individual differences in the relative deployment of attention ( as
   indexed by the P3) toward outcomes affecting other people.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to recognize the identity of faces and voices is essential
   for social relationships. Although the heritability of social memory is
   high, knowledge about the contributing genes is sparse. Since sex
   differences and rodent studies support an influence of estrogens and
   androgens on social memory, polymorphisms in the estrogen and androgen
   receptor genes ( ESR1, ESR2, AR) are candidates for this trait.
   Recognition of faces and vocal sounds, separately and combined, was
   investigated in 490 subjects, genotyped for 10 single nucleotide
   polymorphisms ( SNPs) in ESR1, four in ESR2 and one in the AR. Four of
   the associations survived correction for multiple testing: women
   carrying rare alleles of the three ESR2 SNPs, rs928554, rs1271572 and
   rs1256030, in linkage disequilibrium with each other, displayed superior
   face recognition compared with non-carriers. Furthermore, the uncommon
   genotype of the ESR1 SNP rs2504063 was associated with better
   recognition of identity through vocal sounds, also specifically in
   women. This study demonstrates evidence for associations in women
   between face recognition and variation in ESR2, and recognition of
   identity through vocal sounds and variation in ESR1. These results
   suggest that estrogen receptors may regulate social memory function in
   humans, in line with what has previously been established in mice.}},

Abstract = {{Humans uniquely appreciate aesthetics, experiencing pleasurable
   responses to complex stimuli that confer no clear intrinsic value for
   survival. However, substantial variability exists in the frequency and
   specificity of aesthetic responses. While pleasure from aesthetics is
   attributed to the neural circuitry for reward, what accounts for
   individual differences in aesthetic reward sensitivity remains unclear.
   Using a combination of survey data, behavioral and psychophysiological
   measures and diffusion tensor imaging, we found that white matter
   connectivity between sensory processing areas in the superior temporal
   gyrus and emotional and social processing areas in the insula and medial
   prefrontal cortex explains individual differences in reward sensitivity
   to music. Our findings provide the first evidence for a neural basis of
   individual differences in sensory access to the reward system, and
   suggest that social-emotional communication through the auditory channel
   may offer an evolutionary basis for music making as an aesthetically
   rewarding function in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Depression is linked to increased amygdala activation to neutral and
   negatively valenced facial expressions. Amygdala activation may be
   predictive of changes in depressive symptoms over time. However, most
   studies in this area have focused on small, predominantly female and
   homogenous clinical samples. Studies are needed to examine how amygdala
   reactivity relates to the course of depressive symptoms dimensionally,
   prospectively and in populations diverse in gender, race and
   socioeconomic status. A total of 156 men from predominately low-income
   backgrounds completed an fMRI task where they viewed emotional facial
   expressions. Left and right amygdala reactivity to neutral, but not
   angry or fearful, facial expressions relative to a non-face baseline at
   age 20 predicted greater depressive symptoms 2 years later, controlling
   for age 20 depressive symptoms. Heightened bilateral amygdala reactivity
   to neutral facial expressions predicted increases in depressive symptoms
   2 years later in a large community sample. Neutral facial expressions
   are affectively ambiguous and a tendency to interpret these stimuli
   negatively may reflect to cognitive biases that lead to increases in
   depressive symptoms over time. Individual differences in amygdala
   reactivity to neutral facial expressions appear to identify those at
   most risk for a more problematic course of depressive symptoms across
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Acetaminophen has recently been recognized as having impacts that extend
   into the affective domain. In particular, double blind placebo
   controlled trials have revealed that acetaminophen reduces the magnitude
   of reactivity to social rejection, frustration, dissonance and to both
   negatively and positively valenced attitude objects. Given this
   diversity of consequences, it has been proposed that the psychological
   effects of acetaminophen may reflect a widespread blunting of evaluative
   processing. We tested this hypothesis using event-related potentials (
   ERPs). Sixty-two participants received acetaminophen or a placebo in a
   double-blind protocol and completed the Go/NoGo task. Participants' ERPs
   were observed following errors on the Go/NoGo task, in particular the
   error-related negativity ( ERN; measured at FCz) and error-related
   positivity ( Pe; measured at Pz and CPz). Results show that
   acetaminophen inhibits the Pe, but not the ERN, and the magnitude of an
   individual's Pe correlates positively with omission errors, partially
   mediating the effects of acetaminophen on the error rate. These results
   suggest that recently documented affective blunting caused by
   acetaminophen may best be described as an inhibition of evaluative
   processing. They also contribute to the growing work suggesting that the
   Pe is more strongly associated with conscious awareness of errors
   relative to the ERN.}},

Abstract = {{Current neural models of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD) and anxiety
   disorders suggest hyperactivation of amygdala in anxiety, but
   hypoactivation of amygdala in ASD. The objectives of this study were to
   ( i) test the hypothesis that amygdala activity measured by functional
   magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) represents a hybrid signal of
   opposing social functions and anxiety symptoms, and ( ii) determine
   whether longstanding findings of decreased amygdala activation in ASD
   apply only to those individuals with ASD and low levels of anxiety.
   During fMRI scanning, 81 youth with ASD and 67 non-ASD control
   participants completed a face recognition paradigm that elicits robust
   amygdala activation. Only individuals with ASD and low anxiety levels (
   a subsample of 28 participants) showed decreased amygdala activation
   relative to controls. In the ASD group, anxiety symptoms were positively
   correlated with amygdala activity across the full ASD group, whereas
   core ASD symptoms ( including social deficits) were negatively
   correlated. Results indicate that hypoactivation of amygdala in ASD, a
   suggestive finding first reported nearly 20 years ago, can be masked by
   comorbid anxiety-thus bringing enhanced clarity to this line of work.
   Amygdala activity represents a hybrid signal of emotion and social
   processes that cannot be reduced to either alone.}},

Abstract = {{Social stratification has important implications for health and
   well-being, with individuals lower in standing in a hierarchy
   experiencing worse outcomes than those higher up the social ladder.
   Separate lines of past research suggest that alterations in inflammatory
   processes and neural responses to threat may link lower social status
   with poorer outcomes. This study was designed to bridge these
   literatures to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms linking
   subjective social status and inflammation. Thirty-one participants
   reported their subjective social status, and underwent a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging scan while they were socially evaluated.
   Participants also provided blood samples before and after the stressor,
   which were analysed for changes in inflammation. Results showed that
   lower subjective social status was associated with greater increases in
   inflammation. Neuroimaging data revealed lower subjective social status
   was associated with greater neural activity in the dorsomedial
   prefrontal cortex ( DMPFC) in response to negative feedback. Finally,
   results indicated that activation in the DMPFC in response to negative
   feedback mediated the relation between social status and increases in
   inflammatory activity. This study provides the first evidence of a
   neurocognitive pathway linking subjective social status and
   inflammation, thus furthering our understanding of how social
   hierarchies shape neural and physiological responses to social
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A unique feature of adolescent social re-orientation is heightened
   sensitivity to peer influence when taking risks. However, positive peer
   influence effects are not yet well understood. The present fMRI study
   tested a novel hypothesis, by examining neural correlates of prosocial
   peer influence on donation decisions in adolescence. Participants ( age
   12-16 years; N - 61) made decisions in anonymous groups about the
   allocation of tokens between themselves and the group in a public goods
   game. Two spectator groups of same-age peers-in fact youth actors-were
   allegedly online during some of the decisions. The task had a
   within-subjects design with three conditions: ( 1) Evaluation:
   spectators evaluated decisions with likes for large donations to the
   group, ( 2) Spectator: spectators were present but no evaluative
   feedback was displayed and ( 3) Alone: no spectators nor feedback.
   Results showed that prosocial behavior increased in the presence of
   peers, and even more when participants received evaluative feedback from
   peers. Peer presence resulted in enhanced activity in several social
   brain regions including medial prefrontal cortex, temporal parietal
   junction ( TPJ), precuneus and superior temporal sulcus. TPJ activity
   correlated with donations, which suggests similar networks for prosocial
   behavior and sensitivity to peers. These findings highlight the
   importance of peers in fostering prosocial development throughout
   adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{Although behavioral research has shown that positive mood leads to
   desired outcomes in nearly every major life domain, no studies have
   directly examined the effects of positive mood on the neural processes
   underlying reward-related affect and goal-directed behavior. To address
   this gap, participants in the present fMRI study experienced either a
   positive ( n = 20) or neutral ( n = 20) mood induction and subsequently
   completed a monetary incentive delay task that assessed reward and loss
   processing. Consistent with prediction, positive mood elevated activity
   specifically during reward anticipation in corticostriatal neural
   regions that have been implicated in reward processing and goal-directed
   behavior, including the nucleus accumbens, caudate, lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex and putamen, as well as related paralimbic regions,
   including the anterior insula and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These
   effects were not observed during reward outcome, loss anticipation or
   loss outcome. Critically, this is the first study to report that
   positive mood enhances reward-related neural activity. Our findings have
   implications for uncovering the neural mechanisms by which positive mood
   enhances goal-directed behavior, understanding the malleability of
   reward-related neural activity, and developing targeted treatments for
   psychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in reward processing.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism by which the brain integrates visual and emotional
   information remains incompletely understood, and can be studied through
   focal lesions that selectively disrupt this process. To date, three
   reported cases of visual hypoemotionality, a vision-specific form of
   derealization, have resulted from lesions of the temporo-occipital
   junction. We present a fourth case of this rare phenomenon, and
   investigate the role of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus ( ILF) in
   the underlying pathophysiology. A 50-year-old right-handed male was
   found to have a right medial temporal lobe tumor following new-onset
   seizures. Interstitial laser ablation of the lesion was complicated by a
   right temporo-parieto-occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage. The patient
   subsequently experienced emotional estrangement from visual stimuli. A
   lesion overlap analysis was conducted to assess involvement of the ILF
   by this patient's lesion and those of the three previously described
   cases, and diffusion tensor imaging was acquired in our case to further
   investigate ILF disruption. All four lesions specifically overlapped
   with the expected trajectory of the right ILF, and diminished structural
   integrity of the right ILF was observed in our case. These findings
   implicate the ILF in visual hypoemotionality, suggesting that the ILF is
   critical for integrating visual information with its emotional content.}},

Abstract = {{With the use of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging
   neurofeedback ( NF), amygdala activitiy can be visualized in real time.
   In this study, continuous amygdala NF was provided to patients with
   borderline personality disorder ( BPD) with the instruction to
   down-regulate. During four sessions of NF training, patients viewed
   aversive pictures and received feedback from a thermometer display,
   which showed the amygdala blood oxygenation level-dependent signal.
   Conditions of regulation and viewing without regulation were presented.
   Each session started with a resting-state scan and was followed by a
   transfer run without NF. Amygdala regulation, task-related and
   resting-state functional brain connectivity were analyzed. Self-ratings
   of dissociation and difficulty in emotion regulation were collected. BPD
   patients down-regulated right amygdala activation but there were no
   improvements over time. Task-related amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex connectivity was altered across the four sessions, with an
   increased connectivity when regulating vs viewing pictures.
   Resting-state amygdala-lateral prefrontal cortex connectivity was
   altered and dissociation, as well as scores for `lack of emotional
   awareness', decreased with training. Results demonstrated that amygdala
   NF may improve healthy brain connectivity, as well as emotion
   regulation. A randomized-controlled trial is needed to investigate
   whether amygdala NF is instrumental for improving neural regulation and
   emotion regulation in BPD patients.}},

Abstract = {{Goal conflict situations, involving the simultaneous presence of reward
   and punishment, occur commonly in real life, and reflect well-known
   individual differences in the behavioral tendency to approach or avoid.
   However, despite accumulating neural depiction of motivational
   processing, the investigation of naturalistic approach behavior and its
   interplay with individual tendencies is remarkably lacking. We developed
   a novel ecological interactive scenario which triggers motivational
   behavior under high or low goal conflict conditions. Fifty-five healthy
   subjects played the game during a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   scan. A machine-learning approach was applied to classify
   approach/avoidance behaviors during the game. To achieve an independent
   measure of individual tendencies, an integrative profile was composed
   from three established theoretical models. Results demonstrated that
   approach under high relative to low conflict involved increased activity
   in the ventral tegmental area ( VTA), peri-aquaductal gray, ventral
   striatum ( VS) and precuneus. Notably, only VS and VTA activations
   during high conflict discriminated between approach/avoidance
   personality profiles, suggesting that the relationship between
   individual personality and naturalistic motivational tendencies is
   uniquely associated with the mesostriatal pathway. VTA-VS further
   demonstrated stronger coupling during high vs low conflict. These
   findings are the first to unravel the multilevel relationship among
   personality profile, approach tendencies in naturalistic set-up and
   their underlying neural manifestation, thus enabling new avenues for
   investigating approach-related psychopathologies.}},

Abstract = {{In daily life, complex events are perceived in a causal manner,
   suggesting that the brain relies on predictive processes to model them.
   Within predictive coding theory, oscillatory beta-band activity has been
   linked to top-down predictive signals and gamma-band activity to
   bottom-up prediction errors. However, neurocognitive evidence for
   predictive coding outside lower-level sensory areas is scarce. We used
   magnetoencephalography to investigate neural activity during
   probabilitydependent action perception in three areas pivotal for causal
   inference, superior temporal sulcus, temporoparietal junction and medial
   prefrontal cortex, using bowling action animations. Within this network,
   Granger-causal connectivity in the beta-band was found to be strongest
   for backward top-down connections and gamma for feed-forward bottom-up
   connections. Moreover, beta-band power in TPJ increased parametrically
   with the predictability of the action kinematics-outcome sequences.
   Conversely, gamma-band power in TPJ and MPFC increased with prediction
   error. These findings suggest that the brain utilizes
   predictive-coding-like computations for higher-order cognition such as
   perception of causal events.}},

Abstract = {{Although negative emotion can strengthen memory of an event it can also
   result in memory disturbances, as in posttraumatic stress disorder (
   PTSD). We examined the effects of negative item content on amygdalar and
   hippocampal function in memory for the items themselves and for the
   associations between them. During fMRI, we examined encoding and
   retrieval of paired associates made up of all four combinations of
   neutral and negative images. At test, participants were cued with an
   image and, if recognised, had to retrieve the associated ( target)
   image. The presence of negative images increased item memory but reduced
   associative memory. At encoding, subsequent item recognition correlated
   with amygdala activity, while subsequent associative memory correlated
   with hippocampal activity. Hippocampal activity was reduced by the
   presence of negative images, during encoding and correct associative
   retrieval. In contrast, amygdala activity increased for correctly
   retrieved negative images, even when cued by a neutral image. Our
   findings support a dual representation account, whereby negative emotion
   up-regulates the amygdala to strengthen item memory but downregulates
   the hippocampus to weaken associative representations. These results
   have implications for the development and treatment of clinical
   disorders in which diminished associations between emotional stimuli and
   their context contribute to negative symptoms, as in PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations of fear conditioning have elucidated the neural
   mechanisms of fear acquisition, consolidation and extinction, but it is
   not clear how the neural activation following fear reminder influence
   the following extinction. To address this question, we measured human
   brain activity following fear reminder using resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, and investigated whether the extinction
   effect can be predicted by resting-state functional connectivity (
   RSFC). Behaviorally, we found no significant differences of fear ratings
   between the reminder group and the no reminder group at the fear
   acquisition and extinction stages, but spontaneous recovery during
   re-extinction stage appeared only in the no reminder group. Imaging data
   showed that functional connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex ( vmPFC) and amygdala in the reminder group was greater than that
   in the no reminder group after fear memory reactivation. More
   importantly, the functional connectivity between amygdala and vmPFC of
   the reminder group after fear memory reactivation was positively
   correlated with extinction effect. These results suggest RSFC between
   amygdala and the vmPFC following fear reminder can predict fear
   extinction, which provide important insight into the neural mechanisms
   of fear memory after fear memory reactivation.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders ( ASD) are far more prevalent in males than in
   females. Little is known however about the differential neural
   expression of ASD in males and females. We used a resting-state
   fMRI-dataset comprising 42 males/42 females with ASD and 75 male/75
   female typical-controls to examine whether autism-related alterations in
   intrinsic functional connectivity are similar or different in males and
   females, and particularly whether alterations reflect `neural
   masculinization', as predicted by the Extreme Male Brain theory. Males
   and females showed a differential neural expression of ASD,
   characterized by highly consistent patterns of hypo-connectivity in
   males with ASD ( compared to typical males), and hyper-connectivity in
   females with ASD ( compared to typical females). Interestingly, patterns
   of hyper-connectivity in females with ASD reflected a shift towards the
   ( high) connectivity levels seen in typical males ( neural
   masculinization), whereas patterns of hypo-connectivity observed in
   males with ASD reflected a shift towards the ( low) typical feminine
   connectivity patterns ( neural feminization). Our data support the
   notion that ASD is a disorder of sexual differentiation rather than a
   disorder characterized by masculinization in both genders. Future work
   is needed to identify underlying factors such as sex hormonal
   alterations that drive these sex-specific neural expressions of ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Changed reward functions have been proposed as a core feature of
   stimulant addiction, typically observed as reduced neural responses to
   non-drug-related rewards. However, it was unclear yet how specific this
   deficit is for different types of non-drug rewards arising from social
   and non-social reinforcements. We used functional neuroimaging in
   cocaine users to investigate explicit social reward as modeled by
   agreement of music preferences with music experts. In addition, we
   investigated non-social reward as modeled by winning desired music
   pieces. The study included 17 chronic cocaine users and 17 matched
   stimulant-naive healthy controls. Cocaine users, compared with controls,
   showed blunted neural responses to both social and non-social reward.
   Activation differences were located in the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex overlapping for both reward types and, thus, suggesting a
   non-specific deficit in the processing of non-drug rewards.
   Interestingly, in the posterior lateral orbitofrontal cortex, social
   reward responses of cocaine users decreased with the degree to which
   they were influenced by social feedback from the experts, a response
   pattern that was opposite to that observed in healthy controls. The
   present results suggest that cocaine users likely suffer from a
   generalized impairment in value representation as well as from an
   aberrant processing of social feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research is beginning to reveal an intricate relationship between
   sleep and decision-making. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a unique
   decision-making task that relies on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC), an area that integrates and weighs previous experiences with
   reward and loss to select choices with the highest overall value.
   Recently, it has been demonstrated that a period of sleep can enhance
   decision-making on this task. Our study investigated the sleep
   mechanisms (sleep stages and cortical activity) that underlie this
   improvement. We recorded electrophysiology for 3 consecutive nights: a
   habituation, baseline, and acquisition night. On acquisition night
   participants were administered either a 200-trial IGT (IGT group; n =
   13) or a 200-trial control (IGT-control group; n = 8) version of the
   task prior to sleep. Compared with baseline, the IGT group had a
   significant increase in theta frequency (4 Hz-8 Hz) on cites located
   above vmPFC and left prefrontal cortex during REM sleep. This increase
   correlated with subsequent performance improvement from deck B, a high
   reward deck with negative long-term outcomes. Furthermore, presleep
   emotional arousal (measured via skin conductance response) toward deck B
   correlated to increased theta activity above the right vmPFC during REM
   sleep. Overall, these results suggests that insight into deck B may be
   enhanced via vmPFC theta activity during REM sleep and REM sleep may
   have distinct mechanisms for processing decision-making information.}},

Abstract = {{Prior research has demonstrated that sleep enhances memory for
   future-relevant information, including memory for information that is
   salient due to emotion, reward, or knowledge of a later memory test.
   Although sleep has been shown to prioritize information with any of
   these characteristics, the present study investigates the novel question
   of how sleep prioritizes information when multiple salience cues exist.
   Participants encoded scenes that were future-relevant based on emotion
   (emotional vs. neutral), reward (rewarded vs. unrewarded), and
   instructed learning (intentionally vs. incidentally encoded), preceding
   a delay consisting of a nap, an equivalent time period spent awake, or a
   nap followed by wakefulness (to control for effects of interference).
   Recognition testing revealed that when multiple dimensions of future
   relevance co-occur, sleep prioritizes top-down, goal-directed cues
   (instructed learning, and to a lesser degree, reward) over bottom-up,
   stimulus-driven characteristics (emotion). Further, results showed that
   these factors interact; the effect of a nap on intentionally encoded
   information was especially strong for neutral (relative to emotional)
   information, suggesting that once one cue for future relevance is
   present, there are diminishing returns with additional cues. Sleep may
   binarize information based on whether it is future-relevant or not,
   preferentially consolidating memory for the former category. Potential
   neural mechanisms underlying these selective effects and the
   implications of this research for educational and vocational domains are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{While the influence of sleep on motor memory consolidation has been
   extensively investigated, its relation to initial skill acquisition is
   less well understood. The purpose of the present study was to
   investigate the influence of sleep quality and quantity on subsequent
   motor skill acquisition in young adults without sleep disorders.
   Fifty-five healthy adults (mean age = 23.8 years; 34 women) wore
   actigraph wristbands for 4 nights, which provided data on sleep patterns
   before the experiment, and then returned to the laboratory to engage in
   a motor sequence learning task (explicit 5-item finger sequence tapping
   task). Indicators of sleep quality and quantity were then regressed on a
   measure of motor skill acquisition (Gains Within Training, GWT). Wake
   After Sleep Onset (WASO; i.e., the total amount of time the participants
   spent awake after falling asleep) was significantly and negatively
   related to GWT. This effect was not because of general arousal level,
   which was measured immediately before the motor task. Conversely, there
   was no relationship between GWT and sleep duration or self-reported
   sleep quality. These results indicate that sleep quality, as assessed by
   WASO and objectively measured with actigraphy before the motor task,
   significantly impacts motor skill acquisition in young healthy adults
   without sleep disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence suggests that sleep is important for procedural
   learning, but few studies have investigated the effect of sleep on the
   temporal aspects of motor skill learning. We assessed the effect of a
   90-min day-time nap on learning a motor timing task, using 2 adaptations
   of a serial interception sequence learning (SISL) task. Forty-two
   right-handed participants performed the task before and after a 90-min
   period of sleep or wake. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded
   throughout. The motor task consisted of a sequential spatial pattern and
   was performed according to 2 different timing conditions, that is,
   either following a sequential or a random temporal pattern. The increase
   in accuracy was compared between groups using a mixed linear regression
   model. Within the sleep group, performance improvement was modeled based
   on sleep characteristics, including spindle-and slow-wave density. The
   sleep group, but not the wake group, showed improvement in the random
   temporal, but especially and significantly more strongly in the
   sequential temporal condition. None of the sleep characteristics
   predicted improvement on either general of the timing conditions. In
   conclusion, a daytime nap improves performance on a timing task. We show
   that performance on the task with a sequential timing sequence benefits
   more from sleep than motor timing. More important, the temporal sequence
   did not benefit initial learning, because differences arose only after
   an offline period and specifically when this period contained sleep.
   Sleep appears to aid in the extraction of regularities for optimal
   subsequent performance.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to identify default mode network (DMN) functional
   connectivity deficits in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   and sleep disturbance, relative to those with MCI and no sleep
   disturbance. A control group was included to aid in identifying DMN
   changes specific to MCI. A cross-sectional, single-center study was
   performed at the Brain and Mind Research Centre in Sydney, Australia.
   Participants (95 adults over the age of 65: 38 controls and 57 meeting
   criteria for MCI) underwent resting-state functional MRI along with
   comprehensive neuropsychological, medical, and psychiatric assessment.
   Self-report data were collected including sleep quality assessment via
   the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. A total score of greater than 5 on
   the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to signify the presence of
   significant sleep disturbance, as per commonly used methodology. Using
   this criterion, 53\% (n = 30) of our MCI group were classified as
   sleep-disturbed. Whereas the total group of MCI subjects and controls
   demonstrated no significant differences, sleep-disturbed MCIs
   demonstrated increased connectivity between temporal and parietal
   regions, and decreased connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and
   the temporoparietal junction relative to sleep-disturbed controls.
   Relative to those MCIs without sleep disturbance, sleep-disturbed MCI
   participants demonstrated significantly diminished DMN connectivity
   between temporal and parietal regions, a finding that was particularly
   pronounced in amnestic MCI. Sleep disturbance in MCI is associated with
   distinct alterations in DMN functional connectivity in brain regions
   underpinning salient memory and sleep systems. Future studies may build
   on these results via experimental manipulation and objective measurement
   of sleep.}},

   have been found to be abnormal in patients with epilepsy. In this study,
   we explored the effects that nocturnal epileptiform discharges and the

   Twenty-five patients with focal epilepsy who underwent a 24-hr
   ambulatory EEG also completed the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ).
   The EEG record was scored for length of time spent in the various sleep
   stages, time spent awake after sleep onset, and rapid eye movement (REM)
   latency. Of these sleep variables, only REM latency differed when the
   epilepsy patients were divided on the bases of either presence/absence
   of nocturnal discharges or presence/absence of a hippocampal lesion. In
   both cases, presence of the abnormality was associated with longer
   latency. Furthermore, longer REM latency was found to be a better
   predictor of EMQ score than either number of discharges or presence of a
   hippocampal lesion. Longer REM latency was associated with a smaller
   percentage of time spent in slow-wave sleep in the early part of the
   night and may serve as a particularly sensitive marker to disturbances
   in sleep architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term sleep deprivation soon after training may impair memory
   consolidation. Also, a particular sleep stage or its components increase
   after learning some tasks, such as negative and positive reinforcement
   tasks, avoidance tasks, and spatial learning tasks, and so forth. It
   suggests that discrete memory types may require specific sleep stage or
   its components for their optimal processing. The classical conditioning
   paradigms are widely used to study learning and memory but the role of
   sleep in a complex conditioned learning is unclear. Here, we have
   investigated the effects of short-term sleep deprivation on the
   consolidation of delay-conditioned memory and the changes in sleep
   architecture after conditioning. Rats were trained for the
   delay-conditioned task (for conditioning, house-light {[}conditioned
   stimulus] was paired with fruit juice {[}unconditioned stimulus]).
   Animals were divided into 3 groups: (a) sleep deprived (SD); (b)
   nonsleep deprived (NSD); and (c) stress control (SC) groups. Two-way
   ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between groups and days
   (training and testing) during the conditioned stimulus-unconditioned
   stimulus presentation. Further, Tukey post hoc comparison revealed that
   the NSD and SC animals exhibited significant increase in performances
   during testing. The SD animals, however, performed significantly less
   during testing. Further, we observed that wakefulness and NREM sleep did
   not change after training and testing. Interestingly, REM sleep
   increased significantly on both days compared to baseline more
   specifically during the initial 4-hr time window after conditioning. Our
   results suggest that the consolidation of delay-conditioned memory is
   sleep-dependent and requires augmented REM sleep during an explicit time
   window soon after training.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent and greatly affect consecutive
   emotional reactivity, while sleep quality itself can be strongly
   affected by reactions to previous emotional events. In this review, we
   shed light on this bidirectional relation through examples of pathology:
   insomnia and bipolar disorder. We show that both experimental sleep
   deprivation and insomnia are related to increased emotional reactivity
   and increased amygdala activation upon emotional stimuli presentation,
   and that particularly Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is important for
   emotional processing and reorganization of emotion-specific brain
   activity. Increased emotional reactivity affects REM sleep quality and
   sleep spindles, while REM sleep is particularly affected in insomnia,
   possibly related to condition-specific hyperarousal levels. Normal sleep
   onset deactivation of brain regions important for emotional processing
   (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) is further affected in
   insomnia. In bipolar disorder, sleep disturbances are common in both
   symptomatic and nonsymptomatic phases. Both amygdala and ACC volume and
   function are affected in bipolar disorder, with the ACC showing
   phase-dependent resting state activity differences. Deficient
   Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) GABA-ergic activity of this region might
   play a role in sleep disturbances and their influence on emotional
   reactivity, given the inhibitory role of GABA on brain activity during
   sleep and its deficiency in both bipolar disorder and insomnia.
   Promising findings of normalizing brain activity in both insomnia and
   bipolar disorder upon treatment may inspire a focus on treatment studies
   investigating the normalization of sleep, emotional reactivity, and
   their corresponding brain activity patterns.}},

Abstract = {{A substantial portion of men treated for prostate cancer report
   clinically significant sleep problems and disturbance in sleep quality
   constitutes significant risk for the development of depressive symptoms
   in survivors. Dysregulation in biological stress processes underlies the
   impact of poor sleep on the onset and/or progression of depressive
   symptoms, yet few studies have sought to identify potential
   neurobiological mechanisms (e.g., HPA axis activation) underlying this
   association in PC survivors. The present study examines the
   relationships between sleep disturbance, depressive symptoms, and
   indices of diurnal cortisol patterns among men treated for prostate
   cancer. In total, 66 men (84.8\% White; mean age = 65.8 years, SD =
   9.04) treated in the prior 2 years for localized prostate cancer were
   recruited. They completed questionnaires to measure sleep quality and
   depressive symptoms at study entry (T1) and 4 months later (T2). They
   also provided 4 saliva samples per day, over 3 days, at T1. Three
   cortisol indices were computed: diurnal slope, area under the curve
   (AUC(g)), and cortisol awakening response (CAR). Analyses indicate that,
   controlling for body mass index and age, worse sleep quality at T1 was
   significantly associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms at
   T2. Significant indirect effects were observed for cortisol slope
   (indirect effect = -.17, 95\% CI {[}-.61, -.01]) and AUC(g) (indirect
   effect = -.14, 95\% CI {[}-.43, -.01]), but not CAR. Results suggest
   that dysregulation in HPA activity acts as a neurobiological mechanism
   of the impact of sleep disruption on depressive symptoms in men with
   prostate cancer.}},

Abstract = {{The true intentions of humans are sometimes difficult to ascertain
   exclusively from explicit expressions, such as speech, gestures, or
   facial expressions. In this experiment, functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate implicit intentions that were
   generated while a subject was reading self-relevant sentences. Short
   sentences, which were presented visually, consisted of self-relevant
   statements and a substantive verb, which indicated sentence polarity as
   either affirmative or negative. Each sentence was divided into the
   contents and the sentence ending, and the subjects were asked to respond
   with either agreement or disagreement after the complete sentence was
   presented. The overall group analysis suggested that the intention of
   the sentence response was found even before the reading of the complete
   sentences. Increased neural activation was found in the left medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC) during feelings of agreement compared to
   feelings of disagreement during self-relevant decision-making. In
   addition, according to the sentence ending, the decision of a response
   activated the frontopolar cortex (FPC) in the switching condition. These
   findings indicated that the implicit intentions of responses to the
   given statements were internally generated before an explicit response
   occurred, and, hence, intentions can be used to predict a subject's
   future answer.}},

Abstract = {{The role of emotion in moral decision-making is still a matter of
   debate. Greene, Sommerville, Nystrom, Darley, and Cohen (2001) argue
   that `personal' moral judgments are driven by emotional responses, while
   `impersonal' judgments are largely driven by cognitive processes. In
   this study, oscillatory correlates of decision-making were compared in
   moral personal, moral impersonal, and nonmoral conditions, as well as in
   trials associated with utilitarian (i.e., favoring the `greater good'
   over individual rights) and non-utilitarian choices. Event-related
   synchronization in delta and theta bands was greater in the right
   temporal lobe in personal than in both nonmoral and impersonal moral
   condition. Graph-theoretical analysis of connectivity patterns showed
   the prominent role of the orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices in
   personal moral decision-making, implying greater emotional and
   self-processing. Higher conscientiousness and intellect and lower
   behavioral activation were associated with greater difference in
   oscillatory responses between utilitarian and non-utilitarian choices in
   personal than in impersonal condition, indicating that sensitivity to
   moral issues and the ability to grasp the nuances of moral situation are
   essential for understanding the implications of utilitarian choices in

Abstract = {{Recent studies have demonstrated neural overlap between resting state
   activity and self-referential processing. This ``rest-self{''} overlap
   occurs especially in anterior cortical midline structures like the
   perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC). However, the exact
   neurotemporal and biochemical mechanisms remain to be identified.
   Therefore, we conducted a combined electroencephalography (EEG)-magnetic
   resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study. EEG focused on pre-stimulus (e.g.,
   prior to stimulus presentation or perception) power changes to assess
   the degree to which those changes can predict subjects' perception (and
   judgment) of subsequent stimuli as high or low self-related. MRS
   measured resting state concentration of glutamate, focusing on PACC.
   High pre-stimulus (e.g., prior to stimulus presentation or perception)
   alpha power significantly correlated with both perception of stimuli
   judged to be highly self-related and with resting state glutamate
   concentrations in the PACC. In sum, our results show (i) pre-stimulus
   (e.g., prior to stimulus presentation or perception) alpha power and
   resting state glutamate concentration to mediate rest-self overlap that
   (ii) dispose or incline subjects to assign high degrees of
   self-relatedness to perceptual stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{This neuroimaging study compares brain activation during causal
   attribution to three different attribution loci (i.e., self, another
   person, and situation) across a typical population without (N=20) or
   with subclinical autism spectrum symptoms (N=18) and a clinical
   population with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; N=11). While they
   underwent fMRI, all participants read short sentences describing
   positive and negative behaviors and thoughts of another person directed
   toward the participant (i.e., ``you{''}). Participants were then asked
   to attribute these behaviors to themselves, the other person, or the
   situation. Behavioral measures revealed self-serving attributions (i.e.,
   attributing positive events to the self, while attributing negative
   events externally from the self) in all three participant groups. Neural
   measures revealed a great deal of shared activation across the three
   attribution loci and across the three participant groups in the
   temporo-parietal junction, the posterior superior sulcus, and the
   precuneus. Comparison between groups revealed more widespread activation
   in both subclinical and clinical ASD participants, which may be
   indicative of the extraneural resources these participants invest to
   compensate their impairments.}},

Abstract = {{Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition characterized by an overly
   gregarious personality, including high empathetic concern for others.
   Although seemingly disparate from the profile of autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD), both are associated with deficits in social
   communication/cognition. Notably, the mirror neuron system (MNS) has
   been implicated in social dysfunction for ASD; yet, the integrity of
   this network and its association with social functioning in WS remains
   unknown. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods were used to examine
   the structural integrity of the MNS of adults with WS versus typically
   developing (TD) individuals. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a
   tool typically used to screen for social features of ASD, was also
   employed to assess the relationships between social functioning with the
   MNS morphology in WS participants. WS individuals showed reduced
   cortical surface area of MNS substrates yet relatively preserved
   cortical thickness as compared to TD adults. Increased cortical
   thickness of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) was associated with
   increased deficits in social communication, social awareness, social
   cognition, and autistic mannerisms. However, social motivation was not
   related to anatomical features of the MNS. Our findings indicate that
   social deficits typical to both ASD and WS may be attributed to an
   aberrant MNS, whereas the unusual social drive marked in WS is subserved
   by substrates distinct from this network.}},

Abstract = {{Neural activities triggered by viewing other's in pain have been
   previously reported to be modulated by various factors. How instructions
   of cooperation and competition can influence these activities has not
   been explored yet. In the current study, participants were instructed to
   play a game cooperatively or competitively with a partner. During the

   or non-painful situations were randomly presented in an oddball style.
   The event-related potentials (ERPs) when the participants passively
   observed these pictures under different instructions were compared. We
   found a significant interaction of Instruction x Picture on the P3
   component, where only under competitive instruction did the painful
   pictures elicit significantly larger amplitudes than the non-painful
   pictures, but not under the cooperative instruction. This result
   indicates that the participants were more responsive to other's pain in

Abstract = {{The present research explored the effect of cross-modal integration of
   emotional cues (auditory and visual (AV)) compared with only visual (V)
   emotional cues in observing interspecies interactions. The brain
   activity was monitored when subjects processed AV and V situations,
   which represented an emotional (positive or negative), interspecies
   (human-animal) interaction. Congruence (emotionally congruous or
   incongruous visual and auditory patterns) was also modulated.
   electroencephalography brain oscillations (from delta to beta) were
   analyzed and the cortical source localization (by standardized Low
   Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography) was applied to the data.
   Frequency band (mainly low-frequency delta and theta) showed a
   significant brain activity increasing in response to negative compared
   to positive interactions within the right hemisphere. Moreover,
   differences were found based on stimulation type, with an increased
   effect for AV compared with V. Finally, delta band supported a
   lateralized right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity in
   response to negative and incongruous interspecies interactions, mainly
   for AV. The contribution of cross-modality, congruence (incongruous
   patterns), and lateralization (right DLPFC) in response to interspecies
   emotional interactions was discussed at light of a ``negative

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{311-316}},
Month = {{MAY 3}},
Abstract = {{Several neuroimaging studies have revealed that the superior temporal
   sulcus (STS) is highly implicated in the processing of facial motion. A
   limitation of these investigations, however, is that many of them
   utilize unnatural stimuli (e.g., morphed videos) or those which contain
   many confounding spatial cues. As a result, the underlying mechanisms
   may not be fully engaged during such perception. The aim of the current
   study was to build upon the existing literature by implementing highly
   detailed and accurate models of facial movement. Accordingly,
   neurologically healthy participants viewed simultaneous sequences of
   rigid and nonrigid motion that was retargeted onto a standard computer
   generated imagery face model. Their task was to discriminate between
   different facial motion videos in a two-alternative forced choice
   paradigm. Presentations varied between upright and inverted
   orientations. In corroboration with previous data, the perception of
   natural facial motion strongly activated a portion of the posterior STS.
   The analysis also revealed engagement of the lingual gyrus, fusiform
   gyrus, precentral gyrus, and cerebellum. These findings therefore
   suggest that the processing of dynamic facial information is supported
   by a network of visuomotor substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Attachment is critical to each individual. It affects the

   examines how attachment affects the processing of social information,
   specifically maternal information. We assessed the behavioral and
   electrophysiological responses to maternal information (compared to
   non-specific others) in a Go/No-go Association Task (GNAT) with 22
   participants. The results illustrated that attachment affected maternal
   information processing during three sequential stages of information
   processing. First, attachment affected visual perception, reflected by
   enhanced P100 and N170 elicited by maternal information as compared to
   others information. Second, compared to others, mother obtained more
   attentional resources, reflected by faster behavioral response to
   maternal information and larger P200 and P300. Finally, mother was
   evaluated positively, reflected by shorter P300 latency in a mother+good
   condition as compared to a mother+bad condition. These findings
   indicated that the processing of attachment-relevant information is
   neurologically differentiated from other types of social information
   from an early stage of perceptual processing to late high-level

Abstract = {{The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) plays a key role in emotion
   processing and regulation. vmPFC dysfunction may lead to disinhibition
   of amygdala causing high anxiety levels. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)
   inter-neurons within vmPFC shape the information flow to amygdala. Thus,
   we hypothesize that GABA content within vmPFC could be relevant to trait
   anxiety. Forty-three healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 88 years
   were assessed for trait anxiety with the Subscale-2 of the
   State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y2) and were studied with proton
   magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate GABA and Glx
   (glutamate+glutamine) contents within vmPFC. Total creatine (tCr) was
   used as internal reference. Partial correlations assessed the
   association between metabolite levels and STAI-Y2 scores, removing the
   effect of possible nuisance factors including age, educational level,
   volumes of gray matter and white matter within magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy voxel. We observed a positive relationship between GABA/tCr
   and STAI-Y2 scores. No significant relationships were found between
   Glx/tCr and STAI-Y2 and between tCr/water and STAI-Y2. No differences
   were found between males and females as regards to age, STAI-Y2,
   GABA/tCr, Glx/tCr, tCr/water, gray matter and white matter volumes. We
   suggest a close relationship between GABA content within vmPFC and trait
   anxiety providing new insights in the physiology of emotional brain.}},

Abstract = {{Guilt is thought to maintain social harmony by motivating reparation.
   This study compared two methodologies commonly used to identify the
   neural correlates of guilt. The first, imagined guilt, requires
   participants to read hypothetical scenarios and then imagine themselves
   as the protagonist. The second, recollected guilt, requires participants
   to reflect on times they personally experienced guilt. In the fMRI
   scanner, participants were presented with guilt/neutral memories and
   guilt/neutral hypothetical scenarios. Contrasts confirmed a priori
   predictions that guilt memories, relative to guilt scenarios, were
   associated with significantly greater activity in regions associated
   with affect {[}anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), Caudate, Insula, orbital
   frontal cortex (OFC)] and social cognition {[}temporal pole (TP),
   precuneus). Similarly, results indicated that guilt memories, relative
   to neutral memories, were also associated with greater activity in
   affective (ACC, amygdala, Insula, OFC) and social cognition (mPFC, TP,
   precuneus, temporo-parietal junction) regions. There were no significant
   differences between guilt hypothetical scenarios and neutral
   hypothetical scenarios in either affective or social cognition regions.
   The importance of distinguishing between different guilt inductions
   inside the scanner is discussed. We offer explanations of our results
   and discuss ideas for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Negative social feedback often generates aggressive feelings and
   behavior. Prior studies have investigated the neural basis of negative
   social feedback, but the underlying neural mechanisms of aggression
   regulation following negative social feedback remain largely
   undiscovered. In the current study, participants viewed pictures of
   peers with feedback (positive, neutral or negative) to the participant's
   personal profile. Next, participants responded to the peer feedback by
   pressing a button, thereby producing a loud noise toward the peer, as an
   index of aggression. Behavioral analyses showed that negative feedback
   led to more aggression (longer noise blasts). Conjunction neuroimaging
   analyses revealed that both positive and negative feedback were
   associated with increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC)
   and bilateral insula. In addition, more activation in the right dorsal
   lateral PFC (dlPFC) during negative feedback vs neutral feedback was
   associated with shorter noise blasts in response to negative social
   feedback, suggesting a potential role of dlPFC in aggression regulation,
   or top-down control over affective impulsive actions. This study
   demonstrates a role of the dlPFC in the regulation of aggressive social
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Although we know the transition from childhood to adulthood is marked by
   important social and neural development, little is known about how
   social network size might affect neurocognitive development or vice
   versa. Neuroimaging research has identified several brain regions, such
   as the amygdala, as key to this affiliative behavior. However, white
   matter connectivity among these regions, and its behavioral correlates,
   remain unclear. Here we tested two hypotheses: that an amygdalocentric
   structural white matter network governs social affiliative behavior and
   that this network changes during adolescence and young adulthood. We
   measured social network size behaviorally, and white matter
   microstructure using probabilistic diffusion tensor imaging in a sample
   of neurologically normal adolescents and young adults. Our results
   suggest amygdala white matter microstructure is key to understanding
   individual differences in social network size, with connectivity to
   other social brain regions such as the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior
   temporal lobe predicting much variation. In addition, participant age
   correlated with both network size and white matter variation in this
   network. These findings suggest the transition to adulthood may
   constitute a critical period for the optimization of structural brain
   networks underlying affiliative behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Close social bonds are critical to a happy and fulfilled life and yet
   little is known, in humans, about the neurochemical mechanisms that keep
   individuals feeling close and connected to one another. According to the
   brain opioid theory of social attachment, opioids may underlie the
   contented feelings associated with social connection and may be critical
   to continued bonding. However, the role of opioids in feelings of
   connection toward close others has only begun to be examined in humans.
   In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of naltrexone (an
   opioid antagonist), 31 volunteers took naltrexone for 4 days and placebo
   for 4 days (separated by a 10-day washout period). Participants came to
   the laboratory once on the last day of taking each drug to complete a
   task designed to elicit feelings of social connection. Participants also
   completed daily reports of feelings of social connection while on
   naltrexone and placebo. In line with hypotheses, and for the first time
   in humans, results demonstrated that naltrexone reduced feelings of
   connection both in the laboratory and in daily reports. These results
   highlight the importance of opioids for social bonding with close
   others, lending support to the brain opioid theory of social attachment.}},

Abstract = {{We present neuroimaging markers of the remitted state of major

   individuals during fMRI. Participants comprised 47 individuals (aged
   18-23) diagnosed with rMDD and 37 healthy controls (HCs). Participants
   classified emotional faces or animals (control condition) in the Facial
   Emotion Perception Test (FEPT) during fMRI. Behavioural performance on
   the FEPT did not differ significantly between groups. During fMRI, both
   groups demonstrated significant blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
   activity in bilateral inferior frontal gyri for the faces minus animals
   (F-A) contrast. The rMDD group additionally showed BOLD activity during
   F-A in numerous regions, including the bilateral paracingulate gyri,
   middle temporal gyri and right amygdala. The rMDD group exhibited
   significantly greater activity than the HC group in regions including
   the bilateral middle temporal gyri and left superior frontal gyrus.
   Although the rMDD group did not manifest the behavioural performance
   deficits on facial emotion recognition tasks that have been observed in
   actively depressed individuals, the rMDD group nevertheless showed
   increased BOLD activity compared with never-depressed controls during
   F-A in multiple posterior brain regions, suggesting that persistent
   effects of illness or possible trait vulnerabilities may distinguish
   individuals with rMDD from never-depressed controls.}},

Abstract = {{Individual differences in cognitive ability and social behaviour are
   influenced by the variability in the structure and function of the
   limbic system. A strong heritability of the limbic cortex has been
   previously reported, but little is known about how genetic factors
   influence specific limbic networks. We used diffusion tensor imaging
   tractography to investigate heritability of different limbic tracts in
   52 monozygotic and 34 dizygotic healthy adult twins. We explored the
   connections that contribute to the activity of three distinct functional
   limbic networks, namely the dorsal cingulum ('medial default-mode
   network'), the ventral cingulum and the fornix
   ('hippocampal-diencephalic-retrosplenial network') and the uncinate
   fasciculus ('temporo-amygdala-orbitofrontal network'). Genetic and
   environmental variances were mapped for multiple tract-specific measures
   that reflect different aspects of the underlying anatomy. We report the
   highest heritability for the uncinate fasciculus, a tract that underpins
   emotion processing, semantic cognition, and social behaviour. High to
   moderate genetic and shared environmental effects were found for
   pathways important for social behaviour and memory, for example, fornix,
   dorsal and ventral cingulum. These findings indicate that within the
   limbic system inheritance of specific traits may rely on the anatomy of
   distinct networks and is higher for fronto-temporal pathways dedicated
   to complex social behaviour and emotional processing.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothalamic peptide oxytocin (OXT) has been identified as a key
   modulator of pair-bonding in men, but its effects in women are still
   elusive. Moreover, there is substantial evidence that hormonal
   contraception (HC) influences partner preferences and sexual
   satisfaction, which constitute core domains of OXT function. We thus
   hypothesized that OXT effects on partner-related behavioral and neural
   responses could be significantly altered in women using HC. In this
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study involving 40 pair-bonded
   women, 21 of whom were using HC, we investigated whether a 24-IU nasal
   dose of OXT would modulate brain reward responses evoked by the romantic
   partner's face relative to the faces of familiar and unfamiliar people.
   Treatment with OXT increased the perceived attractiveness of the partner
   relative to other men, which was paralleled by elevated responses in
   reward-associated regions, including the nucleus accumbens. These
   effects of OXT were absent in women using HC. Our results confirm and
   extend previous findings in men that OXT interacts with the brain reward
   system to reinforce partner value representations, indicating a common
   OXT-dependent mechanism underlying partner attraction in both sexes.
   This mechanism may be disturbed in women using HC, suggesting that
   gonadal steroids could alter partner-specific OXT effects.}},

Abstract = {{Unpredictable environments can be anxiety-provoking and elicit
   exaggerated emotional responses to aversive stimuli. Even neutral
   stimuli, when presented in an unpredictable fashion, prime anxiety-like
   behavior and elicit heightened amygdala activity. The amygdala plays a
   key role in initiating responses to biologically relevant information,
   such as facial expressions of emotion. While some expressions clearly
   signal negative (anger) or positive (happy) events, other expressions
   (e.g. surprise) are more ambiguous in that they can predict either
   valence, depending on the context. Here, we sought to determine whether
   unpredictable presentations of ambiguous facial expressions would bias
   participants to interpret them more negatively. We used functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and facial electromyography (EMG) to
   characterize responses to predictable vs unpredictable presentations of
   surprised faces. We observed moderate but sustained increases in
   amygdala reactivity to predictable presentations of surprised faces, and
   relatively increased amygdala responses to unpredictable faces that then
   habituated, similar to previously observed responses to clearly negative
   (e.g. fearful) faces. We also observed decreased corrugator EMG
   responses to predictable surprised face presentations, similar to happy
   faces, and increased responses to unpredictable surprised face
   presentations, similar to angry faces. Taken together, these data
   suggest that unpredictability biases people to interpret ambiguous
   social cues negatively.}},

Abstract = {{Although it has been proposed that schizophrenia is characterized by
   impaired empathy, several recent studies found intact neural responses
   on tasks measuring the affective subdomain of empathy. This study
   further examined affective empathy in 21 schizophrenia outpatients and
   21 healthy controls using a validated pain empathy paradigm with two
   components: (i) observing videos of people described as medical patients
   who were receiving a painful sound stimulation treatment; (ii) listening
   to the painful sounds (to create regions of interest). The observing
   videos component incorporated experimental manipulations of perspective
   taking (instructions to imagine `Self' vs `Other' experiencing pain) and
   cognitive appraisal (information about whether treatment was `Effective'
   vs `Not Effective'). When considering activation across experimental
   conditions, both groups showed similar dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
   (dACC) and anterior insula (AI) activation while merely observing others
   in pain. However, there were group differences associated with
   perspective taking: controls showed relatively greater dACC and AI
   activation for the Self vs Other contrast whereas patients showed
   relatively greater activation in these and additional regions for the
   Other vs Self contrast. Although patients demonstrated grossly intact
   neural activity while observing others in pain, they showed more subtle
   abnormalities when required to toggle between imagining themselves vs
   others experiencing pain.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate estimation of the proximity of threat is important for
   biological survival and to assess relevant events of everyday life. We
   addressed the question of whether proximal as compared with distal vocal
   threat would lead to a perceptual advantage for the perceiver.
   Accordingly, we sought to highlight the neural mechanisms underlying the
   perception of proximal vs distal threatening vocal signals by the use of
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although we found that the
   inferior parietal and superior temporal cortex of human listeners
   generally decoded the spatial proximity of auditory vocalizations,
   activity in the right voice-sensitive auditory cortex was specifically
   enhanced for proximal aggressive relative to distal aggressive voices as
   compared with neutral voices. Our results shed new light on the
   processing of imminent danger signaled by proximal vocal threat and show
   the crucial involvement of the right mid voice-sensitive auditory cortex
   in such processing.}},

Abstract = {{Being a complex phenotype with substantial heritability, anxiety and
   related phenotypes are characterized by a complex polygenic basis.
   Thereby, one candidate pathway is neuronal nitric oxide (NO) signaling,
   and accordingly, rodent studies have identified NO synthase (NOS-I),
   encoded by NOS1, as a strong molecular candidate for modulating anxiety
   and hippocampus-dependent learning processes. Using a multi-dimensional
   and -methodological replication approach, we investigated the impact of
   a functional promoter polymorphism (NOS1-ex1f-VNTR) on human
   anxiety-related phenotypes in a total of 1019 healthy controls in five
   different studies. Homozygous carriers of the NOS1-ex1f short-allele
   displayed enhanced trait anxiety, worrying and depression scores.
   Furthermore, short-allele carriers were characterized by increased
   anxious apprehension during contextual fear conditioning. While
   autonomous measures (fear-potentiated startle) provided only suggestive
   evidence for a modulatory role of NOS1-ex1f-VNTR on (contextual) fear
   conditioning processes, neural activation at the amygdala/anterior
   hippocampus junction was significantly increased in short-allele
   carriers during context conditioning. Notably, this could not be
   attributed to morphological differences. In accordance with data from a
   plethora of rodent studies, we here provide converging evidence from
   behavioral, subjective, psychophysiological and neuroimaging studies in
   large human cohorts that NOS-I plays an important role in anxious
   apprehension but provide only limited evidence for a role in
   (contextual) fear conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{Stress exposure has been linked to increased rates of depression and
   anxiety in adults, particularly in females, and has been associated with
   maladaptive changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which is an
   important brain structure involved in internalizing disorders. Coping
   styles are important mediators of the stress reaction by establishing
   homeostasis, and may thus confer resilience to stress-related
   psychopathology. Anatomical scans were acquired in 181 healthy
   participants at age 25 years. Positive coping styles were determined
   using a self-report questionnaire (German Stress Coping Questionnaire,
   SVF78) at age 22 years. Adult anxiety and depression symptoms were
   assessed at ages 22, 23 and 25 years with the Young Adult Self-Report.
   Information on previous internalizing diagnoses was obtained by
   diagnostic interview (2-19 years). Positive coping styles were
   associated with increased ACC volume. ACC volume and positive coping
   styles predicted anxiety and depression in a sex-dependent manner with
   increased positive coping and ACC volume being related to lower levels
   of psychopathology in females, but not in males. These results remained
   significant when controlled for previous internalizing diagnoses. These
   findings indicate that positive coping styles and ACC volume are two
   linked mechanisms, which may serve as protective factors against
   internalizing disorders.}},

Abstract = {{In real world situations, we typically listen to voice prosody against a
   background crowded with auditory stimuli. Voices and background can both
   contain behaviorally relevant features and both can be selectively in
   the focus of attention. Adequate responses to threat-related voices
   under such conditions require that the brain unmixes reciprocally masked
   features depending on variable cognitive resources. It is unknown which
   brain systems instantiate the extraction of behaviorally relevant
   prosodic features under varying combinations of prosody valence,
   auditory background complexity and attentional focus. Here, we used
   event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the
   effects of high background sound complexity and attentional focus on
   brain activation to angry and neutral prosody in humans. Results show
   that prosody effects in mid superior temporal cortex were gated by
   background complexity but not attention, while prosody effects in the
   amygdala and anterior superior temporal cortex were gated by attention
   but not background complexity, suggesting distinct emotional prosody
   processing limitations in different regions. Crucially, if attention was
   focused on the highly complex background, the differential processing of
   emotional prosody was prevented in all brain regions, suggesting that in
   a distracting, complex auditory world even threatening voices may go
   unnoticed.}},

Abstract = {{Despite evidence documenting activation of the social pain network in
   response to social rejection and its link to temporary distress, far
   less is known regarding its role in pervasive emotional difficulties.
   Moreover, research has not considered the intersection between neural
   activation to experimentally induced social exclusion and naturally
   occurring social adversity. This study examined an integrated social
   pain model of internalizing symptoms, which posits that (i) neural
   sensitivity in the social pain network is associated with internalizing
   symptoms, (ii) this linkage is more robust in youth with than without a
   history of social adversity, and (iii) heightened avoidance motivation
   serves as one pathway linking neural sensitivity and internalizing
   symptoms. During a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, 47
   adolescent girls (M age = 15.46 years, SD = .35) with well-characterized
   histories of peer victimization were exposed to social exclusion.
   Whole-brain analyses revealed that activation to exclusion in the social
   pain network was associated with internalizing symptoms. As anticipated,
   this linkage was stronger in chronically victimized than non-victimized
   girls and was partially accounted for by avoidance motivation. This
   research indicates the importance of integrating neural, social and
   psychological systems of development in efforts to elucidate risk for
   internalizing symptoms among adolescent girls.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The habenula has been implicated in predicting negative events and in
   responding to unexpected negative outcomes. Animal models of depression
   have supported the hypothesis that perturbations in habenula activity
   contribute to the pathophysiology of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a
   psychiatric illness characterized by abnormalities in responding to
   negative feedback and by pessimism in evaluating the likelihood of
   future events. No research to date, however, has examined human habenula
   responses to potential and experienced negative outcomes in MDD. In this
   study, depressed and healthy control participants performed a
   probabilistic guessing task for monetary rewards and penalties during
   high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging of the habenula.
   In healthy adults, we observed a pattern of habenula activation
   consistent with its hypothesized role in predicting future losses and
   responding to suboptimal outcomes. In contrast, in depressed
   participants the left habenula was not activated significantly during
   the prediction or experience of monetary penalty. Complementing this
   group difference, attenuated habenula activation to negative feedback in
   control participants was associated with levels of shame and rumination.
   The results of this study suggest that depressed individuals are
   characterized by dysfunction in a neural system involved in generating
   expectations and comparing expectations with objective outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex and global phenomenon that
   requires a multi-perspective analysis. Nevertheless, the number of
   neuroscientific studies conducted on this issue is scarce as compared
   with studies of other types of violence, and no neuroimaging studies
   comparing batterers to other criminals have been conducted. Thus, the
   main aim of this study was to compare the brain functioning of batterers
   to that of other criminals when they are exposed to IPV or general
   violence pictures. An fMRI study was conducted in 21 batterers and 20
   other criminals while they observed IPV images (IPVI), general violence
   images (GVI) and neutral images (NI). Results demonstrated that
   batterers, compared with other criminals, exhibited a higher activation
   in the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex and in the middle
   prefrontal cortex and a decreased activation in the superior prefrontal
   cortex to IPVI compared to NI. The paired t-test comparison between IPVI
   and GVI for each group showed engagement of the medial prefrontal
   cortex, the posterior cingulate and the left angular cortices to IPVI in
   the batterer group only. These results could have important implications
   for a better understanding of the IPV phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Learning about other peoples' attributes, e.g. whether an individual is
   generous or selfish, is central to human social cognition. It is well
   documented that a network of cortical regions is reliably activated when
   we engage social processes. However, little is known about the specific
   computations performed by these regions or whether such processing is
   specialized for the social domain. We investigated these questions using
   a task in which participants (N = 26) learned about four peoples'
   generosity by watching them choose to sharemoney with third party
   partners, or not. In a non-social control condition, participants
   learned the win/loss rates of four lotteries. fMRI analysis revealed
   learning-related general (social + non-social) prediction error signals
   in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (bilaterally),
   and in the right lateral parietal cortex. Socially specific (social >
   non-social) prediction error signals were found in the precuneus.
   Interestingly, the region that exhibited social prediction errors was a
   distinct subregion of the area in the precuneus and posterior cingulate
   cortex that exhibited a commonly reported main effect of higher overall
   activity for social vs non-social stimuli. These findings elucidate the
   domain-general and-specific computations underlying learning about other
   people and demonstrate the increased explanatory power of computational
   approaches to social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, adversity was defined as the accumulation of
   environmental events (allostatic load). Recently however, a mismatch
   between the early and the later (adult) environment (mismatch) has been
   hypothesized to be critical for disease development, a hypothesis that
   has not yet been tested explicitly in humans. We explored the impact of
   timing of life adversity (childhood and past year) on anxiety and
   depression levels (N = 833) and brain morphology (N = 129). Both remote
   (childhood) and proximal (recent) adversities were differentially
   mirrored in morphometric changes in areas critically involved in
   emotional processing (i.e. amygdala/hippocampus, dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex, respectively). The effect of adversity on affect acted
   in an additive way with no evidence for interactions (mismatch).
   Structural equation modeling demonstrated a direct effect of adversity
   on morphometric estimates and anxiety/depression without evidence of
   brain morphology functioning as a mediator. Our results highlight that
   adversity manifests as pronounced changes in brain morphometric and
   affective temperament even though these seem to represent distinct
   mechanistic pathways. A major goal of future studies should be to define
   critical time periods for the impact of adversity and strategies for
   intervening to prevent or reverse the effects of adverse childhood life
   experiences.}},

Abstract = {{Impulsive aggression has commonly been associated with a dysfunction of
   the serotonin (5-HT) system: many, but not all, studies point to an
   inverse relationship between 5-HT and aggression. As cerebral 5-HT4
   receptor (5-HT4R) binding has recently been recognized as a proxy for
   stable brain levels of 5-HT, we here test the hypothesis in healthy men
   and women that brain 5-HT levels, as indexed by cerebral 5-HT4R, are
   inversely correlated with trait aggression and impulsivity. Sixty-one
   individuals (47 men) underwent positron emission tomography scanning
   with the radioligand {[}C-11]SB207145 for quantification of brain 5-HT4R
   binding. The Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) and the Barratt
   Impulsiveness Scale were used for assessment of trait aggression and
   trait impulsivity. Among male subjects, there was a positive correlation
   between global 5-HT4R and BPAQ total score (P = 0.037) as well as BPAQ
   physical aggression (P = 0.025). No main effect of global 5-HT4R on
   trait aggression or impulsivity was found in the mixed gender sample,
   but there was evidence for sex interaction effects in the relationship
   between global 5-HT4R and BPAQ physical aggression. In conclusion we
   found that low cerebral 5-HT levels, as indexed by 5-HT4R binding were
   associated with high trait aggression in males, but not in females.}},

Abstract = {{Our ability to process complex social cues presented by faces improves
   during adolescence. Using multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data
   collected longitudinally from a sample of 38 adolescents (17 males) when
   they were 10, 11.5, 13 and 15 years old, we tested the possibility that
   there exists parallel variations in the structural and functional
   development of neural systems supporting face processing. By combining
   measures of task-related functional connectivity and brain morphology,
   we reveal that both the structural covariance and functional
   connectivity among `distal' nodes of the face-processing network engaged
   by ambiguous faces increase during this age range. Furthermore, we show
   that the trajectory of increasing functional connectivity between the
   distal nodes occurs in tandem with the development of their structural
   covariance. This demonstrates a tight coupling between functional and
   structural maturation within the face-processing network. Finally, we
   demonstrate that increased functional connectivity is associated with
   age-related improvements of face-processing performance, particularly in
   females. We suggest that our findings reflect greater integration among
   distal elements of the neural systems supporting the processing of
   facial expressions. This, in turn, might facilitate an enhanced
   extraction of social information from faces during a time when greater
   importance is placed on social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Adapting behavior to changes in the environment is a crucial ability for
   survival but such adaptation varies widely across individuals. Here, we
   asked how humans alter their economic decision-making in response to
   emotional cues, and whether this is related to trait anxiety. Developing
   an emotional decision-making task for functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, in which gambling decisions were preceded by emotional and
   non-emotional primes, we assessed emotional influences on loss aversion,
   the tendency to overweigh potential monetary losses relative to gains.
   Our behavioral results revealed that only low-anxious individuals
   exhibited increased loss aversion under emotional conditions. This
   emotional modulation of decision-making was accompanied by a
   corresponding emotion-elicited increase in amygdala-striatal functional
   connectivity, which correlated with the behavioral effect across
   participants. Consistent with prior reports of `neural loss aversion',
   both amygdala and ventral striatum tracked losses more strongly than
   gains, and amygdala loss aversion signals were exaggerated by emotion,
   suggesting a potential role for this structure in integrating value and
   emotion cues. Increased loss aversion and striatal-amygdala coupling
   induced by emotional cues may reflect the engagement of adaptive
   harm-avoidance mechanisms in low-anxious individuals, possibly promoting
   resilience to psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence from functional neuroimaging studies of emotional perception
   shows that when attention is focused on external features of emotional
   stimuli (external perceptual orienting-EPO), the amygdala is primarily
   engaged, but when attention is turned inwards towards one's own
   emotional state (interoceptive self-orienting-ISO), regions of the
   salience network, such as the anterior insula (AI) and the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), also play a major role. Yet, it is
   unknown if ISO boosts the contributions of AI and dACC not only to
   emotional `perception' but also to emotional `memory'. To investigate
   this issue, participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) while viewing emotional and neutral pictures under ISO or
   EPO, and memory was tested several days later. The study yielded three
   main findings: (i) emotion boosted perception-related activity in the
   amygdala during both ISO and EPO and in the right AI exclusively during
   ISO; (ii) emotion augmented activity predicting subsequent memory in AI
   and dACC during ISO but not during EPO and (iii) high confidence memory
   was associated with increased amygdala-dACC connectivity, selectively
   for ISO encoding. These findings show, for the first time, that ISO
   promotes emotional memory formation via regions associated with
   interoceptive awareness of emotional experience, such as AI and dACC.}},

Abstract = {{Healthy social relationships are linked to myriad positive physical and
   mental health outcomes, raising the question of how to enhance
   relationship formation and quality. Behavioral data suggest that theory
   of mind (ToM) may be one such process. ToM is supported by a network of
   brain regions including the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), medial
   prefrontal cortex and precuneus (PC). However, little research has
   investigated how the ToM network supports healthy social relationships.
   Here, we investigate whether recruitment of the ToM network when
   thinking about the mental states of one's romantic partner predicts the
   partner's well-being. We find that selectivity in left TPJ (LTPJ) and PC
   for beliefs vs physical attributes of one's partner is positively
   associated with partner well-being the day of and day after a meaningful
   encounter. Furthermore, LTPJ and PC selectivity moderated how the
   partner's perception of being understood during the encounter affected
   their later well-being. Finally, we find the association between
   ToM-related neural selectivity and well-being robust to other factors
   related to the relationship and the encounter. Together, these data
   suggest that selective engagement of the neural network supporting ToM
   may be a key ingredient for the development and maintenance of healthy
   romantic relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Aberrant brain reward responses to food-related cues are an implied
   characteristic of human obesity; yet, findings are inconsistent. To
   explain these inconsistencies, we aimed to uncover endophenotypes
   associated with heterogeneity in attributing incentive salience to food
   cues in the context of other emotionally salient cues; a phenomenon
   described as sign-vs goal tracking in preclinical models. Data from 64
   lean and 88 obese adults who were 35.5 +/- 9.4 years old and
   predominantly women (79\%) were analyzed. Participants viewed
   food-related, pleasant, neutral and unpleasant images while recording
   electroencephalograph. Late positive potentials were used to assess
   incentive salience attributed to the visual stimuli. Eating and
   affective traits were also assessed. Findings demonstrated that obese
   individuals, in general, do not demonstrate aberrant brain reward
   responses to food-related cues. As hypothesized, latent profile analysis
   of the late positive potential uncovered two distinct groups.
   `Sign-trackers' showed greater responses to food-related cues (P <
   0.001) but lower responses to pleasant stimuli (P < 0.001) compared with
   `goal-trackers'. There were proportionally more obese than lean
   `sign-trackers' (P = 0.03). Obese `sign-trackers' reported significantly
   higher levels of emotional eating and food craving (P < 0.001). By
   examining the heterogeneity in brain reactivity to various emotional
   stimuli, this translational study highlights the need to consider
   important neurobehavioral endophenotypes of obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Relapse represents a major limitation to long-term remission of
   psychopathology (anxiety, addiction). Relapse of anxiety can be modeled
   in the laboratory as return of fear (ROF) following un-signaled
   re-presentation of the aversive event (reinstatement, RI) after
   extinction. In humans, response enhancement to both the CS+ and CS-
   (generalized RI) or specifically to the CS+ (differential RI) has been
   described following RI. The (psychological) mechanisms and boundary
   conditions underlying these different RI qualities were investigated in
   76 healthy participants using autonomic measures and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. Our results suggest that both processes reflect
   distinct albeit intertwined (psychological) processes which are
   reflected in different neural activation patterns. Differential RI was
   linked to CS+ related hippocampal activation and CS- related
   disinhibition of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The latter
   likely contributes to robust generalized RI which was mirrored in
   thalamic and visual areas (as well as the bed nucleus of the striatum
   and inusula) possibly indicating generally facilitated salience
   processing. In addition, we also present data on experimental boundary
   conditions of RI (trial sequence effects, time stability). Taken
   together, this first comprehensive analysis of RI-induced ROF aids not
   only experimental research on ROF but also understanding of factors
   promoting clinical relapse and the role of the vmPFC.}},

Abstract = {{Self-affirmation theory posits that people are motivated to maintain a
   positive self-view and that threats to perceived self-competence are met
   with resistance. When threatened, self-affirmations can restore
   self-competence by allowing individuals to reflect on sources of
   self-worth, such as core values. Many questions exist, however, about
   the underlying mechanisms associated with self-affirmation. We examined
   the neural mechanisms of self-affirmation with a task developed for use
   in a functional magnetic resonance imaging environment. Results of a
   region of interest analysis demonstrated that participants who were
   affirmed (compared with unaffirmed participants) showed increased
   activity in key regions of the brain's self-processing (medial
   prefrontal cortex + posterior cingulate cortex) and valuation (ventral
   striatum + ventral medial prefrontal cortex) systems when reflecting on
   future-oriented core values (compared with everyday activities).
   Furthermore, this neural activity went on to predict changes in
   sedentary behavior consistent with successful affirmation in response to
   a separate physical activity intervention. These results highlight
   neural processes associated with successful self-affirmation, and
   further suggest that key pathways may be amplified in conjunction with
   prospection.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized social anxiety disorder (gSAD) is associated with aberrant
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) response to threat distractors.
   Perceptual load has been shown to modulate ACC activity such that under
   high load, when demands on processing capacity is restricted,
   individuals with gSAD exhibit compensatory activation to threat
   distractors yet under low load, there is evidence of reduced activation.
   It is not known if neural predictors of response to cognitive behavioral
   therapy (CBT), based on such emotional conflict resolution, interact
   with demands on controlled processes. Prior to CBT, 32 patients with
   gSAD completed an fMRI task involving a target letter in a string of
   identical targets (low perceptual load) or a target letter in a mixed
   letter string (high perceptual load) superimposed on fearful, angry and
   neutral face distractors. Whole-brain voxel-wise analyses revealed
   better CBT outcome was predicted by more frontopartial activity that
   included dorsal ACC (dACC) and insula to threat (vs neutral) distractors
   during high, but not low, perceptual load. Psychophysiological
   interaction analysis with dACC as the seed region revealed less
   connectivity with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to threat distractors
   during high load. Results indicate patients with less regulatory
   capability when demands on higher-order control are great may benefit
   more from CBT.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroscience research has examined separately how we detect human agents
   on the basis of their face and body (person perception) and how we
   reason about their thoughts, traits or intentions (person knowledge).
   Neuroanatomically distinct networks have been associated with person
   perception and person knowledge, but it remains unknown how multiple
   features of a person (e.g. thin and kind) are linked to form a holistic
   identity representation. In this fMRI experiment, we investigated the
   hypothesis that when encountering another person specialised person
   perception circuits would be functionally coupled with circuits involved
   in person knowledge. In a factorial design, we paired bodies or names
   with trait-based or neutral statements, and independent localiser scans
   identified body-selective and mentalising networks. When observing a
   body paired with a trait-implying statement, functional connectivity
   analyses demonstrated that body-selective patches in bilateral fusiform
   gyri were functionally coupled with nodes of the mentalising network. We
   demonstrate that when forming a representation of a person circuits for
   representing another person's physical appearance are linked to circuits
   that are engaged when reasoning about trait-based character. These data
   support the view that a `who' system for social cognition involves
   communication between perceptual and inferential mechanisms when forming
   a representation of another's identity.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the medial prefrontal cortex
   is involved in attributions on enduring and abstract trait
   characteristics of persons, but not in causal attributions of temporary
   here-and-now events. Moreover, the neural representation of trait
   information is thought to be located in the ventral part of the medial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). In order to verify this latter finding, this
   study compared the performance of 8 patients with hypoperfusion of the
   vmPFC, 10 with hypoperfusion excluding the vmPFC and 15 healthy controls
   on trait and causal attribution questionnaires consisting of several
   events presented in brief written scenarios. We also investigated
   whether vmPFC hypoperfusion influenced the experienced intensity of the
   negative or positive valence of the events. Our results showed that
   patients with ventral hypoperfusion performed significantly worse on
   trait attributions in comparison with the non-vmPFC group and healthy
   controls. All groups performed equally well on causal attributions.
   These findings support previous research suggesting that the vmPFC is
   critically involved in enduring trait attribution, but not in temporary
   causal attribution. Considering the emotional experience of valence, the
   findings showed more intense valence ratings for negative events and
   persons. This confirms the role of the vmPFC in the modulation and
   regulation of negative emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Stress exposure is known to precipitate psychological disorders.
   However, large differences exist in how individuals respond to stressful
   situations. A major marker for stress sensitivity is
   hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis function. Here, we studied how
   interindividual variance in both basal cortisol levels and
   stress-induced cortisol responses predicts differences in neural
   vigilance processing during stress exposure. Implementing a randomized,
   counterbalanced, crossover design, 120 healthy male participants were
   exposed to a stress-induction and control procedure, followed by an
   emotional perception task (viewing fearful and happy faces) during fMRI
   scanning. Stress sensitivity was assessed using physiological (salivary
   cortisol levels) and psychological measures (trait questionnaires). High
   stress-induced cortisol responses were associated with increased stress
   sensitivity as assessed by psychological questionnaires, a stronger
   stress-induced increase in medial temporal activity and greater
   differential amygdala responses to fearful as opposed to happy faces
   under control conditions. In contrast, high basal cortisol levels were
   related to relative stress resilience as reflected by higher
   extraversion scores, a lower stress-induced increase in amygdala
   activity and enhanced differential processing of fearful compared with
   happy faces under stress. These findings seem to reflect a critical role
   for HPA-axis signaling in stress coping; higher basal levels indicate
   stress resilience, whereas higher cortisol responsivity to stress might
   facilitate recovery in those individuals prone to react sensitively to
   stress.}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests that individuals with conduct disorder (CD) are marked
   by social impairments, such as difficulties in processing the affective
   reactions of others. Little is known, though, about how they make
   decisions during social interactions in response to emotional
   expressions of others. In this study, we therefore investigated the
   neural mechanisms underlying fairness decisions in response to
   communicated emotions of others in aggressive, criminal justice-involved
   boys with CD (N = 32) compared with typically developing (TD) boys (N =
   33), aged 15-19 years. Participants received written emotional responses
   (angry, disappointed or happy) from peers in response to a previous
   offer and then had to make fairness decisions in a version of the
   Dictator Game. Behavioral results showed that CD boys did not make
   differential fairness decisions in response to the emotions, whereas the
   TD boys did show a differentiation and also responded more unfair to
   happy reactions than the CD boys. Neuroimaging results revealed that
   when receiving happy vs disappointed and angry reactions, the CD boys
   showed less activation than the TD boys in the temporoparietal junction
   and supramarginal gyrus, regions involved in perspective taking and

Abstract = {{Childhood and adolescence coincide with rapid maturation and synaptic
   reorganization of distributed neural networks that underlie complex
   cognitive-affective behaviors. These regions, referred to collectively
   as the `social brain network' (SBN) are commonly vulnerable to
   disruption from pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, the
   mechanisms that link morphological changes in the SBN to behavior
   problems in this population remain unclear. In 98 children and
   adolescents with mild to severe TBI, we acquired 3D T1-weighted MRIs at
   2-8 weeks post-injury. For comparison, 33 typically developing controls
   of similar age, sex and education were scanned. All participants were
   assessed on measures of Theory of Mind (ToM) at 6 months post-injury and
   parents provided ratings of behavior problems at 24-months post-injury.
   Severe TBI was associated with volumetric reductions in the overall SBN
   package, as well as regional gray matter structural change in multiple
   component regions of the SBN. When compared with TD controls and
   children with milder injuries, the severe TBI group had significantly
   poorer ToM, which was associated with more frequent behavior problems
   and abnormal SBN morphology. Mediation analysis indicated that impaired
   theory of mind mediated the prospective relationship between abnormal
   SBN morphology and more frequent chronic behavior problems. Our findings
   suggest that sub-acute alterations in SBN morphology indirectly
   contribute to long-term behavior problems via their influence on ToM.
   Volumetric change in the SBN and its putative hub regions may represent
   useful imaging biomarkers for prediction of post-acute social cognitive
   impairment, which may in turn elevate risk for chronic behavior
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneous activity levels prior to stimulus presentation can determine
   how that stimulus will be perceived. It has also been proposed that such
   spontaneous activity, particularly in the default-mode network (DMN), is
   involved in self-related processing. We therefore hypothesised that
   pre-stimulus activity levels in the DMN predict whether a stimulus is
   judged as self-related or not. Participants were presented in the MRI
   scanner with a white noise stimulus that they were instructed contained
   their name or another. They then had to respond with which name they
   thought they heard. Regions where there was an activity level difference
   between self and other response trials 2 s prior to the stimulus being
   presented were identified. Pre-stimulus activity levels were higher in
   the right temporoparietal junction, the right temporal pole and the left
   superior temporal gyrus in trials where the participant responded that
   they heard their own name than trials where they responded that they
   heard another. Pre-stimulus spontaneous activity levels in particular
   brain regions, largely overlapping with the DMN, predict the subsequent
   judgement of stimuli as self-related. This extends our current knowledge
   of self-related processing and its apparent relationship with intrinsic
   brain activity in what can be termed a rest-self overlap.}},

Abstract = {{Because the occurrence of primary reinforcers in natural environments is
   relatively rare, conditioned reinforcement plays an important role in
   many accounts of behavior, including pathological behaviors such as the
   abuse of alcohol or drugs. As a result of pairing with natural or drug
   reinforcers, initially neutral cues acquire the ability to serve as
   reinforcers for subsequent learning. Accepting a major role for
   conditioned reinforcement in everyday learning is complicated by the
   often-evanescent nature of this phenomenon in the laboratory, especially
   when primary reinforcers are entirely absent from the test situation.
   Here, I found that under certain conditions, the impact of conditioned
   reinforcement could be extended by lesions of the basolateral amygdala
   (BLA). Rats received first-order Pavlovian conditioning pairings of 1
   visual conditioned stimulus (CS) with food prior to receiving
   excitotoxic or sham lesions of the BLA, and first-order pairings of
   another visual CS with food after that surgery. Finally, each rat
   received second-order pairings of a different auditory cue with each
   visual first-order CS. As in prior studies, relative to sham-lesioned
   control rats, lesioned rats were impaired in their acquisition of
   second-order conditioning to the auditory cue paired with the
   first-order CS that was trained after surgery. However, lesioned rats
   showed enhanced and prolonged second-order conditioning to the auditory
   cue paired with the first-order CS that was trained before amygdala
   damage was made. Implications for an enhanced role for conditioned
   reinforcement by drug-related cues after drug-induced alterations in
   neural plasticity are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin (OT) has been implicated in a variety of mammalian reproductive
   and social behaviors, and the use of intranasal OT for clinical purposes
   is on the rise. However, basic actions of OT, including the rewarding or
   reinforcing properties of the drug, are currently not fully understood.
   In this study, the authors investigated whether intranasally
   administered OT has different reinforcing properties for social and
   nonsocial stimuli and whether such effects are variable between male and
   female subjects. Conditioned social preference (CSP) and conditioned
   place preference (CPP) paradigms were used to examine social and
   nonsocial reinforcing properties of OT. In CSP, the presence of a
   same-sex unfamiliar conspecific was repeatedly paired with intranasal
   OT, while a different conspecific was associated with saline. The
   reinforcing effect of OT was assessed in a postconditioning choice test
   under a drug-free condition. In CPP, the 2 conspecifics were replaced
   with nonsocial black and white compartments. The authors found that
   intranasal OT (12 mu g) in females supported the formation of CSP
   (Experiment 1) but not CPP (Experiment 3). Neither CSP (Experiment 2)
   nor CPP (Experiment 4) was formed in males. Extended conditioning with
   higher dose OT (36 mu g), however, abolished the initial CSP in females
   and produced an aversion to the OT-paired stimulus mouse. Experiment 5
   indicated that it was the repeated administrations rather than the
   higher dose that produced the abolition of the original preference.
   Overall, the current results demonstrate for the first time a sex-and
   stimulus-dependent reinforcing property of intranasal OT in mice.}},

Abstract = {{The context preexposure facilitation effect (CPFE) is a variant of
   contextual fear conditioning in which context learning, context-shock
   association, and expression of context conditioning occur in 3 separate
   phases-preexposure, training, and testing. During the preexposure phase,
   the CPFE is disrupted by hippocampal NMDA receptor blockade in juvenile
   rats (Schiffino et al., 2011), and a similar deficit is seen with a
   subcutaneous injection of the muscarinic receptor antagonist,
   scopolamine, in adult mice (Brown, Kennard, Sherer, Comalli, \&
   Woodruff-Pak, 2011). As a foundation for further developmental research,
   the present study examined the role of cholinergic function in the CPFE
   in adolescent rats during each phase of the CPFE protocol. In Experiment
   1, an i.p injection of either 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg dose of scopolamine
   administered prior to all 3 phases of the CPFE protocol impaired the
   CPFE. Experiment 2 further showed that a 0.5 mg/kg injection prior to
   just 1 of the 3 phases of the CPFE also disrupted contextual fear
   conditioning. We further showed that the CPFE is impaired by localized
   scopolamine infusions into dorsal hippocampus on the preexposure day
   (Experiment 3a), training day (Experiment 3b), and test day (Experiment
   3c). These findings demonstrate a role of cholinergic signaling in
   hippocampus during each of the 3 phases of the CPFE in adolescent rats.
   Implications for the development and neural basis of the CPFE are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory rodents can adopt the pain or fear of nearby conspecifics.
   This phenotype conceptually lies within the domain of empathy, a
   bio-psycho-social process through which individuals come to share each
   other's emotion. Using a model of cue-conditioned fear, we show here
   that the expression of vicarious fear varies with respect to whether
   mice are raised socially or in solitude during adolescence. The impact
   of the adolescent housing environment was selective: (a) vicarious fear
   was more influenced than directly acquired fear, (b) ``long-term{''}
   (24-h postconditioning) vicarious fear memories were stronger than
   ``short-term{''} (15-min postconditioning) memories in socially reared
   mice whereas the opposite was true for isolate mice, and (c) females
   were more fearful than males. Housing differences during adolescence did
   not alter the general mobility of mice or their vocal response to
   receiving the unconditioned stimulus. Previous work with this mouse
   model underscored a genetic influence on vicarious fear learning, and
   the present study complements these findings by elucidating an
   interaction between the adolescent social environment and vicarious
   experience. Collectively, these findings are relevant to developing
   models of empathy amenable to mechanistic exploitation in the

Abstract = {{Classical fear conditioning creates an association between an aversive
   stimulus and a neutral stimulus. Although the requisite neural circuitry
   is well understood in mature organisms, the development of these
   circuits is less well studied. The current experiments examine the
   ontogeny of fear conditioning and relate it to neuronal activation
   assessed through immediate early gene (IEG) expression in the amygdala,
   hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, and hypothalamus of periweanling rats.
   Rat pups were fear conditioned, or not, during the third or fourth weeks
   of life. Neuronal activation was assessed by quantifying expression of
   FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (FOS) using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in
   Experiment 1. Fos and early growth response gene-1 (EGR1) expression was
   assessed using qRT-PCR in Experiment 2. Behavioral data confirm that
   both auditory and contextual fear continue to emerge between PD 17 and
   24. The IEG expression data are highly consistent with these behavioral
   results. IHC results demonstrate significantly more FOS protein
   expression in the basal amygdala of fear-conditioned PD 23 subjects
   compared to control subjects, but no significant difference at PD 17.
   qRT-PCR results suggest specific activation of the amygdala only in
   older subjects during auditory fear expression. A similar effect of age
   and conditioning status was also observed in the perirhinal cortex
   during both contextual and auditory fear expression. Overall, the
   development of fear conditioning occurring between the third and fourth
   weeks of life appears to be at least partly attributable to changes in
   activation of the amygdala and perirhinal cortex during fear
   conditioning or expression.}},

Abstract = {{An appetitive Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) can predict an
   unconditioned stimulus (US) and acquire incentive salience. We tested
   the hypothesis that US intensity and motivational state of the subject
   would influence Pavlovian learning and impact the attribution of
   incentive salience to an appetitive Pavlovian CS. To this end, we
   examined the effects of sucrose concentration and water deprivation on
   the acquisition of Pavlovian conditioning and responding for a
   conditioned reinforcer. Male Long-Evans rats (Harlan; 220-240 g)
   receiving 3\% (3S) or 20\% (20S) sucrose were either non-water deprived
   or given water for 1 hr per day. During Pavlovian conditioning sessions,
   half the rats in each concentration and deprivation condition received a
   10-s CS paired with 0.2 ml of sucrose (16 trials/session; 3.2
   ml/session). The remainder received unpaired CS and US presentations.
   Entries into a port where sucrose was delivered were recorded. Next,
   responding for conditioned reinforcement was tested, wherein pressing an
   active lever produced the CS and pressing an inactive lever had no
   consequences. CS-elicited port entries increased, and latency to the
   first CS-elicited port entry decreased across sessions in paired groups.
   Water deprivation augmented these effects, whereas sucrose concentration
   had no significant impact on behavior. Responding for conditioned
   reinforcement was observed in the 20S water-deprived, paired group.
   Thus, water deprivation can facilitate the acquisition of Pavlovian
   conditioning, potentially by enhancing motivational state, and a
   high-intensity US and a high motivational state can interact to heighten
   the attribution of incentive salience to an appetitive Pavlovian CS.}},

Abstract = {{Administration of (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) causes
   memory errors by increasing proactive interference. This might occur
   because MDMA alters sensitivity to reinforcement. The current 2
   experiments investigated this directly by assessing the acute
   (Experiment 1) and chronic (Experiment 2) effects of MDMA on sensitivity
   to reinforcement. We presented 5 pairs of concurrent variable interval
   schedules within each session and calculated sensitivity to
   reinforcement for 3 acute doses of MDMA. In contrast to the related
   drug, d-amphetamine, and in spite of producing reductions in response
   rate, MDMA did not reduce sensitivity to reinforcement rate. Chronic
   administration of a fixed dose of MDMA following each session reduced
   response rate but did not affect sensitivity to reinforcement rate. In
   combination with previous research, these results indicate that related
   drugs may have different effects on sensitivity to reinforcement and
   that these effects should be considered when interpreting disruptions to
   operant task performance caused by drug administration.}},

Abstract = {{Motor imagery (MI), the mental rehearsal of movement, is an effective
   means for acquiring a novel skill, even in the absence of physical
   practice (PP). The nature of this learning, be it perceptual, motor, or
   both, is not well understood. Understanding the mechanisms underlying
   MI-based skill acquisition has implications for its use in numerous
   disciplines, including informing best practices regarding its use. Here
   we used an implicit sequence learning (ISL) task to probe whether
   MI-based skill acquisition can be attributed to perceptual or motor
   learning. Participants (n = 60) randomized to 4 groups were trained
   through MI or PP, and were then tested in either perceptual (altering
   the sensory cue) or motor (switching the hand) transfer conditions.
   Control participants (n = 42) that did not perform a transfer condition
   were utilized from previous work. Learning was quantified through effect
   sizes for reaction time (RT) differences between implicit and random
   sequences. Generally, PP-based training led to lower RTs compared with
   MI-based training for implicit and random sequences. All groups
   demonstrated learning (p < .05), the magnitude of which was reduced by
   transfer conditions relative to controls. For MI-based training
   perceptual transfer disrupted performance more than for PP. Motor
   transfer disrupted performance equally for MI-and PP-based training. Our
   results suggest that MI-based training relies on both perceptual and
   motor learning, while PP-based training relies more on motor processes.
   These results reveal details regarding the mechanisms underlying MI, and
   inform its use as a modality for skill acquisition.}},

Abstract = {{Anticipatory nausea (AN) is a conditioned nausea reaction experienced by
   chemotherapy patients upon returning to the clinic. Currently, there are
   no specific treatments for this phenomenon, with the classic antiemetic
   treatments (e.g., ondansetron) providing no relief. The rat model of AN,
   contextually elicited conditioned gaping reactions in rats, provides a
   tool for assessing potential treatments for this difficult to treat
   disorder. Systemically administered drugs which elevate the
   endocannabinoids, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG),
   by interfering with their respective degrading enzymes, fatty acid amide
   hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacyl glycerol lipase (MAGL) interfere with AN
   in the rat model. We have shown that MAGL inhibition within the visceral
   insular cortex (VIC) interferes with acute nausea in the gaping model
   (Sticht et al., 2015). Here we report that bilateral infusion of the
   MAGL inhibitor, MJN110 (but neither the FAAH inhibitor, PF3845, nor
   ondansetron) into the VIC suppressed contextually elicited conditioned
   gaping, and this effect was reversed by coadministration of the CB1
   antagonist, AM251. These findings suggest that 2-AG within the VIC plays
   a critical role in the regulation of both acute nausea and AN. Because
   there are currently no specific therapeutics for chemotherapy patients
   that develop anticipatory nausea, MAGL inhibition by MJN110 may be a
   candidate treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Helping behavior is motivated by empathic concern for others in
   distress. Although empathic concern is pervasive in daily life, its
   neural mechanisms remain unclear. Empathic concern involves the
   suppression of the emotional response to others' distress, which occurs
   when individuals distance themselves emotionally from the distressed
   individual. We hypothesized that helping behavior induced by empathic
   concern, accompanied by perspective-taking, would attenuate the neural
   activation representing aversive feelings. We also predicted reward
   system activation due to the positive feeling resulting from helping
   behavior. Participant underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging
   while playing a virtual ball-toss game. In some blocks ({''}concern
   condition{''}), one player ({''}isolated player{''}) did not receive
   ball-tosses from other players. In this condition, participants
   increased ball-tosses to the isolated player (helping behavior).
   Participants then evaluated the improved enjoyment of the isolated
   player resulting from their helping behavior. Anterior cingulate
   activation during the concern condition was attenuated by the evaluation
   of the effect of helping behavior. The right temporoparietal junction,
   which is involved in perspective-taking and the dorsal striatum, part of
   the reward system, were also activated during the concern condition.
   These results suggest that humans can attenuate affective arousal by
   anticipating the positive outcome of empathic concern through
   perspective-taking.}},

Abstract = {{Across-brain neurodynamic organizations arise when teams perform
   coordinated tasks. We describe a symbolic electroencephalographic (EEG)
   approach that identifies when team neurodynamic organizations occur and
   demonstrate its utility with scientific problem solving and submarine
   navigation tasks. Each second, neurodynamic symbols (NS) were created
   showing the 1-40Hz EEG power spectral densities for each team member.
   These data streams contained a performance history of the team's
   across-brain neurodynamic organizations. The degree of neurodynamic
   organization was calculated each second from a moving window average of
   the Shannon entropy over the task. Decreased NS entropy (i.e., greater
   neurodynamic organization) was prominent in the \~{}16Hz EEG bins during
   problem solving, while during submarine navigation, the maximum NS
   entropy decreases were \~{}10Hz and were associated with establishing
   the ship's location. Decreased NS entropy also occurred in the 20-40Hz
   bins of both teams and was associated with uncertainty or stress. The

Abstract = {{Despite extensive research on the neural basis of empathic responses for
   pain and disgust, there is limited data about the brain regions that
   underpin affective response to other people's emotional facial
   expressions. Here, we addressed this question using event-related
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess neural responses to
   emotional faces, combined with online ratings of subjective state. When
   instructed to rate their own affective response to others' faces,
   participants recruited anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate,
   inferior frontal gyrus, and amygdala, regions consistently implicated in
   studies investigating empathy for disgust and pain, as well as emotional
   saliency. Importantly, responses in anterior insula and amygdala were
   modulated by trial-by-trial variations in subjective affective responses
   to the emotional facial stimuli. Furthermore, overall task-elicited
   activations in these regions were negatively associated with
   psychopathic personality traits, which are characterized by low
   affective empathy. Our findings suggest that anterior insula and
   amygdala play important roles in the generation of affective internal
   states in response to others' emotional cues and that attenuated
   function in these regions may underlie reduced empathy in individuals
   with high levels of psychopathic traits.}},

Abstract = {{Self-esteem affects human life. A thorough examination of the cognitive
   processes and neural activations of implicit self-evaluation should aid
   our understanding of self-esteem. The current study examined
   electrophysiological correlates of implicit self-evaluation among 19
   healthy participants using event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded
   during an Implicit Association Test (IAT). Behavioral results showed
   that participants responded faster in the compatible condition (compared
   to the incompatible condition) in which ``self{''} was paired with
   ``positive{''} traits and ``others{''} was paired with ``negative{''}
   traits, reflecting positive nature of implicit self-evaluation. ERP
   results showed that the incompatible condition elicited a larger N200
   and a smaller P3 compared to the compatible condition. These findings
   indicated that both executive control and stimulus categorization were
   involved in implicit self-evaluation, reflected by N200 and P3,
   respectively. We accordingly suggested that implicit self-evaluation
   manifests in multiple cognitive processes.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{In recent years there has been a growing interest in the use of social
   network analysis in biobehavioral research. Despite the well-established
   importance of social relationships in influencing human behavior and
   health, little is known about how children's perception of their
   immediate social relationships correlates with biological parameters of
   stress. In this study we explore the association between two measures of
   children's personal social networks, perceived network size and
   perceived network density, with two biomarkers of stress, cortisol and
   salivary alpha-amylase. Forty children (mean age=8.30, min age=5, and
   max age=12) were interviewed to collect information about their
   friendships and three samples of saliva were collected. Our results show
   that children characterized by a lower pre-interview cortisol
   concentration and a lower salivary alpha-amylase reactivity to the
   interview reported the highest density of friendships. We discuss this
   result in light of the multisystem approach to the study of children's
   behavioral outcomes, emphasizing that future work of this kind is needed
   in order to understand the cognitive and biological mechanisms
   underlying children's and adolescents' social perceptual biases.}},

Abstract = {{Impairments in the mirror neuron system (MNS) have been implicated as a
   possible underlying neurological basis for deficits in higher-level
   social cognition in schizophrenia. Previous work testing this hypothesis
   has used the electroencephalographic mu rhythm as an index of MNS
   activity, with studies showing mixed results. Here we investigated the
   role that reward plays in modulating the mu rhythm, and its association
   with empathy and emotional mental state reasoning. A group of
   schizophrenia patients and a healthy control group completed an action
   observation paradigm in which they watched actions that were financially
   rewarding, punishing, or neutral. Patients showed intact reward-related
   modulation of the mu rhythm, and greater mu suppression was associated
   with greater negative symptoms. There was also a trend for reduced mu
   suppression in patients. Furthermore, both empathy and emotional mental
   state reasoning were associated with the degree of mu suppression, but
   only in healthy controls. These findings confirm the association between
   the mu suppression and high-level social cognition. It is possible that
   schizophrenia patients utilize different cognitive routes to infer
   mental states. The demonstration that reward influences the degree of mu
   suppression in schizophrenia patients may help to account for previous
   conflicting findings in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition characterized by a
   hypersocial personality and desire to form close relationships,
   juxtaposed with significant anxieties of nonsocial events. The neural
   underpinnings of anxiety in individuals with WS are currently unknown.
   Aberrations in the anatomical and microstructural integrity of the
   uncinate fasciculus (UF) have been recently implicated in social and
   generalized anxiety disorders. Based on these findings, we tested the
   hypothesis that the reported anxieties in individuals with WS share
   similar neuropathological correlates. Toward this end, diffusion tensor
   imaging (DTI) methods were employed to examine the microstructural
   integrity (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, longitudinal
   diffusivity) of the UF in 18 WS and 15 typically developing adults (TD).
   Anxiety and sociability questionnaires were administered to determine
   associations with DTI indices of UF across groups. Results revealed
   comparable white matter integrity of the UF across groups, yet elevated
   subjective experience of anxiety in those with WS. Additionally,
   sociability and UF microstructural properties were dissociated across
   both groups. Whereas no relationships were found between DTI indices and
   anxiety in TD participants, strong negative associations were observed
   between these constructs in individuals with WS. Findings indicated that
   increased anxiety manifested by individuals with WS was associated with
   DTI measures of the UF and may signal structural or possibly
   physiological aberration involving this tract within the
   prefrontal-temporal network.}},

Abstract = {{People react aversely when faced with unfair situations, a phenomenon
   that has been related to an electroencephalographic (EEG) potential
   known as medial frontal negativity (MFN). To our knowledge, the
   existence of the MFN in children has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we
   recorded EEG activity from 15 children playing the ultimatum game (UG)
   and who afterward performed a recognition task, in order to assess
   whether they could recognize the unfair and fair (familiar) proposers
   among unfamiliar faces. During the recognition task, we also acquired
   pupil dilation data to investigate subconscious recognition processes. A
   typical (adult-like) MFN component was detected in reaction to unfair
   proposals. We found a positive correlation between reaction time and
   empathy, as well as a negative correlation between reaction time and
   systematic reasoning scores. Finally, we detected a significant
   difference in pupil dilation in response to unfamiliar faces versus UG
   proposers. Our data provide the first evidence of MFN in children, which
   appears to index similar neurophysiological phenomena as in adults.
   Also, reaction time to fair proposals seems to be related to individual
   traits, as represented by empathy and systematizing. Our pupil dilation
   data provide evidence that automatic responses to faces did not index
   fairness, but familiarity. These findings have implications for our
   understanding of social development in typically developing children.}},

Abstract = {{The processing of infant faces may be somewhat distinct from that of
   adult faces. Indeed, recent neuroimaging studies have provided evidence
   of an early, ``baby-specific{''} neural response whereby infant faces
   are perceived more rapidly than adult faces. Using event-related
   potentials, the present study aimed to determine whether the
   preferential response to infant faces is present at both early and late
   stages of face processing, and to investigate the effects of esthetic
   appearance on the processing of adult and infant faces by directly
   manipulating the perceived attractiveness or cuteness within a given
   face identity. Here, we find evidence for enhanced processing of infant
   faces, relative to adult faces, at both early (N170, P2) and late (LPC)
   stages of face processing. We also find that the esthetic appearance of
   both infant and adult faces modulates early neural responses, with
   enhanced responses to less attractive/cute faces as compared to more
   attractive/cute faces. Overall, our results provide additional evidence
   for a preferential response to infant faces at early stages of
   processing, and provide new evidence that this preferential response
   occurs at later stages of face processing as well, independent of the
   esthetic quality of the face or observer sex.}},

Abstract = {{Research on error observation has focused predominantly on situations in
   which individuals are passive observers of errors. In daily life,
   however, we are often jointly responsible for the mistakes of others. In
   the current study, we examined how information on agency is integrated
   in the error observation network. It was found that activation in the
   anterior insula but not in the posterior medial frontal cortex or
   lateral prefrontal cortex differentiates between observed errors for
   which we are partly responsible or not. Interestingly, the activation
   pattern of the AI was mirrored by feelings of guilt and shame. These
   results suggest that the anterior insula is crucially involved in
   evaluating the consequences of our actions for other persons.
   Consequently, this region may be thought of as critical in guiding
   social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Self-esteem is an affective, self-evaluation of oneself and has a
   significant effect on mental and behavioral health. Although research
   has focused on the neural substrates of self-esteem, little is known
   about the spontaneous brain activity that is associated with trait
   self-esteem (TSE) during the resting state. In this study, we used the
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal of the
   amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and resting state
   functional connectivity (RSFC) to identify TSE-related regions and
   networks. We found that a higher level of TSE was associated with higher
   ALFFs in the left ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and lower
   ALFFs in the left cuneus/lingual gyrus and right lingual gyrus. RSFC
   analyses revealed that the strengths of functional connectivity between
   the left vmPFC and bilateral hippocampus were positively correlated with
   TSE; however, the connections between the left vmPFC and right inferior
   frontal gyrus and posterior superior temporal sulcus were negatively
   associated with TSE. Furthermore, the strengths of functional
   connectivity between the left cuneus/lingual gyrus and right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex were
   positively related to TSE. These findings indicate that TSE is linked to
   core regions in the default mode network and social cognition network,
   which is involved in self-referential processing, autobiographical
   memory and social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Young people frequently socialize together in contexts that encourage
   risky decision making, pointing to a need for research into how
   susceptibility to peer influence is related to individual differences in
   the neural processing of decisions during sequentially escalating risk.
   We applied a novel analytic approach to analyze EEG activity from
   college-going students while they completed the Balloon Analogue Risk
   Task (BART), a well-established risk-taking propensity assessment. By
   modeling outcome-processing-related changes in the P200 and
   feedback-related negativity (FRN) sequentially within each BART trial as
   a function of pump order as an index of increasing risk, our results
   suggest that analyzing the BART in a progressive fashion may provide
   valuable new insights into the temporal neurophysiological dynamics of
   risk taking. Our results showed that a P200, localized to the left
   caudate nucleus, and an FRN, localized to the left dACC, were positively
   correlated with the level of risk taking and reward. Furthermore,
   consistent with our hypotheses, the rate of change in the FRN was higher
   among college students with greater self-reported resistance to peer
   influence.}},

Abstract = {{People cleave to ideological convictions with greater intensity in the
   aftermath of threat. The posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) plays a
   key role in both detecting discrepancies between desired and current
   conditions and adjusting subsequent behavior to resolve such conflicts.
   Building on prior literature examining the role of the pMFC in shifts in
   relatively low-level decision processes, we demonstrate that the pMFC
   mediates adjustments in adherence to political and religious ideologies.
   We presented participants with a reminder of death and a critique of
   their in-group ostensibly written by a member of an out-group, then
   experimentally decreased both avowed belief in God and out-group
   derogation by downregulating pMFC activity via transcranial magnetic
   stimulation. The results provide the first evidence that group prejudice
   and religious belief are susceptible to targeted neuromodulation, and
   point to a shared cognitive mechanism underlying concrete and abstract
   decision processes. We discuss the implications of these findings for
   further research characterizing the cognitive and affective mechanisms
   at play.}},

Abstract = {{Differential processing of threat can consummate as early as 100 ms
   post-stimulus. Moreover, early perception not only differentiates threat
   from non-threat stimuli but also distinguishes among discrete threat
   subtypes (e.g. fear, disgust and anger). Combining
   spatial-frequency-filtered images of fear, disgust and neutral scenes
   with high-density event-related potentials and intracranial source
   estimation, we investigated the neural underpinnings of general and
   specific threat processing in early stages of perception. Conveyed in
   low spatial frequencies, fear and disgust images evoked convergent
   visual responses with similarly enhanced N1 potentials and dorsal visual
   (middle temporal gyrus) cortical activity (relative to neutral cues;
   peaking at 156 ms). Nevertheless, conveyed in high spatial frequencies,
   fear and disgust elicited divergent visual responses, with fear
   enhancing and disgust suppressing P1 potentials and ventral visual
   (occipital fusiform) cortical activity (peaking at 121 ms). Therefore,
   general and specific threat processing operates in parallel in early
   perception, with the ventral visual pathway engaged in specific
   processing of discrete threats and the dorsal visual pathway in general
   threat processing. Furthermore, selectively tuned to distinctive
   spatial-frequency channels and visual pathways, these parallel processes
   underpin dimensional and categorical threat characterization, promoting
   efficient threat response. These findings thus lend support to hybrid
   models of emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Early life stress (ELS) is strongly associated with negative outcomes in
   adulthood, including reduced motivation and increased negative mood. The
   mechanisms mediating these relations, however, are poorly understood. We
   examined the relation between exposure to ELS and reward-related brain
   activity, which is known to predict motivation and mood, at age 26, in a
   sample followed since kindergarten with annual assessments. Using
   functional neuroimaging, we assayed individual differences in the
   activity of the ventral striatum (VS) during the processing of monetary
   rewards associated with a simple card-guessing task, in a sample of 72
   male participants. We examined associations between a cumulative measure
   of ELS exposure and VS activity in adulthood. We found that greater
   levels of cumulative stress during childhood and adolescence predicted
   lower reward-related VS activity in adulthood. Extending this general
   developmental pattern, we found that exposure to stress early in
   development (between kindergarten and grade 3) was significantly
   associated with variability in adult VS activity. Our results provide an
   important demonstration that cumulative life stress, especially during
   this childhood period, is associated with blunted reward-related VS
   activity in adulthood. These differences suggest neurobiological
   pathways through which a history of ELS may contribute to reduced
   motivation and increased negative mood.}},

Abstract = {{Humans' closest living relatives are bonobos (Pan paniscus) and
   chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), yet these great ape species differ
   considerably from each other in terms of social behavior. Bonobos are
   more tolerant of conspecifics in competitive contexts and often use
   sexual behavior to mediate social interactions. Chimpanzees more
   frequently employ aggression during conflicts and actively patrol
   territories between communities. Regulation of emotional responses is
   facilitated by the amygdala, which also modulates social
   decision-making, memory and attention. Amygdala responsiveness is
   further regulated by the neurotransmitter serotonin. We hypothesized
   that the amygdala of bonobos and chimpanzees would differ in its
   neuroanatomical organization and serotonergic innervation. We measured
   volumes of regions and the length density of serotonin
   transporter-containing axons in the whole amygdala and its lateral,
   basal, accessory basal and central nuclei. Results showed that accessory
   basal nucleus volume was larger in chimpanzees than in bonobos. Of
   particular note, the amygdala of bonobos had more than twice the density
   of serotonergic axons than chimpanzees, with the most pronounced
   differences in the basal and central nuclei. These findings suggest that
   variation in serotonergic innervation of the amygdala may contribute to
   mediating the remarkable differences in social behavior exhibited by
   bonobos and chimpanzees.}},

   in the supplementary motor area, right inferior frontal gyrus, superior
   temporal sulcus and left anterior insula. Moreover, the significant
   interaction effect was found in the left amygdala, which showed that the
   monetary outcomes modulated the neural activity in the left amygdala
   only when truth-telling rather than lying. Our study identified a neural

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by reduced attention to
   salient social stimuli. Here, we use two visual oddball tasks to
   investigate brain systems engaged during attention to social (face) and
   non-social (scene) stimuli. We focused on the dorsal and ventral
   subdivisions of the anterior insula (dAI and vAI, respectively),
   anatomically distinct regions contributing to a `salience network' that
   is known to regulate attention to behaviorally meaningful stimuli.
   Children with ASD performed comparably to their typically developing
   (TD) peers, but they engaged the right dAI and vAI differently in
   response to deviant faces compared with deviant scenes. Multivariate
   activation patterns in the dAI reliably discriminated between children
   with ASD and TD children with 85\% classification accuracy, and children
   with ASD activated the vAI more than their TD peers. Children with ASD
   and their TD peers also differed in dAI connectivity patterns to deviant
   faces, with stronger within-salience network interactions in the ASD
   group and stronger cross-network interactions in the TD group. Our
   findings point to atypical patterns of right anterior insula activation
   and connectivity in ASD and suggest that multiple functions subserved by
   the insula, including attention and affective processing of salient
   social stimuli, are aberrant in children with the disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Social approval is a reward that uses abstract social reinforcers to
   guide interpersonal interactions. Few studies have specifically explored
   social reward processing and its related neural substrates in
   schizophrenia. Fifteen patients with schizophrenia and fifteen healthy
   controls participated in a two-part study to explore the functional
   neural correlates of social approval. In the first session, participants
   were led to believe their personality would be assessed based on their
   results from various questionnaires and an interview. Participants were
   then presented with the results of their supposed evaluation in the
   scanner, while engaging in a relevant fMRI social approval task.
   Subjects provided subjective reports of pleasure associated with
   receiving self-directed positive or negative feedback. Higher activation
   of the right parietal lobe was found in controls compared with
   individuals with schizophrenia. Both groups rated traits from the high
   social reward condition as more pleasurable than the low social reward
   condition, while intergroup differences emerged in the low social reward
   condition. Positive correlations were found in patients only between
   subjective ratings of positive feedback and right insula activation, and
   a relevant behavioural measure. Evidence suggests potential neural
   substrates underlying the cognitive representation of social reputation
   in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Defects in experiencing disgust may contribute to obesity by allowing
   for the overconsumption of food. However, the relationship of disgust
   proneness and its associated neural locus has yet to be explored in the
   context of obesity. Thirty-three participants (17 obese, 16 lean)
   completed the Disgust Propensity and Sensitivity Scale-Revised and a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm where images from 4
   categories (food, contaminates, contaminated food or fixation) were
   randomly presented. Independent two-sample t-tests revealed
   significantly lower levels of Disgust Sensitivity for the obese group
   (mean score = 14.7) compared with the lean group (mean score = 17.6, P =
   0.026). The obese group had less activation in the right insula than the
   lean group when viewing contaminated food images. Multiple regression
   with interaction analysis revealed one left insula region where the
   association of Disgust Sensitivity scores with activation differed by
   group when viewing contaminated food images. These interaction effects
   were driven by the negative correlation of Disgust Sensitivity scores
   with beta values extracted from the left insula in the obese group (r =
   -0.59) compared with a positive correlation in the lean group (r =
   0.65). Given these body mass index-dependent differences in Disgust
   Sensitivity and neural responsiveness to disgusting food images, it is
   likely that altered Disgust Sensitivity may contribute to obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Social closeness is a potent moderator of vicarious affect and
   specifically vicarious embarrassment. The neural pathways of how social
   closeness to another person affects our experience of vicarious
   embarrassment for the other's public flaws, failures and norm violations
   are yet unknown. To bridge this gap, we examined the neural response of
   participants while witnessing threats to either a friend's or a
   stranger's social integrity. The results show consistent responses of
   the anterior insula (AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), shared
   circuits of the aversive quality of affect, as well as the medial
   prefrontal cortex and temporal pole, central structures of the
   mentalizing network. However, the ACC/AI network activation was
   increased during vicarious embarrassment in response to a friend's
   failures. At the same time, the precuneus, a brain region associated
   with self-related thoughts, showed a specific activation and an increase
   in functional connectivity with the shared circuits in the frontal lobe
   while observing friends. This might indicate a neural systems mechanism
   for greater affective sharing and self-involvement while people interact
   with close others that are relevant to oneself.}},

Abstract = {{Recent behavioral evidence indicates a key role for intent in moral
   judgments of harmful acts (e.g. assault) but not impure acts (e.g.
   incest). We tested whether the neural responses in regions for mental
   state reasoning, including the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ),
   are greater when people evaluate harmful vs impure violations. In
   addition, using multivoxel pattern analysis, we investigated whether the
   voxel-wise pattern in these regions distinguishes intentional from
   accidental actions, for either kind of violation. The RTPJ was
   preferentially recruited in response to harmful vs impure acts.
   Moreover, although its response was equally high for intentional and
   accidental acts, the voxel-wise pattern in the RTPJ distinguished
   intentional from accidental acts in the harm domain but not the purity
   domain. Finally, we found that the degree to which the RTPJ
   discriminated between intentional and accidental acts predicted the
   impact of intent information on moral judgments but again only in the
   harm domain. These findings reveal intent to be a uniquely critical
   factor for moral evaluations of harmful vs impure acts and shed light on
   the neural computations for mental state reasoning.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence indicates that empathic responses to others' pain are
   modulated by various situational and individual factors. However, few
   studies have examined how empathy and underlying brain functions are
   modulated by social hierarchies, which permeate human society with an
   enormous impact on social behavior and cognition. In this study, social
   hierarchies were established based on incidental skill in a perceptual
   task in which all participants were mediumly ranked. Afterwards,
   participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging
   while watching inferior-status or superior-status targets receiving
   painful or non-painful stimulation. The results revealed that painful
   stimulation applied to inferior-status targets induced higher
   activations in the anterior insula (AI) and anterior medial cingulate
   cortex (aMCC), whereas these empathic brain activations were
   significantly attenuated in response to superior-status targets' pain.
   Further, this neural empathic bias to inferior-status targets was
   accompanied by stronger functional couplings of AI with brain regions
   important in emotional processing (i.e. thalamus) and cognitive control
   (i.e. middle frontal gyrus). Our findings indicate that emotional
   sharing with others' pain is shaped by relative positions in a social
   hierarchy such that underlying empathic neural responses are biased
   toward inferior-status compared with superior-status individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, experimentally induced flow experiences have been
   demonstrated with perfusion imaging during activation blocks of 3 min
   length to accommodate with the putatively slowly evolving ``mood{''}
   characteristics of flow. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) in a sample of 23 healthy, male participants to
   investigate flow in the context of a typical fMRI block design with
   block lengths as short as 30 s. To induce flow, demands of arithmetic
   tasks were automatically and continuously adjusted to the individual
   skill level. Compared against conditions of boredom and overload,
   experience of flow was evident from individuals' reported subjective
   experiences and changes in electrodermal activity. Neural activation was
   relatively increased during flow, particularly in the anterior insula,
   inferior frontal gyri, basal ganglia and midbrain. Relative activation
   decreases during flow were observed in medial prefrontal and posterior
   cingulate cortex, and in the medial temporal lobe including the
   amygdala. Present findings suggest that even in the context of
   comparably short activation blocks flow can be reliably experienced and
   is associated with changes in neural activation of brain regions
   previously described. Possible mechanisms of interacting brain regions
   are outlined, awaiting further investigation which should now be
   possible given the greater temporal resolution compared with previous
   perfusion imaging.}},

Abstract = {{The vicarious reward we receive from watching likable others obtaining a
   positive outcome is a pervasive phenomenon, yet its neural correlates
   are poorly understood. Here, we conducted a series of functional
   magnetic resonance imaging experiments to test the hypothesis that the
   brain areas responsible for action observation and reward processing
   work in a coordinated fashion during vicarious reward. In the first
   experiment (manipulation phase), the participant was instructed to cheer
   for a particular player in a two-player competitive game
   (Rock-Paper-Scissors). This manipulation made participants feel more
   unity with that player and resulted in unity-related activation in the
   premotor area during action observation. In the following main
   experiment, the participant witnessed the previously cheered-for or
   non-cheered-for player succeed in a new solitary game (a stopwatch
   game). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was activated when the
   cheered-for player succeeded in the game but not when the other player
   did. Interestingly, this vmPFC activation was functionally connected
   with premotor activation only during the cheered-for player's success.
   These results suggest that vicarious reward is processed in the
   vmPFC-premotor network, which is activated specifically by the success
   of the other person with whom the individual feels unity and closeness.}},

Abstract = {{Happiness refers to people's cognitive and affective evaluation of their
   life. Why are some people happier than others? One reason might be that
   unhappy people are prone to ruminate more than happy people. The default
   mode network (DMN) is normally active during rest and is implicated in
   rumination. We hypothesized that unhappiness may be associated with
   increased default-mode functional connectivity during rest, including
   the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
   and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). The hyperconnectivity of these areas
   may be associated with higher levels of rumination. One hundred
   forty-eight healthy participants underwent a resting-state fMRI scan. A
   group-independent component analysis identified the DMNs. Results
   indicated increased functional connectivity in the DMN was associated
   with lower levels of happiness. Specifically, relative to happy people,
   unhappy people exhibited greater functional connectivity in the anterior
   medial cortex (bilateral MPFC), posterior medial cortex regions
   (bilateral PCC) and posterior parietal cortex (left IPL). Moreover, the
   increased functional connectivity of the MPFC, PCC and IPL, correlated
   positively with the inclination to ruminate. These results highlight the
   important role of the DMN in the neural correlates of happiness, and
   suggest that rumination may play an important role in people's perceived
   happiness.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of reward expectation on the processing of
   emotional words in two experiments using event-related potentials
   (ERPs). A cue indicating the reward condition of each trial (incentive
   vs non-incentive) was followed by the presentation of a negative or
   neutral word, the target. Participants were asked to discrim inate the
   emotional content of the target word in Experiment 1 and to discriminate
   the color of the target word in Experiment 2, rendering the emotionality
   of the target word task-relevant in Experiment 1, but task-irrelevant in
   Experiment 2. The negative bias effect, in terms of the amplitude
   difference between ERPs for negative and neutral targets, was modulated
   by the task-set. In Experiment 1, P3(1) and early posterior negativity
   revealed a larger negative bias effect in the incentive condition than
   that in the non-incentive condition. However, in Experiment 2, P3(1)
   revealed a diminished negative bias effect in the incentive condition
   compared with that in the non-incentive condition. These results
   indicate that reward expectation improves top-down attentional
   concentration to task-relevant information, with enhanced sensitivity to
   the emotional content of target words when emotionality is
   task-relevant, but with reduced differential brain responses to
   emotional words when their content is task-irrelevant.}},

Abstract = {{Mass media can powerfully affect health decision-making. Pre-testing
   through focus groups or surveys is a standard, though inconsistent,
   predictor of effectiveness. Converging evidence demonstrates that
   activity within brain systems associated with self-related processing
   can predict individual behavior in response to health messages.
   Preliminary evidence also suggests that neural activity in small groups
   can forecast population-level campaign outcomes. Less is known about the
   psychological processes that link neural activity and population-level
   outcomes, or how these predictions are affected by message content. We
   exposed 50 smokers to antismoking messages and used their aggregated
   neural activity within a `self-localizer' defined region of medial
   prefrontal cortex to predict the success of the same campaign messages
   at the population level (n = 400 000 emails). Results demonstrate that:
   (i) independently localized neural activity during health message
   exposure complements existing self-report data in predicting
   population-level campaign responses (model combined R-2 up to 0.65) and
   (ii) this relationship depends on message content-self-related neural
   processing predicts outcomes in response to strong negative arguments
   against smoking and not in response to compositionally similar neutral
   images. These data advance understanding of the psychological link
   between brain and large-scale behavior and may aid the construction of
   more effective media health campaigns.}},

Abstract = {{Research in psychology has suggested that reading fiction can improve
   individuals' social-cognitive abilities. Findings from neuroscience show
   that reading and social cognition both recruit the default network, a
   network which is known to support our capacity to simulate hypothetical
   scenes, spaces and mental states. The current research tests the
   hypothesis that fiction reading enhances social cognition because it
   serves to exercise the default subnetwork involved in theory of mind.
   While undergoing functional neuroimaging, participants read literary
   passages that differed along two dimensions: (i) vivid vs abstract and
   (ii) social vs non-social. Analyses revealed distinct subnetworks of the
   default network respond to the two dimensions of interest: the medial
   temporal lobe subnetwork responded preferentially to vivid passages,
   with or without social content; the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   (dmPFC) subnetwork responded preferentially to passages with social and
   abstract content. Analyses also demonstrated that participants who read
   fiction most often also showed the strongest social cognition
   performance. Finally, mediation analysis showed that activity in the
   dmPFC subnetwork in response to the social content mediated this
   relation, suggesting that the simulation of social content in fiction
   plays a role in fiction's ability to enhance readers' social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Recruitment of `top-down' frontal attentional mechanisms is held to
   support detection of changes in task-relevant stimuli. Fluctuations in
   intrinsic frontal activity have been shown to impact task performance
   more generally. Meanwhile, the amygdala has been implicated in
   `bottom-up' attentional capture by threat. Here, 22 adult human
   participants took part in a functional magnetic resonance change
   detection study aimed at investigating the correlates of successful (vs
   failed) detection of changes in facial identity vs expression. For
   identity changes, we expected prefrontal recruitment to differentiate
   `hit' from `miss' trials, in line with previous reports. Meanwhile, we
   postulated that a different mechanism would support detection of
   emotionally salient changes. Specifically, elevated amygdala activation
   was predicted to be associated with successful detection of
   threat-related changes in expression, over-riding the influence of
   fluctuations in top-down attention. Our findings revealed that fusiform
   activity tracked change detection across conditions. Ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortical activity was uniquely linked to detection of changes
   in identity not expression, and amygdala activity to detection of
   changes from neutral to fearful expressions. These results are
   consistent with distinct mechanisms supporting detection of changes in
   face identity vs expression, the former potentially reflecting top-down
   attention, the latter bottom-up attentional capture by stimulus
   emotional salience.}},

Abstract = {{Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is presumably the result of life
   threats and conditioned fear. However, the neurobiology of fear fails to
   explain the impact of traumas that do not entail threats. Neuronal
   function, assessed as glucose metabolism with 18fluoro-deoxyglucose
   positron emission tomography, was contrasted in active duty,
   treatment-seeking US Army Soldiers with PTSD endorsing either danger-(n
   = 19) or non-danger-based (n = 26) traumas, and was compared with
   soldiers without PTSD (Combat Controls, n = 26) and Civilian Controls (n
   = 24). Prior meta-analyses of regions associated with fear or trauma
   script imagery in PTSD were used to compare glucose metabolism across
   groups. Danger-based traumas were associated with higher metabolism in
   the right amygdala than the control groups, while non-danger-based
   traumas associated with heightened precuneus metabolism relative to the
   danger group. In the danger group, PTSD severity was associated with
   higher metabolismin precuneus and dorsal anterior cingulate and lower
   metabolismin left amygdala (R-2 = 0.61). In the non-danger group, PTSD
   symptom severity was associated with higher precuneus metabolismand
   lower right amygdala metabolism( R-2 = 0.64). These findings suggest a
   biological basis to consider subtyping PTSD according to the nature of
   the traumatic context.}},

Abstract = {{European Americans value excitement more and calm less than Chinese.
   Within cultures, European Americans value excited and calm states

   rating task with functional magnetic resonance imaging. During scanning,
   European American (n = 19) and Chinese (n = 19) females viewed and rated
   faces that varied by expression (excited, calm), ethnicity (White,
   Asian) and gender (male, female). As predicted, European Americans
   showed greater activity in circuits associated with affect and reward
   (bilateral ventral striatum, left caudate) while viewing excited vs calm
   expressions than did Chinese. Within cultures, European Americans
   responded to excited vs calm expressions similarly, whereas Chinese
   showed greater activity in these circuits in response to calm vs excited
   expressions regardless of targets' ethnicity or gender. Across cultural
   groups, greater ventral striatal activity while viewing excited vs. calm
   expressions predicted greater preference for excited vs calm expressions
   months later. These findings provide neural evidence that people find
   viewing the specific positive facial expressions valued by their

Abstract = {{The ability to survive within a cooperative society depends on impartial
   third-party punishment (TPP) of social norm violations. Two cognitive
   mechanisms have been postulated as necessary for the successful
   completion of TPP: evaluation of legal responsibility and selection of a
   suitable punishment given the magnitude of the crime. Converging
   neuroimaging research suggests two supporting domain-general networks; a
   mentalizing network for evaluation of legal responsibility and a
   central-executive network for determination of punishment. A whole-brain
   voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach was used in conjunction with
   a rank-order TPP task to identify brain regions necessary for TPP in a
   large sample of patients with penetrating traumatic brain injury.
   Patients who demonstrated atypical TPP had specific lesions in core
   regions of the mentalizing (dorsomedial prefrontal cortex {[}PFC],
   ventromedial PFC) and central-executive (bilateral dorsolateral PFC,
   right intraparietal sulcus) networks. Altruism and executive functioning
   (concept formation skills) were significant predictors of TPP: altruism
   was uniquely associated with TPP in patients with lesions in right
   dorsolateral PFC and executive functioning was uniquely associated with
   TPP in individuals with lesions in left PFC. Our findings contribute to
   the extant literature to support underlying neural networks associated
   with TPP, with specific brain-behavior causal relationships confirming
   recent functional neuroimaging research.}},

   subjects, who completed measures of trait optimism and anxiety, and
   underwent structural scanning using magnetic resonance imaging. First,
   the OFC gray matter volume (GMV) was associated with increased optimism,

   optimismmediated the relation between the left OFC volume and anxiety,

Abstract = {{Individuals exposed to childhood adversities (CA) present with emotion
   regulation (ER) difficulties in later life, which have been identified
   as risk and maintenance factors for psychopathologies. However, it is
   unclear if CA negatively impacts on ER capacity per se or whether
   observed regulation difficulties are a function of the challenging
   circumstances in which ER is being deployed. In this longitudinal study,
   we aimed to clarify this association by investigating the behavioral and
   neural effects of exposure to common moderate CA (mCA) on a laboratory
   measure of ER capacity in late adolescence/young adulthood. Our
   population-derived samples of adolescents/young adults (N = 53) were
   administered a film-based ER-task during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging that allowed evaluation of ER across mCA-exposure. mCA-exposure
   was associated with enhanced ER capacity over both positive and negative
   affect. At the neural level, the better ER of negative material in those
   exposed to mCA was associated with reduced recruitment of ER-related
   brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex and temporal gyrus. In
   addition mCA-exposure was associated with a greater down-regulation of
   the amygdala during ER of negative material. The implications of these
   findings for our understanding of the effects of mCA on the emergence of
   resilience in adolescence are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Self-control refers to the capacity to override or alter a predominant
   response tendency. The current experiment tested the hypothesis that
   exercising self-control temporarily increases approach motivation, as
   revealed by patterns of electrical activity in the prefrontal cortex.
   Participants completed a writing task that did vs did not require them
   to exercise selfcontrol. Then they viewed pictures known to evoke
   positive, negative or neutral affect. We assessed
   electroencephalo-graphic (EEG) activity while participants viewed the
   pictures, and participants reported their trait levels of behavioral
   inhibition system (BIS) and behavioral activation system (BAS)
   sensitivity at the end of the study. We found that exercising (vs not
   exercising) self-control increased relative left frontal cortical
   activity during picture viewing, particularly among individuals with
   relatively higher BAS than BIS, and particularly during positive picture
   viewing. A similar but weaker pattern emerged during negative picture
   viewing. The results suggest that exercising self-control temporarily
   increases approach motivation, which may help to explain the
   aftereffects of self-control (i.e. ego depletion).}},

Abstract = {{Alexithymia, a personality construct marked by difficulties in
   processing one's emotions, has been linked to the altered activity in
   the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Although longitudinal studies
   reported sex differences in alexithymia, what mediates them is not
   known. To investigate sex-specific associations of alexithymia and
   neuronal markers, we mapped metabolites in four brain regions involved
   differentially in emotion processing using a point-resolved spectroscopy
   MRS sequence in 3 Tesla. Both sexes showed negative correlations between
   alexithymia and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in pregenual ACC (pgACC). Women
   showed a robust negative correlation of the joint measure of glutamate
   and glutamine (Glx) to NAA in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), whereas
   men showed a weak positive association of Glx to NAA in dorsal ACC
   (dACC). Our results suggest that lowered neuronal integrity in pgACC, a
   region of the default mode network (DMN), might primarily account for
   the general difficulties in emotional processing in alexithymia.
   Association of alexithymia in women extends to another region in the
   DMN-PCC, while in men a region in the salience network (SN) was
   involved. These observations could be representative of sex specific
   regulation strategies that include diminished internal evaluation of
   feelings in women and cognitive emotion suppression in men.}},

Abstract = {{As evidenced by a multitude of studies, abnormalities in Theory of Mind
   (ToM) and its neural processing might constitute an intermediate
   phenotype of schizophrenia. If so, neural alterations during ToM should
   be observable in unaffected relatives of patients as well, since they
   share a considerable amount of genetic risk. While behaviorally,
   impaired ToM function is confirmed meta-analytically in relatives,
   evidence on aberrant function of the neural ToM network is sparse and
   inconclusive. The present study therefore aimed to further explore the
   neural correlates of ToM in relatives of schizophrenia. About 297
   controls and 63 unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with
   schizophrenia performed a ToM task during functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Consistent with the literature relatives exhibited decreased
   activity of the medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, increased
   recruitment of the right middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate
   cortex was found, which was related to subclinical paranoid symptoms in
   relatives. These results further support decreased medial prefrontal
   activation during ToM as an intermediate phenotype of genetic risk for
   schizophrenia. Enhanced recruitment of posterior ToM areas in relatives
   might indicate inefficiency mechanisms in the presence of genetic risk.}},

Abstract = {{Fast threat detection is crucial for survival. In line with such
   evolutionary pressure, threat-signaling fear-conditioned faces have been
   found to rapidly (<80 ms) activate visual brain regions including the
   fusiform gyrus on the conditioning day. Whether remotely fear
   conditioned stimuli (CS) evoke similar early processing enhancements is
   unknown. Here, 16 participants who underwent a differential face
   fear-conditioning and extinction procedure on day 1 were presented the
   initial CS 24 h after conditioning (Recent Recall Test) as well as 9-17
   months later (Remote Recall Test) while EEG was recorded. Using a
   data-driven segmentation procedure of CS evoked event-related
   potentials, five distinct microstates were identified for both the
   recent and the remote memory test. To probe intracranial activity, EEG
   activity within each microstate was localized using low resolution
   electromagnetic tomography analysis (LORETA). In both the recent (41-55
   and 150-191 ms) and remote (45-90 ms) recall tests, fear conditioned
   faces potentiated rapid activation in proximity of fusiform gyrus, even
   in participants unaware of the contingencies. These findings suggest
   that rapid processing enhancements of conditioned faces persist over

Abstract = {{What determines how close you choose to stand to someone? Why do some
   people prefer farther distances than others? We hypothesized that an
   important factor is one's sensory sensitivity level, i.e. how sensitive
   one is to nearby visual stimulation, noise, touch or smell. This study
   characterizes the behavioral, hormonal and electrophysiological metrics
   of interpersonal distance (IPD) preferences in relation to levels of
   sensory sensitivity. Using both an ecologically realistic task and
   electroencephalogram (EEG), we found that sensory sensitivity levels
   predicted IPD preferences, such that the more sensitive one is the
   farther distance they prefer. Furthermore, electrophysiological evidence
   revealed that individuals with higher sensory sensitivity show more
   alpha suppression for approaching stimuli, strengthening the notion that
   early sensory cortical excitability is involved in one's social decision
   of how close to stand to another. The results provide evidence that a
   core human metric of social interaction is influenced by individual
   levels of sensory sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need for effective, early post-trauma preventive
   interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Attenuating
   amygdala hyperreactivity early post-trauma, a likely PTSD vulnerability
   factor, may decrease PTSD risk. Since oxytocin modulates amygdala
   reactivity to emotional stimuli, oxytocin administration early
   post-trauma may be a promising candidate for PTSD prevention. In a
   randomized double-blind placebo-controlled fMRI study, we investigated
   effects of a single intranasal oxytocin administration (40 IU) on
   amygdala reactivity to happy, neutral and fearful faces in 41 recently
   trauma-exposed men and women showing moderate to high distress after
   initial post-trauma screening. We explored treatment interactions with
   sex. Participants were scanned within 11 days post-trauma. Compared with
   placebo, oxytocin significantly increased right amygdala reactivity to
   fearful faces. There was a significant treatment by sex interaction on
   amygdala reactivity to neutral faces, with women showing increased left
   amygdala reactivity after oxytocin. These findings indicate that a
   single oxytocin administration may enhance fearful faces processing in
   recently trauma-exposed individuals and neutral faces processing in
   recently trauma-exposed women. These observations may be explained by
   oxytocin-induced increased salience processing. Clinical implications of
   these findings for PTSD prevention should be further investigated. Trial

Abstract = {{Romantic relationship satisfaction (RRS) is important for
   mental/physical health but varies greatly across individuals. To date,
   we have known little about the biological (genetic and neural)
   correlates of RRS. We tested the hypothesis that the serotonin
   transporter promoter polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), the promoter region of the
   gene SLC6A4 that codes for the serotonin transporter protein, is
   associated with individuals' RRS. Moreover, we investigated neural
   activity that mediates 5-HTTLPR association with RRS by scanning
   short-short (s/s) and long-long (l/l) homozygotes of 5-HTTLPR, using
   functional MRI, during a Cyberball game that resulted in social
   exclusion. l/l compared with s/s allele carriers reported higher RRS but
   lower social interaction anxiety. l/l compared with s/s carriers showed
   stronger activity in the right ventral prefrontal cortex (RVPFC) and
   stronger functional connectivity between the dorsal and rostral ACC when
   being excluded from the Cyberball game. Moreover, the 5-HTTLPR
   association with RRS was mediated by the RVPFC activity and the 5-HTTLPR
   association with social interaction anxiety was mediated by both the
   dorsal-rostral ACC connectivity and RVPFC activity. Our findings suggest
   that 5-HTTLPR is associated with satisfaction of one's own romantic
   relationships and this association is mediated by the neural activity in
   the brain region related to emotion regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of the role played by the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in
   human emotion has recently advanced with STN deep brain stimulation, a
   neurosurgical treatment for Parkinson's disease and obsessive-compulsive
   disorder. However, the potential presence of several confounds related
   to pathological models raises the question of how much they affect the
   relevance of observations regarding the physiological function of the
   STN itself. This underscores the crucial importance of obtaining
   evidence from healthy participants. In this study, we tested the
   structural and functional connectivity between the STN and other brain
   regions related to vocal emotion in a healthy population by combining
   diffusion tensor imaging and psychophysiological interaction analysis
   from a high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging study. As
   expected, we showed that the STN is functionally connected to the
   structures involved in emotional prosody decoding, notably the
   orbitofrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, auditory cortex, pallidum
   and amygdala. These functional results were corroborated by
   probabilistic fiber tracking, which revealed that the left STN is
   structurally connected to the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex.
   These results confirm, in healthy participants, the role played by the
   STN in human emotion and its structural and functional connectivity with
   the brain network involved in vocal emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful concept underlying forms of
   associative learning governed by the use of a scalar reward signal, with
   learning taking place if expectations are violated. RL may be assessed
   using model-based and model-free approaches. Model-based reinforcement
   learning involves the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the orbitofrontal
   cortex (OFC). The model-free system involves the
   pedunculopontine-tegmental nucleus (PPTgN), the ventral tegmental area
   (VTA) and the ventral striatum (VS). Based on the functional
   connectivity of VS, model-free and model based RL systems center on the
   VS that by integrating model-free signals (received as reward prediction
   error) and model-based reward related input computes value. Using the
   concept of reinforcement learning agent we propose that the VS serves as
   the value function component of the RL agent. Regarding the model
   utilized for model-based computations we turned to the proactive brain
   concept, which offers an ubiquitous function for the default network
   based on its great functional overlap with contextual associative areas.
   Hence, by means of the default network the brain continuously organizes
   its environment into context frames enabling the formulation of
   analogy-based association that are turned into predictions of what to
   expect. The OFC integrates reward-related information into context
   frames upon computing reward expectation by compiling stimulus-reward
   and context-reward information offered by the amygdala and hippocampus,
   respectively. Furthermore we suggest that the integration of model-based
   expectations regarding reward into the value signal is further supported
   by the efferent of the OFC that reach structures canonical for
   model-free learning (e.g., the PPTgN, VTA, and VS).}},

Abstract = {{The role of opiate systems has been extensively studied in relation to
   learning and memory. Naloxone (Nx), an opiate antagonist, was
   administrated in concurrent (Experiment 1) and sequential (Experiment 2)
   flavor aversion learning (FAL) tasks. The outcomes demonstrate that Nx
   impairs the acquisition of concurrent but not sequential FAL. In the
   concurrent learning (7 trials), both control (vehicle) and Nx2 (treated
   with Nx only on the first 2 days) groups learned the task. Furthermore,
   these 2 groups retained the learning in a discrimination test without
   drug administration (Day 8) but failed a reversal test (Day 9). In
   contrast, the Nx group (7 trials with Nx) showed no concurrent learning
   but correctly performed the discrimination test (Day 8) and, critically,
   the reversal test. These results suggest that Nx blocks concurrent
   (implicit) learning in these experiments but induces animals to resort
   to new strategies that are flexible, a characteristic of explicit
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research has shown the involvement of the central cholinergic
   system in the acquisition and consolidation of tasks involving
   conditioned fear responses, such as those observed in contextual fear
   conditioning (CFC), tone fear conditioning (TFC) and inhibitory
   avoidance (IA). However, there are few data concerning the role of this
   system in the memory retrieval process. Therefore, the present study
   aimed to compare the effects of the administration of an M1 antagonist
   on retrieval during these tasks. For each behavioral procedure, groups
   of male Wistar rats were trained. Twenty-four hr later, they were
   treated with different doses of dicyclomine (16, 32, or 64 mg/kg, i.p.)
   or with saline 30 min before the test session. The results showed that
   dicyclomine at doses of 16 and 32 mg/kg impaired CFC without interfering
   with IA performance. Moreover, only 64 mg/kg impaired TFC. These data
   suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors contribute to memory retrieval in
   CFC and TFC but are not essential for retrieval in IA.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{36-43}},

Abstract = {{Extinction of Pavlovian conditioned fear in humans is a popular paradigm
   often used to study learning and memory processes that mediate
   anxiety-related disorders. Fear extinction studies often only pair the
   conditioned stimulus (CS) and unconditioned stimulus (UCS) on a subset
   of acquisition trials (i.e., partial reinforcement/pairing) to prolong
   extinction (i.e., partial reinforcement extinction effect; PREE) and
   provide more time to study the process. However, there is limited
   evidence that the partial pairing procedures typically used during fear
   conditioning actually extend the extinction process, while there is
   strong evidence these procedures weaken conditioned response (CR)
   acquisition. Therefore, determining conditioning procedures that support
   strong CR acquisition and that also prolong the extinction process would
   benefit the field. The present study investigated 4 separate CS-UCS
   pairing procedures to determine methods that support strong conditioning
   and that also exhibit a PREE. One group (C-C) of participants received
   continuous CS-UCS pairings; a second group (C-P) received continuous
   followed by partial CS-UCS pairings; a third group (P-C) received
   partial followed by continuous CS-UCS pairings; and a fourth group (P-P)
   received partial CS-UCS pairings during acquisition. A strong skin
   conductance CR was expressed by C-C and P-C groups but not by C-P and
   P-P groups at the end of the acquisition phase. The P-C group maintained
   the CR during extinction. In contrast, the CR extinguished quickly
   within the C-C group. These findings suggest that partial followed by
   continuous CS-UCS pairings elicit strong CRs and prolong the extinction
   process following human fear conditioning.}},

   Dorsolateral Striatial-Dependent Learning and Enhances Learning of Set 2

Abstract = {{The role of estrogen in extradimensional set-shifting was evaluated with
   replacement of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) in ovariectomized (OVX) female
   rats. Rats were reinforced with food when they entered an arm of a
   plus-maze that was distinguished by visual and/or tactile cues (Set 1).
   In Set 2, reinforcement was shifted to construct a new association
   between food and visual/tactile cues that were different from Set 1. The
   purpose of using this extradimensional set-shifting task was to
   differentiate the effect of acute or continuous E2 on the dorsolateral
   (DLS) versus dorsomedial (DMS) striatum and medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC), because Set 1 and 2 learning, respectively, are associated with
   these particular brain regions. Results showed that compared to
   controls, acute E2-replaced female rats required more training trials to
   reach criterion in Set 1. Moreover, E2-replaced females showed a
   significant delay in the rate of acquisition of Set 1 learning compared
   to controls. In Set 2 there were no group differences in perseverative
   errors, which are reduced by mPFC activation, or when learning took
   place in a previously reinforced arm, a DMS-mediated effect. Despite
   this, control females required more training trials to learn Set 2
   compared to Set 1, suggesting that prior learning in Set 1 interfered
   with Set 2 performance in non-E-replaced rats. In contrast, E2 groups
   learned Set 2 in fewer training trials than Set 1. These data suggest
   that E2 facilitates set shifting, apart from any apparent enhancement of
   DMS or mPFC function, perhaps by interfering with DLS-mediated Set 1
   learning.}},

   used male subjects. Given the well-established sex differences in drug
   addiction, it is conceivable that such differences are also evident in
   risk-based decision making. To test this possibility, male and female
   adult rats were trained in a risky decision making task (RDT), in which
   they chose between a small, ``safe{''} food reward and a large,
   ``risky{''} food reward accompanied by an increasing probability of mild
   footshock punishment. Consistent with findings in human subjects,
   females were more risk averse, choosing the large, risky reward
   significantly less than males. This effect was not due to differences in
   shock reactivity or body weight, and risk-taking in females was not
   modulated by estrous phase. Systemic amphetamine administration
   decreased risk-taking in both males and females; however, females
   exhibited greater sensitivity to amphetamine, suggesting that
   dopaminergic signaling may partially account for sex differences in
   risk-taking. Finally, although males displayed greater instrumental
   responding for food reward, reward choice in the RDT was not affected by
   satiation, indicating that differences in motivation to obtain food
   reward cannot fully account for sex differences in risk-taking. These
   results should prove useful for developing targeted treatments for
   psychiatric conditions in which risk-taking is altered and that are
   known to differentially affect males and females.}},

Abstract = {{In humans and some nonhuman vertebrates, a sound containing brief silent
   gaps can be rendered perceptually continuous by inserting noise into the
   gaps. This so-called ``continuity illusion{''} arises from a phenomenon
   known as ``auditory induction{''} and results in the perception of
   complete auditory objects despite fragmentary or incomplete acoustic
   information. Previous studies of auditory induction in gray treefrogs
   (Hyla versicolor and H. chrysoscelis) have demonstrated an absence of
   this phenomenon. These treefrog species produce pulsatile
   (noncontinuous) vocalizations, whereas studies of auditory induction in
   other taxa, including humans, often present continuous sounds (e.g.,
   frequency-modulated sweeps). This study investigated the continuity
   illusion in a frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) with an advertisement
   vocalization that is naturally continuous and thus similar to the tonal
   sweeps used in human psychophysical studies of auditory induction. In a
   series of playback experiments, female subjects were presented with sets
   of stimuli that included complete calls, calls with silent gaps, and
   calls with silent gaps filled with noise. The results failed to provide
   evidence of auditory induction. Current evidence, therefore, suggests
   that mammals and birds experience auditory induction, but frogs may not.
   This emerging pattern of taxonomic differences is considered in light of
   potential methodological, neurophysiological, and functional
   explanations.}},

Volume = {{130}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies showed that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a
   role in selective visual attention. The current study further examined
   the role of the ACC in attention using a visual cuing task with
   task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimuli. On every trial, 2 stimuli
   were presented on the touchscreen; 1 was task-relevant and the other was
   task-irrelevant. Rats were trained to attend to the task-relevant
   stimulus over the task-irrelevant stimulus to determine which side of
   the touchscreen should be selected for reward. After the rats were
   well-trained, cannulas targeting the ACC were implanted bilaterally for
   infusions of PBS or muscimol. When the ACC was functionally intact, high
   task performance was correlated with the anticipatory touches toward the
   reward; rats touched the stimulus proximal to the correct side more
   often, regardless of its task-relevancy. Analysis of the presurgery
   training data showed that rats developed anticipatory touches during
   training. Linear discriminant analyses of the touches also showed that
   the touches predict rats' choices in trials. With muscimol infusions,
   choice accuracy was impaired and the anticipatory touches toward the
   correct response location were less frequent. A control experiment, in
   which there were no irrelevant stimuli, showed no effects of ACC
   inactivation on choice accuracy or anticipatory touches. These results
   indicate that the rat ACC plays a critical role in reducing distraction
   from irrelevant stimuli as well as in guiding attention toward the goal
   locations.}},

Abstract = {{Orexins are hypothalamic peptides involved in the modulation of the
   feeding, arousal, reward function, learning, and memory; nevertheless,
   the role of orexins in stress and relapse are largely unclear.
   Therefore, in the present study, the reinstatement model were used to
   examine the effects of intradentate gyrus (DG) administration of
   SB334867 as an orexin-1 receptor antagonist and TCS OX2 29, as an
   orexin-2 receptor antagonist on drug priming-and forced swim stress
   (FSS)-induced reinstatement of morphine. One-hundred and 44 adult male
   albino Wistar rats weighing 200 g-280 g were bilaterally implanted by
   cannulas into the DG. For induction of conditioned place preference
   (CPP), subcutaneous (sc) injection of morphine (5 mg/kg) was used daily
   during a 3-day conditioning phase. Then, the conditioning score
   (conditional stimulus {[}CS]) was calculated. After a 24 hr ``off{''}
   period following achievement of extinction criterion, rats were tested
   for drug priming-induced reinstatement by priming dose of morphine (1
   mg/kg, sc) and for FSS-induced reinstatement 10 min after FSS. In the
   next experiments, animals received different doses of intra-DG
   administration of SB334867 and TCS OX2 29 (3, 10, and 30 mu g/0.5 mu l
   12\% DMSO per side), bilaterally and were subsequently tested for
   morphine priming-and FSS-induced reinstatement. Our findings indicated
   that the FSS-induced the reinstatement of seeking behaviors.
   Furthermore, intra-DG administration of orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptor
   antagonists attenuated drug priming-induced reinstatement
   dose-dependently. However, they have trivial role in FSS-induced
   reinstatement. It is concluded that drug priming-induced reinstatement
   may be mediated, at least in part, by stimulation of orexin receptors in
   the DG.}},

Abstract = {{Rats suppress intake of a palatable taste cue when paired with a
   rewarding or an aversive stimulus in appetitive or aversive
   conditioning, respectively. A similar phenomenon occurs with drugs of
   abuse, but the nature of this conditioning has been subject for debate.
   While relatively little is known about the underlying neural circuitry,
   we recently reported bilateral lesions of the thalamic trigeminal
   orosensory area isolate drug-induced suppression of intake of a taste
   cue. The lesion blocks avoidance of the taste cue when paired with
   experimenter delivered drugs of abuse, yet has no effect on avoidance of
   the same cue when paired with an aversive agent or when it predicts
   access to a highly palatable sucrose solution. We hypothesize the lesion
   may blunt the rewarding properties of the drug. To test this, we used a
   runway apparatus, as running speed has been shown to increase with
   increasing reward value. Our hypothesis was supported by failure of the
   lesioned rats to increase running speed for morphine. Interestingly,
   lesioned rats did avoid intake of the drug-paired cue when presented in
   the runway apparatus and displayed naloxone-precipitated withdrawal.
   Using a partial crossover design, the lesion prevented avoidance of a
   cocaine-paired cue when presented in the home cage. We conclude that the
   lesion disrupts avoidance of a taste cue in anticipation of the
   rewarding properties of a drug but, at least in the presence of
   contextual cues, allows for avoidance of a taste cue as it elicits the
   onset of an aversive conditioned state of withdrawal.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitization to psychostimulants is strongly influenced by the
   environmental context in which the drug is administered and little is
   known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate this process. Chronic
   treatment with psychostimulants has been shown to upregulate the
   expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in the striatum, as a
   downstream target gene of Delta FosB. This study was therefore designed
   to analyze neurochemical changes underlying the expression of
   amphetamine-induced sensitization. To this end, periadolescent rats were
   given saline or 4 mg/kg amphetamine in a NOVEL or a HOME environment.
   After 1 day, subjects were challenged with vehicle or 2 mg/kg
   amphetamine in the same context in which they received the first
   administration of the drug. Locomotor activity and the expression levels
   of p35 and Cdk5 activity in synaptosomes of the dorsal striatum were
   analyzed. The expression of behavioral sensitization was observed only
   in the NOVEL condition. Furthermore, only animals trained and tested in
   the NOVEL condition showed increased p35 protein levels and Cdk5
   activity. Our findings provide clear behavioral and neurochemical
   evidence of a specific association between increased p35 and Cdk5
   activity in the dorsal striatum and the expression of
   amphetamine-behavioral sensitization, allowing us to propose p35 as a
   biochemical marker of behavioral sensitization to amphetamine.}},

Abstract = {{Western diet (WD) intake induces obesity and metabolic dysfunction. The
   present study examined the effects of WD on hippocampal-dependent
   cognitive functioning and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability as a
   function of exposure duration, obesity phenotype, and peripheral markers
   of energy regulation. The use of hippocampal-dependent ``place{''} or
   hippocampal-independent ``response{''} strategies in a Y maze was
   assessed in male rats following 10, 40, and 90 days of WD exposure in
   diet-induced obese (DIO) rats, in diet resistant (DR) rats that are
   relatively insensitive to the obesogenic properties of WD, and in
   chow-fed controls. Insulin, glucose, and BBB permeability throughout
   several loci in the hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum were evaluated
   in relation to duration of WD exposure, obesity phenotype, and type of
   strategy used. DIO rats had increased body weight and adiposity
   throughout the study, and elevated 10-day glucose and 90-day insulin
   levels. Throughout the study, chow-fed and DR rats reliably relied on a
   place strategy. DIO rats, in contrast, favored a response strategy at
   the 10- and 90-day time points. BBB leakage was observed in the dorsal
   striatum and multiple subregions of the hippocampus of DIO, but not DR
   or chow-fed rats. Increased ventral hippocampal BBB permeability and
   blood glucose levels were associated with reduced place strategy use.
   These data indicate that WD-induced BBB leakage is dependent on duration
   of diet exposure as well as obesity phenotype, and implicates BBB
   leakage and impaired glucoregulation in behavioral strategy and
   cognitive performance.}},

Abstract = {{Why do people tend to care for upholding principles of justice? This
   study examined the association between individual differences in the
   affective, motivational and cognitive components of empathy, sensitivity
   to justice, and psychopathy in participants (N 265) who were also asked
   to rate the permissibility of everyday moral situations that pit
   personal benefit against moral standards of justice. Counter to common
   sense, emotional empathy was not associated with sensitivity to
   injustice for others. Rather, individual differences in cognitive
   empathy and empathic concern predicted sensitivity to justice for
   others, as well as the endorsement of moral rules. Psychopathy
   coldheartedness scores were inversely associated with motivation for
   justice. Moreover, hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis
   revealed that self-focused and other-focused orientations toward justice
   had opposing influences on the permissibility of moral judgments. High
   scores on psychopathy were associated with less moral condemnation of
   immoral behavior. Together, these results contribute to a better
   understanding of the information processing mechanisms underlying
   justice motivation, and may guide interventions designed to foster
   justice and moral behavior. In order to promote justice motivation, it
   may be more effective to encourage perspective taking and reasoning than
   emphasizing emotional sharing with the misfortune of others.}},

   findings of distinct functional neural connectivity}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Current theory suggests that the processing of different types of threat
   is supported by distinct neural networks. Here we tested whether there
   are distinct neural correlates associated with different types of threat
   processing in shyness. Using fMRI and multivariate techniques, we
   compared neural responses and functional connectivity during the
   processing of imminent (i.e., congruent angry/angry face pairs) and
   ambiguous (i.e., incongruent angry/neutral face pairs) social threat in
   young adults selected for high and low shyness. To both types of threat
   processing, non-shy adults recruited a right medial prefrontal cortex
   (mPFC) network encompassing nodes of the default mode network involved
   in automatic emotion regulation, whereas shy adults recruited a right
   dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) network encompassing nodes of
   the frontoparietal network that instantiate active attentional and
   cognitive control. Furthermore, in shy adults, the mPFC interacted with
   the dACC network for ambiguous threat, but with a distinct network
   encompassing nodes of the salience network for imminent threat. These
   preliminary results expand our understanding of right mPFC function
   associated with temperamental shyness. They also provide initial
   evidence for differential neural networks associated with shy and
   non-shy profiles in the context of different types of social threat
   processing.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{The motive to achieve success (MAS) and motive to avoid failure (MAF)
   are two different but classical kinds of achievement motivation. Though
   many functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have explored
   functional activation in motivation-related conditions, research has
   been silent as to the brain structures associated with individual
   differences in achievement motivation, especially with respect to MAS
   and MAF. In this study, the voxel-based morphometry method was used to
   uncover focal differences in brain structures related to MAS and MAF
   measured by the Mehrabian Achieving Tendency Scale in 353 healthy young
   Chinese adults. The results showed that the brain structures associated
   with individual differences in MAS and MAF were distinct. MAS was
   negatively correlated with regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in the
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex while MAF was
   negatively correlated with rGMV in the mPFC/subgenual cingulate gyrus.
   After controlling for mutual influences of MAS and MAF scores, MAS
   scores were found to be related to rGMV in the mPFC/orbitofrontal cortex
   and another cluster containing the parahippocampal gyrus and precuneus.
   These results may predict that compared with MAF, the generation process
   of MAS may be more complex and rational, thus in the real world, perhaps
   MAS is more beneficial to personal growth and guaranteeing the quality
   of task performance.}},

Title = {{Left hemisphere EEG coherence in infancy predicts infant declarative

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{49-59}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Pointing plays a central role in preverbal communication. While
   imperative pointing aims at influencing another person's behavior,
   declarative gestures serve to convey epistemic information and to share
   interest in an object. Further, the latter are hypothesized to be a
   precursor ability of epistemic language. So far, little is known about
   their underlying brain maturation processes. Therefore, the present
   study investigated the relation between brain maturation processes and
   the production of imperative and declarative motives as well as
   epistemic language in N=32 infants. EEG coherence scores were measured
   at 14months, imperative and declarative point production at 15months and
   epistemic language at 48months. Results of correlational analyses
   suggest distinct behavioral and neural patterns for imperative and
   declarative pointing, with declarative pointing being associated with
   the maturation of the left hemisphere. Further, EEG coherence measures
   of the left hemisphere at 14months and declarative pointing at 15months
   are related to individual differences in epistemic language skills at
   48months, independently of child IQ. In regression analyses, coherence
   measures of the left hemisphere prove to be the most important predictor
   of epistemic language skills. Thus, neural processes of the left
   hemisphere seem particularly relevant to social communication.}},

Abstract = {{Social cognitive difficulties are common in the acute phase of bipolar
   disorder and, to a lesser extent, during the euthymic stage, and imaging
   studies of social cognition in euthymic bipolar disorder have implicated
   mirror system brain regions. This study aimed to use a novel multimodal
   approach (i.e., including both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
   and electroencephalogram (EEG)) to investigate mirror systems in bipolar
   disorder. Fifteen individuals with euthymic bipolar disorder and 16
   healthy controls participated in this study. Single-pulse TMS was
   applied to the optimal site in the primary motor cortex (M1), which
   stimulates the muscle of interest during the observation of hand
   movements (goal-directed or interacting) designed to elicit mirror
   system activity. Single EEG electrodes (C3, CZ, C4) recorded mu rhythm
   modulation concurrently. Results revealed that the patient group showed
   significantly less mu suppression compared to healthy controls.
   Surprisingly, motor resonance was not significantly different overall
   between groups; however, bipolar disorder participants showed a pattern
   of reduced reactivity on some conditions. Although preliminary, this
   study indicates a potential mirror system deficit in euthymic bipolar
   disorder, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The current study aimed to identify atypical neurophysiological activity
   associated with deficient affective processing in individuals with high
   callous-unemotional traits (CU). Fifty-six participants (M age=20.52;
   46\% male) divided in two groups, differentiated on levels of CU traits,
   were invited to participate in the experimental phase of the study.
   Medial prefrontal cortex activity, measured with functional
   Near-Infrared Spectroscopy, and facial electro-myography activity were
   recorded during videos depicting violent, comedy and neutral scenes.
   Individuals high on CU traits showed similar medial prefrontal cortex
   oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO(2)) activity to positive and negative films,
   while the pre-frontal cortical responses of low CU individuals were more
   pronounced to positive than negative materials. High CU participants
   also showed reduced facial electromyography at the corrugator muscle in
   response to violent films, which was not differentiated from their
   responses to comedy films. These findings suggest that individuals high
   on CU traits show reduced but not absent (i.e., flat) affect to
   emotional material. Deficits in processing positive and negative valent
   material, measured with different neuro-physiological modalities, might
   be essential to understand CU traits.}},

   indeterministic intuitions about the relationship between free will and
   moral responsibility. However, the psychophysiological mechanisms that
   generate these extreme intuitions are still underexplored. Exogenous
   oxytocin offers a unique opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of
   these underlying mechanisms, since this neuropeptide influences a wide
   range of outcomes related to social cognition and prosociality. This
   study investigated the effects of intranasal oxytocin on intuitions
   about the relationship between free will and moral responsibility by
   applying a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subject
   design. Healthy male participants rated the moral responsibility of a
   hypothetical offender, who committed crimes in either a primed
   deterministic or an indeterministic universe. Under placebo,
   participants held the offender more morally responsible when acting in
   an indeterministic compared to a deterministic universe, which could be
   accredited to recognition of the offender's freely chosen action to
   commit the crimes. Under oxytocin, participants rated the offender's
   actions with greater leniency and similarly assigned lower moral
   responsibility in both universes. These findings strengthen the
   assumption that a person can have different intuitions about the
   relationship between free will and moral responsibility, which can be
   presumably dependent on motivational states associated with affiliation.}},

Abstract = {{Humans are amazingly experts at processing and recognizing faces,
   however there are moderating factors of this ability. In the present
   study, we used the event-related potential technique to investigate the
   influence of both race and gaze direction on visual working memory
   (i.e., VWM) face representations. In a change detection task, we
   orthogonally manipulated race (own-race vs. other-race faces) and
   eye-gaze direction (direct gaze vs. averted gaze). Participants were
   required to encode identities of these faces. We quantified the amount
   of information encoded in VWM by monitoring the amplitude of the
   sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN) time-locked to the
   faces. Notably, race and eye-gaze direction differently modulated SPCN
   amplitude such that other-race faces elicited reduced SPCN amplitudes
   compared with own-race faces only when displaying a direct gaze. On the
   other hand, faces displaying averted gaze, independently of their race,
   elicited increased SPCN amplitudes compared with faces displaying direct
   gaze. We interpret these findings as denoting that race and eye-gaze
   direction affect different face processing stages.}},

Title = {{Regularity effect in prospective memory during aging}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Background: Regularity effect can affect performance in prospective
   memory (PM), but little is known on the cognitive processes linked to
   this effect. Moreover, its impacts with regard to aging remain unknown.
   To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine regularity effect
   in PM in a lifespan perspective, with a sample of young, intermediate,
   and older adults.
   Objective and design: Our study examined the regularity effect in PM in
   three groups of participants: 28 young adults (18-30), 16 intermediate
   adults (40-55), and 25 older adults (65-80). The task, adapted from the
   Virtual Week, was designed to manipulate the regularity of the various
   activities of daily life that were to be recalled (regular repeated
   activities vs. irregular non-repeated activities). We examine the role
   of several cognitive functions including certain dimensions of executive
   functions (planning, inhibition, shifting, and binding), short-term
   memory, and retrospective episodic memory to identify those involved in
   PM, according to regularity and age.
   Results: A mixed-design ANOVA showed a main effect of task regularity
   and an interaction between age and regularity: an age-related difference
   in PM performances was found for irregular activities (older B young),
   but not for regular activities. All participants recalled more regular
   activities than irregular ones with no age effect. It appeared that
   recalling of regular activities only involved planning for both
   intermediate and older adults, while recalling of irregular ones were
   linked to planning, inhibition, short-term memory, binding, and
   retrospective episodic memory.
   Conclusion: Taken together, our data suggest that planning capacities
   seem to play a major role in remembering to perform intended actions
   with advancing age. Furthermore, the age-PM-paradox may be attenuated
   when the experimental design is adapted by implementing a familiar
   context through the use of activities of daily living. The clinical
   implications of regularity effect are discussed.}},

Title = {{The role of orgasm in the development and shaping of partner preferences}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Background: The effect of orgasm on the development and shaping of
   partner preferences may involve a catalysis of the neurochemical
   mechanisms of bonding. Therefore, understanding such process is relevant
   for neuroscience and psychology.
   Methods: A systematic review was carried out using the terms Orgasm,
   Sexual Reward, Partner Preference, Pair Bonding, Brain, Learning, Sex,
   Copulation.
   Results: In humans, concentrations of arousing neurotransmitters and
   potential bonding neurotransmitters increase during orgasm in the
   cerebrospinal fluid and the bloodstream. Similarly, studies in animals
   indicate that those neurotransmitters (noradrenaline, oxytocin,
   prolactin) and others (e.g. dopamine, opioids, serotonin) modulate the
   appetitive and consummatory phases of sexual behavior and reward. This
   suggests a link between the experience of orgasm/sexual reward and the
   neurochemical mechanisms of pair bonding. Orgasm/reward functions as an
   unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Some areas in the nervous system function
   as UCS-detection centers, which become activated during orgasm.
   Partner-related cues function as conditioned stimuli (CS) and are
   processed in CS-detector centers.
   Conclusions: Throughout the article, we discuss how UCS-and CS-detection
   centers must interact to facilitate memory consolidation and produce
   recognition and motivation during future social encounters.}},

Title = {{An evolutionary behaviorist perspective on orgasm}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary explanations for sexual behavior and orgasm most often
   posit facilitating reproduction as the primary function (i.e. greater
   rate of fertilization). Other reproductive benefits of sexual pleasure
   and orgasm such as improved bonding of parents have also been discussed
   but not thoroughly. Although sex is known to be highly reinforcing,
   behaviorist principles are rarely invoked alongside evolutionary
   psychology in order to account for human sexual and social behavior. In
   this paper, I will argue that intense sexual pleasure, especially
   orgasm, can be understood as a primary reinforcer shaped by evolution to
   reinforce behavior that facilitates reproductive success (i.e.
   conception through copulation). Next, I will describe an evolutionary
   account of social shaping. In particular, I will focus on how humans
   evolved to use orgasm and sexual arousal to shape the social behavior
   and emotional states of others through both classical and operant
   conditioning and through both reproductive and non-reproductive forms of
   sexual behavior. Finally, I will describe how orgasm is a signal of
   sensitivity to reinforcement that is itself reinforcing.}},

Title = {{Measuring sperm backflow following female orgasm: a new method}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human female orgasm is a vexed question in the field while
   there is credible evidence of cryptic female choice that has many
   hallmarks of orgasm in other species. Our initial goal was to produce a
   proof of concept for allowing females to study an aspect of infertility
   in a home setting, specifically by aligning the study of human
   infertility and increased fertility with the study of other mammalian
   fertility. In the latter case - the realm of oxytocin-mediated sperm
   retention mechanisms seems to be at work in terms of ultimate function
   (differential sperm retention) while the proximate function (rapid
   transport or cervical tenting) remains unresolved.
   Method: A repeated measures design using an easily taught technique in a
   natural setting was used. Participants were a small (n = 6),
   non-representative sample of females. The introduction of a
   sperm-simulant combined with an orgasm-producing technique using a
   vibrator/home massager and other easily supplied materials.
   Results: The sperm flowback (simulated) was measured using a technique
   that can be used in a home setting. There was a significant difference
   in simulant retention between the orgasm (M = 4.08, SD = 0.17) and
   non-orgasm (M = 3.30, SD = 0.22) conditions; t (5) = 7.02, p = 0.001.
   Cohen's d = 3.97, effect size r = 0.89. This indicates a medium to small
   effect size.
   Conclusions: This method could allow females to test an aspect of sexual
   response that has been linked to lowered fertility in a home setting
   with minimal training. It needs to be replicated with a larger sample
   size.}},

Title = {{Determinants of female sexual orgasms}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Background: The pursuit of sexual pleasure is a key motivating factor in
   sexual activity. Many things can stand in the way of sexual orgasms and
   enjoyment, particularly among women. These are essential issues of
   sexual well-being and gender equality.
   Objective: This study presents long-term trends and determinants of
   female orgasms in Finland. The aim is to analyze the roles of factors
   such as the personal importance of orgasms, sexual desire, masturbation,
   clitoral and vaginal stimulation, sexual self-esteem, communication with
   partner, and partner's sexual techniques.
   Design: In Finland, five national sex surveys that are based on random
   samples from the central population register have been conducted. They
   are representative of the total population within the age range of 18-54
   years in 1971 (N = 2,152), 18-74 years in 1992 (N = 2,250), 18-81 years
   in 1999 (N = 1,496), 18-74 years in 2007 (N = 2,590), and 18-79 years in
   2015 (N = 2,150). Another dataset of 2,049 women in the age group of
   18-70 years was collected in 2015 via a national Internet panel.
   Results: Contrary to expectations, women did not have orgasms that are
   more frequent by increasing their experience and practice of
   masturbation, or by experimenting with different partners in their
   lifetime. The keys to their more frequent orgasms lay in mental and
   relationship factors. These factors and capacities included orgasm
   importance, sexual desire, sexual self-esteem, and openness of sexual
   communication with partners. Women valued their partner's orgasm more
   than their own. In addition, positive determinants were the ability to
   concentrate, mutual sexual initiations, and partner's good sexual
   techniques. A relationship that felt good and worked well emotionally,
   and where sex was approached openly and appreciatively, promoted
   orgasms.
   Conclusion: The findings indicate that women differ greatly from one
   another in terms of their tendency and capacity to experience orgasms.
   The improvements in gender equality and sexual education since the 1970s
   have not helped women to become more orgasmic. Neither has the major
   increase in masturbation habits (among women in general). One challenge
   for future studies is to understand why women value their partner's
   orgasms more than their own.}},

Abstract = {{Background: High frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
   (rTMS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has shown
   significant efficiency in the treatment of resistant depression. However
   in healthy subjects, the effects of rTMS remain unclear.
   Objective: Our aim was to determine the impact of 10 sessions of rTMS
   applied to the DLPFC on mood and emotion recognition in healthy
   subjects.
   Design: In a randomised double-blind study, 20 subjects received 10
   daily sessions of active (10 Hz frequency) or sham rTMS. The TMS coil
   was positioned on the left DLPFC through neuronavigation. Several
   dimensions of mood and emotion processing were assessed at baseline and
   after rTMS with clinical scales, visual analogue scales (VASs), and the
   Ekman 60 faces test.
   Results: The 10 rTMS sessions targeting the DLPFC were well tolerated.
   No significant difference was found between the active group and the
   control group for clinical scales and the Ekman 60 faces test. Compared
   to the control group, the active rTMS group presented a significant
   improvement in their adaptation to daily life, which was assessed
   through VAS.
   Conclusion: This study did not show any deleterious effect on mood and
   emotion recognition of 10 sessions of rTMS applied on the DLPFC in
   healthy subjects. This study also suggested a positive effect of rTMS on

Title = {{Do rats have orgasms?}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although humans experience orgasms with a degree of
   statistical regularity, they remain among the most enigmatic of sexual
   responses; difficult to define and even more difficult to study
   empirically. The question of whether animals experience orgasms is
   hampered by similar lack of definition and the additional necessity of
   making inferences from behavioral responses.
   Method: Here we define three behavioral criteria, based on dimensions of
   the subjective experience of human orgasms described by Mah and Binik,
   to infer orgasm-like responses (OLRs) in other species: 1) physiological
   criteria that include pelvic floor and analmuscle contractions that
   stimulate seminal emission and/or ejaculation in the male, or that
   stimulate uterine and cervical contractions in the female; 2) short-term
   behavioral changes that reflect immediate awareness of a pleasurable
   hedonic reward state during copulation; and 3) long-term behavioral
   changes that depend on the reward state induced by the OLR, including
   sexual satiety, the strengthening of patterns of sexual arousal and
   desire in subsequent copulations, and the generation of conditioned
   place and partner preferences for contextual and partner-related cues
   associated with the reward state. We then examine whether physiological
   and behavioral data from observations of male and female rats during
   copulation, and in sexually-conditioned place-and partner-preference
   paradigms, are consistent with these criteria.
   Results: Both male and female rats display behavioral patterns
   consistent with OLRs.
   Conclusions: The ability to infer OLRs in rats offers new possibilities
   to study the phenomenon in neurobiological and molecular detail, and to
   provide both comparative and translational perspectives that would be
   useful for both basic and clinical research.}},

Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Background: The nature of a woman's orgasm has been a source of
   scientific, political, and cultural debate for over a century. Since the
   Victorian era, the pendulum has swung from the vagina to the clitoris,
   and to some extent back again, with the current debate stuck over
   whether internal sensory structures exist in the vagina that could
   account for orgasms based largely on their stimulation, or whether
   stimulation of the external glans clitoris is always necessary for
   orgasm.
   Method: We review the history of the clitoral versus vaginal orgasm
   debate as it has evolved with conflicting ideas and data from psychiatry
   and psychoanalysis, epidemiology, evolutionary theory, feminist
   political theory, physiology, and finally neuroscience.
   Results: A new synthesis is presented that acknowledges the enormous
   potential women have to experience orgasms from one or more sources of
   sensory input, including the external clitoral glans, internal region
   around the ``G-spot{''} that corresponds to the internal clitoral bulbs,
   the cervix, as well as sensory stimulation of non-genital areas such as
   the nipples.
   Conclusions: With experience, stimulation of one or all of these
   triggering zones are integrated into a ``whole{''} set of sensory
   inputs, movements, body positions, autonomic arousal, and partner-and
   contextual-related cues, that reliably induces pleasure and orgasm
   during masturbation and copulation. The process of integration is
   iterative and can change across the lifespan with new experiences of
   orgasm.}},

Title = {{What is orgasm? A model of sexual trance and climax via rhythmic
   entrainment}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Orgasm is one of the most intense pleasures attainable to an organism,
   yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. On the basis of
   existing literatures, this article introduces a novel mechanistic model
   of sexual stimulation and orgasm. In doing so, it characterizes the
   neurophenomenology of sexual trance and climax, describes parallels in
   dynamics between orgasms and seizures, speculates on possible
   evolutionary origins of sex differences in orgasmic responding, and
   proposes avenues for future experimentation. Here, a model is introduced
   where in sexual stimulation induces entrainment of coupling mechanical
   and neuronal oscillatory systems, thus creating synchronized functional
   networks within which multiple positive feedback processes intersect
   synergistically to contribute to sexual experience. These processes
   generate states of deepening sensory absorption and trance, potentially
   culminating in climax if critical thresholds are surpassed. The
   centrality of rhythmic stimulation (and its modulation by salience) for
   surpassing these thresholds suggests ways in which differential orgasmic
   responding between individuals-or with different partners-may serve as a
   mechanism for ensuring adaptive mate choice. Because the production of
   rhythmic stimulation combines honest indicators of fitness with cues
   relating to potential for investment, differential orgasmic response may
   serve to influence the probability of continued sexual encounters with
   specific mates.}},

Title = {{Testing the mate-choice hypothesis of the female orgasm: disentangling
   traits and behaviours}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Background: The evolution of the female orgasm in humans and its role in
   romantic relationships is poorly understood. Whereas the male orgasm is
   inherently linked to reproduction, the female orgasm is not linked to
   obvious reproductive or survival benefits. It also occurs less
   consistently during penetrative sex than does the male orgasm.
   Mate-choice hypotheses posit that the wide variation in female orgasm
   frequency reflects a discriminatory mechanism designed to select
   high-quality mates.
   Objective: We aimed to determine (1) whether women report that their
   orgasm frequency varies between partners, (2) whether this variation
   reflects mates' personal characteristics, and (3) whether this variation
   reflects own and partner sexual behaviour during intercourse.
   Design: We collected survey data from 103 women who rated (1) the extent
   to which their orgasm frequency varied between partners, (2) the
   characteristics of previous sexual partners who induced high-orgasm
   frequency and those who induced low-orgasm frequency, and (3) the
   specific behaviours during sex with those partners. This is the first
   study to test within-woman variation in orgasm and partner traits.
   Results: Overall, women reported variation in their orgasm rates with
   different partners. Partners who induced high-orgasm rates were rated as
   more humorous, creative, warm, faithful, and better smelling than
   partners who induced low-orgasm rates, and also engaged in greater
   efforts to induce partner orgasm.
   Conclusions: Some assumptions and predictions of mate-choice hypotheses
   of female orgasm were supported, while other aspects of our findings
   provide reasons to remain sceptical.}},

Title = {{Activation of sensory cortex by imagined genital stimulation: an fMRI
   analysis}},
Journal = {{SOCIOAFFECTIVE NEUROSCIENCE \& PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Background: During the course of a previous study, our laboratory made a
   serendipitous finding that just thinking about genital stimulation
   resulted in brain activations that overlapped with, and differed from,
   those generated by physical genital stimulation.
   Objective: This study extends our previous findings by further
   characterizing how the brain differentially processes physical `touch'
   stimulation and `imagined' stimulation.
   Design: Eleven healthy women (age range 29-74) participated in an fMRI
   study of the brain response to imagined or actual tactile stimulation of
   the nipple and clitoris. Two additional conditions - imagined dildo
   self-stimulation and imagined speculum stimulation - were included to
   characterize the effects of erotic versus non-erotic imagery.
   Results: Imagined and tactile self-stimulation of the nipple and
   clitoris each activated the paracentral lobule (the genital region of
   the primary sensory cortex) and the secondary somatosensory cortex.
   Imagined self-stimulation of the clitoris and nipple resulted in greater
   activation of the frontal pole and orbital frontal cortex compared to
   tactile self-stimulation of these two bodily regions. Tactile
   self-stimulation of the clitoris and nipple activated the cerebellum,
   primary somatosensory cortex (hand region), and premotor cortex more
   than the imagined stimulation of these body regions. Imagining dildo
   stimulation generated extensive brain activation in the genital sensory
   cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, insula,
   nucleus accumbens, and medial prefrontal cortex, whereas imagining
   speculum stimulation generated only minimal activation.
   Conclusion: The present findings provide evidence of the potency of
   imagined stimulation of the genitals and that the following brain
   regions may participate in erogenous experience: primary and secondary
   sensory cortices, sensory-motor integration areas, limbic structures,
   and components of the `reward system'. In addition, these results
   suggest a mechanism by which some individuals may be able to generate
   orgasm by imagery in the absence of physical stimulation.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{331-343}},
Abstract = {{Mindfulness can be viewed as an important dispositional characteristic
   that reflects the tendency to be mindful in daily life, which is
   beneficial for improving individuals' both hedonic and eudaimonic
   well-being. However, no study to date has examined the brain regions
   involved in individual differences in dispositional mindfulness during
   the resting state and its relation with hedonic and eudaimonic
   well-being. To investigate this issue, the present study employed
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to
   evaluate the regional homogeneity (ReHo) that measures the local
   synchronization of spontaneous brain activity in a large sample. We
   found that dispositional mindfulness was positively associated with the
   ReHo in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left parahippocampal gyrus
   (PHG), and right insula implicated in emotion processing, body
   awareness, and selfreferential processing, and negatively associated
   with the ReHo in right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) implicated in
   response inhibition and attentional control. Furthermore, we found
   different neural associations with hedonic (i.e., positive and negative
   affect) and eudaimonic well-being (i.e., the meaningful and purposeful
   life). Specifically, the ReHo in the IFG predicted eudaimonic well-being
   whereas the OFC predicted positive affect, both of which were mediated
   by dispositional mindfulness. Taken together, our study provides the
   first evidence for linking individual differences in dispositional
   mindfulness to spontaneous brain activity and demonstrates that
   dispositional mindfulness engages multiple brain mechanisms that
   differentially influence hedonic and eudaimonic well-being.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{344-352}},
Abstract = {{The right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is involved in intention
   understanding during interpersonal interactions. To examine how prior
   experience of cooperation and competition affects one's right IFG
   activation in the subsequent interaction, using near-infrared
   spectroscopy (NIRS) we simultaneously measured paired participants'
   bilateral IFG activations during a turn-taking game. Participant pairs
   were assigned to either one of two roles: a Builder taking the initial
   move to copy a target disk-pattern on monitor and the Partner taking the
   second move to aid in (cooperation) or to obstruct (competition) the
   Builder. The experiment consisted of two sessions. One participant (B-P)
   played as a Builder (B-) in session 1 and changed the role to the
   Partner (-P) in session 2, and vice versa for the paired participant
   (P-B). NIRS data in competition demonstrated that the Builder (B-) being
   obstructed in session 1 showed higher right IFG activation when (s) he
   took a role of obstructor (-P) in session 2 (the obstructed effect),
   whereas ``the cooperated effect{''} was not revealed in cooperation.
   These results suggest that prior experience of being obstructed may
   facilitate understanding of the Builder and/or the obstructor's tactical
   move, thereby increasing his/her right IFG activation when one is meant
   to obstruct in subsequent competitions.}},

Abstract = {{The prefrontal cortex (PFC) subserves complex cognitive abilities,
   including risky decision-making; the modulation of this brain area is
   shown to alter the way people take risks. Yet, neuromodulation of the
   PFC in relation to risk-taking behavior remains relatively less
   well-studied. Moreover, the psychological variables that influence such
   neuromodulation remain poorly understood. To address these issues, 16
   participants took part in 3 experimental sessions on separate days. They
   received: (i) left anodal-right cathodal transcranial direct current
   stimulation (tDCS); (ii) left cathodal-right anodal stimulation; or
   (iii) sham stimulation while they completed two risk-taking tasks. They
   also measured on several cognitive-affective abilities and personality
   traits. It was revealed that left cathodal-right anodal stimulation led
   to significantly reduced risk-taking under a context of haste. The
   reduction of risk-taking (relative to sham) correlated with state and
   trait impulsivity, such that the effect was larger in more impulsive
   individuals. For these individuals, the tDCS effect size was considered
   to be large (generalized partial eta(2) >.17). The effect of
   prefrontal-neuromodulation in reducing risk-taking was influenced by
   baseline impulsivity, reflecting a state-dependent effect of
   neuromodulation on the PFC. The results of this study carry important
   insights into the use of neuromodulation to alter higher cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Many individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) have difficulty producing
   normal speech and voice, resulting in problems with interpersonal
   communication and reduced quality of life. Translational animal models
   of communicative dysfunction have been developed to assess disease
   pathology. However, it is unknown whether acoustic feature changes
   associated with vocal production deficits in these animal models lead to
   compromised communication. In rodents, male ultrasonic vocalizations
   (USVs) have a well-established role in functional inter-sexual
   communication. To test whether acoustic deficits in USVs observed in a
   PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) knockout (KO) PD rat model
   compromise communication, we presented recordings of male PINK1 KO USVs
   and normal wildtype (WT) USVs to female rat listeners. We measured
   approached behavior and immediate early gene expression (c-Fos) in brain
   regions implicated in auditory processing and sexual motivation. Our
   results suggest that females show reduced approach in response to PINK1
   KO USVs compared with WT. Moreover, females exposed to PINK1 KO USVs had
   lower c-Fos immunolabeling in the nucleus accumbens, a region implicated
   in sexual motivation. These results are the first to demonstrate that
   vocalization deficits in a rat PD model result in compromised
   communication. Thus, the PINK1 KO PD model may be valuable for assessing
   treatments aimed at restoring vocal communicative function.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{380-394}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral and neurological studies have revealed that emotions
   influence moral cognition. Although moral stimuli are emotionally
   charged, the time course of interactions between emotions and moral
   judgments remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the
   temporal dynamics of the interaction between emotional processes and
   moral cognition. The results revealed that when making moral judgments,
   the time course of the event-related potential (ERP) waveform was
   significantly different between high emotional arousal and low emotional
   arousal contexts. Different stages of processing were distinguished,
   showing distinctive interactions between emotional processes and moral
   reasoning. The precise time course of moral intuition and moral
   reasoning sheds new light on theoretical models of moral psychology.
   Specifically, the N1 component (interpreted as representing moral
   intuition) did not appear to be influenced by emotional arousal.
   However, the N2 component and late positive potential were strongly
   affected by emotional arousal; the slow wave was influenced by both
   emotional arousal and morality, suggesting distinct moral processing at
   different emotional arousal levels.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{395-408}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, we used a valence classification task to
   investigate the common and distinct neural basis of the two fundamental
   dimensions of social cognition (agency and communion) using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results showed that several brain
   areas associated with mentalizing, along with the inferior parietal
   gyrus in the mirror system, showed overlap in response to both agentic
   and communal words. These findings suggest that both content categories
   are related to the neural basis of social cognition; further, several
   areas in the default mode network (DMN) showed similar deactivations
   between agency and communion, reflecting task-induced deactivation
   (TID). In terms of distinct activations, the findings indicated greater
   deactivations for communal than agentic content in the ventral anterior
   cingulate (vACC) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). Communion also
   showed greater activation in some visual areas compared to agentic
   content, including occipital gyrus, lingual gyrus, and fusiform gyrus.
   These activations may reflect greater allocation of attentional
   resources to visual areas when processing communal content, or
   inhibition of cognitive activity irrelevant to task performance. If so,
   this suggests greater attention and engagement with communion-related
   content. The present research thus suggests common and differential
   activations for agency-versus communion-related content.}},

Abstract = {{Although Theory of Mind (ToM) is thought to be impaired in Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), it remains unclear whether this impairment is linked to
   the level of task complexity, the heterogeneity of the studied patients,
   or the implication of executive dysfunctions. To elucidate this point,
   42 AD patients, divided into two subgroups {[} moderate AD (mAD)
   patients (n - 19) and early AD (eAD) patients (n - 23)], and 23 matched
   healthy older subjects (HO) were enrolled. All participants were given
   (1) a false-belief task (cognitive ToM), (2) a revised version of the
   ``Reading the Mind in the Eyes{''} test (affective ToM), and (3) a
   composite task designed to assess ToM abilities with minimal cognitive
   demands. Participants were also given executive tasks assessing
   inhibition, shifting, and updating processes. We observed a significant
   impairment of cognitive and composite ToM abilities in eAD patients
   compared with mAD patients. There was no impairment of affective ToM.
   Stepwise regression revealed that measures of global efficiency and
   executive functions (EFs) were the best predictors of progressive decay
   of ToM scores. These results indicate that cognitive aspects of ToM are
   more sensitive to AD progression than affective tasks. They also show
   that ToM abilities are more affected by dementia severity than by task
   complexity. One explanation of our results is the presence of
   compensatory mechanisms (social reserve) in AD.}},

Pages = {{424-437}},
Abstract = {{Socially anxious individuals are characterized as those with distorted
   negative self-beliefs (NSBs), which are thought to enhance reactions of
   social distress (emotional reactivity) and social avoidance (social
   functioning). However, it remains unclear whether individual differences
   in social distress and social avoidance are represented by differences
   in brain morphometry. To probe into these neural correlates, we analyzed
   magnetic resonance images of a sample of 130 healthy subjects and used
   the Connectome Computation System (CCS) to evaluate these factors. The
   results showed that social distress was correlated with the cortical
   volume of the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the subcortical
   volume of the left amygdala, while social avoidance was correlated with
   the cortical volume of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
   Additionally, loneliness might mediate the relationship between the
   amygdala volume and the social distress score. Our results demonstrated
   that social distress and social avoidance were represented by segregated
   cortical regions in the healthy individuals. These findings might
   provide a valuable basis for understanding the stable brain structures
   underlying individual differences in social anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{The weighing of intentions and consequences is inconsistent in adult's
   moral judgments, and this is particularly prominent when assigning blame
   to the immoral intentions in the absence of negative outcomes. The
   current study extends previous research by examining how individual
   differences in moral judgment competence are reflected in the cortical
   network when making judgments about immoral intentions. Twenty-four
   participants were scanned, using functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   while making judgments about three kinds of moral scenarios: a neutral
   condition, an immoral intention condition, and an immoral condition. The
   result showed that comparing with making judgments about the other two
   conditions, making judgments about the immoral intentions takes longer
   time and was associated with significantly elevated activity in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.
   Additionally, moral judgment competence scores were inversely correlated
   with activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when assigning
   blame to the immoral intentions. Greater activity in the right
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in participants with lower moral judgment
   competence possibly reflected increased recruitment of cognitive
   resource applied to control impulsive response and integrate competitive
   information in making judgments about the immoral intention.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Pages = {{455-466}},
Abstract = {{Both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and psychopathy are primarily
   characterized by social dysfunction; overlapping phenotypic features may
   reflect altered function in common brain mechanisms. The current study
   examined the degree to which neural response to social and nonsocial
   feedback is modulated by autistic versus psychopathic traits in a sample
   of typically developing adults (N = 31, 11 males, 18-52 years).
   Event-related potentials were recorded whilst participants completed a
   behavioral task and received feedback on task performance. Both autistic
   and psychopathic traits were associated with alterations in the neural
   correlates of feedback processing. Sensitivity to specific forms of
   feedback (social, nonsocial, positively valenced, negatively valenced)
   differed between the two traits. Autistic traits were associated with
   decreased sensitivity to social feedback. In contrast, the antisocial
   domain of psychopathic traits was associated with an overall decrease in
   sensitivity to feedback, and the interpersonal manipulation domain was
   associated with preserved processing of positively valenced feedback.
   Results suggest distinct alterations within specific mechanisms of
   feedback processing may underlie similar difficulties in social
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Depression symptoms during pregnancy may affect emerging maternal
   sensitivity and have lasting consequences for the dyadic relationship.
   Here, we examined whether depression was associated with the neural
   correlates of infant face and cry perception during pregnancy. In 36
   women between 34 and 38 weeks gestation, we examined the P300 elicited
   by infant emotional (happy, distressed, and neutral) faces and cries
   (high-and low-distress cries and a neutral tone). The Edinburgh
   Postnatal Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory-II were
   employed to measure current depression symptomatology. Higher depression
   symptoms were associated with an attenuated P300 to distressed infant
   faces, but not with happy or neutral infant faces. There was no
   association between depression symptoms and the P300 elicited by infant
   cries. These results suggest that depression symptoms during pregnancy
   may affect neural processing of infant faces, especially when the infant
   face is expressing distress.}},

Abstract = {{In human society, which is organized by social hierarchies, resources
   are usually allocated unequally and based on social status. In this
   study, we analyze how being endowed with different social statuses in a
   math competition affects the perception of fairness during asset
   allocation in a subsequent Ultimatum Game (UG). Behavioral data showed
   that when participants were in high status, they were more likely to
   reject unfair UG offers than in low status. This effect of social status
   correlated with activity in the right anterior insula (rAI) and with the
   functional connectivity between the rAI and a region in the anterior
   middle cingulate cortex, indicating that these two brain regions are
   crucial for integrating contextual factors and social norms during
   fairness perception. Additionally, there was an interaction between
   social status and UG offer fairness in the amygdala and thalamus,
   implicating the role of these regions in the modulation of social status
   on fairness perception. These results demonstrate the effect of social
   status on fairness perception and the potential neural underpinnings for
   this effect.}},

Abstract = {{Negative stimuli do not only evoke fear or disgust, but can also evoke a
   state of `morbid fascination' which is an urge to approach and explore a
   negative stimulus. In the present neuroimaging study, we applied an
   innovative method to investigate the neural systems involved in typical
   and atypical conceptualizations of negative images. Participants
   received false feedback labeling their mental experience as fear,
   disgust or morbid fascination. This manipulation was successful;
   participants judged the false feedback correct for 70\% of the trials on
   average. The neuroimaging results demonstrated differential activity
   within regions in the `neural reference space for discrete emotion'
   depending on the type of feedback. We found robust differences in the
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and
   the lateral orbitofrontal cortex comparing morbid fascination to control
   feedback. More subtle differences in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
   and the lateral orbitofrontal cortex were also found between morbid
   fascination feedback and the other emotion feedback conditions. This
   study is the first to forward evidence about the neural representation
   of the experimentally unexplored state of morbid fascination. In line
   with a constructionist framework, our findings suggest that neural
   resources associated with the process of conceptualization contribute to
   the neural representation of this state.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In daily life, interpersonal interactions are influenced by uncertainty
   about other people's intentions. Face-to-face (FF) interaction reduces
   such uncertainty by providing external visible cues such as facial
   expression or body gestures and facilitates shared intentionality to
   promote belief of cooperative decisions and actual cooperative behaviors
   in interaction. However, so far little is known about interpersonal
   brain synchronization between two people engaged in naturally occurring
   FF interactions. In this study, we combined an adapted ultimatum game
   with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning to
   investigate how FF interaction impacts interpersonal brain
   synchronization during economic exchange. Pairs of strangers interacted
   repeatedly either FF or face-blocked (FB), while their activation was
   simultaneously measured in the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ)
   and the control region, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC).
   Behaviorally, FF interactions increased shared intentionality between
   strangers, leading more positive belief of cooperative decisions and
   more actual gains in the game. FNIRS results indicated increased
   interpersonal brain synchronizations during FF interactions in rTPJ (but
   not in rDLPFC) with greater shared intentionality between partners.
   These results highlighted the importance of rTPJ in collaborative social
   interactions during FF economic exchange and warrant future research
   that combines FF interactions with fNIRS hyperscanning to study social
   brain disorders such as autism.}},

Abstract = {{Frontal asymmetry in alpha oscillations is assumed to be associated with
   psychopathology and individual differences in emotional responding.
   Brain-activity-based feedback is a promising tool for the modulation of
   cortical activity. Here, we validated a neurofeedback protocol designed
   to change relative frontal asymmetry based on individual alpha peak
   frequencies, including real-time average referencing and eye-correction.
   Participants (N = 60) were randomly assigned to a right, left or placebo
   neurofeedback group. Results show a difference in trainability between
   groups, with a linear change in frontal alpha asymmetry over time for
   the right neurofeedback group during rest. Moreover, the asymmetry
   changes in the right group were frequency and location specific, even
   though trainability did not persist at 1 week and 1 month follow-ups. On
   the behavioral level, subjective stress on the second test day was
   reduced in the left and placebo neurofeedback groups, but not in the
   right neurofeedback group. We found individual differences in
   trainability that were dependent on training group, with participants in
   the right neurofeedback group being more likely to change their frontal
   asymmetry in the desired direction. Individual differences in
   trainability were also reflected in the ability to change frontal
   asymmetry during the feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a strong heritable basis, as
   evidenced by twin concordance rates. Within ASD, symptom domains may
   arise via independent genetic contributions, with varying heritabilities
   and genetic mechanisms. In this article, we explore social functioning
   in the form of (i) electrophysiological and behavioral measures of face
   processing (P1 and N170) and (ii) social behavior among child and
   adolescent twins with (N = 52) and without ASD (N = 66). Twins without
   ASD had better holistic face processing and face memory, faster P1
   responses and greater sensitivity to the effects of facial inversion on
   P1. In contrast, N170 responses to faces were similar across diagnosis,
   with more negative amplitudes for faces vs non-face images. Across the
   sample, stronger social skills and fewer social difficulties were
   associated with faster P1 and N170 responses to upright faces, and
   better face memory. Twins were highly correlated within pairs across
   most measures, but correlations were significantly stronger for
   monozygotic vs dizygotic pairs on N170 latency and social problems. We
   suggest common developmental influences across twins for face processing
   and social behavior, but highlight (i) neural speed of face processing
   and (ii) social difficulties as important avenues in the search for
   genetic underpinnings in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibitory control is subserved in part by discrete regions of the
   prefrontal cortex whose functionality may be altered according to
   specific trait-based phenotypes. Using a unified model of normal range
   personality traits, we examined activation within lateral and medial
   aspects of the prefrontal cortex during a manual go/no-go task. Evoked
   hemodynamic oxygenation within the prefrontal cortex was measured in 106
   adults using a 16-channel continuous-wave functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy system. Within lateral regions of the prefrontal cortex,
   greater activation was associated with higher trait levels of
   extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness, and lower
   neuroticism. Higher agreeableness was also related to more activation in
   the medial prefrontal cortex during inhibitory control. These results
   suggest that personality traits reflecting greater emotional stability,
   extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness may be associated with
   more efficient recruitment of control processes subserved by lateral
   regions of the prefrontal cortex. These findings highlight key links
   between trait-based phenotypes and neural activation patterns in the
   prefrontal cortex underlying inhibitory control.}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneous imitation is assumed to underlie the acquisition of
   important skills by infants, including language and social interaction.
   In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to
   examine the neural basis of `spontaneously' driven imitation, which has
   not yet been fully investigated. Healthy participants were presented
   with movie clips of meaningless bimanual actions and instructed to
   observe and imitate them during an fMRI scan. The participants were
   subsequently shown the movie clips again and asked to evaluate the
   strength of their `urge to imitate' (Urge) for each action. We searched
   for cortical areas where the degree of activation positively correlated
   with Urge scores; significant positive correlations were observed in the
   right supplementary motor area (SMA) and bilateral midcingulate cortex
   (MCC) under the imitation condition. These areas were not explained by
   explicit reasons for imitation or the kinematic characteristics of the
   actions. Previous studies performed in monkeys and humans have
   implicated the SMA and MCC/caudal cingulate zone in voluntary actions.
   This study also confirmed the functional connectivity between Urge and
   imitation performance using a psychophysiological interaction analysis.
   Thus, our findings reveal the critical neural components that underlie
   spontaneous imitation and provide possible reasons why infants imitate
   spontaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Reproducibility of results is important in improving the robustness of
   conclusions drawn from research, particularly in functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). In this study, we aim to replicate a previous
   study on the neural correlates of face emotion processing above and
   below awareness level using an independent sample of youth with severe
   mood dysregulation (SMD) and healthy volunteers (HV). We collected fMRI
   data in 17 SMD and 20 HV, using an affective priming paradigm with
   masked (17 ms) and unmasked (187 ms) faces (angry, happy, neutral, blank
   oval). When processing masked and unmasked angry faces, SMD patients
   exhibited increased activation in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and
   superior temporal gyrus relative to HV. When processing masked and
   unmasked happy faces, SMD patients showed decreased activation in the
   insula, PHG and thalamus compared with HV. During masked face processing
   in general across emotions, youth with SMD showed greater ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation relative to HV. Perturbed
   activation in emotion processing areas (e.g. insula, PHG, superior
   temporal gyrus and thalamus) manifests as hyper-sensitivity toward
   negative emotions and hypo-sensitivity toward positive emotions may be
   important in the etiology and maintenance of irritability, aggression
   and depressive symptoms in SMD. vmPFC dysfunction may mediate
   over-reactivity to face emotions associated with irritability.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated cognitive and affective Theory of Mind (ToM) and empathy

   relationship between ToM performance and executive skills was also
   examined. Sixteen preclinical and 23 clinical HD patients, and 39
   healthy subjects divided into 2 control groups were given a French
   adaptation of the Yoni test (Shamay-Tsoory, S.G., Aharon-Peretz, J.
   (2007). Dissociable prefrontal networks for cognitive and affective
   theory of mind: a lesion study. Neuropsychologia, 45(3), 3054-67) that
   examines first- and second-order cognitive and affective ToM processing
   in separate conditions with a physical control condition. Participants
   were also given questionnaires of empathy and cognitive tests which
   mainly assessed executive functions (inhibition and mental flexibility).
   Clinical HD patients made significantly more errors than their controls
   in the first- and second-order cognitive and affective ToM conditions of
   the Yoni task, but exhibited no empathy deficits. However, there was no
   evidence that ToM impairment was related to cognitive deficits in these
   patients. Preclinical HD patients were unimpaired in ToM tasks and
   empathy measures compared with their controls. Our results are
   consistent with the idea that impaired affective and cognitive
   mentalizing emerges with the clinical manifestation of HD, but is not
   necessarily part of the preclinical stage. Furthermore, these
   impairments appear independent of executive dysfunction and empathy.}},

Abstract = {{During the transformative period of adolescence, social influence plays
   a prominent role in shaping young people's emerging social identities,
   and can impact their propensity to engage in prosocial or risky
   behaviors. In this study, we examine the neural correlates of social
   influence from both parents and peers, two important sources of
   influence. Nineteen adolescents (age 16-18 years) completed a social
   influence task during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   scan. Social influence from both sources evoked activity in brain
   regions implicated in mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex, left
   temporoparietal junction, right temporoparietal junction), reward
   (ventromedial prefrontal cortex), and self-control (right ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex). These results suggest that mental state reasoning,
   social reward and self-control processes may help adolescents to
   evaluate others' perspectives and overcome the prepotent force of their
   own antecedent attitudes to shift their attitudes toward those of
   others. Findings suggest common neural networks involved in social
   influence from both parents and peers.}},

Abstract = {{Inner speech has been implicated in important aspects of normal and
   atypical cognition, including the development of auditory
   hallucinations. Studies to date have focused on covert speech elicited
   by simple word or sentence repetition, while ignoring richer and
   arguably more psychologically significant varieties of inner speech.
   This study compared neural activation for inner speech involving
   conversations ('dialogic inner speech') with single-speaker scenarios
   ('monologic inner speech'). Inner speech-related activation differences
   were then compared with activations relating to Theory-of-Mind (ToM)
   reasoning and visual perspective-taking in a conjunction design.
   Generation of dialogic (compared with monologic) scenarios was
   associated with a widespread bilateral network including left and right
   superior temporal gyri, precuneus, posterior cingulate and left inferior
   and medial frontal gyri. Activation associated with dialogic scenarios
   and ToM reasoning overlapped in areas of right posterior temporal cortex
   previously linked to mental state representation. Implications for
   understanding verbal cognition in typical and atypical populations are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity to accurately infer the thoughts and intentions of other
   people is critical for effective social interaction, and neural activity
   in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) has long been linked with the
   extent to which people engage in mental state attribution. In this
   study, we combined functional neuroimaging and experience sampling
   methodologies to test the predictive value of this neural response for
   daily social behaviors. We found that individuals who displayed greater
   activity in dmPFC when viewing social scenes spent more time around
   other people on a daily basis. These findings suggest a specific role
   for the neural mechanisms that support the capacity to mentalize in
   guiding individuals toward situations containing valuable social
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{In a dynamically changing social environment, humans have to face the
   challenge of prioritizing stimuli that compete for attention. In the
   context of social communication, the voice is the most important sound
   category. However, the existing studies do not directly address whether
   and how the salience of an unexpected vocal change in an auditory
   sequence influences the orientation of attention. In this study,
   frequent tones were interspersed with task-relevant infrequent tones and
   task-irrelevant infrequent vocal sounds (neutral, happy and angry
   vocalizations). Eighteen healthy college students were asked to count
   infrequent tones. A combined event-related potential (ERP) and EEG
   time-frequency approach was used, with the focus on the P3 component and
   on the early auditory evoked gamma band response, respectively. A
   spatial-temporal principal component analysis was used to disentangle
   potentially overlapping ERP components. Although no condition
   differences were observed in the 210-310 ms window, larger positive
   responses were observed for emotional than neutral vocalizations in the
   310-410 ms window. Furthermore, the phase synchronization of the early
   auditory evoked gamma oscillation was enhanced for happy vocalizations.
   These findings support the idea that the brain prioritizes the
   processing of emotional stimuli, by devoting more attentional resources
   to salient social signals even when they are not task-relevant.}},

Abstract = {{Communication between the amygdala and other brain regions critically
   regulates sensitivity to threat, which has been associated with risk for
   mood and affective disorders. The extent to which these neural pathways
   are genetically determined or correlate with risk-related personality
   measures is not fully understood. Using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we evaluated independent and interactive effects of the
   5-HTTLPR genotype and neuroticism on amygdala functional connectivity
   during an emotional faces paradigm in 76 healthy individuals. Functional
   connectivity between left amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
   and between both amygdalae and a cluster including posterior cingulate
   cortex, precuneus and visual cortex was significantly increased in
   5-HTTLPR S' allele carriers relative to LALA individuals. Neuroticism
   was negatively correlated with functional connectivity between right
   amygdala and mPFC and visual cortex, and between both amygdalae and left
   lateral orbitofrontal (lOFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   (vlPFC). Notably, 5-HTTLPR moderated the association between neuroticism
   and functional connectivity between both amygdalae and left lOFC/vlPFC,
   such that S' carriers exhibited a more negative association relative to
   LALA individuals. These findings provide novel evidence for both
   independent and interactive effects of 5-HTTLPR genotype and neuroticism
   on amygdala communication, which may mediate effects on risk for mood
   and affective disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion and cognition are dynamically coupled to bodily arousal: the
   induction of anger, even unconsciously, can reprioritise neural and
   physiological resources toward action states that bias cognitive
   processes. Here we examine behavioural, neural and bodily effects of
   covert anger processing and its influence on cognition, indexed by
   lexical decision-making. While recording beat-to-beat blood pressure,
   the words ANGER or RELAX were presented subliminally just prior to rapid
   word/non-word reaction-time judgements of letter-strings. Subliminal
   ANGER primes delayed the time taken to reach rapid lexical decisions,
   relative to RELAX primes. However, individuals with high trait anger
   were speeded up by subliminal anger primes. ANGER primes increased
   systolic blood pressure and the magnitude of this increase predicted
   reaction time prolongation. Within the brain, ANGER trials evoked an
   enhancement of activity within dorsal pons and an attenuation of
   activity within visual occipitotemporal and attentional parietal
   cortices. Activity within periaqueductal grey matter, occipital and
   parietal regions increased linearly with evoked blood pressure changes,
   indicating neural substrates through which covert anger impairs semantic
   decisions, putatively through its expression as visceral arousal. The
   behavioural and physiological impact of anger states compromises the
   efficiency of cognitive processing through action-ready changes in
   autonomic response that skew regional neural activity.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies on trait inference demonstrated that the ventral
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) houses neural representations of memory
   codes for traits . In this study, we investigate the neural code not
   only of traits, but also of persons who exemplify these traits. We used
   repetition suppression, which is a rapid suppression of the neuroimaging
   signal upon repeated presentation of the same stimulus or core stimulus
   characteristics-in this case, the implied trait and person. Participants
   inferred familiar person's traits. At each trial, a critical (target)
   sentence described a behavior that implied a trait, and was preceded by
   a (prime) sentence that implied the same trait and portrayed the same
   person, the same trait but portrayed a different person or did not imply
   a trait and portrayed a different person. As predicted, we found partly
   overlapping repetition suppression areas in the ventral mPFC when
   persons and traits were repeated, indicating that not only traits but
   also familiar persons have a neural code in the ventral mPFC. We also
   found a negative correlation between activation when reading about a new
   person and participants' social network size, indicating that experience
   with larger social groups results in less recruitment of a person code.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a time of increased risk for the onset of psychological
   disorders associated with deficits in face emotion labeling. We used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine age-related
   differences in brain activation while adolescents and adults labeled the
   emotion on fearful, happy and angry faces of varying intensities {[}0\%
   (i.e. neutral), 50\%, 75\%, 100\%]. Adolescents and adults did not
   differ on accuracy to label emotions. In the superior temporal sulcus,
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and middle temporal gyrus, adults show
   an inverted-U-shaped response to increasing intensities of fearful faces
   and a U-shaped response to increasing intensities of happy faces,
   whereas adolescents show the opposite patterns. In addition, adults, but
   not adolescents, show greater inferior occipital gyrus activation to
   negative (angry, fearful) vs positive (happy) emotions. In sum, when
   subjects classify subtly varying facial emotions, developmental
   differences manifest in several `ventral stream' brain regions. Charting
   the typical developmental course of the brain mechanisms of
   socioemotional processes, such as facial emotion labeling, is an
   important focus for developmental psychopathology research.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging studies of mindfulness training (MT) modulate anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula among other brain regions, which are
   important for attentional control, emotional regulation and
   interoception. Inspiratory breathing load (IBL) is an experimental
   approach to examine how an individual responds to an aversive stimulus.
   Military personnel are at increased risk for cognitive, emotional and
   physiological compromise as a consequence of prolonged exposure to
   stressful environments and, therefore, may benefit from MT. This study
   investigated whether MT modulates neural processing of interoceptive
   distress in infantry marines scheduled to undergo pre-deployment
   training and deployment to Afghanistan. Marines were divided into two
   groups: individuals who received training as usual (control) and
   individuals who received an additional 20-h mindfulness-based mind
   fitness training (MMFT). All subjects completed an IBL task during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and post-MMFT
   training. Marines who underwent MMFT relative to controls demonstrated a
   significant attenuation of right anterior insula and ACC during the
   experience of loaded breathing. These results support the hypothesis
   that MT changes brain activation such that individuals process more
   effectively an aversive interoceptive stimulus. Thus, MT may serve as a
   training technique to modulate the brain's response to negative
   interoceptive stimuli, which may help to improve resilience.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the effect of lateralized left-right resting brain
   activity on prefrontal cortical responsiveness to emotional cues and on
   the explicit appraisal (stimulus evaluation) of emotions based on their
   valence. Indeed subjective responses to different emotional stimuli
   should be predicted by brain resting activity and should be lateralized
   and valence-related (positive vs negative valence). A hemodynamic
   measure was considered (functional near-infrared spectroscopy). Indeed
   hemodynamic resting activity and brain response to emotional cues were
   registered when subjects (N = 19) viewed emotional positive vs negative
   stimuli (IAPS). Lateralized index response during resting state, LI
   (lateralized index) during emotional processing and self-assessment
   manikin rating were considered. Regression analysis showed the
   significant predictive effect of resting activity (more left or right
   lateralized) on both brain response and appraisal of emotional cues
   based on stimuli valence. Moreover, significant effects were found as a
   function of valence (more right response to negative stimuli; more left
   response to positive stimuli) during emotion processing. Therefore,
   resting state may be considered a predictive marker of the successive
   cortical responsiveness to emotions. The significance of resting
   condition for emotional behavior was discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Although the amygdala is often directly linked with fear and emotion,
   amygdala neurons are activated by a wide variety of emotional and
   non-emotional stimuli. Different subregions within the amygdala may be
   engaged preferentially by different aspects of emotional and
   non-emotional tasks. To test this hypothesis, we measured and compared
   the effects of novelty and fear on amygdala activity. We used
   high-resolution blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging and
   streamline tractography to subdivide the amygdala into three distinct
   functional subunits. We identified a laterobasal subregion connected
   with the visual cortex that responds generally to visual stimuli, a
   non-projecting region that responds to salient visual stimuli, and a
   centromedial subregion connected with the diencephalon that responds
   only when a visual stimulus predicts an aversive outcome. We provide
   anatomical and functional support for a model of amygdala function where
   information enters through the laterobasal subregion, is processed by
   intrinsic circuits in the interspersed tissue, and is then passed to the
   centromedial subregion, where activation leads to behavioral output.}},

Abstract = {{The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), a neurophysiological
   marker of attentional resource allocation with its generators in early
   visual cortex, exhibits enhanced amplitude for emotional compared to
   neutral complex pictures. Emotional cue extraction for complex images is
   linked to the N1-EPN complex with a peak latency of similar to 140-160
   ms. We tested whether neural facilitation in early visual cortex with
   affective pictures requires emotional cue extraction of individual
   images, even when a stream of images of the same valence category is
   presented. Images were shown at either 6 Hz (167 ms, allowing for
   extraction) or 15 Hz (67 ms per image, causing disruption of processing
   by the following image). Results showed SSVEP amplitude enhancement for
   emotional compared to neutral images at a presentation rate of 6 Hz but
   no differences at 15 Hz. This was not due to featural differences
   between the two valence categories. Results strongly suggest that
   individual images need to be displayed for sufficient time allowing for
   emotional cue extraction to drive affective neural modulation in early
   visual cortex.}},

Abstract = {{Shyness is a fundamental trait associated with social-emotional
   maladaptive behaviors, including many forms of psychopathology.
   Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that hyper-responsivity to social
   and emotional stimuli occurs in the frontal cortex and limbic system in
   shy individuals, but the relationship between shyness and brain-wide
   functional connectivity remains incompletely understood. Using
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we addressed this
   issue by exploring the relationship between regional functional
   connectivity strength (rFCS) and scores of shyness in a cohort of 61
   healthy young adults and controlling for the effects of social and trait
   anxiety scores. We observed that the rFCS of the insula positively
   correlated with shyness scores regardless of sex. Furthermore, we found
   that there were significant sex-by-shyness interactions in the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex and insula (two core nodes of the salience
   network) as well as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex: the rFCS
   values of these regions positively correlated with shyness scores in
   females but negatively correlated in males. Taken together, we provide
   evidence for intrinsic functional connectivity differences in
   individuals with different degrees of shyness and that these differences
   are sex-dependent. These findings might have important implications on
   the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying emotional and
   cognitive processing associated with shyness.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive reappraisal recruits prefrontal and parietal cortical areas.
   Because of the near exclusive usage in past research of visual stimuli
   to elicit emotions, it is unknown whether the same neural substrates
   underlie the reappraisal of emotions induced through other sensory
   modalities. Here, participants reappraised their emotions in order to
   increase or decrease their emotional response to angry prosody, or
   maintained their attention to it in a control condition. Neural activity
   was monitored with fMRI, and connectivity was investigated by using
   psychophysiological interaction analyses. A right-sided network
   encompassing the superior temporal gyrus, the superior temporal sulcus
   and the inferior frontal gyrus was found to underlie the processing of
   angry prosody. During reappraisal to increase emotional response, the
   left superior frontal gyrus showed increased activity and became
   functionally coupled to right auditory cortices. During reappraisal to
   decrease emotional response, a network that included the medial frontal
   gyrus and posterior parietal areas showed increased activation and
   greater functional connectivity with bilateral auditory regions.
   Activations pertaining to this network were more extended on the right
   side of the brain. Although directionality cannot be inferred from PPI
   analyses, the findings suggest a similar frontoparietal network for the
   reappraisal of visually and auditorily induced negative emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretically, normal developmental variation in amygdala volumes may be
   altered under conditions of severe stress. The purpose of this article
   was to examine whether posttraumatic stress moderates the association
   between age and amygdala volumes in youth exposed to traumatic events
   who are experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Volumetric imaging was conducted on two groups of youth aged 9-17 years:
   28 with exposure to trauma and PTSD symptoms (boys = 15, girls = 13) and
   26 matched (age, IQ) comparison youth (Controls; boys = 12, girls = 14).
   There was a significant group by age interaction in predicting right
   amygdala volumes. A positive association between age and right amygdala
   volumes was observed, but only in PTSD youth. These associations with
   age remained when controlling for IQ, total brain volumes and sex.
   Moreover, older youth with PTSD symptoms had relatively larger right
   amygdala volumes than controls. Findings provide evidence that severe
   stress may influence age-related variation in amygdala volumes. Results
   further highlight the importance of utilizing age as an interactive
   variable in pediatric neuroimaging research, in so far as age may act as
   an important moderator of group differences.}},

Abstract = {{Social pain after exclusion by others activates brain regions also
   involved in physical pain. Here we evaluated whether monetary reward
   could compensate for the negative feeling of social pain in the brain.
   To address this question we used the unique technique of intracranial
   electroencephalography in subjects with drug resistant epilepsy.
   Specifically, we recorded theta activity from intracranial electrodes
   implanted in the insular cortex while subjects experienced conditions of
   social inclusion and exclusion associated with monetary gain and loss.
   Our study confirmed that theta rhythm in the insular cortex is the
   neural signature of social exclusion. We found that while monetary gain
   suppresses the effect of social pain in the anterior insula, there is no
   such effect in the posterior insula. These results imply that the
   anterior insula can use secondary reward signals to compensate for the
   negative feeling of social pain. Hence, here we propose that the
   anterior insula plays a pivotal role in integrating contingencies to
   update social pain feelings. Finally, the possibility to modulate the
   theta rhythm through the reward system might open new avenues of
   research for treating pathologies related to social exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in the capacity to
   accurately recognise facial expressions. The aim of the current study
   was to determine if anodal transcranial direct current stimulation
   (tDCS) targeting the right OFC in healthy adults would enhance facial
   expression recognition, compared with a sham condition. Across two
   counterbalanced sessions of tDCS (i.e. anodal and sham), 20
   undergraduate participants (18 female) completed a facial expression
   labelling task comprising angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, sad and
   neutral expressions, and a control (social judgement) task comprising
   the same expressions. Responses on the labelling task were scored for
   accuracy, median reaction time and overall efficiency (i.e. combined
   accuracy and reaction time). Anodal tDCS targeting the right OFC
   enhanced facial expression recognition, reflected in greater efficiency
   and speed of recognition across emotions, relative to the sham
   condition. In contrast, there was no effect of tDCS to responses on the
   control task. This is the first study to demonstrate that anodal tDCS
   targeting the right OFC boosts facial expression recognition. This
   finding provides a solid foundation for future research to examine the
   efficacy of this technique as a means to treat facial expression
   recognition deficits, particularly in individuals with OFC damage or
   dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the extent to which personal semantic memory supports
   the self-concept in individuals with medial temporal lobe amnesia and
   healthy adults. Participants completed eight `I Am' self-statements. For
   each of the four highest ranked self-statements, participants completed
   an open-ended narrative task, during which they provided supporting
   information indicating why the I Am statement was considered
   self-descriptive. Participants then completed an episodic probe task,
   during which they attempted to retrieve six episodic memories for each
   of these self-statements. Supporting information was scored as episodic,
   personal semantic or general semantic. In the narrative task, personal
   semantic memory predominated as self-supporting information in both
   groups. The amnesic participants generated fewer personal semantic
   memories than controls to support their self-statements, a deficit that
   was more pronounced for trait relative to role self-statements. In the
   episodic probe task, the controls primarily generated unique event
   memories, but the amnesic participants did not. These findings
   demonstrate that personal semantic memory, in particular
   autobiographical fact knowledge, plays a critical role in supporting the
   self-concept, regardless of the accessibility of episodic memories, and
   they highlight potential differences in the way traits and roles are
   supported by personal memory.}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests psychopathy is associated with structural brain
   alterations that may contribute to the affective and interpersonal
   deficits frequently observed in individuals with high psychopathic
   traits. However, the regional alterations related to different
   components of psychopathy are still unclear. We used voxel-based
   morphometry to characterize the structural correlates of psychopathy in
   a sample of 35 healthy adults assessed with the Triarchic Psychopathy
   Measure. Furthermore, we examined the regional grey matter alterations
   associated with the components described by the triarchic model. Our
   results showed that, after accounting for variation in total
   intracranial volume, age and IQ, overall psychopathy was negatively
   associated with grey matter volume in the left putamen and amygdala.
   Additional regression analysis with anatomical regions of interests
   revealed total triPM score was also associated with increased lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and caudate volume. Boldness was positively
   associated with volume in the right insula. Meanness was positively
   associated with lateral OFC and striatum volume, and negatively
   associated with amygdala volume. Finally, disinhibition was negatively
   associated with amygdala volume. Results highlight the contribution of
   both subcortical and cortical brain alterations for subclinical
   psychopathy and are discussed in light of prior research and theoretical
   accounts about the neurobiological bases of psychopathic traits.}},

Abstract = {{To study emotional reactions to music, it is important to consider the
   temporal dynamics of both affective responses and underlying brain
   activity. Here, we investigated emotions induced by music using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a data-driven approach
   based on intersubject correlations (ISC). This method allowed us to
   identify moments in the music that produced similar brain activity (i.e.
   synchrony) among listeners under relatively natural listening
   conditions. Continuous ratings of subjective pleasantness and arousal
   elicited by the music were also obtained for the music outside of the
   scanner. Our results reveal synchronous activations in left amygdala,
   left insula and right caudate nucleus that were associated with higher
   arousal, whereas positive valence ratings correlated with decreases in
   amygdala and caudate activity. Additional analyses showed that
   synchronous amygdala responses were driven by energy-related features in
   the music such as root mean square and dissonance, while synchrony in
   insula was additionally sensitive to acoustic event density.
   Intersubject synchrony also occurred in the left nucleus accumbens, a
   region critically implicated in reward processing. Our study
   demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of an approach based on ISC
   to explore the temporal dynamics of music perception and emotion in
   naturalistic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Depletion imposes both need and desire to drink, and potentiates the
   response to need-relevant cues in the environment. The present fMRI
   study aimed to determine which neural structures selectively increase
   the incentive value of need-relevant stimuli in a thirst state. Towards
   this end, participants were scanned twice-either in a thirst or
   no-thirst state-while viewing pictures of beverages and chairs. As
   expected, thirst led to a selective increase in self-reported
   pleasantness and arousal by beverages. Increased responses to beverage
   when compared with chair stimuli were observed in the cingulate cortex,
   insular cortex and the amygdala in the thirst state, which were absent
   in the no-thirst condition. Enhancing the incentive value of
   need-relevant cues in a thirst state is a key mechanism for motivating

Abstract = {{The neuropeptide S (NPS) and its receptor NPSR have captured attention
   in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. Here, a functional
   polymorphism in the NPSR1 gene has been linked to deviant cortico-limbic
   interactions in response to negative stimuli. While healthy T allele
   carriers exhibited increased amygdala and prefrontal cortex activity,
   panic disorder patients carrying the T risk allele displayed
   hypofrontality possibly reflecting insufficient prefrontal inhibition of
   limbic reactivity. In order to study multi-level effects of genotype and
   anxiety, prefrontal cortex activity during an emotional n-back task was
   measured in 66 volunteers genotyped for the NPSR1 rs324981 A/T variant
   (AA homozygotes vs. T allele carriers) by means of functional
   near-infrared spectroscopy. For a high working memory load (3-back), T
   allele carriers showed a signal increase to negative pictures in the
   dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex while AA homozygotes displayed
   a signal decrease. Since groups did not differ on skin conductance level
   and behavioral parameters, this effect in the risk group in line with
   results from fMRI studies is speculated to represent an adaptive
   mechanism to compensate for presumably increased subcortical activity
   driven by an overactive NPS system. However, anxiety sensitivity
   correlated negatively with prefrontal activity in T allele carriers
   possibly suggesting a decompensation of the adaptive compensatory
   upregulation.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the neural basis of individual variation in
   emotion regulation, specifically the ability to reappraise negative
   stimuli so as to down-regulate negative affect. Brain functions in young
   adults were measured with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging during
   three conditions: (i) attending to neutral pictures; (ii) attending to
   negative pictures and (iii) reappraising negative pictures.
   Resting-state functional connectivity was measured with amygdala and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) seed regions frequently
   associated with emotion regulation. Participants reported more negative
   affect after attending to negative than neutral pictures, and less
   negative affect following reappraisal. Both attending to negative vs
   neutral pictures and reappraising vs attending to negative pictures
   yielded widespread activations that were significantly right-lateralized
   for attending to negative pictures and left-lateralized for reappraising
   negative pictures. Across participants, more successful reappraisal
   correlated with less trait anxiety and more positive daily emotion,
   greater activation in medial and lateral prefrontal regions, and lesser
   resting-state functional connectivity between (a) right amygdala and
   both medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices, and (b)
   bilateral DLPFC and posterior visual cortices. The ability to regulate
   emotion, a source of resilience or of risk for distress, appears to vary
   in relation to differences in intrinsic functional brain architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Theory of mind (ToM) is the ability to interpret and understand human
   behaviour by representing the mental states of others. Like many human
   capacities, ToM is thought to develop through both complex biological
   and socialization mechanisms. However, no study has examined the joint
   effect of genetic and environmental influences on ToM. This study
   examined how variability in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and
   parenting behaviour-two widely studied factors in ToM
   development-interacted to predict ToM in pre-school-aged children.
   Participants were 301 children who were part of an ongoing longitudinal
   birth cohort study. ToM was assessed at age 4.5 using a previously
   validated scale. Parenting was assessed through observations of mothers'
   cognitively sensitive behaviours. Using a family-based association
   design, it was suggestive that a particular variant (rs11131149)
   interacted with maternal cognitive sensitivity on children's ToM (P =
   0.019). More copies of the major allele were associated with higher ToM
   as a function of increasing cognitive sensitivity. A sizeable 26\% of
   the variability in ToM was accounted for by this interaction. This study
   provides the first empirical evidence of gene-environment interactions
   on ToM, supporting the notion that genetic factors may be modulated by
   potent environmental influences early in development.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies indicate that mindfulness meditation training
   interventions reduce stress and improve stress-related health outcomes,
   but the neural pathways for these effects are unknown. The present
   research evaluates whether mindfulness meditation training alters
   resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the amygdala, a region
   known to coordinate stress processing and physiological stress
   responses. We show in an initial discovery study that higher perceived
   stress over the past month is associated with greater bilateral
   amygdala-subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) rsFC in a sample of
   community adults (n = 130). A follow-up, single-blind randomized
   controlled trial shows that a 3-day intensive mindfulness meditation
   training intervention (relative to a well-matched 3-day relaxation
   training intervention without a mindfulness component) reduced right
   amygdala-sgACC rsFC in a sample of stressed unemployed community adults
   (n = 35). Although stress may increase amygdala-sgACC rsFC, brief
   training in mindfulness meditation could reverse these effects. This
   work provides an initial indication that mindfulness meditation training
   promotes functional neuroplastic changes, suggesting an amygdala-sgACC
   pathway for stress reduction effects.}},

Abstract = {{Delay of gratification (DG) is the ability to forgo immediate
   temptations in the service of obtaining larger, delayed rewards. An
   extensive body of behavioral research has revealed that DG ability in

   this ability. In this study, we conducted a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging study to identify the neural underpinnings of
   individual differences in DG among children. We observed a relationship
   between behavior during the classic DG task, a well-studied and
   ecologically valid measure, and functional connectivity during a
   modified version of this task in the scanner. Specifically, greater
   attentional focus away from temptations was associated with stronger
   functional coupling between the nucleus accumbens, a brain region that
   supports approach behavior, and several regions within prefrontal and
   parietal cortex that support self-control. These results shed light on
   the network interactions that contribute to DG and that account for
   individual differences in this capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The present experiment monitored bilateral eyelid responses during
   eyeblink conditioning in rats trained with a unilateral unconditioned
   stimulus (US). Three groups of rats were used to determine if
   cross-modal savings occurs when the location of the US is switched from
   one eye to the other. Rats in each group first received paired or
   unpaired eyeblink conditioning with a conditioned stimulus (tone or
   light; conditional stimulus {[}CS]) and a unilateral periorbital
   electrical stimulation US. All rats were subsequently given paired
   training, but with the US location (Group 1), CS modality (Group 2), or
   US location and CS modality (Group 3) changed. Changing the location of
   the US alone resulted in an immediate transfer of responding in both
   eyelids (Group 1) in rats that received paired training before the
   transfer session. Rats in Groups 2 and 3 that initially received paired
   training showed facilitated learning to the new CS modality during the
   transfer sessions, indicating that cross-modal savings occurs whether or
   not the location of the US is changed. All rats that were initially
   given unpaired training acquired conditioned eyeblink responses similar
   to de novo acquisition rate during the transfer sessions. Savings of CR
   incidence was more robust than savings of CR amplitude when the US
   switched sides, a finding that has implications for elucidating the
   neural mechanisms of cross-modal savings.}},

Abstract = {{The opioid receptor system is well known for its relationship to painful
   stimuli but has also been discovered to have a role in acquisition and
   consolidation of associative memories. Most opioid receptor specific
   studies have focused on, and attributed these findings to, modulation of
   the mu-opioid receptor (MOR); however, some studies have suggested that
   the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) also plays in role in memory modulation.
   The following study set out to determine KOR involvement in acquisition
   for forebrain-dependent associations. Using the forebrain-dependent
   associative task whisker-trace eyeblink conditioning (WTEB), the current
   study demonstrated that KOR inhibition via NorBNI (10 mg/kg)
   significantly delayed acquisition. To explore the brain region mediating
   these NorBNI-induced learning impairments, subsequent experiments
   focused on primary somatosensory cortex (S1). S1 plays a pivotal role in
   the acquisition of WTEB with lesions either before or after conditioning
   inhibiting acquisition or retrieval respectively. NorBNI (10 mu g or 20
   mu g) in S1 was found to significantly delay acquisition, similar to
   that observed following systemic injections. In support of these
   findings, studies have suggested a role for dynorphin (KOR's endogenous
   ligand) expressing GABAergic interneurons in cortical processing of
   whisker information. Although, additional studies will be required to
   determine the specific mechanism for KOR and these GABAergic
   interneurons; these findings strongly support previous studies
   suggesting KOR involvement in learning mechanisms, while elucidating an
   unexplored neocortical learning mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Patients suffering from major depression often experience memory
   deficits even after the remission of mood symptoms, and many
   antidepressant drugs do not affect, or impair, memory in animals and
   humans. However, some antidepressant drugs, after a single dose, enhance
   cognition in humans (Harmer et al., 2009). To compare different classes
   of antidepressant drugs for their potential as memory enhancers, we used
   a version of the novel object recognition task in which rats
   spontaneously forget objects 24 hr after their presentation.
   Antidepressant drugs were injected systemically 30 min before or
   directly after the training phase (Session 1 {[}S1]). Post-S1 injections
   were used to test for specific memory-consolidation effects. The
   noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors reboxetine and atomoxetine, as well as
   the serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor duloxetine, injected
   prior to S1 significantly enhanced recognition memory. In contrast, the
   serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram and paroxetine and the cyclic
   antidepressant drugs desipramine and mianserin did not enhance
   recognition memory. Post-S1 injection of either reboxetine or citalopram
   significantly enhanced recognition memory, indicating an effect on
   memory consolidation. The fact that citalopram had an effect only when
   injected after S1 suggests that it may counteract its own

   However, pretreatment with citalopram did not attenuate reboxetine's
   memory-enhancing effect. The D1/5-receptor antagonist SCH23390 blunted
   reboxetine's memory-enhancing effect, indicating a role of dopaminergic
   transmission in reboxetine-induced recognition memory enhancement. Our

Abstract = {{The head direction system is composed of neurons found in a number of
   connected brain areas that fire in a sharply tuned, directional way. The
   function of this system, however, has not been fully established. To
   assess this, we devised a novel spatial landmark task, comparable to the
   paradigms in which stimulus control has been assessed for spatially
   tuned neurons. The task took place in a large cylinder and required rats
   to dig in a specific sand cup, from among 16 alternatives, to obtain a
   food reward. The reinforced cup was in a fixed location relative to a
   salient landmark, and probe sessions confirmed that the landmark exerted
   stimulus control over the rats' cup choices. To assess the contribution
   of the head direction cell system to this memory task, half of the
   animals received ibotenic acid infusions into the lateral mammillary
   nuclei (LMN), an essential node in the head direction network, while the
   other received sham lesions. No differences were observed in performance
   of this task between the 2 groups. Animals with LMN lesions were
   impaired, however, in reversal learning on a water maze task. These
   results suggest that the LMN, and potentially the head direction cell
   system, are not essential for the use of visual landmarks to guide
   spatial behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Posttraining intracranial self-stimulation (SS) in the lateral
   hypothalamus facilitates the acquisition and retention of several
   implicit and explicit memory tasks. Here, intracellular injections of
   Lucifer yellow were used to assess morphological changes in hippocampal
   neurons that might be specifically related to the facilitative
   posttraining SS effect upon the acquisition and retention of a
   distributed spatial task in the Morris water maze. We examined the
   structure, size and branching complexity of cornus ammonis 1 (CA1)
   cells, and the spine density of CA1 pyramidal neurons and granular cells
   of the dentate gyrus (DG). Animals that received SS after each
   acquisition session performed faster and better than Sham ones-an
   improvement that was also evident in a probe trial 3 days after the last
   training session. The neuromorphological analysis revealed an increment
   in the size and branching complexity in apical CA1 dendritic
   arborization in SS-treated subjects as compared with Sham animals.
   Furthermore, increased spine density was observed in the CA1 field in SS
   animals, whereas no effects were observed in DG cells. Our results
   support the hypothesis that the facilitating effect of SS on the
   acquisition and retention of a spatial memory task could be related to
   structural plasticity in CA1 hippocampal cells.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic epidemiological studies support a role for CNTNAP2 in
   developmental language disorders such as autism spectrum disorder,
   specific language impairment, and dyslexia. Atypical language
   development and function represent a core symptom of autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD), with evidence suggesting that aberrant auditory
   processing-including impaired spectrotemporal processing and enhanced
   pitch perception-may both contribute to an anomalous language phenotype.
   Investigation of gene-brainbehavior relationships in social and
   repetitive ASD symptomatology have benefited from experimentation on the
   Cntnap2 knockout (KO) mouse. However, auditory-processing behavior and
   effects on neural structures within the central auditory pathway have
   not been assessed in this model. Thus, this study examined whether
   auditory-processing abnormalities were associated with mutation of the
   Cntnap2 gene in mice. Cntnap2 KO mice were assessed on
   auditory-processing tasks including silent gap detection, embedded tone
   detection, and pitch discrimination. Cntnap2 knockout mice showed
   deficits in silent gap detection but a surprising superiority in
   pitch-related discrimination as compared with controls. Stereological
   analysis revealed a reduction in the number and density of neurons, as
   well as a shift in neuronal size distribution toward smaller neurons, in
   the medial geniculate nucleus of mutant mice. These findings are
   consistent with a central role for CNTNAP2 in the ontogeny and function
   of neural systems subserving auditory processing and suggest that
   developmental disruption of these neural systems could}},

Abstract = {{Drug overdose now exceeds car accidents as the leading cause of
   accidental death in the United States. Of those drug overdoses, a large
   percentage of the deaths are due to heroin and/or pharmaceutical
   overdose, specifically misuse of prescription opioid analgesics. It is
   imperative, then, that we understand the mechanisms that lead to opioid
   abuse and addiction. The rewarding actions of opioids are mediated
   largely by the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), and signaling by this receptor
   is modulated by various interacting proteins. The neurotransmitter
   dopamine also contributes to opioid reward, and opioid addiction has
   been linked to reduced expression of dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) in the
   brain. That said, it is not known if alterations in the expression of
   these proteins relate to drug exposure and/or to the
   ``addiction-like{''} behavior exhibited for the drug. Here, we held
   total drug self-administration constant across acquisition and showed
   that reduced expression of the D2R and the MOR interacting protein,
   Wntless, in the medial prefrontal cortex was associated with greater
   addiction-like behavior for heroin in general and with a greater
   willingness to work for the drug in particular. In contrast, reduced
   expression of the D2R in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus was
   correlated with greater seeking during signaled nonavailability of the
   drug. Taken together, these data link reduced expression of both the D2R
   and Wntless to the explicit motivation for the drug rather than to
   differences in total drug intake per se.}},

Abstract = {{Prenatal alcohol treatment (PA) produces a decrease in dopaminergic
   neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area, an alteration that is
   alleviated with methylphenidate treatment. Evidence exists that PA also
   produces hyperactivity, inattention and enhanced impulsivity, behavioral
   alterations that have been related to dopaminergic and noradrenergic
   functions. The purpose of this work was to study the effects of
   methylphenidate and atomoxetine on impulsivity and motor activity in
   preadolescent male rats prenatally exposed to alcohol. Pregnant Wistar
   rats were exposed to either alcohol or an isocaloric solution from Days
   8 to 20 of gestation. Starting at 24 postnatal days, male offspring were
   tested for motor activity and trained in a delay-discounting task for
   impulsivity assessment before, and during, treatment with either 3 mg/kg
   i.p. of methylphenidate, 2 mg/ kg i.p. of atomoxetine, or saline i.p.
   The group prenatally exposed to alcohol showed higher motor activity and
   more frequent choices of immediate, but small, rewards than the control
   group; a finding indicative of higher impulsivity. Atomoxetine reduced
   both motor activity and impulsivity. In contrast, methylphenidate had
   only a mild effect on impulsivity. Results suggest an important
   participation of noradrenergic transmission in cognitive impulsivity and
   hyperactivity in preadolescent rats with previous alterations in these
   behaviors. Dopaminergic participation in these behaviors is partially
   supported by the present findings on the basis of the effects of
   methylphenidate.}},

Abstract = {{The neurexins are a family of presynaptic cell adhesion molecules. Human
   genetic studies have found heterozygous deletions affecting NRXN1 and
   NRXN2, encoding alpha-neurexin I (Nrxn1 alpha) and alpha-neurexin II
   (Nrxn2 alpha), in individuals with autism spectrum disorders and
   schizophrenia. However, the link between alpha-neurexin deficiency and
   the manifestation of psychiatric disorders remain unclear. To assess
   whether the heterozygous loss of neurexins results in behaviors relevant
   to autism or schizophrenia, we used mice with heterozygous (HET)
   deletion of Nrxn1 alpha or Nrxn2 alpha. We found that in a test of
   social approach, Nrxn1 alpha HET mice show no social memory for familiar
   versus novel conspecifics. In a passive avoidance test, female Nrxn1
   alpha HET mice cross to the conditioned chamber sooner than female
   wild-type and Nrxn2 alpha HET mice. Nrxn2 alpha HET mice also express a

Abstract = {{In some conditions, female sexual behavior in ovariectomized rats can be
   induced by continuous exposure of estradiol (E-2) alone or by a single
   injection of a high dose of the long-lasting, esterified estradiol
   benzoate (EB). However, there are inconsistencies in the literature on
   the role of estrogens during priming or in the facilitation on female
   sexual behavior in EB-primed rats, as well as the cellular mechanisms
   involved. Either subcutaneous (sc) or intracerebral (icv) administration
   of some doses of free unesterified E-2, induced lordosis in EB-primed
   rats. Either sc or icv injection of E-2, immediately prior to testing,
   induced high levels of sexual receptivity when the female rats were
   primed with an EB sc injection of 2 mu g EB. The roles of progesterone
   receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor on lordosis induced by sc or icv
   administration of E-2 were explored. Tamoxifen or RU486 administrated sc
   or icv; each reduced lordosis induced by E-2. Similarly, antisense
   oligonucleotides directed at PR-B or total PR (PR-A + PR-B)
   administrated icv immediately before EB injection inhibited lordosis
   induced by daily injections of EB. These results suggest that lordosis
   facilitated by free E-2 is dependent on priming dose of EB. Furthermore
   both ERs and PRs are involved in this action of E-2.}},

Abstract = {{The estradiol (E-2), estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha), testosterone
   (T), and androgen receptor (AR) can contribute to anxiety, but whether
   they are associated with the reversion of prenatal adverse outcomes
   remains unclear. Here, we tested the interactive effects of prenatal
   maternal restraint stress and early postnatal short-term maternal
   separation on adult male mandarin vole (Microtus mandarinus) behavior
   and changes in E-2, T, and their receptors. The results showed that PS
   adult males (PS/NH) exhibited an increase in anxiety-like behavior in
   open-field and elevated plus-maze tests than the other 3 groups,
   including adult male offspring controls (PC/NH), adult male offspring
   controls with short-term maternal separation (PC/H), and PS adult males
   with short-term maternal separation (PS/H). The increase in anxiety-like
   behavior was associated with significantly lower E-2 and T serum levels,
   had significantly more ER alpha immunoreactive neurons (ER alpha-IRs) in
   some brain regions, as well as significantly fewer AR immunoreactive
   neurons (AR-IRs) in some brain regions than the other 3 groups. We found
   it interesting that the PC/H and PS/H were similar to the PC/NH in that
   they did not produce anxiety-like behavior. However, early postnatal
   short-term maternal separation reversed prenatally induced changes in
   E-2 and T serum levels and altered ER alpha-IRs and AR-IRs in the brain.
   These data suggest that changes in anxious adults may be governed by
   early environmental factors and their interactions because changes in
   E-2 and T serum levels and the distribution of ER alpha and AR in the
   brain result in behavioral changes related to less anxiety into
   adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{Loss aversion is the tendency to overweight losses compared with gains
   in decision situations. Several studies have investigated the
   neurobiological background of this phenomenon and it was found that
   activation in the mesolimbic-mesocortical dopamine system during a
   gambling decision correlates with loss aversion. In a behavioral
   experiment with N = 143 subjects, the present study investigates the
   influence of 2 functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the BDNF
   gene (BDNF Val66Met polymorphism) and ANKK1 gene (DRD2 Taq1a/ANKK1
   polymorphism), that are known to affect the dopamine system, on loss
   aversion. Additionally, associations of alexithymia, a personality
   construct describing the disability to consciously experience emotions
   in the self, with loss aversion and with the mentioned polymorphisms
   were assessed using the TAS-20 questionnaire, to replicate associations
   that have been reported before. Results revealed a significant
   interaction effect of the 2 polymorphisms on loss aversion. Carriers of
   the genetic constellation 66Met+/A1+ had the lowest loss aversion
   scores, compared with all other allelic groups. According to the
   literature this allelic configuration is characterized by a relatively
   low D2/3 receptor binding in the striatum and an impaired
   activity-dependent secretion of BDNF. This is the first study showing
   that loss aversion is related to naturally occurring differences in
   dopamine function.}},

Abstract = {{The present study explored the role of the amygdala in mediating a
   unique pattern of feeding behavior driven by intra-accumbens (intra-Acb)
   opioid activation in the rat. Temporary inactivation of the basolateral
   amygdala (BLA), via GABAA agonist muscimol administration prevents
   increased consumption following intra-Acb opioid administration of the
   selective mu-opioid agonist D-Ala2, NMe-Phe4, Glyol5-enkephalin (DAMGO),
   yet leaves food approach behaviors intact, particularly after
   consumption has ended. One interpretation is that inactivation of the
   BLA selectively blocks neural activity underlying DAMGO-driven
   consummatory (consumption) but not appetitive (approach) behaviors. The
   present experiments take advantage of this temporal dissociation of
   consumption and approach behaviors to investigate their associated
   neural activity. Following either intra-Acb saline or DAMGO
   administration, with or without BLA muscimol administration, rats were
   given 2-hr access to a limited amount of high-fat diet. Immediately
   following the feeding session, rats were sacrificed and brains assayed
   for neural activity patterns across critical brain regions known to
   regulate both appetitive and consummatory feeding behaviors. The results
   show that intra-Acb DAMGO administration increased c-Fos activation in
   orexin neurons within the perifornical area of the hypothalamus and that
   this increase in activation is blocked by BLA muscimol inactivation.
   Intra-Acb DAMGO administration significantly increased c-Fos activation
   within dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, compared to
   saline controls, and BLA inactivation had no effect on this increase.
   Overall, these data provide underlying circuitry that may mediate the
   selective influence of the BLA on driving consummatory, but not
   appetitive, feeding behaviors in a model of hedonically driven feeding
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive impairment is a prominent feature in a range of different
   movement disorders. Children with Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood
   are prone to developmental delay, with deficits in cognitive functioning
   becoming progressively more evident as they grow older. Heterozygous
   mutations of the ATP1A3 gene, encoding the Na+,K+-ATPase alpha 3
   subunit, have been identified as the primary cause of Alternating
   Hemiplegia. Heterozygous Myshkin mice have an amino acid change (I810N)
   in Na+,K+-ATPase alpha 3 that is also found in Alternating Hemiplegia.
   To investigate whether Myshkin mice exhibit learning and memory deficits
   resembling the cognitive impairments of patients with Alternating
   Hemiplegia, we subjected them to a range of behavioral tests that
   interrogate various cognitive domains. Myshkin mice showed impairments
   in spatial memory, spatial habituation, locomotor habituation, object
   recognition, social recognition, and trace fear conditioning, as well as
   in the visible platform version of the Morris water maze. Increasing the
   duration of training ameliorated the deficit in social recognition but
   not in spatial habituation. The deficits of Myshkin mice in all of the
   learning and memory tests used are consistent with the cognitive
   impairment of the vast majority of AHC patients. These mice could thus
   help advance our understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms
   influencing cognitive impairment in patients with ATP1A3-related
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Prosocial behavior plays an important role in establishing and
   maintaining relationships with others and thus may have important
   developmental implications. This study examines the association between
   cortical thickness and prosocial behavior in a population-based sample
   of 6- to 9-year-old children. The present study was embedded within the
   Generation R Study. Magnetic resonance scans were acquired from 464
   children whose parents had completed the prosocial scale of the
   Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. To study the association
   between cortical thickness and prosocial behavior, we performed
   whole-brain surface-based analyses. Prosocial behavior was related to a
   thicker cortex in a cluster that covers part of the left superior
   frontal and rostral middle frontal cortex (p<.001). Gender moderated the
   association between prosocial behavior and cortical thickness in a
   cluster including the right rostral middle frontal and superior frontal
   cortex (p<.001) as well as in a cluster covering the right superior
   parietal cortex, cuneus, and precuneus (p<.001). Our results suggest
   that prosocial behavior is associated with cortical thickness in regions
   related to theory of mind (superior frontal cortex, rostral middle
   frontal cortex cuneus, and precuneus) and inhibitory control (superior
   frontal and rostral middle frontal cortex).}},

Abstract = {{Neurobiological studies on facial affect recognition have demonstrated
   reduced response amplitudes to anger cues in patients suffering from
   attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is still unclear
   whether a similar deficit exists in the auditory domain. Therefore, this
   near-infrared spectroscopy study focused on neuronal correlates of
   affective prosody processing. Fourteen boys suffering from ADHD and
   fourteen healthy boys were exposed to emotionally intoned, standardized
   sentences of the categories anger, sadness, happiness, and to
   affectively neutral sentences. Relative to controls, the patients
   displayed a diminished activation of the right superior temporal gyrus
   (STG) when processing anger prosody, which was correlated with
   aggressive behavior. There were no group differences for the other
   emotions. Additionally, the ADHD group showed increased supramarginal
   gyrus (SMG) activation in the anger condition. This might mirror
   compensatory attention allocation. In summary, we identified a
   selectively lowered STG activation to auditory anger cues in ADHD
   patients. Consequently, STG recruitment during anger exposure might be
   used for evaluation of psychotherapy effects.}},

Abstract = {{Social reorientation from parents to same-age peers is normative in
   adolescence, but the neural correlates of youths' socioemotional
   processing of parents and peers have not been explored. In the current
   study, 22 adolescents (average age 16.98) underwent neuroimaging
   (functional magnetic resonance imaging) while viewing and rating
   emotions shown in brief video clips featuring themselves, their parents,
   or an unfamiliar peer. Viewing self vs. other and parents vs. the peer
   activated regions in the medial prefrontal cortex, replicating prior
   findings that this area responds to self-relevant stimuli, including
   familiar and not just similar others. Viewing the peer compared with
   parents elicited activation in posterior mentalizing' structures, the
   precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), bilateral posterior
   superior temporal sulcus and right temporoparietal junction, as well as
   the ventral striatum and bilateral amygdala and hippocampus. Relative
   activations in the PCC and precuneus to the peer vs. the parent were
   related both to reported risk-taking behavior and to affiliations with
   more risk-taking peers. The results suggest neural correlates of the

Abstract = {{The lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) plays a critical role in inhibiting
   self-perspective information, which is necessary for theory of mind
   (ToM) processing. Additionally, previous research has indicated that
   negative emotions interfere with lPFC activation during executive tasks.
   In this study, we hypothesized that negative emotions would inhibit lPFC
   activation during a ToM task. While female participants performed the
   director task following the observation of emotionally laden movies
   (neutral/negative/positive), their prefrontal hemodynamic activity was
   measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. After viewing the neutral
   movie, bilateral lPFC activity was significantly enhanced during ToM
   process compared to the control condition. In contrast, after viewing
   the negative movie, left lPFC activity during ToM process was
   significantly impaired. These results were interpreted to support the
   idea that negative emotions interfere with inhibition of
   self-perspective information through inactivation of the lPFC.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Previous neuroeconomic studies have observed that people display
   sympathetic neural responses toward others' misfortunes. We argue that
   the reverse emotions, such as gloating or schadenfreude, may also emerge
   in certain circumstances. To examine this theory, we recorded
   feedback-related negativity (FRN) toward others' large or small gains or
   losses in a stock market context. We adopted the framework of social
   distance, according to which we hypothesized that because others in the
   stock market are far away, unidentified, and indistinct, people would
   show less sympathy or even schadenfreude toward others' large losses.
   The results indicated that FRN at Fz was significantly less negative
   when observing larger decreases in others' stock, indicating that
   others' large losses are not unexpected negative events in the stock
   market and suggesting the existence of schadenfreude. Our research
   contributes to the understanding of social neurofinance by demonstrating
   the schadenfreude effect in relation to the stock market. This study
   also provides new information regarding the relationship between FRN and
   the social emotions that form the expectations of gain and loss.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{624-634}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Conforming to the majority can be seen as a heuristic type of judgment,
   as it allows the individual to easily choose the most accurate or most
   socially acceptable type of behavior. People who process the currently
   to-be-judged items in a superficial, heuristic way should tend to
   conform to group judgment more than people processing these items in a
   systematic and elaborate way. We investigated this hypothesis using
   electroencephalography (EEG), analyzing whether the strength of neural
   encoding of faces was related to the tendency to adopt a group's
   evaluative judgments regarding these faces. As expected, we found that
   the amplitude of the N170, a specific neural correlate of face encoding,
   was inversely related to conformity across participants: The weaker the
   faces were encoded, the more the majority response regarding the faces'
   attractiveness was adopted instead of relying on the actual qualities of
   the faces. Applying neurophysiological methodology, we thus provide
   support for previous claims, based on behavioral data and theorizing,
   that social conformity is a heuristic type of judgment. We propose that
   weak encoding of judgment-relevant information is a typical, possibly
   even necessary, precursor of socially adjusted judgments, irrespective
   of one's current motivational goal (i.e., to be accurate or accepted).}},

Abstract = {{Gaze direction perception triggers rapid visuospatial orienting to the
   location observed by others. When this is congruent with the location of
   a target, reaction times are faster than when incongruent. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that the non-joint attention
   induced by incongruent cues are experienced as more emotionally negative
   and this could relate to less favorable trust judgments of the faces
   when gaze-cues are contingent with identity. Here, we provide further
   support for these findings using time-resolved event-related potentials.
   In addition to replicating the effects of identity-contingent gaze-cues
   on reaction times and trust judgments, we discovered that the
   emotion-related late positive potential increased across blocks to
   incongruent compared to congruent faces before, during and after the
   gaze-cue, suggesting both learning and retrieval of emotion states
   associated with the face. We also discovered that the
   face-recognition-related N250 component appeared to localize to sources
   in anterior temporal areas. Our findings provide unique
   electrophysiological evidence for the role of emotion in learning trust
   from gaze-cues, suggesting that the retrieval of face evaluations during
   interaction may take around 1000 ms and that the N250 originates from
   anterior temporal face patches.}},

Abstract = {{The current study examined blood oxygen level-dependent signal

   shoot responses when the picture showed armed individuals but don't
   shoot responses to unarmed individuals, with the cost of not shooting
   armed individuals being greater than that of shooting unarmed
   individuals. Participants were faster to shoot armed Blacks than Whites,
   but faster in making don't shoot responses to unarmed Whites than
   Blacks. Brain activity differed to armed versus unarmed targets
   depending on target race, suggesting different mechanisms underlying
   threat versus safety decisions. Anterior cingulate cortex was
   preferentially engaged for unarmed Whites than Blacks. Parietal and
   visual cortical regions exhibited greater activity for armed Blacks than
   Whites. Seed-based functional connectivity of the amygdala revealed
   greater coherence with parietal and visual cortices for armed Blacks
   than Whites. Furthermore, greater implicit Black-danger associations

Abstract = {{Understanding how emotions are represented neurally is a central aim of
   affective neuroscience. Despite decades of neuroimaging efforts
   addressing this question, it remains unclear whether emotions are
   represented as distinct entities, as predicted by categorical theories,
   or are constructed from a smaller set of underlying factors, as
   predicted by dimensional accounts. Here, we capitalize on multivariate
   statistical approaches and computational modeling to directly evaluate
   these theoretical perspectives. We elicited discrete emotional states
   using music and films during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   scanning. Distinct patterns of neural activation predicted the emotion
   category of stimuli and tracked subjective experience. Bayesian model
   comparison revealed that combining dimensional and categorical models of
   emotion best characterized the information content of activation
   patterns. Surprisingly, categorical and dimensional aspects of emotion
   experience captured unique and opposing sources of neural information.
   These results indicate that diverse emotional states are poorly
   differentiated by simple models of valence and arousal, and that
   activity within separable neural systems can be mapped to unique emotion
   categories.}},

Abstract = {{Although body ownership-i.e. the feeling that our bodies belong to
   us-modulates activity within the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), it
   is still unknown whether this modulation occurs within a somatotopically
   defined portion of S1. We induced an illusory feeling of ownership for
   another person's finger by asking participants to hold their palm
   against another person's palm and to stroke the two joined index fingers
   with the index and thumb of their other hand. This illusion (numbness
   illusion) does not occur if the stroking is performed asynchronously or
   by the other person. We combined this somatosensory paradigm with
   ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging finger mapping to
   study whether illusory body ownership modulates activity within
   different finger-specific areas of S1. The results revealed that the
   numbness illusion is associated with activity in Brodmann area (BA) 1
   within the representation of the finger stroking the other person's
   finger and in BA 2 contralateral to the stroked finger. These results
   show that changes in bodily experience modulate the activity within
   certain subregions of S1, with a different finger-topographical
   selectivity between the representations of the stroking and of the
   stroked hand, and reveal that the high degree of somatosensory
   specialization in S1 extends to bodily self-consciousness.}},

Abstract = {{Early life trauma exposure represents a potent risk factor for the
   development of mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression and
   post-traumatic stress disorder. Moreover, deleterious consequences of
   trauma are exacerbated in youth living in impoverished, urban
   environments. A priori probability maps were used to examine
   resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala in 21
   trauma-exposed, and 21 age-and sex-matched urban children and
   adolescents (youth) without histories of trauma. Intrinsic FC analyses
   focused on amygdala-medial prefrontal circuitry, a key emotion
   regulatory pathway in the brain. We discovered reduced negative
   amygdala-subgenual cingulate connectivity in trauma-exposed youth.
   Differences between groups were also identified in anterior insula and
   dorsal anterior cingulate to amygdala connectivity. Overall, results
   suggest a model in which urban-dwelling trauma-exposed youth lack
   negative prefrontal to amygdala connectivity that may be critical for
   regulation of emotional responses. Functional changes in amygdala
   circuitry might reflect the biological embedding of stress reactivity in
   early life and mediate enhanced vulnerability to stress-related
   psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Social pressure influences human behavior including risk taking, but the
   psychological and neural underpinnings of this process are not well
   understood. We used the human lesion method to probe the role of
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in resisting adverse social
   pressure in the presence of risk. Thirty-seven participants (11 with
   vmPFC damage, 12 with brain damage outside the vmPFC and 14 without
   brain damage) were tested in driving simulator scenarios requiring
   left-turn decisions across oncoming traffic with varying time gaps
   between the oncoming vehicles. Social pressure was applied by a virtual
   driver who honked aggressively from behind. Participants with vmPFC
   damage were more likely to select smaller and potentially unsafe gaps
   under social pressure, while gap selection by the comparison groups did
   not change under social pressure. Participants with vmPFC damage also
   showed prolonged elevated skin conductance responses (SCR) under social
   pressure. Comparison groups showed similar initial elevated SCR, which
   then declined prior to making left-turn decisions. The findings suggest
   that the vmPFC plays an important role in resisting explicit and
   immediately present social pressure with potentially negative
   consequences. The vmPFC appears to contribute to the regulation of
   emotional responses and the modulation of decision making to optimize
   long-term outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Standard economic thinking postulates that increased monetary incentives
   should increase performance. Human decision makers, however, frequently
   focus on past performance, a form of reinforcement learning occasionally
   at odds with rational decision making. We used an incentivized
   belief-updating task from economics to investigate this conflict through
   measurements of neural correlates of reward processing. We found that
   higher incentives fail to improve performance when immediate feedback on
   decision outcomes is provided. Subsequent analysis of the
   feedback-related negativity, an early event-related potential following
   feedback, revealed the mechanism behind this paradoxical effect. As
   incentives increase, the win/lose feedback becomes more prominent,
   leading to an increased reliance on reinforcement and more errors. This
   mechanism is relevant for economic decision making and the debate on
   performance-based payment.}},

Abstract = {{Cigarette smoking is an economically and epidemiologically expensive
   public health concern. Most adult smokers become addicted during
   adolescence, rendering it a crucial period for prevention and
   intervention. Although litigation claims have delayed implementation,
   graphic warning labels proposed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
   (FDA) may be a promising way to achieve this goal. We aimed to determine
   the efficacy of the labels in reducing in-scanner craving and to
   characterize the neurobiological responses in adolescent and adult
   smokers and non-smokers. While undergoing functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, thirty-nine 13- to 18-year-old adolescent and forty-one 25- to
   30-year-old adult smokers and non-smokers rated their desire to smoke
   when presented with emotionally graphic warning labels and comparison
   non-graphic labels. Compared with adult smokers, adolescent smokers
   exhibited greater craving reduction in response to the warning labels.
   Although smokers evinced overall blunted recruitment of insula and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) relative to non-smokers, an
   effect that was stronger in adolescent smokers, parametrically
   increasing activation of these regions was associated with greater
   craving reduction. Functional connectivity analyses suggest that greater
   DLPFC regulation of limbic regions predicted cigarette craving. These
   data underscore a prominent role of frontoinsular circuitry in
   predicting the efficacy of FDA graphic warning labels in craving
   reduction in adult and adolescent smokers.}},

Abstract = {{Although acute impact of traumatic experiences on brain function in
   disaster survivors is similar to that observed in post-traumatic stress
   disorders (PTSD), little is known about the long-term impact of this
   experience. We have used structural and functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to investigate resting-state functional connectivity and gray
   and white matter (WM) changes occurring in the brains of healthy
   Wenchuan earthquake survivors both 3 weeks and 2 years after the
   disaster. Results show that while functional connectivity changes 3
   weeks after the disaster involved both frontal-limbic-striatal and
   default-mode networks (DMN), at the 2-year follow-up only changes in the
   latter persisted, despite complete recovery from high initial levels of
   anxiety. No gray or WM volume changes were found at either time point.
   Taken together, our findings provide important new evidence that while
   altered functional connectivity in the frontal-limbic-striatal network
   may underlie the post-trauma anxiety experienced by survivors, parallel
   changes in the DMN persist despite the apparent absence of anxiety
   symptoms. This suggests that long-term changes occur in neural networks
   involved in core aspects of self-processing, cognitive and emotional
   functioning in disaster survivors which are independent of anxiety
   symptoms and which may also confer increased risk of subsequent
   development of PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides a joint analysis of the cardiac and
   electro-cortical-early and late P3 and feedback-related negativity
   (FRN)-responses to social acceptance and rejection feedback. Twenty-five
   female participants performed on a social-and age-judgment control task,
   in which they received feedback with respect to their liking and age
   judgments, respectively. Consistent with previous reports, results
   revealed transient cardiac slowing to be selectively prolonged to
   unexpected social rejection feedback. Late P3 amplitude was more
   pronounced to unexpected relative to expected feedback. Both early and
   late P3 amplitudes were shown to be context dependent, in that they were
   more pronounced to social as compared with non-social feedback. FRN
   amplitudes were more pronounced to unexpected relative to expected
   feedback, irrespective of context and feedback valence. This pattern of
   findings indicates that social acceptance and rejection feedback have
   widespread effects on bodily state and brain function, which are
   modulated by prior expectancies.}},

Abstract = {{Notwithstanding the significant role that human-robot interactions (HRI)
   will play in the near future, limited research has explored the neural
   correlates of feeling eerie in response to social robots. To address
   this empirical lacuna, the current investigation examined brain activity
   using functional magnetic resonance imaging while a group of
   participants (n = 26) viewed a series of human-human interactions (HHI)
   and HRI. Although brain sites constituting the mentalizing network were
   found to respond to both types of interactions, systematic neural
   variation across sites signaled diverging social-cognitive strategies
   during HHI and HRI processing. Specifically, HHI elicited increased
   activity in the left temporal-parietal junction indicative of
   situation-specific mental state attributions, whereas HRI recruited the
   precuneus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) suggestive of
   script-based social reasoning. Activity in the VMPFC also tracked
   feelings of eeriness towards HRI in a parametric manner, revealing a
   potential neural correlate for a phenomenon known as the uncanny valley.
   By demonstrating how understanding social interactions depends on the
   kind of agents involved, this study highlights pivotal sub-routes of
   impression formation and identifies prominent challenges in the use of
   humanoid robots.}},

Abstract = {{Temperamental-traits (e.g. threat/reward-sensitivity) are found to
   modulate cognitive-control and attentional-processes. Yet, it is unclear
   exactly how these traits interact with emotional-stimuli in the
   modulation of cognitive-control, as reflected by the N2 event-related
   potential (ERP), and attentional-processes, as reflected by the P2 and
   P3 ERPs. Here in an ERP emotional-Go/NoGo task, 36 participants were
   instructed to inhibit their response to Fearful-and Happy-faces.
   Individual-differences in threat-sensitivity, reward-sensitivity and
   hypomanic-personality were assessed through self-report.
   Hypomanic-personality was assessed, given its relationship with
   reward-sensitivity and relevance to mood-disorder symptoms. Concerning
   cognitive-control, individuals with elevated threat-sensitivity
   displayed more-negative N2s to Happy-NoGo (relative to Fearful-NoGo)
   faces, whereas both individuals with elevated reward-sensitivity and
   hypomanic-personality displayed more-negative N2s to Fearful-NoGo
   (relative to Happy-NoGo) faces. Accordingly, when cognitive-control is
   required (during Go/NoGo), a mismatch between one's temperament and the
   valence of the NoGo-stimulus elevates detection of the need for
   cognitive-control. Conversely, the modulation of attentional-processing
   was specific to threat-sensitivity, as there was no relationship between
   either reward-sensitivity or hypomanic-personality and
   attentional-processing. Elevated threat-sensitivity was associated with
   enhanced early (P2s) and later (P3s) attentional-processing to
   Fearful-NoGo (relative to Happy-NoGo) faces. These latter findings
   support the negative attentional-bias model relating elevated
   threat-sensitivity with attentional-biases toward negative-stimuli and
   away from positive-stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorder refers to a neurodevelopmental condition
   primarily characterized by deficits in social cognition and behavior.
   Subclinically, autistic features are supposed to be present in healthy
   humans and can be quantified using the Autism Quotient (AQ). Here, we
   investigated a potential relationship between AQ and neural correlates
   of social and monetary reward processing, using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging in young, healthy participants. In an incentive delay
   task with either monetary or social reward, reward anticipation elicited
   increased ventral striatal activation, which was more pronounced during
   monetary reward anticipation. Anticipation of social reward elicited
   activation in the default mode network (DMN), a network previously
   implicated in social processing. Social reward feedback was associated
   with bilateral amygdala and fusiform face area activation. The
   relationship between AQ and neural correlates of social reward
   processing varied in a gender-dependent manner. In women and, to a
   lesser extent in men, higher AQ was associated with increased posterior
   DMN activation during social reward anticipation. During feedback, we
   observed a negative correlation of AQ and right amygdala activation in
   men only. Our results suggest that social reward processing might
   constitute an endophenotype for autism-related traits in healthy humans
   that manifests in a gender-specific way.}},

Abstract = {{Worry is reliably associated with overactive action-monitoring processes
   as measured by the error-related negativity (ERN). However, worry is not
   associated with error-related behavioral adjustments which are typically
   used to infer increased cognitive control following errors. We
   hypothesized that this disconnect between overactive action monitoring
   and unimproved post-error adjustments in worriers is the result of
   reduced functional integration between medial and lateral prefrontal
   regions during generation of the ERN, understood to have an important
   role in mediating controlled processing. To test this, we examined ERN
   amplitude and interchannel phase synchrony extracted from scalp-recorded
   electroencephalographic data during error processing in 77
   undergraduates who performed a Flankers task. Correlational and path
   analytic results demonstrated that worry was related to both an enlarged
   ERN and reduced phase synchrony. Although not directly related to
   post-error behavioral adjustments, results also revealed that worry was
   indirectly related to poor post-error adjustments through its
   association with reduced phase synchrony. Therefore, worry seems to
   affect multiple components of the action-monitoring system. It is
   related not just with the initial response to the error, but also with
   the transmission of information between networks involved in cognitive
   control processes.}},

Abstract = {{Gaze direction, a cue of both social and spatial attention, is known to
   modulate early neural responses to faces e.g. N170. However, findings in
   the literature have been inconsistent, likely reflecting differences in
   stimulus characteristics and task requirements. Here, we investigated
   the effect of task on neural responses to dynamic gaze changes: away and
   toward transitions (resulting or not in eye contact). Subjects
   performed, in random order, social (away/toward them) and non-social
   (left/right) judgment tasks on these stimuli. Overall, in the non-social
   task, results showed a larger N170 to gaze aversion than gaze motion
   toward the observer. In the social task, however, this difference was no
   longer present in the right hemisphere, likely reflecting an enhanced
   N170 to gaze motion toward the observer. Our behavioral and
   event-related potential data indicate that performing social judgments
   enhances saliency of gaze motion toward the observer, even those that
   did not result in gaze contact. These data and that of previous studies
   suggest two modes of processing visual information: a `default mode'
   that may focus on spatial information; a `socially aware mode' that
   might be activated when subjects are required to make social judgments.
   The exact mechanism that allows switching from one mode to the other
   remains to be clarified.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala is a key structure for monitoring the relevance of
   environmental stimuli. Yet, little is known about the dynamics of its
   response to primary social cues such as gaze and emotion. Here, we
   examined evoked amygdala responses to gaze and facial emotion changes in
   five epileptic patients with intracerebral electrodes. Patients first
   viewed a neutral face that would then convey social cues: it turned
   either happy or fearful with or without gaze aversion. This social cue
   was followed by a laterally presented target, the detection of which was
   faster if it appeared in a location congruent with the averted gaze
   direction. First, we observed pronounced evoked amygdala potentials to
   the initial neutral face. Second, analysis of the evoked responses to
   the cue showed an early effect of gaze starting at 123 ms in the right
   amygdala. Differential effects of fearful vs happy valence were
   individually present but more variable in time and therefore not
   observed at group-level. Our study is the first to demonstrate such an
   early effect of gaze in the amygdala, in line with its particular
   behavioral relevance in the spatial attention task.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive control supports goal-directed behavior by resolving conflict
   among opposing action tendencies. Emotion can trigger cognitive control
   processes, thus speeding up conflict processing when the target
   dimension of stimuli is emotional. However, it is unclear what role
   emotionality of the target dimension plays in the processing of
   emotional conflict (e.g. in irony). In two EEG experiments, we compared
   the influence of emotional valence of the target (emotional, neutral) in
   cognitive and emotional conflict processing. To maximally approximate
   real-life communication, we used audiovisual stimuli. Participants
   either categorized spoken vowels (cognitive conflict) or their emotional
   valence (emotional conflict), while visual information was congruent or
   incongruent. Emotional target dimension facilitated both cognitive and
   emotional conflict processing, as shown in a reduced reaction time
   conflict effect. In contrast, the N100 in the event-related potentials
   showed a conflict-specific reversal: the conflict effect was larger for
   emotional compared with neutral trials in cognitive conflict and smaller
   in emotional conflict. Additionally, domain-general conflict effects
   were observed in the P200 and N200 responses. The current findings
   confirm that emotions have a strong influence on cognitive and emotional
   conflict processing. They also highlight the complexity and
   heterogeneity of the interaction of emotion with different types of
   conflict.}},

Abstract = {{Autobiographical memory (AM) overgenerality is a consistent
   neuropsychological feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) and is
   present in individuals at high-familial risk (HR) of developing MDD.
   Structural changes have been found in brain regions implicated in AM
   recall in MDDs and HRs. However, the relationship between selective
   regional gray matter volume (GMV) differences and AM recall deficits has
   not been examined. We examined this relationship in 27 HR, 43
   unmedicated MDD and 47 low-risk healthy control participants as they
   completed an AM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging.
   FreeSurfer was used for automated anatomical image processing and
   volumetric quantification. Anatomical regions of interest for GMV
   analysis were selected based on regions most commonly activated in
   controls as they recall specific AMs according to a recent
   meta-analysis. Pearson correlations were calculated among volumetric and
   AM recall data. In HRs and MDDs, left hippocampal volume correlated
   positively with specific (HRs r = 0.42; MDDs r = 0.60) and inversely
   with categorical AM recall (HRs r = -0.51; MDDs r = -0.35). In MDDs,
   left precuneus volume also correlated positively with specific (r =
   0.49) and inversely with categorical (r = -0.35) AM recall. Our results
   suggest selective GMV alterations within the AM network may contribute
   to AM impairments observed in both HR and MDD individuals.}},

Abstract = {{One in five American children grows up in poverty. Childhood poverty has
   far-reaching adverse impacts on cognitive, social and emotional
   development. Altered development of neurocircuits, subserving emotion
   regulation, is one possible pathway for childhood poverty's ill effects.
   Children exposed to poverty were followed into young adulthood and then
   studied using functional brain imaging with an implicit emotion
   regulation task focused. Implicit emotion regulation involved attention
   shifting and appraisal components. Early poverty reduced left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex recruitment in the context of emotional
   regulation. Furthermore, this emotion regulation associated brain
   activation mediated the effects of poverty on adult task performance.
   Moreover, childhood poverty also predicted enhanced insula and reduced
   hippocampal activation, following exposure to acute stress. These
   results demonstrate that childhood poverty can alter adult emotion
   regulation neurocircuitry, revealing specific brain mechanisms that may
   underlie long-term effects of social inequalities on health. The role of
   poverty-related emotion regulatory neurocircuitry appears to be
   particularly salient during stressful conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive behavior poses a threat to human collaboration and social
   safety. It is of utmost importance to identify the functional mechanisms
   underlying aggression and to develop potential interventions capable of
   reducing dysfunctional aggressive behavior already at a brain level. We
   here experimentally shifted fronto-cortical asymmetry to manipulate the
   underlying motivational emotional states in both male and female
   participants while assessing the behavioral effects on proactive and
   reactive aggression. Thirty-two healthy volunteers received either
   anodal transcranial direct current stimulation to increase neural
   activity within right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, or sham
   stimulation. Aggressive behavior was measured with the Taylor Aggression
   Paradigm. We revealed a general gender effect, showing that men
   displayed more behavioral aggression than women. After the induction of
   right fronto-hemispheric dominance, proactive aggression was reduced in
   men. This study demonstrates that non-invasive brain stimulation can
   reduce aggression in men. This is a relevant and promising step to
   better understand how cortical brain states connect to impulsive actions
   and to examine the causal role of the prefrontal cortex in aggression.
   Ultimately, such findings could help to examine whether the brain can be
   a direct target for potential supportive interventions in clinical
   settings dealing with overly aggressive patients and/or violent
   offenders.}},

Abstract = {{Approach, avoidance and the supervisory control system are fundamental
   to human behavior. Much past research has examined the
   neurophysiological models relating trait approach and avoidance. Using
   measures of electroencephalographic (EEG) frontal asymmetry, trait
   approach has been associated with greater left-frontal activity and
   trait avoidance has been associated with greater right-frontal activity.
   However, traits related to the supervisory control system have not been
   previously associated with frontal asymmetry. The current study sought
   to test whether trait positive urgency, measuring the tendency towards
   rash action in response to extreme positive emotional states, would
   relate to frontal alpha asymmetry. One hundred twenty-six individuals
   completed a measure of positive urgency and resting EEG recordings.
   Greater positive urgency was associated with greater relative
   left-frontal EEG activity. Source localization revealed that this
   relationship appeared to originate from reduced right-frontal activity
   in the inferior frontal gyrus. These results clarify that the link
   between frontal asymmetry and positive urgency is related to reduced
   right-frontal activity. Reduced right-frontal activity may be a
   potential neurobiological trait related to the supervisory control
   system.}},

   neural mechanism whereby one's facial emotion modulates the visual
   cortical responses to other's facial expressions remains unknown. To
   understand how one's facial expression affects visual processing, we
   measured participants' visual evoked potentials (VEPs) during a facial
   emotion judgment task of positive and neutral faces. To control for the
   effects of facial muscles on VEPs, we asked participants to smile
   (adopting an expression of happiness), to purse their lips (incompatible
   with smiling) or to pose with a neutral face, in separate blocks.
   Results showed that the smiling expression modulates face-specific
   visual processing components (N170/vertex positive potential) to
   watching other facial expressions. Specifically, when making a happy
   expression, neutral faces are processed similarly to happy faces. When
   making a neutral expression or pursing the lips, however, responses to
   neutral and happy face are significantly different. This effect was
   source localized within multisensory associative areas, angular gyrus,
   associative visual cortex and somatosensory cortex. We provide novel
   evidence that one's own emotional expression acts as a top-down
   influence modulating low-level neural encoding during facial perception.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the risks, people enjoy giving advice. One explanation is that
   giving beneficial advice can result in reflected glory, ego boosts or
   reputation enhancement. However, giving poor advice can be socially
   harmful (being perceived as incompetent or untrustworthy). In both
   circumstances, we have a vested interest in the advice follower's
   success or failure, especially when it reflects specifically on us
   compared with when it is diffused between multiple advisors. We examined
   these dynamics using an Advisor-Advisee Game, where subjects acted as an
   Advisor to a confederate Advisee who selected one of the three options
   when trying to win money: accept the subject's advice, accept the advice
   of a second confederate Advisor or accept both Advisors' advice. Results
   showed that having one's advice accepted, compared with being rejected,
   resulted in activity in the ventral striatum-a core reward area.
   Furthermore, the ventral striatum was only active when the subject's
   advice led to the advisee winning, and not when the advisee won based on
   the confederate's advice. Finally, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
   was more active when the Advisee won or lost money based solely on the
   subject's advice compared with when the second Advisor's advice was
   accepted. One explanation for these findings is that the MPFC monitors
   self-relevant social information, while the ventral striatum is active
   when others accept advice and when their success leads to reflected
   glory.}},

Abstract = {{Although emotional intensity powerfully challenges regulatory
   strategies, its influence remains largely unexplored in
   affective-neuroscience. Accordingly, the present study addressed the
   moderating role of emotional intensity in two regulatory
   stages-implementation (during regulation) and pre-implementation (prior
   to regulation), of two major cognitive regulatory strategies-distraction
   and reappraisal. According to our framework, because distraction
   implementation involves early attentional disengagement from emotional
   information before it gathers force, in high-intensity it should be more
   effective in the short-term, relative to reappraisal, which modulates
   emotional processing only at a late semantic meaning phase. Supporting
   findings showed that in high (but not low) intensity, distraction
   implementation resulted in stronger modulation of negative experience,
   reduced neural emotional processing (centro-parietal late positive
   potential, LPP), with suggestive evidence for less cognitive effort
   (frontal-LPP), relative to reappraisal. Related pre-implementation
   findings confirmed that anticipating regulation of high-intensity
   stimuli resulted in distraction (over reappraisal) preference. In
   contrast, anticipating regulation of low-intensity stimuli resulted in
   reappraisal (over distraction) preference, which is most beneficial for
   long-term adaptation. Furthermore, anticipating cognitively demanding
   regulation, either in cases of regulating counter to these preferences
   or via the more effortful strategy of reappraisal, enhanced neural
   attentional resource allocation (Stimulus Preceding Negativity). Broad
   implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Engaging social working memory (SWM) during effortful social cognition
   has been associated with neural activation in two neurocognitive
   systems: the medial frontoparietal system and the lateral frontoparietal
   system. However, the respective roles played by these systems in SWM
   remain unknown. Results from this study demonstrate that only the medial
   frontoparietal system supports the social cognitive demands managed in
   SWM. In contrast, the lateral frontoparietal system supports the
   non-social cognitive demands that are needed for task performance, but
   that are independent of the social cognitive computations. Moreover,
   parametric increases in the medial frontoparietal system, but not the
   lateral frontoparietal system, in response to SWM load predicted
   performance on a challenging measure of perspective-taking. Thus, the
   medial frontoparietal system may uniquely support social cognitive
   processes in working memory and the working memory demands afforded by
   effortful social cognition, such as the need to track another person's
   perspective in mind.}},

Abstract = {{People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often have difficulty
   comprehending social situations in the complex, dynamic contexts
   encountered in the real world. To study the social brain under
   conditions which approximate naturalistic situations, we measured brain
   activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants
   watched a full-length episode of the sitcom The Office. Having
   quantified the degree of social awkwardness at each moment of the
   episode, as judged by an independent sample of controls, we found that
   both individuals with ASD and control participants showed reliable
   activation of several brain regions commonly associated with social
   perception and cognition (e.g. those comprising the `mentalizing
   network') during the more awkward moments. However, individuals with ASD
   showed less activity than controls in a region near right
   temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ) extending into the posterior end of the
   right superior temporal sulcus (RSTS). Further analyses suggested that,
   despite the free-form nature of the experimental design, this group
   difference was specific to this RTPJ/RSTS area of the mentalizing
   network; other regions of interest showed similar activity across groups
   with respect to both location and magnitude. These findings add support
   to a body of evidence suggesting that RTPJ/RSTS plays a special role in
   social processes across modalities and may function atypically in
   individuals with ASD navigating the social world.}},

Abstract = {{Diminished responsivity to reward incentives is a key contributor to the
   social-communication problems seen in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).
   Social motivation theories suggest that individuals with ASD do not
   experience social interactions as rewarding, leading to negative
   consequences for the development of brain circuitry subserving social
   information. In this study, we examined neural responses to social and
   non-social reward anticipation in 35 typically developing young adults,
   examining modulation of reward sensitivity by level of autistic traits.
   Using an Event-related potential incentive-delay task incorporating
   novel, more ecologically valid forms of reward, higher expression of
   autistic traits was associated with an attenuated P3 response to the
   anticipation of social (simulated real-time video feedback from an
   observer), but not non-social (candy), rewards. Exploratory analyses
   revealed that this was unrelated to mentalizing ability. The P3
   component reflects motivated attention to reward signals, suggesting
   attenuated motivation allocation specific to social incentives. The
   study extends prior findings of atypical reward anticipation in ASD,
   demonstrating that attenuated social reward responsiveness extends to
   autistic traits in the range of typical functioning. Results support the
   development of innovative paradigms for investigating social and
   non-social reward responsiveness. Insight into vulnerabilities in reward
   processing is critical for understanding social function in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Deficits in a wide variety of social cognitive processes are well
   established in schizophrenia. However, research focusing on actual
   interacting individuals is surprisingly scarce. Problems in low-level
   processes such as self-other integration may importantly underlie
   often-reported higher-level deficits. The current study aimed at
   measuring possible disturbances in self-other integration in
   schizophrenia using both behavioral and event-related potential (ERP)
   measures. Sixteen healthy controls and fifteen schizophrenia patients
   performed a social Simon task in both a joint and an individual setting.
   Behaviorally, patients showed general slower reaction times, but
   comparable self-other integration as reflected in the social Simon
   effect. The ERP results for the healthy controls revealed increased
   no-go P3 amplitudes in the joint compared with the individual setting.
   Crucially, patients did not show this increase in no-go P3 amplitude. In
   line with previous research, the present ERP findings demonstrate that
   healthy volunteers needed more effort to inhibit their responses in the
   joint compared with the individual setting. Patients however, showed
   altered self-other integration when they had to withhold their responses
   while their co-actor had to act. These outcomes indicate that
   schizophrenia patients have deficits in low-level processes required for
   successful joint action.}},

Abstract = {{Media violence exposure causes increased aggression and decreased
   prosocial behavior, suggesting that media violence desensitizes people
   to the emotional experience of others. Alterations in emotional face
   processing following exposure to media violence may result in
   desensitization to others' emotional states. This study used scalp
   electroencephalography methods to examine the link between exposure to
   violence and neural changes associated with emotional face processing.
   Twenty-five participants were shown a violent or nonviolent film clip
   and then completed a gender discrimination stop-signal task using
   emotional faces. Media violence did not affect the early visual P100
   component; however, decreased amplitude was observed in the N170 and
   P200 event-related potentials following the violent film, indicating
   that exposure to film violence leads to suppression of holistic face
   processing and implicit emotional processing. Participants who had just
   seen a violent film showed increased frontal N200/P300 amplitude. These
   results suggest that media violence exposure may desensitize people to
   emotional stimuli and thereby require fewer cognitive resources to
   inhibit behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Despite being one of the healthiest developmental periods, morbidity and
   mortality rates increase dramatically during adolescence, largely due to
   preventable, risky behaviors. Heightened reward sensitivity, coupled
   with ineffective cognitive control, has been proposed to underlie
   adolescents' risk taking. In this study, we test whether reward
   sensitivity can be redirected to promote safe behavior. Adolescents
   completed a risk-taking task in the presence of their mother and alone
   during fMRI. Adolescents demonstrated reduced risk-taking behavior when
   their mothers were present compared with alone, which was associated
   with greater recruitment of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)
   when making safe decisions, decreased activation in the ventral striatum
   following risky decisions and greater functional coupling between the
   ventral striatum and VLPFC when making safe decisions. Importantly, the
   very same neural circuitry (i.e. ventral striatum) that has been linked
   to greater risk-taking can also be redirected toward thoughtful, more
   deliberative and safe decisions.}},

   potentials, we show that highly fluent Welsh-English bilinguals require
   significantly less processing effort when reading sentences in Welsh
   which contain factually correct information about Wales, than when
   reading sentences containing the same information presented in English.
   Crucially, culturally irrelevant information was processed similarly in
   both Welsh and English. Our findings show that even in highly proficient
   bilinguals, language interacts with factors associated with personal
   identity, such as culture, to modulate online semantic processing.}},

Abstract = {{Despite moral prohibitions on hurting other humans, some social contexts
   allow for harmful actions such as killing of others. One example is
   warfare, where killing enemy soldiers is seen as morally justified. Yet,
   the neural underpinnings distinguishing between justified and
   unjustified killing are largely unknown. To improve understanding of the
   neural processes involved in justified and unjustified killing,
   participants had to imagine being the perpetrator whilst watching
   `first-person perspective' animated videos where they shot enemy
   soldiers ('justified violence') and innocent civilians ('unjustified
   violence'). When participants imagined themselves shooting civilians
   compared with soldiers, greater activation was found in the lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Regression analysis revealed that the more
   guilt participants felt about shooting civilians, the greater the
   response in the lateral OFC. Effective connectivity analyses further
   revealed an increased coupling between lateral OFC and the
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ) when shooting civilians. The results show
   that the neural mechanisms typically implicated with harming others,
   such as the OFC, become less active when the violence against a
   particular group is seen as justified. This study therefore provides
   unique insight into how normal individuals can become aggressors in
   specific situations.}},

Abstract = {{Near-miss events are situations in which an action yields a negative
   result but is very close to being successful. They are known to
   influence behavior, especially in gambling scenarios. Previous
   neuroimaging studies have described an `anomalous' activity of brain
   reward areas following these events. The goal of the present research
   was to study electrophysiological correlates of near-misses in the
   expectation and outcome phases. Electroencephalography was recorded
   while participants were playing a simplified version of a slot machine.
   Four possible outcomes (gain, near-miss, loss and no-information) were
   presented in a pseudorandom order to ensure fixed proportions. Results
   from the time-frequency analysis for the theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (9-13
   Hz), low beta (15-22 Hz) and beta-gamma (25-35 Hz) frequency-bands
   presented larger power increases for wins and near-misses compared with
   losses. In the anticipation phase, power changes were lower than in the
   resolution phase. The current results are in agreement with previous
   studies showing that near-miss events recruit brain areas of the reward
   network. Likewise, the oscillatory activity in near-misses is very
   similar to the one elicited in the gain condition. In addition, present
   findings suggest that oscillatory activity in the expectation phase does
   not play a crucial role in near-miss events.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the developmental trajectories of neural circuits implicated
   in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are largely unknown. Here, we
   specifically focused on age-related changes in the functional circuitry
   of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), a key hub underlying
   social-cognitive processes known to be impaired in ASD. Using a
   cross-sectional approach, we analysed resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from children, adolescents and
   adults available through the autism brain imaging data exchange
   repository {[}n = 106 with ASD and n = 109 typical controls (TC), ages
   7-30 years]. The observed age-related changes of pSTS intrinsic
   functional connectivity (iFC) suggest that no single developmental
   pattern characterizes ASD. Instead, pSTS circuitry displayed a complex
   developmental picture, with some functional circuits showing patterns
   consistent with atypical development in ASD relative to TC (pSTS-iFC
   with fusiform gyrus and angular gyrus) and others showing delayed
   maturation (pSTS-iFC with regions of the action perception network).
   Distinct developmental trajectories in different functional circuits in
   ASD likely reflect differential age-related changes in the
   socio-cognitive processes they underlie. Increasing insight on these
   mechanisms is a critical step in the development of age-specific
   interventions in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala and the parietal cortex play a key role in the neural
   representation of personal space. Although the concept of personal space
   is clinically very relevant for borderline personality disorder (BPD),
   especially in affective contexts, it has not been investigated thus far
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this fMRI study,
   25 female BPD patients and 25 healthy women were exposed to photos of
   angry, disgusted and neutral facial expressions. All stimuli were once
   shown as still photos, and once were zoomed-in in order to simulate
   intrusion into one's own personal space. Approaching faces generally
   provoked activation of the amygdala and the somatosensory cortex. BPD
   patients showed an increased activation within both regions, but only
   toward approaching disgusted faces. Their amygdala activation in this
   specific condition positively correlated with self-disgust scores.
   Moreover, the clinical group indicated an enhanced personal distance
   preference, which was associated with parietal activation. The present
   study revealed altered personal space processing of BPD patients,
   especially in situations that relate to social contexts involving
   disgust. Future studies should focus on the temporal stability of
   personal space processing during the natural course of BPD as well as
   during therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Neurobiological and behavioral findings suggest that psychosis is
   associated with corticolimbic hyperactivity during the processing of
   emotional salience. This has not been widely studied in the early stages
   of psychosis, and the impact of these abnormalities on psychotic
   symptoms and global functioning is unknown. We sought to address this
   issue in 18 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP), 18 individuals
   at ultra high risk of psychosis (UHR) and 22 healthy controls (HCs).
   Corticolimbic response and subjective ratings to emotional and neutral
   scenes were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The
   clinical and functional impact of corticolimbic abnormalities was
   assessed with regression analyses. The FEP and UHR groups reported
   increased subjective emotional arousal to neutral scenes compared with
   HCs. Across groups, emotional vs neutral scenes elicited activation in
   the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus/anterior
   insula and amygdala. Although FEP and UHR participants showed reduced
   activation in these regions when viewing emotional scenes compared with
   controls, this was driven by increased activation to neutral scenes.
   Corticolimbic hyperactivity to neutral scenes predicted higher levels of
   positive symptoms and poorer levels of functioning. These results
   indicate that disruption of emotional brain systems may represent an
   important biological substrate for the pathophysiology of early
   psychosis and UHR states.}},

Volume = {{129}},

Abstract = {{The central amygdala (CeA) has been shown to play an important role in
   mediating several attentional processes, including selective and
   sustained attention. Emerging evidence suggests that the connections
   between the CeA and the midbrain dopamine areas are important for
   attentional processing. However, little is known about the role of
   dopaminergic input into the CeA in mediating attentional processes. To
   investigate how dopamine activity in the CeA modulates attentional
   processing, CeA D1 and D2 receptors were temporarily inactivated during
   testing in a 5-choice task. In this task, rats were trained to detect 1
   of 5 recessed ports that briefly illuminated in order to receive a food
   reward, therefore requiring the rats to successfully sustain their
   attention to monitor all 5 ports and selectively attend to the lit port.
   Then, rats were tested in several altered versions of the task to
   increase attentional load (e.g., variable ready period). In 2
   experiments, the D1 antagonist CH 23390 or the D2 antagonist raclopride
   were infused into the bilateral CeA preceding the test sessions. D1, but
   not D2, inactivation reduced performance in the more demanding versions
   of the 5-choice task. Therefore, CeA D1 receptors might mediate
   attentional functions important for visual cue detection in a 5-choice
   task.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing motivation can positively impact cognitive performance. Here
   we employed a cognitive timing task that allows us to detect changes in
   cognitive performance that are not influenced by general activity or
   arousal factors such as the speed or persistence of responding. This
   approach allowed us to manipulate motivation using three different
   methods; molecular/genetic, behavioral and pharmacological. Increased
   striatal D2Rs resulted in deficits in temporal discrimination. Switching
   off the transgene improved motivation in earlier studies, and here
   partially rescued the temporal discrimination deficit. To manipulate
   motivation behaviorally, we altered reward magnitude and found that
   increasing reward magnitude improved timing in control mice and
   partially rescued timing in the transgenic mice. Lastly, we manipulated
   motivation pharmacologically using a functionally selective 5-HT2C
   receptor ligand, SB242084, which we previously found to increase
   incentive motivation. SB242084 improved temporal discrimination in both
   control and transgenic mice. Thus, while there is a general intuitive
   belief that motivation can affect cognition, we here provide a direct
   demonstration that enhancing motivation, in a variety of ways, can be an
   effective strategy for enhancing temporal cognition. Understanding the
   interaction of motivation and cognition is of clinical significance
   since many psychiatric disorders are characterized by deficits in both
   domains.}},

Volume = {{129}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{589-598}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Informational masking (IM) describes the insensitivity of detecting a
   change in sound features in a complex acoustical environment when such a
   change could easily be detected in the absence of distracting sounds. IM
   occurs because of the similarity between deviant sound and distracting
   sounds (so-called similarity-based IM) and/or stimulus uncertainty
   stemming from trial-to-trial variability (so-called uncertainty-based
   IM). IM can be abolished if similarity-based or uncertainty-based IM are
   minimized. Here, we modulated similarity-based IM using binaural cues.
   Standard/deviant tones and distracting tones were presented
   sequentially, and level-increment thresholds were measured. Deviant
   tones differed from standard tones by a higher sound level. Distracting
   tones covered a wide range of levels. Standard/deviant tones and
   distracting tones were characterized by their interaural time difference
   (ITD), interaural level difference (ILD), or both ITD and ILD. The
   larger the ITD or ILD was, the better similarity-based IM was overcome.
   If both interaural differences were applied to standard/deviant tones,
   the release from IM was larger than when either interaural difference
   was used. The results show that binaural cues are potent cues to abolish
   similarity-based IM and that the auditory system makes use of multiple
   available cues.}},

Abstract = {{Age-associated cognitive decline can reduce an individual's quality of
   life. As no single neurobiological deficit can account for the wide
   spectrum of behavioral impairments observed in old age, it is critical
   to develop an understanding of how interactions between different brain
   regions change over the life span. The performance of young and aged
   animals on behaviors that require the hippocampus and cortical regions
   to interact, however, has not been well characterized. Specifically, the
   ability to link a spatial location with specific features of a stimulus,
   such as object identity, relies on the hippocampus, perirhinal and
   prefrontal cortices. Although aging is associated with dysfunction in
   each of these brain regions, behavioral measures of functional change
   within the hippocampus, perirhinal and prefrontal cortices in individual
   animals are often not correlated. Thus, how dysfunction of a single
   brain region within this circuit, such as the hippocampus, impacts
   behaviors that require communication with the perirhinal and prefrontal
   cortices remains unknown. To address this question, young and aged rats
   were tested on the interregion dependent object-place paired association
   task, as well as a hippocampal-dependent test of spatial reference
   memory. This particular cohort of aged rats did not show deficits on the
   hippocampal-dependent task, but were significantly impaired at acquiring
   object-place associations relative to young. These data suggest that
   behaviors requiring functional connectivity across different regions of
   the memory network may be particularly sensitive to aging, and can be
   used to develop models that will clarify the impact of systems-level
   dysfunction in the elderly.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously characterized a model of posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD), based on classical conditioning of the rabbit
   nictitating membrane response (NMR), that focuses on 2 key PTSD-like
   features: conditioned responses to trauma-associated cues and
   hyperarousal. In addition to the development of conditioned NMRs (CRs)
   to a tone conditioned stimulus (CS) associated with a periorbital shock
   unconditioned stimulus (US), we have observed that rabbits also exhibit
   a conditioning-specific reflex modification (CRM) of the NMR that
   manifests as an exaggerated and more complex reflexive NMR to
   presentations of the US by itself, particularly to intensities that
   elicited little response prior to conditioning. Previous work has
   demonstrated that unpaired presentations of the CS and US are successful
   at extinguishing CRs and CRM simultaneously, even when a significantly
   weakened version of the US is utilized. In the current study, additional
   extinction treatments were tested, including continued pairings of the
   CS with a weakened US and exposure to the training context alone, and
   these treatments were contrasted with the effects of unpaired extinction
   with a weakened US and remaining in home cages with no further
   treatment. Results showed that continued pairings only slightly
   decreased CRs and CRM, while context exposure had no effect on CRs and
   marginal effects on reducing CRM. Unpaired extinction was still the most
   effective treatment for reducing both. Findings are discussed in terms
   of applications to cognitive-behavioral therapies for treatment of PTSD,
   such as incorporating mild, innately stressful stimuli into virtual
   reality therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of acute sleep deprivation on anxiety are the focus of
   controversy in the literature. While clinical research studies on the
   effects of sleep deprivation seem to show a consistent increase in acute
   anxiety, rodent studies have produced inconsistent results, with some
   experiments pointing to anxiogenesis and others to anxiolysis. Such
   observations impair the translational applicability of rodent models on
   the paradigm between sleep deprivation and anxiety. Current studies fail
   in the very basic principle of biomedical translational research: to
   provide relevant and reliable knowledge from basic experimental science
   that can be applied in clinical environments. Possible explanations for
   the disparity between human and animal studies include the accuracy of
   both human and rodent research, the ability of current behavioral
   protocols to truly reflect the anxiety response of rodents to sleep
   deprivation, and the nature of sleep deprivation-induced anxiety in
   rodents. Based on these hypotheses, we performed a brief overview of the
   literature on the relationship between sleep deprivation and anxiety and
   propose a research agenda that could lead to a better understanding of
   the reasons for the discrepancies found in the literature and provide
   more reliable data on the translational relationship between sleep
   deprivation and anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{The role of thyroid hormones in vertebrate development has been well
   documented for several decades. As hypothyroidism during critical
   periods of development can cause defects to the development of every
   major organ system, including brain, eye, and general morphology, we
   hypothesized that hypothyroidism would affect specific behaviors. To
   assess this, we treated zebrafish with the hypothyroid drug methimazole
   (MMI) and examined changes in anxiety, shoaling, vision, and locomotion.
   Following low-dose MMI exposure for the first 10 days of life, a time of
   rapid and significant development, larvae were removed from treatment
   and allowed to develop until 1 month of age. Comparisons between treated
   and controls took place between 10 and 30 days postfertilization to
   examine times both during and after treatment. Using the novel tank and
   startle response tests, we found that anxiety behaviors are
   significantly increased following MMI treatment. These effects persisted
   for several days following removal from treatment and indicate a
   prolonged effect of early hypothyroidism. However, permanent MMI effects
   on anxiety were not observed, as anxiety behaviors of early treated
   zebrafish recovered to control levels following 10 days out of
   treatment. In contrast to the strong link between MMI treatment and
   anxiety, shoaling and visual behaviors were not significantly affected
   within our experimental parameters. This indicates that disruption of
   thyroid system functioning early in life can differentially affect
   behavior by specifically altering anxiety responses without producing
   indiscriminate changes to overall behavioral development.}},

Abstract = {{Prolonged morphine treatment in neonatal pediatric populations is
   associated with a high incidence of opioid tolerance and dependence.
   Despite the clinical relevance of this problem, our knowledge of
   long-term consequences is sparse. The main objective of this study was
   to investigate whether prolonged morphine administration in a neonatal
   rat is associated with long-term behavioral changes in adulthood.
   Newborn animals received either morphine (10 mg/kg) or equal volume of
   saline subcutaneously twice daily for the first 2 weeks of life.
   Morphine-treated animals underwent 10 days of morphine weaning to reduce
   the potential for observable physical signs of withdrawal. Animals were
   subjected to nonstressful testing (locomotor activity recording and a
   novel-object recognition test) at a young age (Postnatal Days {[}PDs]
   27-31) or later in adulthood (PDs 55-56), as well as stressful testing
   (calibrated forceps test, hot plate test, and forced swim test) only in
   adulthood. Analysis revealed that prolonged neonatal morphine exposure
   resulted in decreased thermal but not mechanical threshold. Importantly,
   no differences were found for total locomotor activity (proxy of drug
   reward/reinforcement behavior), individual forced swim test behaviors
   (proxy of affective processing), or novel-object recognition test.
   Performance on the novel-object recognition test was compromised in the
   morphine-treated group at the young age, but the effect disappeared in
   adulthood. These novel results provide insight into the long-term
   consequences of opioid treatment during an early developmental period
   and suggest long-term neuroplastic differences in sensory processing
   related to thermal stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Why do people gamble? Conventional views hold that gambling may be
   motivated by irrational beliefs, risk-seeking, impulsive temperament, or
   dysfunction within the same reward circuitry affected by drugs of abuse.
   An alternate, unexplored perspective is that gambling is an extension of
   natural foraging behavior to a financial environment. However, when
   these foraging algorithms are applied to stochastic gambling outcomes,
   undesirable results may occur. To test this hypothesis, we recruited
   participants based on their frequency of gambling-yearly (or less),
   monthly, and weekly-and investigated how gambling frequency related to
   irrational beliefs, risk-taking/impulsivity, and foraging behavior. We
   found that increased gambling frequency corresponded to greater
   gambling-related beliefs, more exploratory choices on an explore/exploit
   foraging task, and fewer points earned on a Patchy Foraging Task.
   Gambling-related beliefs negatively related to performance on the Patchy
   Foraging Task, indicating that individuals with more gambling-related
   cognitions tended to leave a patch too quickly. This indicates that
   frequent gamblers have reduced foraging ability to maximize rewards;
   however, gambling frequency - and by extension, poor foraging
   ability-was not related to risk-taking or impulsive behavior. These
   results suggest that gambling reflects the application of a
   dysfunctional foraging process to financial outcomes.}},

Title = {{Mnemonic Discrimination of Similar Face Stimuli and a Potential
   Mechanism for the ``Other Race{''} Effect}},

Abstract = {{Face recognition is an important component of successful social
   interactions in humans. A large literature in social psychology has
   focused on the phenomenon termed the ``other race{''} (ORE) effect, the
   tendency to be more proficient with face recognition within one's own
   ethnic group compared with other ethnic groups. Several potential
   hypotheses have been proposed for this effect, including perceptual
   expertise, social grouping, and holistic face processing. Recent work on
   mnemonic discrimination (i.e., the ability to resolve mnemonic
   interference among similar experiences) may provide a mechanistic
   account for the ORE. In the current study, we examined how
   discrimination and generalization in the presence of mnemonic
   interference may contribute to the ORE. We developed a database of
   computerized faces divided evenly among ethnic origins (Black,
   Caucasian, East Asian, South Asian), as well as morphed face stimuli
   that varied in the amount of similarity to the original stimuli (30\%,
   40\%, 50\%, and 60\% morphs). Participants first examined the original
   unmorphed stimuli during study, then during test were asked to judge the
   prior occurrence of repetitions (targets), morphed stimuli (lures), and
   new stimuli (foils). We examined participants' ability to correctly
   reject similar morphed lures and found that it increased linearly as a
   function of face dissimilarity. We additionally found that Caucasian
   participants' mnemonic discrimination-generalization functions were
   sharply tuned for Caucasian faces but considerably less tuned for East
   Asian and Black faces. These results suggest that expertise plays an
   important role in resolving mnemonic interference, which may offer a
   mechanistic account for the ORE.}},

Abstract = {{Rats received N-methyl-D-aspartate lesions of the bed nucleus of the
   stria terminalis (BNST) and then 10 aversive conditioning trials in
   which exposure to a context was paired with footshock. For half the
   animals, shock was presented 1 min after the onset of each context
   exposure; for the other half, shock was presented after 10 min. With the
   1-min context duration, aversive conditioning (measured by freezing) was
   unaffected by BNST lesion. In contrast, at the 10-min duration, lesioned
   animals froze substantially less than sham controls. When
   1-min-conditioned animals were left in the context for 10 min, freezing
   that was evident (though declining) throughout the test was not affected
   by the BNST lesion. When freezing over 10 min was similarly examined in
   the 10-min-conditioned animals, BNST lesions caused a deficit that was
   consistently evident over time. The results indicate that the BNST is
   involved in aversive conditioning to long-duration, but not merely
   contextual, conditional stimuli. Results may be less consistent with the
   view that BNST becomes activated after prolonged fear than the view that
   it is involved when a cue's onset has a remote temporal relation to

Abstract = {{Latent variables may exist in experimental designs and may interfere
   with reproducibility of findings. The present study reveals 1 such
   variable, the individual differences in affective response to chronic
   injection stress, by using the novelty-seeking phenotype as a model of
   differential emotional reactivity. The phenotype is identified by
   exposing a population of experimentally naive outbred rats to the mild
   stress of a novel environment and classifying them as high responders
   (HR; upper 1/3) and low responders (LR; lower 1/3) based on their
   locomotor reactivity. Research has shown that HR/LR animals differ in
   their basal levels of anxiety-and depressive-like behavior, as well as
   in their response to environmental and pharmacological challenges;
   suggesting validity of this model in studying individual differences in
   stress reactivity. The present data showed that 14 daily,
   intraperitoneal saline injections did not alter the phenotypic
   differences in social behavior observed basally in HR/LR rats. However,
   injections significantly increased time spent immobile in the forced
   swim test in HRs, while the identical regimen significantly decreased
   the same measure in LRs, compared with handled-controls. These data
   indicate that individual differences in stress reactivity can have a
   significant impact on the depressive-like responses to repeated
   intraperitoneal injections in rats. Given that such underlying emotional
   variability exists within standard, outbred rat populations, this study
   highlights the importance of accounting for such variability in any
   study investigating the effects of repeated drug administration on
   depressive-like behavior for reliability and replicability of findings.
   Thus, we recommend including an uninjected control group in all studies.}},

Abstract = {{Over 70years since the first description of the disease, disrupted
   social behavior remains a core clinical feature of autistic spectrum

   characterized by a failure to develop peer relationships, difficulty

   examine recent progress that has been made toward understanding the

Abstract = {{Social emotions such as empathy or compassion greatly facilitate our
   interactions with others. Despite the importance of social emotions,
   scientific studies have only recently revealed functional neural
   plasticity associated with the training of such emotions. Using the
   framework of two antagonistic neural systems, the threat and social
   disconnection system on the one hand, and the reward and social
   connection system on the other, this article describes how training
   compassion and empathy can change the functioning of these systems in a
   targeted manner. Whereas excessive empathic sharing of suffering can
   increase negative feelings and activations in the insula and anterior
   cingulate cortex (corresponding to the threat and social disconnection
   system), compassion training can strengthen positive affect and neural
   activations in the medial orbitofrontal cortex and striatum
   (corresponding to the reward and social connection system). These
   neuroimaging findings are complemented by results from behavioral
   studies showing that compassion is linked to helping and forgiveness
   behavior, whereas empathic distress not only decreases helping behavior,
   but is even associated with increased aggressive behavior. Taken
   together, these data provide encouraging evidence for the plasticity of
   adaptive social emotions with wide-ranging implications for basic
   science and applied settings.}},

Abstract = {{It has been long recognized that parents exert profound influences on
   child development. Dating back to at least the seventeenth-century
   Enlightenment, the ability for parents to shape child behavior in an
   enduring way has been noted. Twentieth-century scholars developed
   theories to explain how parenting histories influence psychological
   development, and since that time, the number of scientific publications
   on parenting influences in both human and nonhuman animal fields has
   grown at an exponential rate, reaching numbers in the thousands by 2015.
   This special issue describes a symposium delivered by Megan Gunnar,
   Regina Sullivan, Mar Sanchez, and Nim Tottenham in the Fall of 2014 at
   the Society for Social Neuroscience. The goal of the symposium was to
   describe the emerging knowledge on neurobiological mechanisms that
   mediate parent-offspring interactions across three different species:
   rodent, monkey, and human. The talks were aimed at designing testable
   models of parenting effects on the development of emotional and stress
   regulation. Specifically, the symposium aimed at characterizing the
   special modulatory (buffering) effects of parental cues on fear- and
   stress-relevant neurobiology and behaviors of the offspring and to
   discuss examples of impaired buffering when the parent-infant
   relationship is disrupted.}},

Abstract = {{Social buffering, a subset of social support, is the process through
   which the availability of a conspecific reduces the activity of
   stress-mediating neurobiological systems. While its role in coping and
   resilience is significant, we know little about its developmental
   history in humans. This brief review presents an integrative
   developmental account of the social buffering of
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) stress reactivity in humans,
   from infancy to adulthood. During infancy, parents are powerful
   stress-regulators for children, but child temperament also plays a role
   and interacts with parenting quality to predict the magnitude of stress
   responses to fear or pain stimuli. Recent work indicates that parental
   support remains a potent stress buffer into late childhood, but that it
   loses its effectiveness as a buffer of the HPA axis by adolescence.
   Puberty may be the switch that alters the potency of parental buffering.
   Beginning in middle childhood, friends may serve as stress buffers,
   particularly when other peers are the source of stress. By adulthood,
   romantic partners assume this protective role, though studies often
   reveal sex differences that are currently not well understood.
   Translational research across species will be critical for developing a
   mechanistic understanding of social buffering and the processes involved
   in developmental changes noted in this review.}},

Abstract = {{Social buffering, which is the attenuation of stress hormone release by
   a social partner, occurs in many species throughout the lifespan. Social
   buffering of the infant by the caregiver is particularly robust, and
   animal models using infant rodents are uncovering the mechanisms and
   neural circuitry supporting social buffering. At birth, the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress system is functional but is
   suppressed via extended social buffering by the mother: the profound
   social buffering effects of the mother can last for 1-2hours when pups
   are removed from the mother. At 10days of age, pups begin to mount a
   stress response immediately when separated from the mother. The stimuli
   from the mother supporting social buffering are broad, for tactile
   stimulation, milk, and an anesthetized mother (no maternal behavior) all
   sufficiently support social buffering. The mother appears to produce
   social buffering by blocking norepinephrine (NE) release into the
   hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which blocks HPA activation.
   Since the infant amygdala relies on the presence of corticosterone
   (CORT), this suggests that social buffering of pups by the mother
   attenuates the neurobehavioral stress response in infancy and prevents
   pups from learning about threat within mother-infant interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Social buffering, the phenomenon by which the presence of a familiar
   individual reduces or even eliminates stress- and fear-induced
   responses, exists in different animal species and has been examined in
   the context of the mother-infant relationship, in addition to adults.
   Although it is a well-known effect, the biological mechanisms that
   underlie it as well as its developmental impact are not well understood.
   Here, we provide a review of evidence of social and maternal buffering
   of stress reactivity in nonhuman primates, and some data from our group
   suggesting that when the mother-infant relationship is disrupted,
   maternal buffering is impaired. This evidence underscores the critical
   role that maternal care plays for proper regulation and development of
   emotional and stress responses of primate infants. Disruptions of the
   parent-infant bond constitute early adverse experiences associated with
   increased risk for psychopathology. We will focus on infant
   maltreatment, a devastating experience not only for humans, but for
   nonhuman primates as well. Taking advantage of this naturalistic animal
   model of adverse maternal caregiving, we have shown that competent
   maternal care is critical for the development of healthy attachment,
   social behavior, and emotional and stress regulation, as well as of the
   neural circuits underlying these functions.}},

   and the traits associated with status in both humans and nonhuman
   primates, and how status varies across development in humans. Our review
   finds that we can rapidly identify social status based on a wide range
   of cues. Like monkeys, we tend to use certain cues, like physical
   strength, to make status judgments, although layered on top of these
   more primitive perceptual cues are sociocultural status cues like job
   titles and educational attainment. One's relative status has profound
   effects on attention, memory, and social interactions, as well as health
   and wellness. These effects can be particularly pernicious in children
   and adolescents. Developmental research on peer groups and social
   exclusion suggests teenagers may be particularly sensitive to social
   status information, but research focused specifically on status
   processing and associated brain areas is very limited. Recent evidence
   from neuroscience suggests that there may be an underlying neural
   network, including regions involved in executive, emotional, and reward
   processing, that is sensitive to status information. We conclude with
   questions for future research as well as stressing the need to expand
   social neuroscience research on status processing to adolescents.}},

Title = {{Sidetracked by trolleys: Why sacrificial moral dilemmas tell us little

Abstract = {{Research into moral decision-making has been dominated by sacrificial
   dilemmas where, in order to save several lives, it is necessary to
   sacrifice the life of another person. It is widely assumed that these
   dilemmas draw a sharp contrast between utilitarian and deontological
   approaches to morality, and thereby enable us to study the psychological
   and neural basis of utilitarian judgment. However, it has been
   previously shown that some sacrificial dilemmas fail to present a
   genuine contrast between utilitarian and deontological options. Here, I
   raise deeper problems for this research paradigm. Even when sacrificial
   dilemmas present a contrast between utilitarian and deontological
   options at a philosophical level, it is misleading to interpret the
   responses of ordinary folk in these terms. What is currently classified
   as utilitarian judgment does not in fact share essential features of a
   genuine utilitarian outlook, and is better explained in terms of
   commonsensical moral notions. When subjects deliberate about such
   dilemmas, they are not deciding between opposing utilitarian and
   deontological solutions, but engaging in a richer process of weighing
   opposing moral reasons. Sacrificial dilemmas therefore tell us little
   about utilitarian decision-making. An alternative approach to studying
   proto-utilitarian tendencies in everyday moral thinking is proposed.}},

Title = {{RNAi knockdown of oxytocin receptor in the nucleus accumbens inhibits
   social attachment and parental care in monogamous female prairie voles}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{Oxytocin modulates many aspects of social cognition and behaviors,
   including maternal nurturing, social recognition and bonding. Natural
   variation in oxytocin receptor (OXTR) density in the nucleus accumbens
   (NAcc) is associated with variation in alloparental behavior, and
   artificially enhancing OXTR expression in the NAcc enhances alloparental
   behavior and pair bonding in socially monogamous prairie voles.
   Furthermore, infusion of an OXTR antagonist into the NAcc inhibits
   alloparental behavior and partner preference formation. However,
   antagonists can promiscuously interact with other neuropeptide
   receptors. To directly examine the role of OXTR signaling in social
   bonding, we used RNA interference to selectively knockdown, but not
   eliminate, OXTR in the NAcc of female prairie voles and examined the
   impact on social behaviors. Using an adeno-associated viral vector
   expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Oxtr mRNA, we reduced
   accumbal OXTR density in female prairie voles from juvenile age through
   adulthood. Females receiving the shRNA vector displayed a significant
   reduction in alloparental behavior and disrupted partner preference
   formation. These are the first direct demonstrations that OXTR plays a
   critical role in alloparental behavior and adult social attachment, and
   suggest that natural variation in OXTR expression in this region alone
   can create variation in social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Based on studies in rodents, the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is
   considered a key site for experience-dependent neural plasticity
   underlying the acquisition of conditioned fear responses. In humans,
   very few studies exist of subjects with selective amygdala lesions and
   those studies have only implicated the amygdala more broadly leaving the
   role of amygdala sub-regions underexplored. We tested a rare sample of
   subjects (N = 4) with unprecedented focal bilateral BLA lesions due to a
   genetic condition called Urbach-Wiethe disease. In a classical delay
   fear conditioning experiment, these subjects showed impaired acquisition
   of conditioned fear relative to a group of matched control subjects (N =
   10) as measured by fear-potentiation of the defensive eye-blink startle
   reflex. After the experiment, the BLA-damaged cases showed normal
   declarative memory of the conditioned association. Our findings provide
   new evidence that the human BLA is essential to drive fast classically
   conditioned defensive reflexes.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse aspects of physical, affective and cognitive health relate to
   social integration, reflecting engagement in social activities and
   identification with diverse roles within a social network. However, the
   mechanisms by which social integration interacts with the brain are
   unclear. In healthy adults (N = 155), we tested the links between social
   integration and measures of white matter microstructure using diffusion
   tensor imaging. Across the brain, there was a predominantly positive
   association between a measure of white matter integrity, fractional
   anisotropy (FA), and social network diversity. This association was
   particularly strong in a region near the anterior corpus callosum and
   driven by a negative association with the radial component of the
   diffusion signal. This callosal region contained projections between
   bilateral prefrontal cortices, as well as cingulum and corticostriatal
   pathways. FA within this region was weakly associated with circulating
   levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), but IL-6 did
   not mediate the social network and FA relationship. Finally, variation
   in FA indirectly mediated the relationship between social network
   diversity and intrinsic functional connectivity of medial
   corticostriatal pathways. These findings suggest that social integration
   relates to myelin integrity in humans, which may help explain the
   diverse aspects of health affected by social networks.}},

Abstract = {{This study systematically investigated the sensitivity of the phobic
   attention system by measuring event-related potentials (ERPs) in
   spider-phobic and non-phobic volunteers in a context where spider and
   neutral pictures were presented (phobic threat condition) and in
   contexts where no phobic but unpleasant and neutral or only neutral
   pictures were displayed (phobia-irrelevant conditions). In a
   between-group study, participants were assigned to phobia-irrelevant
   conditions either before or after the exposure to spider pictures
   (pre-exposure vs post-exposure participants). Additionally, each picture
   was preceded by a fixation cross presented in one of three different
   colors that were informative about the category of an upcoming picture.
   In the phobic threat condition, spider-phobic participants showed a
   larger P1 than controls for all pictures and signal cues. Moreover,
   individuals with spider phobia who were sensitized by the exposure to
   phobic stimuli (i.e. post-exposure participants) responded with an
   increased P1 also in phobia-irrelevant conditions. In contrast, no group
   differences between spider-phobic and non-phobic individuals were
   observed in the P1-amplitudes during viewing of phobia-irrelevant
   stimuli in the pre-exposure group. In addition, cues signaling neutral
   pictures elicited decreased stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) compared
   with cues signaling emotional pictures. Moreover, emotional pictures and
   cues signaling emotional pictures evoked larger early posterior
   negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) than neutral stimuli.
   Spider phobics showed greater selective attention effects than controls
   for phobia-relevant pictures (increased EPN and LPP) and cues (increased
   LPP and SPN). Increased sensitization of the attention system observed
   in spider-phobic individuals might facilitate fear conditioning and
   promote generalization of fear playing an important role in the
   maintenance of anxiety disorders.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Mood disorders are characterized by impaired emotion regulation
   abilities, reflected in alterations in frontolimbic brain functioning
   during regulation. However, little is known about differences in brain
   function when comparing regulatory strategies. Reappraisal and emotional
   acceptance are effective in downregulating negative affect, and are
   components of effective depression psychotherapies. Investigating neural
   mechanisms of reappraisal vs emotional acceptance in remitted major
   depressive disorder (rMDD) may yield novel mechanistic insights into
   depression risk and prevention. Thirty-seven individuals (18 rMDD, 19
   controls) were assessed during a functional magnetic resonance imaging
   task requiring reappraisal, emotional acceptance or no explicit
   regulation while viewing sad images. Lower negative affect was reported
   following reappraisal than acceptance, and was lower following
   acceptance than no explicit regulation. In controls, the acceptance >
   reappraisal contrast revealed greater activation in left insular cortex
   and right prefrontal gyrus, and less activation in several other
   prefrontal regions. Compared with controls, the rMDD group had greater
   paracingulate and right midfrontal gyrus (BA 8) activation during
   reappraisal relative to acceptance. Compared with reappraisal,
   acceptance is associated with activation in regions linked to somatic
   and emotion awareness, although this activation is associated with less
   reduction in negative affect. Additionally, a history of MDD moderated
   these effects.}},

Abstract = {{Humans show stronger empathy for in-group compared with out-group
   members' suffering and help in-group members more than out-group
   members. Moreover, the in-group bias in empathy and parochial altruism
   tend to be more salient in collectivistic than individualistic cultures.
   This work tested the hypothesis that modifying self-construals, which
   differentiate between collectivistic and individualistic cultural
   orientations, affects in-group bias in empathy for perceived own-race vs
   other-race pain. By scanning adults using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging, we found stronger neural activities in the mid-cingulate, left
   insula and supplementary motor area (SMA) in response to racial in-group
   compared with out-group members' pain after participants had been primed
   with interdependent self-construals. However, the racial in-group bias
   in neural responses to others' pain in the left SMA, mid-cingulate
   cortex and insula was significantly reduced by priming independent
   self-construals. Our findings suggest that shifting an individual's
   self-construal leads to changes of his/her racial in-group bias in
   neural responses to others' suffering.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of social psychological research suggests that we think
   quite positively of ourselves, often unrealistically so. Research on
   this `self-positivity bias' has relied mainly on self-report and
   behavioral measures, but these can suffer from a number of problems
   including confounds that arise from the desire to present oneself well.
   What has not been clearly assessed is whether the self-positivity bias
   influences the processing of incoming information as it unfolds in real
   time. In this study, we used event-related potentials to address this
   question. Participants read two-sentence social vignettes that were
   either self-or other-relevant. Pleasant words in self-relevant contexts
   evoked a smaller negativity between 300 and 500 ms (the N400 time
   window) than the same words in other-relevant contexts, suggesting that
   comprehenders were more likely to expect positive information when a
   scenario referred to themselves. This finding indicates that the
   self-positivity bias is available online, acting as a general schema
   that directly influences real-time comprehension.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperation and free riding are among the most frequently observed
   behaviors in human social decision-making. In social interactions, the
   effects of strategic decision processes have been consistently reported
   in iterative cooperation decisions. However, the neural activity
   immediately after new information is presented, the time at which
   strategy learning potentially starts has not yet been investigated with
   high temporal resolution. Here, we implemented an iterative, binary
   public goods game that simulates cooperation/free riding behavior. We
   applied the multi-feature pattern analysis method by using a support
   vector machine and the unique combinatorial performance measure, and
   identified neural features from the single-trial, event-related spectral
   perturbation at the result-presentation of the current round that
   predict participants' decisions to cooperate or free ride in the
   subsequent round. We found that neural oscillations in centroparietal
   and temporal regions showed the highest predictive power through 10-fold
   cross-validation; these predicted the participants' next decisions,
   which were independent of the neural responses during their own
   preceding choices. We suggest that the spatial distribution and
   time-frequency information of the selected features represent covert
   motivations to free ride or cooperate in the next round and are
   separately processed in parallel with information regarding the
   preceding results.}},

Abstract = {{In this functional neuroimaging study, we investigated neural
   activations during the process of learning to gain monetary rewards and
   to avoid monetary loss, and how these activations are modulated by
   individual differences in reward and punishment sensitivity. Healthy
   young volunteers performed a reinforcement learning task where they
   chose one of two fractal stimuli associated with monetary gain (reward
   trials) or avoidance of monetary loss (avoidance trials). Trait
   sensitivity to reward and punishment was assessed using the behavioral
   inhibition/ activation scales (BIS/BAS). Functional neuroimaging results
   showed activation of the striatum during the anticipation and reception
   periods of reward trials. During avoidance trials, activation of the
   dorsal striatum and prefrontal regions was found. As expected,
   individual differences in reward sensitivity were positively associated
   with activation in the left and right ventral striatum during reward
   reception. Individual differences in sensitivity to punishment were
   negatively associated with activation in the left dorsal striatum during
   avoidance anticipation and also with activation in the right lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex during receiving monetary loss. These results
   suggest that learning to attain reward and learning to avoid loss are
   dependent on separable sets of neural regions whose activity is
   modulated by trait sensitivity to reward or punishment.}},

Abstract = {{Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative condition.
   Patients with this movement disorder can exhibit deficits on tasks
   involving Theory of Mind (ToM): the ability to understand mental states
   such as beliefs and emotions. We investigated mental state inference in
   HD in response to ambiguous animations involving geometric shapes, while
   exploring the impact of symptoms within cognitive, emotional and motor
   domains. Forty patients with HD and twenty healthy controls described
   the events in videos showing random movements of two triangles (i.e.
   floating), simple interactions (e.g. following) and more complex
   interactions prompting the inference of mental states (e.g. one triangle
   encouraging the other). Relationships were explored between animation
   interpretation and measures of executive functioning, alexithymia and
   motor symptoms. Individuals with HD exhibited alexithymia and a reduced
   tendency to spontaneously attribute intentions to interacting triangles
   on the animations task. Attribution of intentions on the animations task
   correlated with motor symptoms and burden of pathology. Importantly,
   patients without motor symptoms showed similar ToM deficits despite
   intact executive functions. Subtle changes in ToM that are unrelated to
   executive dysfunction could therefore feature in basal ganglia disorders
   prior to motor onset.}},

Abstract = {{In face-to-face communication, speech is typically enriched by gestures.
   Clearly, not all people gesture in the same way, and the present study
   explores whether such individual differences in gesture style are taken
   into account during the perception of gestures that accompany speech.
   Participants were presented with one speaker that gestured in a
   straightforward way and another that also produced self-touch movements.
   Adding trials with such grooming movements makes the gesture information
   a much weaker cue compared with the gestures of the non-grooming
   speaker. The Electroencephalogram was recorded as participants watched
   videos of the individual speakers. Event-related potentials elicited by
   the speech signal revealed that adding grooming movements attenuated the
   impact of gesture for this particular speaker. Thus, these data suggest
   that there is sensitivity to the personal communication style of a
   speaker and that affects the extent to which gesture and speech are
   integrated during language comprehension.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is characterized by an increase in risk-taking and
   reward-seeking behaviors. In other populations, increased risk taking
   has been associated with tighter coupling between cortisol production
   and ventral striatum (VS) activation during reward anticipation; this
   relation has not yet been examined, however, as a function of adolescent
   development. This study examined the influence of pubertal development
   on the association between diurnal cortisol production and VS activity
   during reward anticipation. Pre- and post-menarcheal girls collected
   diurnal cortisol and completed an functional magnetic resonance
   imaging-based monetary incentive delay task, from which we extracted
   estimates of VS activity during the anticipation of reward, anticipation
   of loss and anticipation of non-incentive neutral trials.
   Post-menarcheal girls showed greater coupling between the cortisol
   awakening response and VS activation during anticipation of reward and
   loss than did their pre-menarcheal counterparts. Post-menarcheal girls
   did not differ from pre-menarcheal girls in their cortisol-VS coupling
   during anticipation of neutral trials, suggesting that puberty-related
   changes in cortisol-VS coupling are specific to affective stimuli.
   Interestingly, behavioral responses during the task indicate that
   post-menarcheal girls are faster to engage with affective stimuli than
   are pre-menarcheal girls. Thus, post-menarcheal girls exhibit
   neurobiological and behavioral patterns that have been associated with
   risk taking and that may underlie the dramatic increase in risk-taking
   behavior documented during adolescence.}},

   basis of aggression in healthy individuals. Here, we tested whether
   regional differences in white matter (WM) microstructure were associated
   with later reports of aggressive tendencies. We recontacted healthy
   young adults an average of 3 years after they underwent research MRI
   scans. Via electronic survey, we administered the Buss Perry Aggression
   Questionnaire. We divided aggression into Aggressive Thoughts (Anger and
   Hostility subscales) and Aggressive Acts (Verbal and Physical subscales)
   and used Tract-Based Spatial Statistics to test the relationship of
   those measures to WM microstructure. In 45 individuals age 15-30 at
   baseline, we observed significant relationships between Aggressive Acts
   and fractional anisotropy (FA) in a parietal region consistent with the
   superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). As the SLF has an established
   relationship to executive function, we performed an exploratory analysis
   in a subset of individuals with working memory data. Decreased FA in
   executive network regions, as well as working memory performance, were
   associated with later self-reported aggressive tendencies. This has
   implications for our healthy behavior understanding of as well as that
   of patient populations known to have executive dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{We tested two competing models for the brain basis of emotion, the basic
   emotion theory and the conceptual act theory of emotion, using
   resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging
   (rs-fcMRI). The basic emotion view hypothesizes that anger, sadness,
   fear, disgust and happiness each arise from a brain network that is
   innate, anatomically constrained and homologous in other animals. The
   conceptual act theory of emotion hypothesizes that an instance of
   emotion is a brain state constructed from the interaction of
   domain-general, core systems within the brain such as the salience,
   default mode and frontoparietal control networks. Using peak coordinates
   derived from a meta-analysis of task-evoked emotion fMRI studies, we
   generated a set of whole-brain rs-fcMRI `discovery' maps for each
   emotion category and examined the spatial overlap in their conjunctions.
   Instead of discovering a specific network for each emotion category,
   variance in the discovery maps was accounted for by the known
   domain-general network. Furthermore, the salience network is observed as
   part of every emotion category. These results indicate that specific
   networks for each emotion do not exist within the intrinsic architecture
   of the human brain and instead support the conceptual act theory of
   emotion.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala is a highly interconnected region of the brain that is
   critically important to emotional processing and affective networks.
   Previous studies have shown that the response of the amygdala to
   emotionally arousing stimuli can be modulated by sex hormones. Because
   oral contraceptive pills dramatically lower circulating sex hormone
   levels with potent analogs of those hormones, we performed a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging experiment to measure amygdala reactivity in
   response to emotional stimuli in women using oral contraceptives, and
   compared their amygdala reactivity with that of naturally cycling women.
   Here, we show that women who use oral contraceptive pills have
   significantly decreased bilateral amygdala reactivity in response to
   negatively valenced, emotionally arousing stimuli compared with
   naturally cycling women. We suggest that by modulating amygdala
   reactivity, oral contraceptive pills may influence behaviors that have
   previously been shown to be amygdala dependent-in particular, emotional
   memory.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that the association between oxytocin receptor
   polymorphism (OXTR rs53576) and emotion-related behavioral/psychological
   tendencies differs between individuals from East Asian and Western
   cultures. What remains unresolved is which specific dimension of
   cultural orientations interacts with OXTR rs53576 to shape these
   tendencies and whether such gene x culture interactions occurs at both
   behavioral and neural level. This study investigated whether and how
   OXTR rs53576 interacts with interdependence-a key dimension of cultural
   orientations that distinguish between East Asian and Western cultures-to
   affect human empathy that underlies altruistic motivation and prosocial
   behavior. Experiment 1 measured interdependence, empathy trait and OXTR
   rs53576 genotypes of 1536 Chinese participants. Hierarchical regression
   analyses revealed a stronger association between interdependence and
   empathy trait in G allele carriers compared with A/A homozygotes of OXTR
   rs53576. Experiment 2 measured neural responses to others' suffering by
   scanning A/A and G/G homozygous of OXTR rs53576 using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed
   stronger associations between interdependence and empathic neural
   responses in the insula, amygdala and superior temporal gyrus in G/G
   compared with A/A carriers. Our results provide the first evidence for
   gene x culture interactions on empathy at both behavioral tendency and
   underlying brain activity.}},

Abstract = {{Early timing of adrenarche, associated with relatively high levels of
   Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in children, has been associated with
   mental health and behavioral problems. However, little is known about
   effects of adreneracheal timing on brain function. The aim of this study
   was to investigate the effects of early adrenarche (defined by high DHEA
   levels independent of age) on affective brain function and symptoms of
   psychopathology in late childhood (N = 83, 43 females, M age 9.53 years,
   s.d. 0.34 years). Results showed that higher DHEA levels were associated
   with decreased affect-related brain activity (i) in the mid-cingulate
   cortex in the whole sample, and (ii) in a number of cortical and
   subcortical regions in female but not male children. Higher DHEA levels
   were also associated with increased externalizing symptoms in females,
   an association that was partly mediated by posterior insula activation
   to happy facial expressions. These results suggest that timing of
   adrenarche is an important moderator of affect-related brain function,
   and that this may be one mechanism linking early adrenarche to
   psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion regulation research has primarily focused on techniques that
   attenuate or modulate the impact of emotional stimuli. Recent evidence
   suggests that this mode regulation can be problematic in the context of
   regulation of emotion elicited by the suffering of others, resulting in
   reduced emotional connectedness. Here, we investigated the effects of an
   alternative emotion regulation technique based on the up-regulation of
   positive affect via Compassion-meditation on experiential and neural
   affective responses to depictions of individuals in distress, and
   compared these with the established emotion regulation strategy of
   Reappraisal. Using fMRI, we scanned 15 expert practitioners of
   Compassion-meditation either passively viewing, or using
   Compassion-meditation or Reappraisal to modulate their emotional
   reactions to film clips depicting people in distress. Both strategies
   effectively, but differentially regulated experienced affect, with
   Compassion primarily increasing positive and Reappraisal primarily
   decreasing negative affect. Imaging results showed that Compassion,
   relative to both passive-viewing and Reappraisal increased activation in
   regions involved in affiliation, positive affect and reward processing
   including ventral striatum and medial orbitfrontal cortex. This network
   was shown to be active prior to stimulus presentation, suggesting that
   the regulatory mechanism of Compassion is the stimulus-independent
   endogenous generation of positive affect.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies using fictional moral dilemmas indicate that both
   automatic emotional processes and controlled cognitive processes
   contribute to moral judgments. However, not much is known about how
   people process socio-normative violations that are more common to their
   everyday life nor the time-course of these processes. Thus, we recorded
   participants' electrical brain activity while they were reading
   vignettes that either contained morally acceptable vs unacceptable
   information or text materials that contained information which was
   either consistent or inconsistent with their general world knowledge. A
   first event-related brain potential (ERP) positivity peaking at similar
   to 200 ms after critical word onset (P200) was larger when this word
   involved a socio-normative or knowledge-based violation. Subsequently,
   knowledge-inconsistent words triggered a larger centroparietal ERP
   negativity at similar to 320 ms (N400), indicating an influence on
   meaning construction. In contrast, a larger ERP positivity (larger late
   positivity), which also started at similar to 320 ms after critical word
   onset, was elicited by morally unacceptable compared with acceptable
   words. We take this ERP positivity to reflect an implicit evaluative
   (good-bad) categorization process that is engaged during the online
   processing of moral transgressions.}},

Abstract = {{Social support is crucial for psychological and physical well-being.
   Yet, in experimental and clinical pain research, the presence of others
   has been found to both attenuate and intensify pain. To investigate the
   factors underlying these mixed effects, we administered noxious laser
   stimuli to 39 healthy women while their romantic partner was present or
   absent, and measured pain ratings and laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) to
   assess the effects of partner presence on subjective pain experience and
   underlying neural processes. Further, we examined whether individual
   differences in adult attachment style (AAS), alone or in interaction
   with the partner's level of attentional focus (manipulated to be either
   on or away from the participant) might modulate these effects. We found
   that the effects of partner presence vs absence on pain-related measures
   depended on AAS but not partner attentional focus. The higher
   participants' attachment avoidance, the higher pain ratings and N2 and
   P2 local peak amplitudes were in the presence compared with the absence
   of the romantic partner. As LEPs are thought to reflect activity
   relating to the salience of events, our data suggest that partner
   presence may influence the perceived salience of events threatening the
   body, particularly in individuals who tend to mistrust others.}},

Abstract = {{Given the determinant role of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in
   valuation, we examined whether vmPFC lesions also modulate how people
   scale political beliefs. Patients with penetrating traumatic brain
   injury (pTBI; N = 102) and healthy controls (HCs; N = 31) were tested on
   the political belief task, where they rated 75 statements expressing
   political opinions concerned with welfare, economy, political
   involvement, civil rights, war and security. Each statement was rated
   for level of agreement and scaled along three dimensions: radicalism,
   individualism and conservatism. Voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping
   (VLSM) analysis showed that diminished scores for the radicalism
   dimension (i.e. statements were rated as less radical than the norms)
   were associated with lesions in bilateral vmPFC. After dividing the pTBI
   patients into three groups, according to lesion location (i.e. vmPFC,
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex {[}dlPFC] and parietal cortex), we found
   that the vmPFC, but not the dlPFC, group had reduced radicalism scores
   compared with parietal and HC groups. These findings highlight the
   crucial role of the vmPFC in appropriately valuing political behaviors
   and may explain certain inappropriate social judgments observed in
   patients with vmPFC lesions.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Although task-switching has been investigated extensively, its
   interaction with emotionally salient task content remains unclear.
   Prioritized processing of affective stimulus content may enhance
   accessibility of affective task-sets and generate increased interference
   when switching between affective and non-affective task-sets. Previous
   research has demonstrated that more dominant task-sets experience
   greater switch costs, as they necessitate active inhibition during
   performance of less entrenched tasks. Extending this logic to the
   affective domain, the present experiment examined (a) whether affective
   task-sets are more dominant than non-affective ones, and (b) what neural
   mechanisms regulate affective task-sets, so that weaker, non-affective
   task-sets can be executed. While undergoing functional magnetic
   resonance imaging, participants categorized face stimuli according to
   either their gender (non-affective task) or their emotional expression
   (affective task). Behavioral results were consistent with the affective
   task dominance hypothesis: participants were slower to switch to the
   affective task, and cross-task interference was strongest when
   participants tried to switch from the affective to the non-affective
   task. These behavioral costs of controlling the affective task-set were
   mirrored in the activation of a right-lateralized frontostriatal network
   previously implicated in task-set updating and response inhibition.
   Connectivity between amygdala and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
   was especially pronounced during cross-task interference from affective
   features.}},

Abstract = {{Neural correlates of unfairness perception depend on who is the target
   of the unfair treatment. These previous findings suggest that the
   activation of medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is related to unfairness
   perception only when the subject of the measurement is also the person
   affected by the unfair treatment. We aim at demonstrating the
   specificity of MPFC involvement using transcranial direct current
   stimulation (tDCS), a technique that induces cortical excitability
   changes in the targeted region. We use a modified version of the
   Ultimatum Game, in which responders play both for themselves (myself-MS
   condition) and on behalf of an unknown third-party (TP condition), where
   they respond to unfairness without being the target of it. We find that
   the application of cathodal tDCS over MPFC decreases the probability of
   rejecting unfair offers in MS, but not in TP; conversely, the same
   stimulation increases the probability of rejecting fair offers in TP,
   but not in MS. We confirm the hypothesis that MPFC is specifically
   related to processing unfairness when the self is involved, and discuss
   possible explanations for the opposite effect of the stimulation in TP.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual behavior involves motivational processes. Findings from both
   animal models and neuroimaging in humans suggest that the recruitment of
   neural motor networks is an integral part of the sexual response.
   However, no study so far has directly linked sexual motivation to
   physiologically measurable changes in cerebral motor systems in humans.
   Using transcranial magnetic stimulation in hetero- and homosexual men,
   we here show that sexual motivation modulates cortical excitability.
   More specifically, our results demonstrate that visual sexual stimuli
   corresponding with one's sexual orientation, compared with
   non-corresponding visual sexual stimuli, increase the excitability of
   the motor cortex. The reflection of sexual motivation in motor cortex
   excitability provides evidence for motor preparation processes in sexual
   behavior in humans. Moreover, such interrelationship links theoretical
   models and previous neuroimaging findings of sexual behavior.}},
