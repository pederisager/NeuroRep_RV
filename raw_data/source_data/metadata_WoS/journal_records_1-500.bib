Abstract = {{Perceiving, integrating, and interpreting multimodal signals are
   essential for social success, but the neural substrates mediating these
   functions are not fully understood. This study examined the role of the
   amygdala in processing bimodal species-specific vocalizations using eye
   tracking in rhesus macaques. Looking behavior of 6 adult rhesus monkeys
   with neonatal amygdala lesions (Neo-A(ibo); 3M, 3F) was compared with
   that of 6 sham-operated controls (Neo-C; 3M, 3F). Two side-by-side
   videos of unknown male conspecifics emitting different vocalizations
   were presented with the audio signal matching one video. The percentage
   of time spent looking at each video was used to assess crossmodal
   integration ability and the percentages of time spent looking at a
   priori regions of interest (ROIs; eyes, mouth, and rest of each video)
   were used to characterize scanning patterns. Both groups looked more to
   one video, indicating that early amygdalar damage did not impair
   crossmodal integration of complex social signals. However, scanning
   patterns differed across groups as a function of sex and stimulus
   parameter. Whereas Neo-C males exhibited differential viewing to the eye
   and mouth regions as a function of the relative identity of the stimulus
   animals and Neo-C females made similar distinctions as a function of the
   relative valence of the vocalizations in females, Neo-Aibo males and
   females scanned these regions similarly across all trial types. The
   results suggest that neonatal amygdala damage alters the ability to
   perceive the social relevance of stimulus features, and are consistent
   with a role of the amygdala in the recognition of the social salience of
   complex cues.}},

Title = {{Beyond Romance: Neural and Genetic Correlates of Altruism in Pair-Bonds}},

Abstract = {{Altruism is an evolutionarily conserved neurobehavioral mechanism for
   responding to others' needs, even at a cost to the self. It is thought
   to be rooted in offspring care and is most prominent in kin and close
   relationships, but also extends to others. We investigated the neural
   and genetic (OXTR rs53576 and AVPR1a rs3) correlates of altruism (with
   the Agape scale) in newlywed pair-bonds. Using functional MRI, 18
   participants were scanned (T1) while viewing happy or sad face images of
   the partner; of a stranger; or of a highly familiar, neutral
   acquaintance (HFN). Thirteen returned for another scan 11 months later
   (T2), and the additional control of a neutral expression of the partner
   and stranger was added. At both time points, the right ventral pallidum
   (VP), ventral tegmental area, and caudate showed significant responses
   to Partner (romantic) versus HFN images. At T2, altruism scores, OXTR
   rs53576 G alleles, and AVPR1a rs3 long alleles showed positive
   correlations with activity in the left VP/accumbens, amygdala, and
   septum for both Happy and Sad Partner expressions compared to neutral
   expressions, but not for strangers. However, when the Happy or Sad
   partner was compared to a Happy or Sad stranger, positive correlations
   were limited mainly to the amygdala/entorhinal cortex region. This study
   localized neural correlates of altruism in pair-bonds, including the VP
   and the amygdala. Also, responsivity in the VP showed increases or
   decreases as a function of OXTR and AVPR1a variants. These variations
   may contribute to behavioral heterogeneity and diverse strategies
   observed in complex social behaviors. In conclusion, the neural and
   hormonal basis of altruism in pair-bonds may be phylogenetically
   conserved, yet genetically variable, and promote pair-bond stability and
   enhance survival and cooperation of the species.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
   tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) are regulated by gonadal hormone
   signaling and are expressed in brain areas that are important for sexual
   behaviors. Accordingly, BDNF and TrkB signaling have been shown to be
   important for the expression of consummatory sexual behaviors. However,
   the role of TrkB in sexually motivated behaviors remains to be fully
   elucidated. To this end, male rats were administered either the TrkB
   antagonist, ANA-12, or a vehicle control prior to sexual motivation
   testing, which took place on a noncontact version of a partner
   preference task. Vehicle treated rats, but not rats treated with ANA-12,
   exhibited a preference for the sexually receptive stimulus female rat
   relative to the sexually active stimulus male rat, as indicated by the
   percentage of time and entries in the vicinity of the female throughout
   the entire 20-min test. In addition, when compared directly with vehicle
   treated rats, rats treated with ANA-12 exhibited a significant decrease
   in levels of sexual motivation as indicated by the magnitude of each
   group's preference for the female during the early stages of testing.
   Collectively, these results suggest that TrkB plays a role in the sexual
   preferences and corresponding initial levels of sexual motivation in
   male rats.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the well-established fact that maternal care plays a pivotal
   role in the offspring development, little is known about the effects of
   disruption of maternal care early in life on the development of this
   behavior in the offspring. Using brief repeated maternal separation (45
   min/day on postnatal Days 3-6), which represents a model of early life
   stress, we found behavioral changes in adult female mice offspring. The
   decrease in home cage exploratory behavior (both pup-directed and
   nonpup-directed) was revealed later in adulthood without changes in
   maternal care level. Maternal separation coupled with pain exposure
   caused by subcutaneous saline injection procedure had a cumulative
   resulting effect, which was manifested in the decreased level of nursing
   associated with licking-grooming in adult females. The behavioral
   changes found in adult female offspring could be triggered by identified
   changes in the behavior of their mothers, while alterations of the level
   of histone H3 acetylation in the neonatal brain were not detected.
   Histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium valproate was used in order to
   study the possibility of preventing the effects of early life stress
   through involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. Despite the increase in
   the level of histone H3 acetylation in the neonatal brain caused by
   valproate, its behavioral effects were barely detectable. These effects
   were reflected in prevention of the reduction of nursing associated with
   licking-grooming induced by maternal separation, accompanied by pain
   exposure. The data are discussed in terms of the possible application to
   the studies of mechanisms underlying long-term effects of human early
   life trauma.}},

Abstract = {{Research shows that memory for a context generalizes (i.e., becomes less
   precise) over time. In this series of experiments, we examined the
   impact of early life stress on context generalization. Early life stress
   was modeled using a maternal separation procedure, whereby pups were
   separated from the dam for 3 hr a day from postnatal Day 2 to 14, or
   reared as normal. In adulthood, rats were trained to fear a context, and
   were then tested for freezing in either the training context or a
   generalization context. Across 5 experiments, we found that maternally
   separated animals showed generalization when tested 1 day after training
   (Experiments 1a, 2, 3a, 3b), whereas standard reared rats discriminated
   at this time point (Experiments 1a \& 3b). When tested 1 week after
   training, all rats generalized (Experiment 1b). Furthermore, maternally
   separated animals froze more to the training context than the
   generalization context when tested 1 hour after training (Experiment 2),
   indicating that the increased generalization expressed by these animals
   when tested after 1 day is not due to a general inability to
   discriminate. Manipulations that have been found to reduce
   generalization in standard reared animals failed to enhance memory
   specificity at the 1-day retention interval in maternally separated
   animals (i.e., a pretest reminder, Experiment 3a, and context
   preexposure, Experiment 3b). Thus, early life stress results in faster
   generalization that is more resistant to treatments designed to enhance
   memory specificity.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals tend to make riskier decisions in response to stress. The
   magnitude of the stress effect on decision-making under risk seems to
   depend on the stressor type and the decision situation. We examined the
   effects of physiological and combined physiological and psychosocial
   stress on decision-making under risk and whether risk taking differs
   between women and men. Ninety female (n = 45) and male (n = 45) students
   completed a decision-making under risk task with explicit probabilities
   and without feedback after exposure to physiological (Cold Pressor Test,
   CPT), combined physiological and psychosocial (Socially Evaluated Cold
   Pressor Test, SECPT), or no stress (Warm Water Test, WWT). Subjective
   stress ratings, salivary cortisol, blood pressure, and heart rate
   indicated increased stress reactions to the CPT and SECPT compared with
   the WWT. We found no effect of condition, indicating no difference in
   risk taking between the CPT, SECPT, and WWT. We did find a sex effect,
   showing that men made riskier decisions compared with women.
   Unexpectedly, a Condition x Sex interaction indicated increased risk
   taking in men compared with women in reaction to the CPT and in women in
   reaction to the SECPT compared with the WWT. In summary, our results
   suggest that the sex of the individuum making the decision in
   combination with the stressor type influence decisions made under risk.}},

Abstract = {{This study focused on genetically determined versus acquired factors in
   shaping anxiety-related behavior by combining cross-breeding and
   cross-fostering approaches. Via cross-breeding of HAB (high
   anxiety-related behavior) female and LAB (low anxiety-related behavior)
   male mice, we obtained F1 hybrids with intermediate anxiety levels
   carrying genetic characteristics of both parental lines. Pups were
   raised either by their biological HAB (noncross-fostered control) or
   foster LAB (cross-fostered) mothers. Compared to controls, 6-week-old
   offspring raised by LAB mothers showed lower levels of anxiety in the
   elevated plus-maze and open field, but not the light-dark box, tests. No
   differences were found in the forced swim test reflecting active versus
   passive coping. The behavioral changes were associated with increased
   stress-induced concentrations of plasma corticosterone in cross-fostered
   animals. The expression of the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor
   type I and glucocorticoid receptor genes did not differ in limbic and
   hypothalamic brain areas between cross-fostered and control mice. The
   data suggest that LAB-typical maternal care may partially shift
   behavioral and neuroendocrine characteristics of F1 crosses carrying
   both HAB and LAB alleles from intermediate toward reduced
   anxiety-related behavior.}},

Title = {{Differential Involvement of D2 and D3 Receptors During Reinstatement of

Abstract = {{Roman high-(RHA) and low-avoidance (RLA) rats have been used as a model
   for drug-addiction, showing, respectively, high-and low-responding to
   psychostimulants, and low versus high dopamine D2/3 receptors (D2/3R)
   striatal density. Previous studies indicated a major involvement of
   D2/3R on reinstatement of cocaine seeking, although the respective role
   of the two receptor subtypes is not clear. Here, we investigated
   sensitivity to cocaine self-administration (SA) through a dose-response
   protocol in RHAs and RLAs, and reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior at
   15 days and 5 weeks following withdrawal. Compared to RLAs, RHAs
   confirmed a higher vulnerability to cocaine SA that was not related to a
   difference in sensitivity to the drug, as highlighted by the
   dose-response analysis. Both at early and late withdrawal, RHAs showed
   higher susceptibility than RLAs to reinstatement of drug-seeking when
   cocaine was used as a primer, but the two sublines did not differ when
   primed with the D2/3R agonist quinpirole. Moreover, while the specific
   D2R antagonist L741,626 blocked, the specific D3R antagonist SB-277011A
   failed to impair cocaine-primed relapse. The higher vulnerability of RHA
   versus RLA rats to cocaine-primed relapse, which contrasts with their
   similar vulnerability to quinpirole-primed relapse, suggests that the
   different propensity of both sublines to relapse likely relies on
   presynaptic rather than postsynaptic mechanisms. Moreover, our study
   challenges the involvement of D3R in the mechanisms underlying relapse
   to cocaine addiction, at least in conditions that may involve high
   levels of dopaminergic stimulation, and supports a major role of
   postsynaptic D2R over D3R in the vulnerability to relapse.}},

Abstract = {{Pairing a taste with either internal pain or nausea, despite equivalent
   effects on voluntary consumption, has dissociable effects on hedonic
   responses: Only pairing with nausea results in the production of disgust
   reactions, while pairing with internal pain results in conditioned fear
   as indicated by immobility. Here, we use orofacial reactions to examine
   the hedonic responses elicited by contextual, nonflavor, cues paired
   with nausea produced by injection of lithium chloride (LiCl) or internal
   pain caused by injection of hypertonic saline. In Experiment 1, aversive
   orofacial responses were the specific context-elicited behaviors in the
   rats injected with LiCl, whereas immobility was seen in the animals
   injected with hypertonic saline. In Experiment 2, rats first received
   discriminative training with two contexts, where one context was paired
   with LiCl or hypertonic saline, and the other context with isotonic
   saline. After this, rats were intraorally infused with a flavor
   (conditioned stimulus (CS)+) in the paired context, and with a different
   flavor (CS-) in the unpaired context. Second-order conditioning was then
   examined in a test conducted in the unpaired context. The infusion of
   the CS+ flavor produced aversive orofacial responses in the rats
   injected with LiCl but immobility in the subjects injected with
   hypertonic saline. The results suggest that nonflavor cues support
   conditioned hedonic responses in the same way as flavor cues, which
   implies that the quality of aversion learning (conditioned nausea vs.
   fear) is primarily determined by the nature of the aversive event and
   not the type of conditioned cue.}},

Abstract = {{Given the increasing prevalence of and severity of complications
   associated with obesity, there is great need for treatments resulting in
   prolonged weight loss. Long-term maintenance of weight loss requires
   sustained changes in food-intake and energy-expenditure strategies,
   which are unfortunately often taxing, resulting in a return to
   predieting weight. Therefore, drug therapies may facilitate greater
   adherence to a restricted diet and prolong weight loss. One such drug is
   rapamycin (RAP), a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor.
   Here, we show that a single injection of RAP dampens the hyperphagic
   response in calorically restricted rats when they are returned to free
   feed immediately or 10 days after injection. Moreover, we demonstrate
   that a single injection of RAP given to calorically restricted rats
   prevents body-weight regain when animals are returned to free feed
   either immediately or 10 days after injection. Furthermore, we extend
   our previous findings that RAP does not produce malaise or illness and
   show that RAP does not produce any behavioral deficits that may inhibit
   an animal from eating. Thus, we suggest that mTOR may be a useful target
   in obesity research, given that its inhibition may decrease the
   hyperphagic response following caloric restriction.}},

Abstract = {{Habitual behavior can be advantageous by increasing the availability of
   cognitive resources for use in other tasks. However, habitual behaviors
   are problematic when they are coopted to prolong the maladaptive
   responding present in several psychopathologies such as substance abuse,
   dysregulated fear responding in posttraumatic stress disorder, and
   obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although sex differences exist in the
   occurrence or progression of these psychopathologies, there are no
   studies that compare the development of habitual behavior systematically
   in male and female animals. In the present study, male and female rats
   were identically trained on a variable interval 30-s (VI 30-s) schedule
   of reinforcement to nose-poke for sucrose pellet reinforcers.
   Subsequently, the sucrose was devalued in one half of the animals by
   pairing its presentation with injections of lithium chloride (LiCl) to
   induce nausea, thus conditioning a taste aversion. Habitual behavior was
   operationalized as continued operant responding in an extinction test
   following devaluation of the sucrose reinforcer. Successful devaluation
   was confirmed with both a consumption and reacquisition test. Given
   identical training to 240 sucrose pellets, female rats demonstrate
   habitual behavior whereas male rats remain goal-directed. Additionally,
   females are habitual after 200 or 160 reinforcers earned on a VI 30-s
   schedule, but remain goal-directed at 120 and 80 reinforcers on this
   schedule. These data suggest that behavioral flexibility may be
   compromised in female rats compared to males due to accelerated habit
   formation in females. These results are important because sex
   differences are present in several psychopathologies, which may be
   related to differences in the development of habitual behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Sign-and goal-tracking behavior signifies the influence of opposed
   cognitive-motivational styles, with the former being characterized by a
   tendency for approaching and contacting reward cues, including a
   readiness for attending, bottom-up, to salient cues, and a relatively
   greater vulnerability for developing and maintaining addiction-like
   behaviors. We previously demonstrated that these styles also impact the
   cognitive-motor interactions that are taxed during traversal of dynamic
   surfaces, with goal-trackers (GTs) making less movement errors and
   falling less frequently than sign-trackers (STs). The present experiment
   tested the hypothesis that complex movement control in GTs, but not STs,
   depends on activation of the basal forebrain projection system to
   telencephalic regions. Chemogenetic inhibition of the basal forebrain
   increased movement errors and falls in GTs during traversal of a
   rotating zigzag rod but had no significant effect on the relatively
   lower performance of STs. Neurochemical evidence confirmed the efficacy
   of the inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer
   drug (DREADD). Administration of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) had no
   significant effect in GTs not expressing the DREADD. These results
   indicate that GTs, but not STs, activate the basal forebrain projection
   system to mediate their relatively superior ability for complex movement
   control. STs may also serve as an animal model in research on the role
   of basal forebrain systems in aging-and Parkinson's disease-associated
   falls.}},

Abstract = {{Akt protein family (Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3) of serine/threonine kinases,
   also known as protein kinase B, are enzymes implicated in many
   physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous system.
   A striking feature of these enzymes is their ability to interact with
   several molecular targets such as the glycogen synthase kinase 3
   (GSK-3). Among Akt isoforms, the Akt3 is significantly more expressed in
   the brain and the present investigation was designed to determine
   whether the Akt3/GSK-3 pathway plays a role in the learning of a complex
   motor skill. Using the accelerating rotarod task, known to reproduce
   different motor learning phases, we demonstrated in mouse models that
   genetic deletion of GSK-3 alpha or GSK-3 beta had no effect on rotarod
   performances. However, Akt3 deletion robustly compromised rotarod
   learning when compared with wild-type animals. Biochemical analysis in
   the striatum revealed modifications in the levels of both phosphorylated
   GSK-3 and tau in Akt3-deficient mice, which are reminiscent of enhanced
   GSK-3 activity. In this line, we observed that both biochemical and
   motor learning impairments were prevented in Akt3-deficent mice by
   chronic treatments with lithium, a well-known GSK-3 inhibitor.
   Altogether, our findings raised the interesting possibility that
   interconnection between Akt3 and GSK-3 kinases is required in the
   learning of new complex motor tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Spontaneous interpersonal synchronization of rhythmic behavior such as
   gait or hand clapping is a ubiquitous phenomenon in human interactions,
   and is potentially important for social relationships and action
   understanding. Although several authors have suggested a role of the
   mirror neuron system in interpersonal coupling, the underlying brain
   mechanisms are not well understood. Here we argue that more general
   theories of neural computations, namely predictive coding and the Free
   Energy Principle, could explain interpersonal coordination dynamics.
   Each brain minimizes coding costs by reducing the mismatch between the
   representations of observed and own motor behavior. Continuous mutual
   prediction and alignment result in an overall minimization of free
   energy, thus forming a stable attractor state.}},

Abstract = {{Positive emotional perceptions and healthy emotional intelligence (EI)
   are important for social functioning. In this study, we investigated
   whether loving kindness meditation (LKM) combined with anodal
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) would facilitate
   improvements in EI and changes in affective experience of visual
   stimuli. LKM has been shown to increase positive emotional experiences
   and we hypothesized that tDCS could enhance these effects. Eighty-seven
   undergraduates were randomly assigned to 30 minutes of LKM or a
   relaxation control recording with anodal tDCS applied to the left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left dlPFC) or right temporoparietal
   junction (right TPJ) at 0.1 or 2.0 milliamps. The primary outcomes were
   self-reported affect ratings of images from the International Affective
   Picture System and EI as measured by the Mayer, Salovey and Caruso
   Emotional Intelligence Test. Results indicated no effects of training on
   EI, and no main effects of LKM, electrode placement, or tDCS current
   strength on affect ratings. There was a significant interaction of
   electrode placement by meditation condition (p = 0.001), such that those
   assigned to LKM and right TPJ tDCS, regardless of current strength,
   rated neutral and positive images more positively after training.
   Results suggest that LKM may enhance positive affective experience.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-40}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Recent research emphasizes the importance of social factors during
   performance monitoring. Thus, the current study investigated the impact
   of social stimuli -such as communicative gestures- on feedback
   processing. Moreover, it addressed a shortcoming of previous studies,
   which failed to consider stimulus complexity as potential confounding
   factor. Twenty-four volunteers performed a time estimation task while
   their electroencephalogram was recorded. Either social complex, social
   non-complex, non-social complex, or non-social non-complex stimuli were
   used to provide performance feedback. No effects of social dimension or
   complexity were found for task performance. In contrast,
   Feedback-Related Negativity (FRN) and P300 amplitudes were sensitive to
   both factors, with larger FRN and P300 amplitudes after social compared
   to non-social stimuli, and larger FRN amplitudes after complex positive
   than non-complex positive stimuli. P2 amplitudes were solely sensitive
   to feedback valence and social dimension. Subjectively, social complex
   stimuli were rated as more motivating than non-social complex ones.
   Independently of each other, social dimension and visual complexity
   influenced amplitude variation during performance monitoring. Social
   stimuli seem to be perceived as more salient, which is corroborated by
   P2, FRN and P300 results, as well as by subjective ratings. This could
   be explained due to their given relevance during every day social
   interactions.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has demonstrated that comparing two persons activates
   a frontoparietal network associated with numbers and nonsocial
   magnitudes. However, it is unclear whether this network is also
   recruited by comparisons involving the self. Self-reflection engages
   self-serving motivations (e.g., the maintenance of a positive
   self-image) and is associated with specific brain structures, such as
   the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the anterior insula (AI) and the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Self-other comparisons may thus rely on
   distinct neural activity. To clarify this question, we used fMRI and
   asked female participants to compare their own attractiveness (or the
   attractiveness of a familiar woman) to pictures of unknown women.
   Participants were slower for comparisons with targets whose
   attractiveness was similar to their own (or their familiar other). Yet
   although this behavioral result resembles the distance effect reported
   for nonsocial magnitudes, at the brain level, it was linked to the
   activity of the AI, the ACC and the MPFC. The effect of distance in
   these regions was stronger for self-other than familiar-other
   comparisons. We interpret these results in relation to previous
   literature in social psychology and social neuroscience.}},

Abstract = {{Shame and guilt have been compared in many behavioral and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging studies. However, the time course of shame
   and guilt processing remains unknown. We conducted an event-related
   potential (ERP) study to investigate the temporal dynamics of shame and
   guilt in an interpersonal context. Behaviorally, participants reported
   ``shame{''} when their wrong advice was correctly rejected by a
   confederate, whereas reported ``guilt{''} when their wrong advice
   resulted in economic loss of a confederate. The ERP results showed
   significant difference between the shame and guilt conditions in the
   early P2 component (140-220 ms) over the frontal region and the alpha
   oscillations (240-1000 ms) over the parietal region. No significant
   difference was found between the shame and guilt conditions in the N2,
   P3, and theta oscillations. These results supported previous findings
   that shame compared to guilt involves more self-referential processing,
   whereas guilt compared to shame involves more empathetic processing, and
   provided evidence that the distinction between shame and guilt could
   occur in an early stage.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) polymorphisms, lower ventral striatum (VS)
   response to social stimuli, and lower economic privilege have been
   independently associated with depression and anxiety. However, the
   interactions between these risk factors are unknown. One hundred and
   fifty-seven healthy adult participants genotyped for OXTR rs237915
   completed a common emotion-matching task during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. Past economic privilege and depression and anxiety
   symptoms were concurrently assessed through validated self-report
   measures. The data revealed an interaction between rs237915 genotype and
   economic privilege on the neural response to negative faces. C-carriers
   showed decreased VS activation and increased connectivity between the VS
   and ventromedial prefrontal cortex with increased economic privilege. TT
   homozygotes showed the reverse pattern. Low VS response to negative
   faces predicted increased social anxiety, but only for those with either
   lower economic privilege or the C allele. For those with both, low VS
   response was associated with paradoxically lower social anxiety.
   Findings suggest that economic privilege and OXTR rs237915 genotype may
   calibrate social motivational neural systems for better or worse. While
   lower VS response to negative faces may generally constitute a risk
   factor for social anxiety, lower response to social cues may be a
   benefit for those with dual risk.}},

Abstract = {{Familial stressors, such as weak familial connectedness, are associated
   with the development of maladaptive threat processing, yet little is
   known regarding how weak familial bonds impinge on biological mechanisms
   of threat processing. The present study leveraged multivoxel pattern
   analysis of fMRI data to compare the neural encoding of familial and
   nonfamilial threatening and non-threatening stimuli in adolescents who
   endorsed varying levels of connectedness to their families. Adolescents
   (N = 22, Mage = 14.38 years) reporting lower family connectedness 1 year
   earlier showed elevated sensitivity to familial threat, but not to
   nonfamilial threat in a neural network associated with threat
   processing, comprising left and right amygdala, and right inferior and
   middle temporal gyri. Results suggest that a learning history about
   one's social environment may shape neural mechanisms of threat
   processing by sensitizing them to risk-relevant stimuli. Such findings
   advance our understanding of how familial stressors contribute to
   disordered threat processing in adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying faces is a process central for social interaction and a
   relevant factor in eyewitness theory. False recognition is a critical
   mistake during an eyewitness's identification scenario because it can
   lead to a wrongful conviction. Previous studies have described neural
   areas related to false facial recognition using the standard
   Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm, triggering related false
   recognition. Nonetheless, misidentification of faces without trying to
   elicit false memories (unrelated false recognition) in a police lineup
   could involve different cognitive processes, and distinct neural areas.
   To delve into the neural circuitry of unrelated false recognition, we
   evaluated the memory and response confidence of participants while
   watching faces photographs in an fMRI task. Functional activations of
   unrelated false recognition were identified by contrasting the
   activation on this condition vs. the activations related to recognition
   (hits) and correct rejections. The results identified the right
   precentral and cingulate gyri as areas with distinctive activations
   during false recognition events suggesting a conflict resulting in a
   dysfunction during memory retrieval. High confidence suggested that
   about 50\% of misidentifications may be related to an unconscious
   process. These findings add to our understanding of the construction of
   facial memories and its biological basis, and the fallibility of the
   eyewitness testimony.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research on testosterone and risk-taking behavior is beginning to
   focus on the role of context-dependent changes in testosterone.
   Extending this research, our study investigated the association between
   testosterone reactivity to competitive outcomes and risk-taking in the
   context of a video game based competition. The study also examined
   whether self-construal moderated this relationship. Results indicated
   that a rise in testosterone during competition did not predict
   subsequent risk-taking behavior. However, a rise in testosterone during
   competition predicted subsequent risk-taking behaviors within winners
   with independent self-construals. Nevertheless, results did not reveal
   an association between basal testosterone and risk-taking, nor did
   competitive outcomes modulate a differential testosterone response.
   Overall, we treat these findings as preliminary, as there were multiple
   analyses conducted and effect sizes were relatively small. We discuss
   these results in the context of recent animal findings that testosterone
   facilitates success at future competitions after winning a competition,
   as well as recent research suggesting self-construal moderates
   associations between testosterone and aggression.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{This study used a joint flanker task to investigate differences in
   processing of social and non-social nogo cues, i.e., between cues
   indicating that a co-actor should respond and cues signaling that
   neither actor nor co-actor should respond, using event-related
   potentials (ERPs) and trial-to-trial response times (RTs). It was
   hypothesized that a social co-actor's response should be reflected in
   stronger modulation (slower RTs on subsequent trials; augmented neural
   responses) for social compared to non-social nogo. RTs and ERPs
   replicated flanker compatibility effects, with faster responses and
   increased P3a on compatible trials. In line with the hypotheses, ERPs
   revealed distinct coding of social and non-social nogo in the
   conflict-sensitive N2 which showed a compatibility effect only for
   social nogo, and in the attention/memory-related P3b which was larger
   for social relative to non-social nogo. The P3a did not distinguish
   between social and non-social nogo, but was larger for compatible and
   smaller for go trials. Contrary to our hypotheses, RTs were faster after
   social relative to non-social nogo. Hence, the representation of the
   co-actor's response in joint action modulates conflict processing
   reflected in the N2 and response discrimination and evaluation reflected
   in the P3b and may facilitate subsequent responses in the context of
   social versus non-social nogo.}},

Abstract = {{Differing from basic emotions such as happiness, gratitude and elevation
   are important other-praising emotions. Previous behavioral studies have
   established that these complex emotions differ from each other; however,
   it remains under-investigated whether proneness to these emotions have
   common or distinct neuroanatomical correlates. Here we used voxel-based
   morphometry to identify the common and distinct neuroanatomical
   correlates of trait (i.e. proneness to) gratitude and elevation. We used
   the Gratitude Questionnaire-6 and the trait elevation scale to measure
   these affective traits. We demonstrated that trait gratitude was
   positively correlated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the left
   cerebellum extending to fusiform gyrus, and also the right middle
   occipital gyrus (MOG) extending to posterior superior temporal sulcus
   (pSTS) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ), while trait elevation was
   negatively correlated with GMV in the left dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex. While controlling each other, all the regions still held
   significant, except the right MOG and pSTS/TPJ. The results indicate
   that there are distinct neuroanatomical correlates for proneness to
   gratitude and elevation, while the evidence is mixed that pSTS/TPJ may
   be the common correlates for them. The implications of these findings
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive reappraisal is associated with major depressive disorder
   (MDD), while spontaneous activity patterns of the default mode network
   (DMN) is implicated in reappraisal and MDD. However, neural mechanisms
   subserving the close association of spontaneous reappraisal and
   depression are unclear. Spontaneous reappraisal, depression and
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were measured from
   105 healthy subjects. We assessed the temporal complexity (Hurst
   exponent), Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional Amplitude of Low
   Frequency Fluctuation (fALFF) profiles of DMN, a network involved in
   both reappraisal and depression. Mediation effects of these standard
   measures on the relationship between reappraisal and depression, and the
   contributions of each DMN subregion, were assessed. Results indicated
   that Hurst exponent (H) of DMN, whether extracted by independent
   component analysis or region of interest, was significantly associated
   with reappraisal scores. An individual with a higher reappraisal score
   has a lower Hurst value of DMN. Mediation analyses suggest that H of DMN
   partially mediates the association between reappraisal and the degree of
   depression, and this mediation effect arises from the contribution of
   medial prefrontal cortex. Neither ReHo nor fALFF showed a similar
   correlation or mediation effect. These findings suggest that temporal
   dynamics of DMN play an important role in emotion regulation and its
   association with depression. H of DMN may serve as a neural marker
   mediating the association between reappraisal and depression.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has demonstrated that reward-related neural activity
   is enhanced for choice relative to no-choice opportunities in the gain
   context. The current event-related potential study examined whether this
   modulatory effect of choice can be observed in both the gain and the
   loss contexts across anticipatory and consummatory phases of incentive
   processing. Thirty-two participants performed a simple choice task
   during which choices were made either by themselves (a choice condition)
   or by a computer (a no-choice condition) during a gain context (gain vs
   nongain) and a loss context (nonloss vs loss). Behaviorally,
   participants reported a higher level of perceived control in the choice
   than the no-choice condition as well as in the gain than loss context.
   During the anticipatory phase, the choice relative to the no-choice
   condition elicited an increased cue-P3 in the loss context and an
   enhanced stimulus-preceding negativity in the gain context. During the
   consummatory phase, the choice condition elicited a larger reward
   positivity (Delta RewP) than the no-choice condition in the gain
   relative to the loss context but a comparable feedback P3 across
   contexts. These findings demonstrate that the crucial role of voluntary
   choice in reward processing is contingent upon contextual valence.}},

Abstract = {{Anhedonia is associated with multiple forms of psychopathology, yet
   relatively, little is known about how anhedonia develops. Emerging
   evidence suggests that anhedonia is the result of interactions between
   life stress and the brain's reward systems, and that social stress, in
   particular, may drive these processes. One potent form of social stress
   is peer victimization, but very little research has focused on peer
   victimization beyond adolescence, and even less has examined the
   associations between peer victimization and neural response to rewards.
   The present study sought to identify associations between past-year
   history of peer victimization and neural response to rewards in emerging
   adults (N = 61). Relational and physical forms of victimization were
   assessed separately since these distinct types of social stress have
   different trajectories across development and different associations
   with psychopathology. Reward sensitivity was indexed with the
   event-related potential component known as the reward positivity, which
   was elicited using a forced-choice monetary reward guessing task.
   Results demonstrated that past-year relational, but not physical,
   victimization was associated with a blunted neural response to rewards.
   These findings provide insight into one potential mechanism in the
   etiology of anhedonia, which may, in turn, help us to better identify
   pathways to multiple psychopathologies.}},

   mental simulation of action, which has been argued to support internal
   representation of others' emotional states. Despite the proposed role of
   simulation in emotion perception, little is known about the effect of
   emotional content on mu-suppression. We recorded high-density EEG while
   participants viewed point-light displays of emotional vs neutral body
   movements in `coherent' biologically plausible and `scrambled'
   configurations. Although coherent relative to scrambled stimuli elicited
   mu-alpha suppression, the comparison of emotional and neutral movement,
   controlling for basic visual input, revealed suppression effects in both
   alpha and beta bands. Whereas alpha-band activity reflected reduced
   power for emotional stimuli in central and occipital sensors, beta power
   at frontocentral sites was driven by enhancement for neutral relative to
   emotional actions. A median-split by autism-spectrum quotient score
   revealed weaker mu-alpha suppression and beta enhancement in
   participants with autistic tendencies, suggesting that sensorimotor
   simulation may be differentially engaged depending on social
   capabilities. Consistent with theories of embodied emotion, these data
   support a link between simulation and social perception while more
   firmly connecting emotional processing to the activity of sensorimotor
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation models of facial expressions propose that sensorimotor
   regions may increase the clarity of facial expressions representations
   in extrastriate areas. We monitored the event-related potential marker
   of visual working memory (VWM) representations, namely the sustained
   posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), also termed contralateral
   delay activity, while participants performed a change detection task
   including to-be-memorized faces with different intensities of anger. In
   one condition participants could freely use their facial mimicry during
   the encoding/VWM maintenance of the faces while in a different condition
   participants had their facial mimicry blocked by a gel. Notably, SPCN
   amplitude was reduced for faces in the blocked mimicry condition when
   compared to the free mimicry condition. This modulation interacted with
   the empathy levels of participants such that only participants with
   medium-high empathy scores showed such reduction of the SPCN amplitude
   when their mimicry was blocked. The SPCN amplitude was larger for full
   expressions when compared to neutral and subtle expressions, while
   subtle expressions elicited lower SPCN amplitudes than neutral faces.
   These findings provide evidence of a functional link between mimicry and
   VWM for faces and further shed light on how this memory system may
   receive feedbacks from sensorimotor regions during the processing of
   facial expressions.}},

Abstract = {{People socialized in different cultures differ in their thinking styles.
   Eastern-culture people view objects more holistically by taking context
   into account, whereas Western-culture people view objects more
   analytically by focusing on them at the expense of context. Here we
   studied whether participants, who have different thinking styles but
   live within the same culture, exhibit differential brain activity when
   viewing a drama movie. A total of 26 Finnish participants, who were
   divided into holistic and analytical thinkers based on self-report
   questionnaire scores, watched a shortened drama movie during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. We compared intersubject correlation (ISC)
   of brain hemodynamic activity of holistic vs analytical participants
   across the movie viewings. Holistic thinkers showed significant ISC in
   more extensive cortical areas than analytical thinkers, suggesting that
   they perceived the movie in a more similar fashion. Significantly higher
   ISC was observed in holistic thinkers in occipital, prefrontal and
   temporal cortices. In analytical thinkers, significant ISC was observed
   in right-hemisphere fusiform gyrus, temporoparietal junction and frontal
   cortex. Since these results were obtained in participants with similar
   cultural background, they are less prone to confounds by other possible
   cultural differences. Overall, our results show how brain activity in
   holistic vs analytical participants differs when viewing the same drama
   movie.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)
   modulating intrinsic neural oscillations has spawned interest in
   applying tACS to treat psychiatric disorders associated with aberrant
   neural oscillations. The alpha rhythmic activity is known to dominate
   neural oscillations at the awake, restful state, while attenuated
   resting-state alpha activity has been implicated in anxious mood.
   Administering repeated alpha-frequency tACS (alpha-tACS; at individual
   peak alpha frequency; 8-12 Hz) over four consecutive days (in the
   experiment group, sham stimulation in the control group), we
   demonstrated immediate and lasting (>24 h) increases in resting-state
   posterior -> frontal connectivity in the alpha frequency, quantified by
   Granger causality. Critically, this connectivity enhancement was
   accompanied by sustained reductions in both anxious arousal and negative
   perception of sensory stimuli. Resting-state alpha power also increased,
   albeit only transiently, reversing to the baseline level within 24 h
   after tACS. Therefore, the lasting enhancement of long-range alpha
   connectivity due to alpha-tACS differs from local alpha activity that is
   nonetheless conserved, highlighting the adaptability of alpha
   oscillatory networks. In light of increasing recognition of large-scale
   network dysfunctions as a transdiagnostic pathophysiology of psychiatric
   disorders, this enduring connectivity plasticity, along with the
   behavioral improvements, paves the way for tACS applications in clinical
   interventions of psychiatric `oscillopathies'.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated cultural differences regarding social
   connectedness in association with social vs non-social comparison
   feedback. We performed electroencephalography in 54 Chinese and 49
   Western adults while they performed a time estimation task in which
   response-accuracy feedback was either delivered pertaining to
   participants' own performance (non-social reference frame) or to the
   performance of a reference group (social reference frame). Trait
   interdependence and independence were assessed using a cultural
   orientations questionnaire. Applying a principal component approach, we
   observed divergent effects for the two cultural groups during feedback
   processing. In particular, Feedback-Related Negativity results indicated
   that non-social (vs social) reference feedback was more
   salient/motivating for Chinese participants, while Westerners showed the
   opposite pattern. The results suggest that Chinese individuals perceive
   a non-social context as more salient than a social comparison context,
   possibly due to their extensive experience of social comparisons in
   daily life. The reverse pattern was found in Western participants, for
   whom a social comparison context is less common and presumably more
   salient. The cultural differences in neural responses to social vs
   non-social feedback might be caused by culturally diverse cognitive
   traits, as well as by exposure to culturally defined behaviour on a
   systemic level-such as the education system.}},

   red letter `T' while angry or neutral face distractors appeared or

   attentional capture effects were found in response to abruptly appearing
   distractors in both groups. The patient group showed significant
   attentional dwelling effects in response to the angry face distractor
   only. Patients showed increased neural activity in the amygdala,

   compared with those of controls for the abruptly appearing angry
   distractor. Patients also maintained increased activities in brain
   regions related to attentional reorienting to distractor, namely the TPJ
   and IFG in line with their behavioral results of attentional holding
   effects. Our results indicate that patients with SAD showed prolonged
   attentional bias to task-irrelevant social threats. The underlying
   mechanism of prolonged attentional bias in SAD was indicated with
   amygdala hyperactivity and continued activity of the bottom-up attention
   network including the TPJ and IFG.}},

Abstract = {{It is frequently assumed that infants are impaired in contextual memory
   and consequently, in recovery from extinction, a phenomenon considered
   to be context dependent. However, the evidence in the field is far from
   consistent with this interpretation, since several studies have shown
   context-dependent extinction in infant rats using a variety of
   procedures and behavioral measures. This discussion has primarily been
   based on studies using Pavlovian conditioning tasks. Three experiments
   were conducted to study reinstatement of an extinguished operant
   response and additionally to evaluate the context dependence of such an
   effect. Preweanling rats were trained on postnatal days (PDs) 16 and 17
   to acquire an appetitive operant response using chocolate milk as
   reinforcer. At PD18 the operant response was extinguished and at PD19
   animals received a reminder in the same (Experiment 1 and 2) or in a
   different context than the one used during the extinction phase
   (Experiment 3). Infant rats showed recovery from extinction after a
   reminder treatment (Experiments 2 and 3). This effect was dependent on
   the context in which the reminder was delivered (Experiment 3). Our
   results indicate that infant rats can recover an extinguished operant
   response by means of a reminder treatment in a context-dependent way,
   highlighting the importance of the context for modulating learning
   processes during infancy.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined whether selective neonatal hippocampal lesions in
   monkeys (Macaca mulatta), which left the surrounding cortical areas
   (parahippocampal cortex) intact, affect contextual learning and memory
   compared with controls. Monkeys were tested with an automated
   touch-screen apparatus so that stimuli and contextual cues could be
   manipulated independently of one another. The data suggest that animals
   with neonatal hippocampal lesions have sparing of function with regard
   to contextual learning and memory when (a) contextual information is
   irrelevant or (b) relevant for good discrimination performance, and (c)
   when transferring a contextual rule to new discriminations. These
   findings are at odds with studies examining contextual learning and
   memory in monkeys with selective adult-onset hippocampal lesions, and
   those with nonselective neonatal hippocampal lesions, which have
   demonstrated impairment in contextual learning and memory. Therefore,
   the sparing of function seen in this study may be attributable to the
   early nature of the damage and the plastic nature of the infant brain,
   as well as the intact medial temporal lobe cortical areas as a result of
   the lesion methodology. Specifically, by removing the hippocampus early
   in life, before it has begun to function, the parahippocampal (TH/TF)
   and perirhinal cortices and its interactions with the lateral prefrontal
   cortex may be able to support context processing throughout life.}},

Abstract = {{The context preexposure facilitation effect (CPFE) is a variant of
   contextual fear conditioning in which learning about the context
   (preexposure) and associating the context with a shock (training) occur
   on separate occasions. The CPFE is sensitive to a range of neonatal
   alcohol doses (Murawski \& Stanton, 2011). The current study examined
   the impact of neonatal alcohol on Egr-1 mRNA expression in the
   infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) subregions of the mPFC, the CA1 of
   dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), and the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA),
   following the preexposure and training phases of the CPFE. Rat pups were
   exposed to a 5.25 g/kg/day single binge-like dose of alcohol (Group
   EtOH) or were sham intubated (SI; Group SI) over postnatal days (PD)
   7-9. In behaviorally tested rats, alcohol administration disrupted
   freezing. Following context preexposure, Egr-1 mRNA was elevated in both
   EtOH and SI groups compared with baseline control animals in all regions
   analyzed. Following both preexposure and training, Group EtOH displayed
   a significant decrease in mPFC Egr-1 mRNA expression compared with Group
   SI. However, this decrease was greatest after training. Training day
   decreases in Egr-1 expression were not found in LA or CA1 in Group EtOH
   compared with Group SI. A second experiment confirmed that the
   EtOH-induced training-day deficits in mPFC Egr-1 mRNA expression were
   specific to groups which learned contextual fear (vs. nonassociative
   controls). Thus, memory processes that engage the mPFC during the
   context-shock association may be most susceptible to the teratogenic
   effects of neonatal alcohol.}},

Title = {{Analysis of Learning Deficits in Aged Rats on the W-Track Continuous

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Young and aged animals were tested on a spatial alternation task that
   consisted of two interleaved components: (1) an ``outbound{''} or
   alternation component (working memory) and (2) an ``inbound{''}
   component, requiring the animal to remember to return to a central
   location in space (spatial memory). In the present study, aged rats made
   more outbound errors throughout testing, resulting in significantly more
   days to reach learning criterion, as compared to young rats.
   Furthermore, while all animals were able to learn the
   hippocampus-dependent inbound component of the task, most aged animals
   remained just above chance on the outbound component, even after
   extended testing days. Aged rats may be more impaired on the outbound
   part of the task because it requires cooperation of both the hippocampus
   and mPFC, each of which is compromised with age. In addition to
   presenting these results, we compare one commonly used analysis
   (repeated measures ANOVA) and two less common hierarchical modeling
   techniques (hierarchical generalized linear model and state-space random
   effects model) to determine the best method for comparing population
   learning over time. We found that hierarchical modeling is the most
   appropriate for this task and that a state-space model better captures
   the behavioral responses.}},

Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{One of the cognitive symptoms observed in schizophrenia is decreased
   flexibility in several tasks, including reversal learning. Reversal
   learning has previously been tested in rats following maternal immune
   activation (MIA), a risk factor for schizophrenia, with varying results.
   Whereas some previous studies have shown that MIA rats are slower to
   learn a reversal, others have reported more rapid learning compared with
   controls. Several of these latter studies have, however, used a T-maze
   task with aversive, negative reinforcement as a motivating factor.
   Because most human studies use positive reinforcement in reversal tasks,
   here we tested whether reinforcement valence might be a critical factor.
   We ran male MIA and control rats in a T-maze reversal procedure that was
   very similar to previous studies except that positive, appetitive
   reinforcement was used for motivation. The results showed that MIA
   animals performed similarly to controls during training, but in contrast
   to the previous, aversively motivated T-maze studies, slower reversal
   learning was observed. These results show that MIA animals are impaired
   in reversal learning under conditions of positive reinforcement,
   consistent with the effects observed in individuals with schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Effort-based decision-making paradigms have recently been used to
   measure motivation in healthy subjects and patients with
   neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present study, we developed a novel
   effort-discounting paradigm using a touch-panel system in common
   marmosets. Marmosets were trained to choose between a low-reward (a
   piece of cake) requiring low-effort (one touch response) versus
   high-reward (three pieces of cake) requiring one of three different
   effort levels (one, two, or four touch responses). Because the number of
   trials per session was kept constant, the selection of the high-reward
   choice was always the optimal strategy to receive the maximum number of
   rewards. Marmosets' high-reward rates were reduced as the physical
   effort requirement was increased, when they were tested using effort
   discounting in either ascending or descending order of effort intensity.
   It indicates that marmosets' decisions could be attributable to
   cost-benefit evaluation, but not to their fatigue or satisfaction with
   the reward during the progression of the paradigm. The high dose of
   dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist SCH-39166 (0.03 mg/kg) reduced the
   high-reward choice rate, only when more effort was required to obtain
   the high-reward than the low-reward. On the other hand, the D-2 receptor
   antagonist raclopride (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg) unexpectedly did not affect
   the high-reward choice rate, but the high dose did increase omission
   rate. Our finding suggests that dopamine D-1 receptor signaling may play
   a more important role in effort-based decision making than D-2 receptor
   signaling in marmosets. Our novel behavioral paradigm would be useful in
   translational research focused on motivational deficits.}},

Abstract = {{Although steroids are widely known to affect behavior through activation
   of nuclear/cytosolic receptors ({''}genomic{''} effects), steroids can
   also rapidly affect behavior via modulation of signal transduction
   pathways ({''}nongenomic,{''} fast actions, or rapid effects). In zebra
   finches, there is evidence that sex steroids have context-specific
   effects on pair-maintenance behavior, on both acute and chronic
   time-scales. Here, we quantified the effects of orally administered
   testosterone and 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on pair-maintenance behavior. We
   show that E2 rapidly affects female, but not male, affiliative behavior
   profiles during a partner separation and reunion paradigm. More
   specifically, E2 rapidly (within 5-15 min of administration) increased
   females' spatial proximity to a partner. This effect was present
   regardless of breeding condition (water restriction or water ad
   libitum). Combined, these results contribute to a growing body of
   evidence implicating sex steroids in the regulation of prosocial
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{We previously demonstrated that 40 days of prior midlife estradiol
   treatment results in enhanced spatial memory in aging ovariectomized
   rats long after termination of the estradiol treatment. Our current goal
   was to determine whether this benefit is due to lasting impacts on
   memory specifically of previous exogenous estradiol treatment or simply
   due to delaying cognitive deficits that occur following loss of ovarian
   hormones. Middle-aged rats were ovariectomized or underwent sham
   surgery. Ovariectomized rats received estradiol (Previous Estradiol) or
   vehicle (Previous Vehicle) implants. Rats undergoing sham surgery
   (Previous Intact) received vehicle implants. Forty days later, Previous
   Intact rats were ovariectomized, the other 2 groups underwent sham
   surgeries, and all implants were removed. Thus, no ovarian or
   exogenously administered hormones were present during behavior testing.
   Rats underwent 24 days of acquisition training on an 8-arm radial maze.
   Following acquisition and again 2 months later, rats were tested on
   delay trials, during which animals had to remember the location of food
   rewards across time delays inserted between fourth and fifth arm
   choices. During acquisition, rats that had previous extended exposure to
   exogenous estradiol (Previous Estradiol) and endogenous ovarian hormones
   (Previous Intact) significantly outperformed rats that did not
   experience extended hormone exposure (Previous Vehicle). However, during
   delays trials the Previous Estradiol group significantly outperformed
   both the Previous Vehicle and Previous Intact groups. Results
   demonstrate that whereas extended exposure to endogenous ovarian
   hormones may provide short-term cognitive benefits, midlife estradiol
   treatment following ovariectomy provides additional benefits that
   persist for months following termination of treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Research has implicated the deep cerebellar nuclei in autism. This study
   questioned whether fastigial nuclei abnormalities account for some of
   the irregular social behaviors seen in autism. Bilateral cannulation
   surgery was performed on 13 rats. An ABABAB reversal design was
   implemented. All animals received a microinfusion of saline during the
   baseline (A) phases. The experimental animal was placed in an open field
   with an unfamiliar confederate animal, and social interactions between
   the two animals were measured for 10 min. Seven animals received
   microinfusions of bupivacaine during the treatment phases (B), which
   temporarily inactivated the fastigial nuclei. Six control animals
   received saline again, and social interaction was retested. This
   sequence was executed 3 times over 6 days to achieve an ABABAB reversal
   design. Because the cerebellum is involved in motor behavior, the
   animals' locomotion was analyzed to ensure results were not because of
   locomotor deficits. A gait analysis and distance traveled in the open
   field were used to measure locomotion. No differences were found in
   locomotor behavior. Results of the social interaction analyses indicate
   animals with inactivated fastigial nuclei engage in less intense social
   interactions and engage in more behaviors to prevent social interaction.
   Knowledge that the fastigial nuclei mediate social interaction can
   further the understanding of pathology in the autistic brain and lead to
   breakthrough treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive and emotional functions are supported by the coordinated
   activity of a distributed network of brain regions. This coordinated
   activity may be disrupted by psychosocial stress, resulting in the
   dysfunction of cognitive and emotional processes. Graph theory is a
   mathematical approach to assess coordinated brain activity that can
   estimate the efficiency of information flow and determine the centrality
   of brain regions within a larger distributed neural network. However,
   limited research has applied graph-theory techniques to the study of
   stress. Advancing our understanding of the impact stress has on global
   brain networks may provide new insight into factors that influence
   individual differences in stress susceptibility. Therefore, the present
   study examined the brain connectivity of participants that completed the
   Montreal Imaging Stress Task (Goodman et al., 2016; Wheelock et al.,
   2016). Salivary cortisol, heart rate, skin conductance response, and
   self-reported stress served as indices of stress, and trait anxiety
   served as an index of participant's disposition toward negative
   affectivity. Psychosocial stress was associated with a decrease in the
   efficiency of the flow of information within the brain. Further, the
   centrality of brain regions that mediate emotion regulation processes
   (i.e., hippocampus, ventral prefrontal cortex, and cingulate cortex)
   decreased during stress exposure. Interestingly, individual differences
   in cortisol reactivity were negatively correlated with the efficiency of
   information flow within this network, whereas cortisol reactivity was
   positively correlated with the centrality of the amygdala within the
   network. These findings suggest that stress reduces the efficiency of
   information transfer and leaves the function of brain regions that
   regulate the stress response vulnerable to disruption.}},

Abstract = {{Down-regulation of negative emotions has been shown to reliably inhibit
   the emotion-modulated startle reflex, but it remains unclear whether the
   timing of the startle probe influences the quantification of emotion
   regulation with this measure. Moreover, it is not known whether the
   degree of startle inhibition corresponds to the subjective attenuation
   of negative emotions. Therefore, the two main goals of the study were,
   first, to systematically analyze the effect of probe time on startle
   inhibition and, second, to explore the association between subjectively
   perceived down-regulation of arousal and valence and the degree of
   startle inhibition. We presented negative and neutral pictures to N = 47
   participants. Pictures were paired with the instruction to reappraise or
   to maintain the emotions elicited by these pictures. Probes were
   delivered at three different times during a 12.5-s regulation phase, and
   the startle response was measured with electromyography. Valence and
   arousal ratings were assessed after each trial. Results revealed no
   significant impact of probe time on startle inhibition during
   reappraisal. Startle inhibition and perceived down-regulation of arousal
   were significantly and positively correlated, whereas perceived
   down-regulation of valence was not. The results provide important
   implications for future studies in terms of startle probe timing and
   shed light onto the interpretation of startle inhibition as an indicator
   of subjective attenuation of negative emotions.}},

Abstract = {{Acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) is a commonly used
   over-the-counter pain medication, but recent evidence suggests that a
   single exposure or prenatal exposure may have significant behavioral
   effects. This investigation aimed to determine whether acetaminophen
   could disrupt memory formation in an object-recognition task and to
   quantify potential changes in memory-related signaling cascades in the
   hippocampus of mice after acetaminophen administration. Using male mice,
   we examined the effect of a single subcutaneous injection of
   acetaminophen on the object-recognition task, a single-trial,
   hippocampus-dependent memory task. We also investigated potential
   changes in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
   in the dorsal mouse hippocampus 1 hr after a subcutaneous injection of
   acetaminophen. We found that 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg interfered with
   performance in the object-recognition memory task, whereas 10 mg/kg did
   not. We also found that a single 50 mg/kg injection of acetaminophen
   significantly increased p42 ERK phosphorylation in the dorsal mouse
   hippocampus. Overall, these results suggest that a single dose of
   acetaminophen can have significant effects on memory and alters
   signaling kinases critical for memory consolidation. Further work is
   needed to determine the involved mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In psychological experiments, behavioral speed varies across trials, and
   this variation is often associated with corresponding fluctuations in
   cortical activity. Little is known about such cortical variations in
   semantic priming tasks where target words are matched with preceding
   sensory object cues. Here, two visually presented target words
   ({''}pear{''} and ``lilac{''}) were repeatedly cued by corresponding
   odors or pictures, and the participants were to indicate matching or
   nonmatching combinations. Data were split in behaviorally ``fast{''}
   versus ``slow{''} trials. We hypothesized that slow trials would be
   associated with higher prestimulus alpha activity and reduced ERP
   amplitudes, and that response-time differences between odor-cued and
   picture-cued trials would be especially large in slow behavioral trials.
   Results confirmed that slow trials showed increased alpha-band activity
   prior to word target onset, as well as amplitude decreases in the
   sensory P1 and semantic N400 components. However, no interactions
   between cue-modality and processing speed were observed. Instead,
   odor-cue integration responses were uniquely delayed on incongruent
   trials, a novel behavioral effect that was not observed in EEG measures.
   The results show that semantic integration speed is reflected in
   cortical activity before and during stimulus processing. Behavioral
   interactions with cue modality did not correspond to observed cortical
   activity changes, perhaps because olfactory circuits are not readily
   observed in scalp-recorded EEG. We conclude that combining behavioral
   speed variability and cortical EEG measures is useful in understanding
   the fluctuating nature of cognitive processing sequences.}},

Abstract = {{Limb immobilization paradigms are increasingly used to investigate
   changes in brain plasticity and support potential rehabilitation
   techniques that might help counteract motor impairments. Yet, it remains
   unclear how unilateral arm immobilization may influence the sensorimotor
   representation and functional output for both arms. Using a randomized
   crossover design, 14 participants underwent a baseline test, followed by
   two experimental conditions separated by 1 week: a right (dominant) arm
   immobilization phase over a period of 8 hr and a no-immobilization (or
   control) phase also lasting 8 hr. Before and after each condition,
   participants were tested on a hand laterality judgment task to assess
   changes in sensorimotor representation of the hands, followed by an
   out-and-back reaching motor task measuring changes in spatiotemporal
   components of motor actions. Data from the hand laterality judgment task
   revealed that participants were faster at identifying right-hand
   pictures after the control phase, but such improvement was not observed
   after the immobilization phase, with no effect of immobilization for
   pictures depicting the overused left hand. Results from the reaching
   motor task revealed that the right-arm movement planning component was
   altered after immobilization, whereas there was no effect for the
   overused left arm. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that an 8-hr
   period of unilateral immobilization affects sensorimotor representation
   and functions of the corresponding limb, but not of the overused,
   nonimmobilized hand.}},

Abstract = {{Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability, though current
   rehabilitative strategies fail to yield complete recovery. Focused
   training of the impaired limb improves functional outcome in rodents,
   but these strategies require intensive training that is difficult to
   practice in humans. Because aerobic exercise has been found to induce
   beneficial changes in the brain, it is a promising rehabilitative
   strategy after stroke. The current study investigated the effect of
   voluntary poststroke aerobic exercise on functional outcome in young and
   aged mice. Mice were trained on a skilled reaching task before receiving
   focal ischemic stroke and being subdivided into 3 different groups for
   rehabilitative training: traditional skilled reach rehabilitation,
   aerobic exercise, and control procedures. Both young and aged mice
   benefited from aerobic exercise after stroke, though the behavioral
   profile somewhat differed. Aerobic exercise in young mice yielded
   poststroke performance levels that were equivalent to preinjury levels.
   In aged mice, aerobic exercise accelerated improvement in motor
   performance without an effect on the absolute level of performance
   compared with controls. Our results suggest that aerobic exercise may be
   an effective alternative or adjunctive rehabilitative strategy after
   stroke. Potential mechanisms of this effect need to be further
   investigated.}},

Title = {{Pain Chronification and Chronic Pain Impair a Defensive Behavior, But
   Not the Ability of Acute Pain to Facilitate It, Through the Activation
   of an Endogenous Analgesia Circuit}},

Abstract = {{The endogenous ability to decrease pain perception during
   life-threatening situations is crucial to the prevention of recuperative
   behaviors and to leave the subject free to engage in appropriated
   defensive responses. We have previously shown that acute pain activates
   the ascending nociceptive control-an endogenous analgesia circuit
   dependent on opioid mechanisms within nucleus accumbens-to facilitate
   the tonic immobility response, an innate defensive behavior. Now we
   asked whether chronic pain and pain chronification impairs either the
   tonic immobility response or the ability of acute pain to facilitate it
   by activating the ascending nociceptive control. We found a significant
   decrease in the duration of the tonic immobility response in rats during
   the induction and maintenance phases of the persistent mechanical
   hyperalgesia. This finding suggests that chronic pain and its
   development impair defensive responses. However, during the induction
   and maintenance phases of persistent hyperalgesia, the ascending
   nociceptive control activation, by a forepaw capsaicin injection,
   increased the tonic immobility response, an effect prevented by the
   blockade of mu-opioid receptors within nucleus accumbens. This finding
   suggests that pain chronification and chronic pain do not prevent the
   ability of acute pain to facilitate the defensive behavior of tonic
   immobility by activating the ascending nociceptive control. Therefore,
   although chronic pain states decrease the ability to engage in a
   defensive behavior, they may not prevent the expression of defensive
   behaviors during life-threatening situations accompanied by acute pain.
   The biological purpose of such a mechanism may be to increase the
   chances of survival of a wounded subject exposed to acute pain in a
   novel life-threatening situation.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research demonstrates that aversive stimuli can interrupt
   appetitive processing and that brain regions involved with the
   processing of potential rewards, such as the ventral striatum (VS), also
   respond to threatening information. Potential losses can likewise
   activate the VS and, thus, the full extent to which threat can impact
   neural responses during incentive processing remains unclear. Here,
   unpredictable threat of shock was used to induce anxiety while
   participants performed the monetary incentive delay (MID) task during
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During anticipation,
   anxiety impacted neural responses within the bilateral VS and
   distributed regions of the occipital cortex. Anxiety enhanced activity
   within the VS to both gain and loss trials. Furthermore, anxiety
   enhanced activity to both gain and loss trials within dorsal areas of
   BA19. However, anxiety only enhanced activity during gain, but not loss
   trials, within ventral areas of BA19. These results suggest that during
   anticipation, induced anxiety enhanced VS activity to incentives
   generally, which might reflect changes in the subjective salience of
   gains and losses. Collectively, these results suggest that the impact of
   induced anxiety on responses to monetary incentives depend on the neural
   region, type of incentive, and stage of processing.}},

Abstract = {{Pain is modulated by social context. Recent neuroimaging studies have
   shown that romantic partners can provide a potent form of social support
   during pain. However, such studies have only focused on passive support,
   finding a relatively late-onset modulation of pain-related neural
   processing. In this study, we examined for the first time dynamic touch
   by one's romantic partner as an active form of social support.
   Specifically, 32 couples provided social, active, affective (vs active
   but neutral) touch according to the properties of a specific C-tactile
   afferent pathway to their romantic partners, who then received
   laser-induced pain. We measured subjective pain ratings and early N1 and
   later N2-P2 laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) to noxious stimulation, as
   well as individual differences in adult attachment style. We found that
   affective touch from one's partner reduces subjective pain ratings and
   similarly attenuates LEPs both at earlier (N1) and later (N2-P2) stages
   of cortical processing. Adult attachment style did not affect LEPs, but
   attachment anxiety had a moderating role on pain ratings. This is the
   first study to show early neural modulation of pain by active, partner
   touch, and we discuss these findings in relation to the affective and
   social modulation of sensory salience.}},

Abstract = {{Witnessing exemplary actions triggers admiration, a positive emotion
   that can pertain to concrete skills, or move the onlooker beyond
   physical characteristics to appreciate the abstract, moral implications.
   Participants reacted to narratives depicting skilled or virtuous
   protagonists first during a videotaped interview then during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We analyzed participants' gaze
   aversion (an indicator of disengaging from the immediate environment)
   and cognitive construals (mentions of concrete characteristics vs
   abstract beliefs and values) during the interview, and relations to
   individuals' subsequent neural activations. When participants averted
   their gaze, they were more likely to mention abstract construals, and
   both behaviors were more likely when reacting to virtue. Gaze aversion
   to virtue narratives predicted greater subsequent activation for those
   narratives in dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC), involved in
   visual attention control. The inferior-posterior posteromedial cortices
   (ipPMC), a default mode network hub involved in abstract thought,
   activated only to virtue, and activity level reflected individuals'
   tendency to abstract construals. Critically, dPCC and ipPMC activity
   sequentially mediated the relationship between individuals' gaze and
   abstract construal tendencies. No such relationships existed for
   reactions to skill, despite participants reporting equivalently strong
   positive emotion. In appreciating virtue, dPCC may support individuals
   in transcending the viewable context, facilitating ipPMC activity and
   moral construals.}},

Abstract = {{Interpersonal sensorimotor synchronization (interpersonal SMS) is the
   foundation of complex human social interaction. Previous studies
   primarily focused on the individual cognitive processes of interpersonal
   SMS. However, all individuals compose an entire interaction system with
   emerged holistic properties during interpersonal SMS. Therefore, we
   proposed the `holistic cognitive and neural processes' of interpersonal
   SMS and defined quantitative measurements that included Holistic
   Correction Gain (HCG), Holistic Timekeeper Variance (HTV) and Holistic
   Motor Variance (HMV) based on linear error correction model and
   inter-brain couplings obtained by hyperscanning technique. We performed
   a joint-tapping experiment including bidirectional and unidirectional
   conditions using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
   hyperscanning to evaluate effects of these holistic processes on
   synchronization performance. We found that the dyads' performance highly
   correlated with the integrated effect of holistic cognitive processes in
   both conditions. Each holistic cognitive process played different roles
   in interpersonal SMS. HCG was critical to maintain synchronization. HTV
   related to mentalizing others' behavior. Holistic neural process, the
   inter-brain coupling of right prefrontal cortex (PFC), was significantly
   different between bidirectional and unidirectional conditions, which
   suggested the existence of neural markers at holistic level in
   interpersonal SMS.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin has anxiolytic properties whose mechanisms of action are still
   being identified. DNA methylation in the promoter region of the oxytocin
   receptor gene (OXTR), an epigenetic modification that putatively
   reflects a downtuning of the oxytocin system, has previously been
   implicated in the regulation of fear-related responses through the
   amygdala. In this study, we attempted to characterize the relationship
   between methylation of OXTR and anxiogenesis using two distinct
   endophenotypes: autonomic nervous system activity and subcortical brain
   structure. In 79 participants, we found that increased OXTR methylation
   is associated with attenuated resting parasympathetic tone, measured
   using high-frequency heart rate variability. Further, we found that this
   relationship is mediated by brain morphology, such that OXTR methylation
   is associated with increased gray matter of the central amygdala which
   is, in turn, associated with decreased parasympathetic tone. These
   results further our understanding of epigenetic regulation of the human
   oxytocin system and its role in anxiogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, psychopathic individuals have been described as suffering
   a chronic hyporesponsivity to negatively valent stimuli. However, while
   a wide body of empirical work indicates that the psychopath does not
   manifest normal reactivity to emotional stimuli, it does not similarly
   indicate that they cannot do so. To attempt to differentiate these
   alternatives, the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study evaluated the extent to which offenders with varying PCL-R scores
   could up- (or down-) regulate their neural response to negatively valent
   stimuli. Participants were asked to either watch negatively- and
   neutrally-valent images naturally (passive-processing), or to try to
   increase or decrease their emotional response to the images
   (instructed-processing). During passive processing, high-psychopathy
   offenders showed reduced activity compared to both low- and
   mid-psychopathic offenders through a majority of emotion-relevant
   regions. However, when participants were instructed to try to increase
   their emotional response all groups showing increased activity
   throughout relevant regions, including left insula, orbitofrontal cortex
   and anterior cingulate/medial frontal cortex (ACC/mFC). Comparison of
   participants' subjective emotion ratings indicated that all groups
   showed symmetry between their neural/subjective emotion metrics, and the
   high-psychopathy group may have showed the greatest such symmetry. These
   findings suggest that psychopathic individuals may be capable of
   manifesting emotional reactivity to negatively valent stimuli, at least
   under certain conditions. Relevance for traditional and developing
   models of psychopathy is discussed in turn.}},

Abstract = {{Stress has a critical impact on affective and cognitive processing.
   Based on rodent data suggesting that endocannabinoid signaling via CB1
   receptors serves as an emotional buffer, we hypothesized that a common
   variant of the gene coding for the CB1 receptor modulates affective
   processing under stress (CNR1; rs1049353 A vs G allele). Therefore, 139
   participants, genotyped for this polymorphism, underwent a stress or
   control manipulation before they viewed emotionally neutral and negative
   pictures in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex, known for its crucial role in emotion regulation, was
   significantly more activated in AA/AG vs GG genotype carriers when
   viewing negative pictures after stress. Under no-stress conditions,
   AA/AG genotype carriers showed enhanced crosstalk between the
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. We further assessed
   participants' 24 h-delayed memory for the presented pictures and found
   that memory performance correlated with amygdala and hippocampus
   activity and connectivity in stressed carriers of the AA/AG but not the
   GG genotype. These findings underline the modulatory role of the
   endocannabinoid system in stress effects on emotion and cognition and
   provide insights into the neural mechanisms that may contribute to the
   suggested protective effect of the AA/AG genotype of the CB1 receptor
   polymorphism against stress-related psychopathologies.}},

Abstract = {{Reward processing is altered in various psychopathologies and has been
   shown to be susceptible to genetic and environmental influences. Here,
   we examined whether maternal care may buffer familial risk for
   psychiatric disorders in terms of reward processing. Functional magnetic
   resonance imaging during a monetary incentive delay task was acquired in
   participants of an epidemiological cohort study followed since birth (N
   = 172, 25 years). Early maternal stimulation was assessed during a
   standardized nursing/playing setting at the age of 3 months. Parental
   psychiatric disorders (familial risk) during childhood and the
   participants' previous psychopathology were assessed by diagnostic
   interview. With high familial risk, higher maternal stimulation was
   related to increasing activation in the caudate head, the supplementary
   motor area, the cingulum and the middle frontal gyrus during reward
   anticipation, with the opposite pattern found in individuals with no
   familial risk. In contrast, higher maternal stimulation was associated
   with decreasing caudate head activity during reward delivery and reduced
   levels of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the
   high-risk group. Decreased caudate head activity during reward
   anticipation and increased activity during delivery were linked to ADHD.
   These findings provide evidence of a long-term association of early
   maternal stimulation on both adult neurobiological systems of reward
   underlying externalizing behavior and ADHD during development.}},

Abstract = {{Backgrounds: More males than females play video games and develop
   problems with gaming. However, little is known regarding how males and
   females who game on the Internet may differ with respect to neural
   responses to gaming cues. Methods: Behavioral and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data were recorded from 40 female and 68 male
   Internet gamers. This study included three components including
   participation in a pre-gaming cue-craving task, 30 min of online gaming
   and a post-gaming cue-elicited-craving task. Group differences were
   examined at pre-gaming, post-gaming and post- vs pre-gaming times.
   Correlations between brain responses and behavioral performance were
   calculated. Results: Gaming-related cues elicited higher cravings in
   male vs female subjects. Prior to gaming, males demonstrated greater
   activations in the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), inferior
   frontal cortex and bilateral declive. Following gaming, male subjects
   demonstrated greater activations in the medial frontal gyrus and
   bilateral middle temporal gyri. In a post-pre comparison, male subjects
   demonstrated greater thalamic activation than did female subjects.
   Conclusions: Short-term gaming elicited in males vs females more
   craving-related activations to gaming cues. These results suggest neural
   mechanisms for why males may be more vulnerable than females in
   developing Internet gaming disorder.}},

Abstract = {{Suicidal ideation (SI), a potent risk factor for suicide attempts,
   increases in adolescence. While alterations in dopaminergic functioning
   have been implicated in suicidal acts-particularly in adults-we do not
   know whether morphological alterations in dopamine-rich regions of the
   brain, such as the striatum, are vulnerability factors for the emergence
   of SI in adolescents. At baseline, a community sample of 152 adolescents
   (89 female; mean age: 11.41 +/- 1.01 years) completed a magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) scan that was used to estimate gray matter
   volumes (GMVs) of three striatal structures: caudate, nucleus accumbens
   and putamen. At a 24 month follow-up session, participants completed a
   self-report measure of SI frequency {[}Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire
   (SIQ)] and the death version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT).
   Robust linear regression models were conducted to predict SIQ and IAT
   scores from striatal GMV. Bilateral putamen and left caudate GMV
   significantly predicted IAT scores (all Ps < 0.03). No other
   associations were significant (all Ps > 0.05). Our finding of reduced
   dorsal striatal GMV predicting implicit SI may indicate that downstream
   dopaminergic dysfunction is implicated in the development of overt
   suicidal behaviors. Self-reported SI was not associated with striatal
   GMV, suggesting that biological correlates of suicide risk may correlate
   specifically with objective measurements of SI in adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy has received considerable attention from the field of cognitive
   and social neuroscience. A significant portion of these studies used the
   event-related potential (ERP) technique to study the mechanisms of
   empathy for pain in others in different conditions and clinical
   populations. These show that specific ERP components measured during the
   observation of pain in others are modulated by several factors and
   altered in clinical populations. However, issues present in this
   literature such as analytical flexibility and lack of type 1 error
   control raise doubts regarding the validity and reliability of these
   conclusions. The current study compiled the results and methodological
   characteristics of 40 studies using ERP to study empathy of pain in
   others. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that the
   centro-parietal P3 and late positive potential component are sensitive
   to the observation of pain in others, while the early N1 and N2
   components are not reliably associated with vicarious pain observation.
   The review of the methodological characteristics shows that the presence
   of selective reporting, analytical flexibility and lack of type 1 error
   control compromise the interpretation of these results. The implication
   of these results for the study of empathy and potential solutions to
   improve future investigations are discussed.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1019-1027}},

Abstract = {{It is widely accepted that holistic processing is critical for early
   face recognition, but recent work has suggested a larger role for
   feature-based processing. The earliest step in familiar face recognition
   is thought to be matching a perceptual representation of a familiar face
   to a stored representation of that face, which is thought to be indexed
   by the N250r event-related potential (ERP). In the current face-priming
   studies, we investigated whether this perceptual representation can be
   effectively activated by feature-based processing. In the first
   experiment, prime images were familiar whole faces, isolated eyes or
   isolated mouths. Whole faces and isolated eyes, but not isolated mouths,
   effectively modulated the N250r. In the second experiment, prime images
   were familiar whole faces presented either upright or inverted. Inverted
   face primes were no less effective than upright face primes in
   modulating the N250r. Together, the results of these studies indicate
   that activation of the earliest face recognition processes is not
   dependent on holistic processing of a typically configured face. Rather,
   feature-based processing can effectively activate the perceptual memory
   of a familiar face. However, not all features are effective primes as we
   found eyes, but not mouths, were effective in activating early face
   recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Acetaminophen has been shown to influence cognitive and affective
   behavior possibly via alterations in serotonin function. This study
   builds upon this previous work by examining the relationship between
   acetaminophen and dual-learning systems, comprising reflective
   (rule-based) and reflexive (information-integration) processing. In a
   double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a sample of community-recruited
   adults (N = 87) were randomly administered acetaminophen (1000 mg) or
   placebo and then completed reflective-optimal and reflexive-optimal
   category learning tasks. For the reflective-optimal category learning
   task, acetaminophen compared to placebo was associated with enhanced
   accuracy prior to the first rule switch (but not overall accuracy), with
   needing fewer trials to reach criterion and with a faster learning rate.
   Acetaminophen modestly attenuated performance on the reflexive-optimal
   category learning task compared to placebo. These findings indirectly
   support two positions that have been proposed elsewhere. First, they are
   consistent with the view that acetaminophen has an influence on the
   serotonergic system. Second, the findings are consistent with a proposed
   link between elevated serotonin function and relative dominance of
   effortful, rule-based processing.}},

Abstract = {{Fear extinction is a powerful model of adaptive and anxiety-related
   maladaptive fear inhibition. This learning process is dependent upon
   plastic interactions between the amygdala, the anterior midcingulate
   cortex (aMCC), the hippocampus, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC). With regard to the amygdala, the basolateral (BLA) and
   centromedial amygdala (CMA) serve unique roles in fear extinction. In a
   large sample (N = 91), the current study examined pre- to
   post-extinction changes in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC)
   of fear inhibition and expression pathways. We also examined how trait
   anxiety and extinction performance were associated with
   extinction-related changes within these neural pathways. We found
   stronger pre- to post-extinction RSFC in pathways known to play a role
   in the down-regulation of fear responses (BLA-hippocampus,
   aMCC-hippocampus, CMA-hippocampus, CMA-aMCC). We also found that trait
   anxiety was associated with strengthening of a BLA-aMCC circuit
   supporting fear expression following extinction learning. Furthermore,
   we found that physiological indices of poorer extinction learning were
   linked to weaker pre- to post-extinction RSFC of a BLA-hippocampus
   pathway important for fear extinction consolidation. Our results
   highlight the network changes that occur during extinction, the
   separable role of CMA and BLA-based circuitry and a key pathway linked
   to risk for anxiety pathology.}},

Abstract = {{Nonverbal communication of emotion is essential to human interaction and
   relevant to many clinical applications, yet it is an understudied topic
   in social neuroscience. Drumming is an ancient nonverbal communication
   modality for expression of emotion that has not been previously
   investigated in this context. We investigate the neural response to
   live, natural communication of emotion via drumming using a novel
   dual-brain neuroimaging paradigm. Hemodynamic signals were acquired
   using whole-head functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Dyads of
   36 subjects participated in two conditions, drumming and talking,
   alternating between `sending' (drumming or talking to partner) and
   `receiving' (listening to partner) in response to emotionally salient
   images from the International Affective Picture System. Increased
   frequency and amplitude of drum strikes was behaviorally correlated with
   higher arousal and lower valence measures and neurally correlated with
   temporoparietal junction (TPJ) activation in the listener. Contrast
   comparisons of drumming greater than talking also revealed neural
   activity in right TPJ. Together, findings suggest that emotional content
   communicated by drumming engages right TPJ mechanisms in an emotionally
   and behaviorally sensitive fashion. Drumming may provide novel,
   effective clinical approaches for treating social-emotional
   psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{The current functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI study
   investigated how outcomes achieved by others affect subjective regret
   and subsequent behavior. During the task, participants were asked to
   open a series of boxes consecutively until they decided to stop. Each
   box contained a reward (gold), except for one that contained an adverse
   stimulus (devil), which caused the participants to lose all the gold
   they collected in that trial. Importantly, participants were instructed
   that every trial they encountered would also be played in parallel by
   another player. During the feedback stage, outcomes of both the
   participant and the other player were presented. Behaviorally,
   participants felt less regret and took less risk when objective outcomes
   improved or when their outcomes were better than others. Participants
   tended to take more risk after experiencing regret. At the neural level,
   the ventral striatum (VS) and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex
   (pgACC) showed increased activation as objective outcomes improved.
   Across participants, activation of the VS was positively correlated with
   corresponding behavioral changes. Increased activation of the VS and
   significantly higher functional connectivity with the dorsal anterior
   cingulate cortex (dACC) were found when their outcomes were better than
   others. Additionally, the VS-dACC functional connectivity was correlated

Abstract = {{Patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) often engage in
   dangerous self-injurious behaviors (SIBs) as a maladaptive technique to
   decrease heightened feelings of distress (e.g. negative feelings caused
   by social exclusion). The reward system has recently been proposed as a
   plausible neural substrate, which may influence the interaction between
   social distress and physical pain processing in patients that engage in
   SIBs. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 20 adult BPD
   patients with a history of SIBs and 23 healthy controls (HCs), we found
   a hyper-activation of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and amygdala when
   painful stimuli were presented to BPD patients (but not HCs) in a state
   of heightened distress, induced via social exclusion. This differential
   NAcc activity was mediated by anxious attachment style, which is a key
   developmental feature of the disorder. Altogether, these results suggest
   a neural mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of SIBs in these
   patients, which is likely reinforced via the reward system.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals in a major depressive episode often display impairment in
   cognitive control, and this impairment exists outside of the acute phase
   of illness. Impairment in cognitive control also has been associated
   with exposure to childhood adversity (CA). The current study examined
   whether exposure to CA can explain variance in a component of cognitive
   control-inhibitory control-independent of diagnostic status in young
   adults with and without a history of depression. Healthy control
   individuals (n = 40) and individuals with remitted major depressive
   disorder (n = 53) completed a task measuring inhibitory control,
   reported level of CA and completed a scanning session to assess gray
   matter volume and resting state connectivity in regions associated with
   cognitive control. The results demonstrate that higher levels of CA were
   associated with poorer inhibitory control, reduced right middle frontal
   gyrus gray matter, decreased connectivity of salience and emotion
   networks and increased connectivity in cognitive control networks, even
   after controlling for diagnostic status, residual depression symptoms
   and current stressors. Together, the results suggest that inhibitory
   control impairment and intrinsic connectivity changes may be
   characterized as developmental sequelae of early stress exposure.}},

   variant of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) resulting from a single
   nucleotide polymorphism involving an adenine (A)/guanine (G) transition,

   gene to behaviour has not been elucidated. We conducted the present
   study to determine whether amygdala volume mediates the association
   between OXTR rs53576 genotypes and attitudinal trust. Our results
   revealed that the left amygdala volume was significantly smaller in GG
   men than in AA and AG men, whereas it was significantly smaller in AA
   and AG women than in GG women. In addition, the left amygdala volume was
   negatively associated with attitudinal trust in men, whereas there was
   no such association in women. We also found a significant mediation
   effect of the left amygdala volume on the association between OXTR
   rs53576 genotypes and attitudinal trust in men. The results of our study

Abstract = {{Infant faces have distinctive features that together are described as
   baby schema, a configuration that facilitates caregiving motivation and
   behavior, and increases the perception of cuteness. In the current
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated the
   effect of a within-subjects intranasal oxytocin administration (24 IU)
   and caregiving motivation on neural responses to infant faces of varying
   baby schema in 23 healthy nulliparous women. Overall, infant faces
   elicited activation in several brain regions involved in reward and
   salience processing, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA),
   putamen, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula, and this
   activation was related to self-reported caregiving motivation.
   Critically, whereas we hypothesized enhanced neural caregiving-related
   responses after oxytocin administration, we observed reduced activation
   in the VTA, putamen and amygdala after oxytocin compared to placebo. In
   nulliparous women, oxytocin has been shown to reduce neural responses in
   the same regions in response to social stimuli using other paradigms.
   Oxytocin might affect neural activation toward social stimuli depending
   on elicited arousal and personal characteristics. The current study is
   the first to demonstrate this effect in response to infant faces and
   thereby adds to specify the role of oxytocin in human social information
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) has surged in recent years,
   as this region has been implicated in a range of cognitive processes.
   Previously reported anatomical and functional definitions of the human
   RSC encompass a larger area than expected from underlying
   cytoarchitectonic profiles. Here, we used a large-scale, unbiased, and
   data-driven approach combining functional MRI meta-analysis and
   resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) methods to test the nature
   of this heterogeneity. The automated toolset Neurosynth was used to
   conduct meta-analyses in order to (a) identify heterogeneous areas in
   the retrosplenial region (RS region) associated with one or more
   cognitive domains, and (b) contrast the activation profiles related to
   these domains. These analyses yielded several functional subregions
   across the RS region, highlighting differences between anterior RS
   regions associated with episodic memory and posterior RS regions in the
   parietal-occipital sulcus associated with scenes and navigation. These
   regions were subsequently used as seeds to conduct whole brain rsFC
   analyses using data from the Human Connectome Project. In support of the
   meta-analysis findings, rsFC revealed divergent connectivity profiles,
   with anterior regions demonstrating connectivity to the default mode
   network (DMN) and posterior regions demonstrating connectivity to visual
   regions. Anterior RS regions and the parietaloccipital sulcus connected
   to different subnetworks of the DMN. This convergent evidence supports
   the conclusion that the broad cortical RS region incorporating both
   anatomical and functional RSC consists of functionally heterogeneous
   subregions. This study combines two large databases to provide a novel
   methodological blueprint for understanding brain function in the RS
   region and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) has recently begun to gain widespread
   interest because of its anatomical connectivity with other well-known
   memory structures, such as the hippocampus and anterior thalamus, and
   its role in spatial, contextual, and episodic memory. Although much of
   the current work on the RSC is focused on spatial cognition, there is
   also an extensive literature that shows that the RSC plays a critical
   role in a variety of conditioning tasks that have no obvious spatial
   component. Many of these studies suggest that the RSC is involved in
   identifying and encoding behaviorally significant cues, particularly
   those cues that predict reinforcement or the need for a behavioral
   response. Consistent with this idea, recent studies have shown that RSC
   neurons also encode cues in spatial navigation tasks. In this article,
   we review these findings and suggest that the encoding of cues is an
   important component of the RSC contribution to many forms of learning.}},

Abstract = {{The rodent retrosplenial cortex is known to be vital for spatial
   cognition, but evidence has also pointed to a role in processing
   nonspatial information. It has been suggested that the retrosplenial
   cortex may serve as a site of integration of incoming sensory
   information. To examine this proposal, the current set of experiments
   assessed the impact of excitotoxic lesions in the retrosplenial cortex
   on two behavioral tasks that tax animals' ability to process multiple
   and overlapping environmental stimuli. In Experiment 1, rats with
   retrosplenial lesions acquired a negative patterning discrimination, a
   form of configural learning that can be solved only by learning the
   conjunction of cues. Subsequent transfer tests confirmed that both the
   lesion and control animals had solved the task by using configural
   representations. Furthermore, in Experiment 2, a 2nd cohort of
   retrosplenial lesion animals successfully acquired conditioned
   inhibition. Nevertheless, the same animals failed a subsequent summation
   test that assesses the ability to transfer what has been learned about
   one stimulus to another stimulus in the absence of reinforcement. Taken
   together, these results suggest that in the nonspatial domain, the
   retrosplenial cortex is not required for forming associations between
   multiple or overlapping environmental stimuli and, consequently,
   retrosplenial engagement in such processes is more selective than was
   previously envisaged.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined the effects of excitotoxic lesions in 2
   closely related structures, the anterior thalamic nuclei and the
   retrosplenial cortex, on latent inhibition. Latent inhibition occurs
   when nonreinforced preexposure to a stimulus retards the subsequent
   acquisition of conditioned responding to that stimulus. Latent
   inhibition was assessed in a within-subject procedure with auditory
   stimuli and food reinforcement. As expected, sham-operated animals were
   slower to acquire conditioned responding to a stimulus that had
   previously been experienced without consequence, relative to a
   non-preexposed stimulus. This latent inhibition effect was absent in
   rats with excitotoxic lesions in the anterior thalamic nuclei, as these
   animals conditioned to both stimuli at equivalent rates. The
   retrosplenial lesions appeared to spare latent inhibition, as these
   animals displayed a robust stimulus preexposure effect. The
   demonstration here that anterior thalamic nuclei lesions abolish latent
   inhibition is consistent with emerging evidence of the importance of
   these thalamic nuclei for attentional control.}},

Abstract = {{Although the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is critically involved in
   spatial learning and memory, it appears to have more selective
   contributions to learning and memory for discrete cues. For example,
   damage to the RSC does not impair Pavlovian delay fear conditioning to a
   discrete auditory cue (e.g., tone), when RSC manipulation occurs just
   prior to, or shortly after, conditioning. In contrast, when lesions of
   the RSC occur following a substantial retention interval (e.g., 28
   days), the RSC is necessary for retrieval of fear to the tone. Thus, the
   RSC makes time-dependent contributions to memory retrieval for discrete
   auditory cues. The purpose of the current experiment was to assess if
   the time-dependent involvement of the RSC in cue-specific fear memory
   extended to cues of other sensory modalities. Rats firsts underwent fear
   conditioning to a visual stimulus, and lesions of the RSC subsequently
   occurred 1 or 28 days later. Lesions of the RSC impaired fear expression
   when made 28 days after conditioning, but not when made 1 day following
   conditioning. Coupled with previous findings, the current results
   suggest the RSC is necessary for retrieval of remotely acquired cued
   fear memories across multiple modalities.}},

Abstract = {{Although the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is necessary for the retrieval
   of remotely acquired fear to a discrete auditory cue, it is not
   necessary for the retrieval of recently acquired cued-fear memories.
   Thus, the RSC's role in memory retrieval for discrete cues is
   time-dependent. The purpose of the current experiment was to identify
   the larger cortical circuit involved in the retrieval of
   remotely-acquired auditory fear memories. One candidate circuit involves
   the RSC and secondary auditory cortex; the secondary auditory cortex is
   also necessary for the retrieval of remotely acquired auditory fear
   memories (Sacco \& Sacchetti, 2010), and sends direct projections to the
   RSC. To test this possibility, we assessed retrieval of remote memory
   following functional disconnection of the RSC and secondary auditory
   cortex. Complete disconnection of these regions produced a larger
   impairment in fear expression to a remotely acquired auditory cue
   compared to partial disconnection of these regions. These results are
   consistent with the notion that RSC and secondary auditory cortex form a
   functional circuit involved in the retrieval of remotely acquired fear
   to a discrete auditory cue.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of learning and memory have made significant advances in
   characterizing the mechanisms of single memories, formed when surprising
   and unpredictable events trigger synaptic modifications in response to
   tightly timed coincidental cues. Yet outside the laboratory setting, few
   natural experiences are wholly unique, and much of our behavior is
   shaped progressively through the interactions of perceived experiences,
   recently formed memories and distant acquired knowledge. Despite the
   necessity of these memory dynamics, relatively little is known about how
   previously established associations are accessed, updated, and applied
   to inform new learning at the appropriate moments in time. Such
   questions have historically been technically challenging to address
   because they require prolonged access to circuits linked to past
   episodes of learning; however, new techniques for function-and
   activity-based circuit mapping, developed and refined over several
   decades, have introduced novel opportunities to investigate both broad
   systems-level functions and detailed circuit mechanisms in complex
   neocortical systems. This review will focus particularly on insights
   from studies of the retrosplenial cortex, a large and heavily
   interconnected region of neocortex that has recently emerged as a
   candidate node for largescale information exchange over functionally
   diverse anatomical domains.}},

Abstract = {{The retrosplenial cortex is anatomically positioned to integrate
   sensory, motor, and visual information and is thought to have an
   important role in processing spatial information and guiding behavior
   through complex environments. Anatomical and theoretical work has argued
   that the retrosplenial cortex participates in spatial behavior in
   concert with input from the parietal cortex. Although the nature of
   these interactions is unknown, a central position is that the functional
   connectivity is hierarchical with egocentric spatial information
   processed in the parietal cortex and higher-level allocentric mappings
   generated in the retrosplenial cortex. Here, we review the evidence
   supporting this proposal. We begin by summarizing the key anatomical
   features of the retrosplenial-parietal network, and then review studies
   investigating the neural correlates of these regions during spatial
   behavior. Our summary of this literature suggests that the
   retrosplenial-parietal circuitry does not represent a strict
   hierarchical parcellation of function between the two regions but
   instead a heterogeneous mixture of egocentric-allocentric coding and
   integration across frames of reference. We also suggest that this
   circuitry should be represented as a gradient of
   egocentric-to-allocentric information processing from parietal to
   retrosplenial cortices, with more specialized encoding of global
   allocentric frameworks within the retrosplenial cortex and more
   specialized egocentric and local allocentric representations in parietal
   cortex. We conclude by identifying the major gaps in this literature and
   suggest new avenues of research.}},

Abstract = {{Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is an association cortex supporting spatial
   navigation and memory. However, critical issues remain concerning the
   forms by which its ensemble spiking patterns register spatial
   relationships that are difficult for experimental techniques to fully
   address. We therefore applied an evolutionary algorithmic optimization
   technique to create spiking neural network models that matched
   electrophysiologically observed spiking dynamics in rat RSC neuronal
   ensembles. Virtual experiments conducted on the evolved networks
   revealed a mixed selectivity coding capability that was not built into
   the optimization method, but instead emerged as a consequence of
   replicating biological firing patterns. The experiments reveal several
   important outcomes of mixed selectivity that may subserve flexible
   navigation and spatial representation: (a) robustness to loss of
   specific inputs, (b) immediate and stable encoding of novel routes and
   route locations, (c) automatic resolution of input variable conflicts,
   and (d) dynamic coding that allows rapid adaptation to changing task
   demands without retraining. These findings suggest that biological
   retrosplenial cortex can generate unique, first-trial, conjunctive
   encodings of spatial positions and actions that can be used by
   downstream brain regions for navigation and path integration. Moreover,
   these results are consistent with the proposed role for the RSC in the
   transformation of representations between reference frames and
   navigation strategy deployment. Finally, the specific modeling framework
   used for evolving synthetic retrosplenial networks represents an
   important advance for computational modeling by which synthetic neural
   networks can encapsulate, describe, and predict the behavior of neural
   circuits at multiple levels of function.}},

Abstract = {{Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is heavily interconnected with a multitude of
   cortical regions and is directly connected with the hippocampal
   formation. As such, it is a likely coordinator of information transfer
   between the hippocampus (HPC) and cortex in the service of spatial
   cognition and episodic memory. The current work examined three potential
   temporal frameworks for retrosplenial-hippocampal communication, namely,
   theta frequency oscillations (6-12 Hz), sharp-wave/ripple events, and
   repeating, theta phase-locked shifts from low (30-65 Hz) to high
   (120-160 Hz) gamma frequency oscillations. From simultaneous recordings
   of single units and local field potentials (LFPs) in RSC and HPC, we
   report the presence of prominent theta, low-gamma, and high-gamma
   oscillations in the retrosplenial LFP. Retrosplenial and hippocampal
   theta rhythms were strongly coherent and subgroups of retrosplenial
   neurons exhibited either spiking at theta frequencies and/or
   spike-phase-locking to theta. Retrosplenial neurons were also
   phase-locked to local low-and high-gamma rhythms, and power in these
   frequency bands was coupled in a sequential fashion to specific phases
   of hippocampal and retrosplenial theta rhythms. Coordinated activity
   between the two regions also occurred during hippocampal
   sharp-wave/ripple events, where retrosplenial neuron populations were
   modulated in their spiking and retrosplenial LFPs exhibited
   sharp-wave-like events that co-occurred with those observed in HPC.
   These results identify several temporal windows of synchronization
   between RSC and HPC that may mediate cortico-hippocampal processes
   related to learning, memory, and spatial representation.}},

Abstract = {{This meta-analysis (k = 48, N = 2196) examined the effect of
   transcranial direct current brain stimulation (tDCS) applied to the
   prefrontal cortex on a variety of social behaviors, including
   aggression, overeating, impulsivity, bias, honesty, and risk-taking.
   tDCS showed an overall significant effect on reducing undesirable
   behaviors, with an average effect size of d = -0.20. tDCS was most
   effective at reducing risk-taking behavior, bias, and overeating. tDCS
   did not affect aggression, impulsivity, or dishonesty. We examined
   moderators such as brain region of interest, online vs offline
   stimulation, within- vs between-subjects designs, dose, and duration,
   but none showed significant interactions. We also tested for potential
   publication bias using two different tools, which indicated signs of
   publication bias in the literature. After correcting for potential
   publication bias, the effect of tDCS was still significant, but the size
   was reduced (d = -0.10). These findings suggest the presence of tDCS
   studies with null findings outside of the published literature. Taken
   together, these results suggest that although tDCS can reduce
   undesirable behaviors, researchers should consider the types of
   behaviors they measure and use strategies to ensure sufficient power to
   detect a possible effect of tDCS on social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Neural mechanisms that mediate dynamic social interactions remain
   understudied despite their evolutionary significance. The interactive
   brain hypothesis proposes that interactive social cues are processed by
   dedicated brain substrates and provides a general theoretical framework
   for investigating the underlying neural mechanisms of social
   interaction. We test the specific case of this hypothesis proposing that
   canonical language areas are upregulated and dynamically coupled across
   brains during social interactions based on talking and listening.
   Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was employed to acquire
   simultaneous deoxyhemoglobin (deOxyHb) signals of the brain on partners
   who alternated between speaking and listening while doing an Object
   Naming \& Description task with and without interaction in a natural
   setting. Comparison of interactive and non-interactive conditions
   confirmed an increase in neural activity associated with Wernicke's area
   including the superior temporal gyrus (STG) during interaction (P =
   0.04). However, the hypothesis was not supported for Broca's area.
   Cross-brain coherence determined by wavelet analyses of signals
   originating from the STG and the subcentral area was greater during
   interaction than non-interaction (P < 0.01). In support of the
   interactive brain hypothesis these findings suggest a dynamically
   coupled cross-brain neural mechanism dedicated to pathways that share
   interpersonal information.}},

Abstract = {{Intranasal oxytocin (OT) has previously been found to increase
   spirituality, an effect moderated by OT-related genotypes. This
   pre-registered study sought to conceptually replicate and extend those
   findings. Using a single dose of intranasal OT vs placebo (PL), we
   investigated experimental treatment effects, and moderation by
   OT-related genotypes on spirituality, mystical experiences, and the
   sensed presence of a sentient being. A more exploratory aim was to test
   for interactions between treatment and the personality disposition
   absorption on these spirituality-related outcomes. A priming plus
   sensory deprivation procedure that has facilitated spiritual experiences
   in previous studies was used. The sample (N = 116) contained both sexes
   and was drawn from a relatively secular context. Results failed to
   conceptually replicate both the main effects of treatment and the
   treatment by genotype interactions on spirituality. Similarly, there
   were no such effects on mystical experiences or sensed presence.
   However, the data suggested an interaction between treatment and
   absorption. Relative to PL, OT seemed to enhance spiritual experiences
   in participants scoring low in absorption and dampen spirituality in
   participants scoring high in absorption.}},

Abstract = {{Posed facial expressions of actors have often been used as stimuli to
   induce mental state inferences, in order to investigate `Theory of Mind'
   processes. However, such stimuli make it difficult to determine whether
   perceivers are using a basic or more elaborated mentalizing strategy.
   The current study used as stimuli covert recordings of target
   individuals who viewed various emotional expressions, which caused them
   to spontaneously mimic these expressions. Perceivers subsequently judged
   these subtle emotional expressions of the targets: in one condition
   ('classification') participants were instructed to classify the target's
   expression (i.e. match it to a sample) and in another condition
   ('retrodicting') participants were instructed to retrodict (i.e. infer
   which emotional expression the target was viewing). When instructed to
   classify, participants showed more prevalent activations in
   event-related brain potentials (ERPs) at earlier and mid-latency ERP
   components N170, P200 and P300-600. By contrast, when instructed to
   retrodict participants showed enhanced late frontal and fronto-temporal
   ERPs (N800-1000), with more sustained activity over the right than the
   left hemisphere. These findings reveal different cortical processes
   involved when retrodicting about a facial expression compared to merely
   classifying it, despite comparable performance on the behavioral task.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a developmental period associated with increased
   health-risk behaviors and unique sensitivity to the input from the
   social context, paralleled by major changes in the developing brain.
   Peer presence increases adolescent risk taking, associated with greater
   reward-related activity, while parental presence decreases risk taking,
   associated with decreased reward-related activity and increased
   cognitive control. Yet the effects specific to peers and parents are
   still unknown. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   study compared within-person peer and parent influences on risky
   decision-making during adolescence (ages 12-15 years; N = 56).
   Participants completed the Yellow Light Game (YLG), a computerized
   driving task, during which they could make safe or risky decisions, in
   the presence of a peer and their parent. Behavioral findings revealed no
   effects of social context on risk taking. At the neural level, a
   collection of affective, social and cognitive regions {[}ventral
   striatum (VS), temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)] was more active during decision-making with
   peers than parents. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses
   showed greater coupling between affective, social and cognitive control
   regions (VS-insula, VS-TPJ) during decision-making with parents than
   peers. These findings highlight the complex nature of social influence
   processes in peer and parent contexts, and contribute to our
   understanding of the opportunities and vulnerabilities associated with
   adolescent social sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the human parental brain implicated brain networks involved
   in simulation, mentalization and emotion processing and indicated that
   stimuli of own parent-child interaction elicit greater integration among
   networks supporting attachment. Here, we examined children's neural
   activation while viewing own parent-child interactions and asked whether
   similar networks activate when children are exposed to attachment
   stimuli. Sixty-five 11-year-old children underwent
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) while observing own vs unfamiliar
   mother-child interaction. Own mother-child interactions elicited a
   greater neural response across distributed brain areas including alpha
   suppression in posterior regions, theta enhancement in the fusiform
   gyrus and beta-and gamma-band oscillations across a wide cluster in the
   right temporal cortex, comprising the superior temporal sulcus/superior
   temporal gyrus and insula. Theta and gamma activations were associated
   with the degree of mother-child social synchrony in the home ecology.
   Findings from this exploratory study are the first to show activations
   in children that are similar to previous findings in parents and
   comparable associations between social synchrony and gamma oscillations
   in temporal regions. Results indicate that attachment stimuli elicit a
   strong neural response in children that spreads across a wide range of
   oscillations, underscoring the considerable neural resources allocated
   to this fundamental, survival-related cue.}},

Abstract = {{The continuous balancing of the risks and benefits of exploiting known
   options or exploring new opportunities is essential to human life. We
   forage for new opportunities when they are deemed to be more attractive
   than the available option, but this decision to forage also entails
   costs. People differ in their propensity to exploit or forage, and both
   the social circumstances and our individual value orientations are
   likely influences. Here, participants made foraging decisions for
   themselves and for a charity of their choice in two paradigms: one that
   features two distinct modes of decision-making (foraging vs classical
   economic decision-making) and one which is more directly related to the
   classical animal foraging and ethology literature. Across both
   paradigms, individuals who possessed a stronger self-focused value
   orientation obtained more rewards when they were allowed to forage for
   themselves rather than the charity. Neuroimaging during the tasks
   revealed that this effect was associated with activity in the dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in that more self-focused individuals
   showed lower activity in dACC for the self-condition relative to the
   other condition. This evidence reveals a dynamic interplay between
   foraging outcomes and the higher-order value system of individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Sibling relationships have been linked to adolescent externalizing
   behaviors, but the neurobiological factors that underlie this
   association have not been identified. This study investigated sibling
   closeness and birth order as a predictor of adolescent externalizing
   behavior via differences in neural processes during safe
   decision-making. A total of 77 adolescents (range = 12-15 years, M-age =
   13.45 years, 40 females) completed a computerized driving task during a
   functional MRI scan. Results showed that adolescents' perceptions of
   sibling closeness were associated with greater neural activation in the
   anterior insula, ventral striatum and left ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex when making safe decisions, suggesting that the quality of
   sibling relationships modulates adolescent neurocognition even without
   being present. Furthermore, moderated mediation analyses revealed that
   higher sibling closeness was associated with lower externalizing
   behavior via left anterior insula activation during safe
   decision-making, but only for adolescents without older siblings (i.e.
   eldest children) compared to adolescents who had multiple older
   siblings. Importantly, these findings persisted above and beyond
   parental and peer closeness and sibling characteristics (i.e. sex,

Abstract = {{Thinking of attachment figures can potentially impact acquisition and

   about a supportive attachment figure and half thought about a
   non-attachment positive experience prior to the fear conditioning. All
   participants then underwent a differential fear conditioning and fear
   extinction paradigm, and returned 2 days later for an extinction recall
   task. Fear-potentiated startle and subjective expectancy of shock
   ratings were measured as the primary indicators of fear learning across
   trials. The attachment prime significantly reduced the acquisition of
   fear-potentiated startle, and this lower level of fear was maintained at
   the extinction recall task. These results demonstrate that attachment
   primes can modulate the acquisition of conditioned fear. These findings
   provide preliminary evidence for the protective nature of attachment

Abstract = {{Loneliness results from lacking satisfied social connections. However,
   little is known how trait loneliness, which is a stable personal
   characteristic, is influenced by different types of social support (i.e.
   emotional and instrumental support) through the brain activity
   associated with loneliness. To explore these questions, data of
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) of 92
   healthy participants were analyzed. We identified loneliness-related
   brain regions by correlating participants' loneliness scores with
   amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of R-fMRI data. We then
   conducted mediation analyses to test whether the negative relation
   between each type of social support and loneliness was explained via the
   neural activity in the loneliness-related brain regions. The results
   showed that loneliness was positively related to the mean ALFF value
   within right inferior temporal gyrus (ITG). In addition, the negative
   relation between emotional support and loneliness was explained by a
   decrease in the spontaneous neural activity within right ITG but this
   pattern was not observed for instrumental support. These results suggest
   the importance of social information processing on trait loneliness and
   highlight the need to differentiate the functions of different types of
   social support on mental health from a neural perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence has been characterized as a developmental period of
   heightened reward seeking and attenuated aversive processing. However,
   it remains unclear how the neural bases of distinct outcome valuation
   processes shift during this stage of the lifespan. A total of 74
   participants ranging in age from 13 to 20 years completed a
   value-modulated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task in
   which participants earn low and high magnitude monetary outcomes to test
   whether gain and loss magnitude tracking-the neural representation of
   relative value in context-change differentially over this age span.
   Results revealed that gain and loss magnitude tracking follow asymmetric
   developmental trajectories. Gain magnitude tracking is elevated in the
   striatum during early adolescence and then decreases with age. By
   contrast, loss magnitude tracking in the anterior insula follows a
   quadratic pattern, undergoing a temporary attenuation during mid-late
   adolescence. A typical comparison of gain vs loss outcomes (collapsing
   over magnitude effects) showed robust activity across a suite of brain
   regions sensitive to value based on prior work including the ventral
   striatum, but they exhibited no changes with age. These findings suggest
   that value coding subprocesses follow divergent developmental paths
   across adolescence, which may contribute to normative shifts in
   adolescent motivated behavior.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of research indicates that psychopathic individuals lie
   chronically and show little remorse or anxiety. Yet, little is known
   about the neurobiological substrates of dishonesty in psychopathy. In a
   sample of incarcerated individuals (n = 67), we tested the hypothesis
   that psychopathic individuals show reduced activity in the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) when confronted with an opportunity for dishonest
   gain, reflecting dishonest behavior that is relatively unhindered by
   response conflict. During functional magnetic resonance imaging,
   incarcerated offenders with different levels of psychopathy performed an
   incentivized prediction task wherein they were given real and repeated
   opportunities for dishonest gain. We found that while incarcerated
   offenders showed a high rate of cheating, levels of psychopathic traits
   did not influence the frequency of dishonesty. Higher psychopathy scores
   predicted decreased activity in the ACC during dishonest
   decision-making. Further analysis revealed that the ACC was functionally
   connected to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and that ACC activity
   mediated the relationship between psychopathic traits and reduced
   reaction times for dishonest behavior. These findings suggest that
   psychopathic individuals behave dishonestly with relatively low levels
   of response conflict and that the ACC may play a critical role in this
   pattern of behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The defining pathological features of social anxiety disorder primarily
   concern the social landscape, yet few empirical studies have examined
   the potentially aberrant behavioral and neural patterns in this
   population using socially interactive paradigms. We addressed this issue
   by investigating the behavioral and neural patterns associated with
   social conformity in patients with social anxiety disorder. We recorded
   event-related potentials when healthy subjects (n = 19), and patients
   with social anxiety disorder (n = 20) made attractiveness judgements of
   unfamiliar others, while at the same time, being exposed to
   congruent/incongruent peer ratings. Afterwards, participants were asked
   to rerate the same faces without the presence of peer ratings. When
   compared with healthy controls, social anxiety disorder patients
   exhibited more positive attitudes to unfamiliar others and conformed
   more with peers-higher feedback. These behavioral effects were in
   parallel with neural responses associated with social conflict in the
   N400 signal, showing higher conformity to peers-higher feedback compared
   with peers-lower or peers-agree feedback among social anxiety disorder
   patients. Our findings provide evidence on the behavioral and neural
   patterns of social anxiety disorder during social interactions, and
   support the hypothesis that individuals with social anxiety disorder are
   more motivated to pursue social acceptance and possibly avoid social
   rejection.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has characterized a collection of neural regions which
   support social-cognitive processes. While this `social brain' is often
   described as a cohesive unit, it has been largely assessed with
   univariate methodologies, which cannot account for functional
   relationships `between' brain regions, and therefore cannot test the
   idea of the social brain as a network. In the present work, we utilized
   a multi-method approach to empirically assess the functional
   architecture of the social brain. Fifty participants (ages 8-16)
   completed a social evaluation task during an functional imaging scan.
   Results from three unique functional connectivity methodologies
   demonstrated that social brain regions show strong functional
   relationships, while also interfacing with non-social regions,
   suggesting that future work should consider network relationships
   between social brain regions in addition to traditional univariate
   approaches. We probed, but did not find age-related differences in
   social brain network organization, demonstrating that this functional
   architecture is in place by late childhood.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals stably vary in their responses to rewards, but researchers
   have not yet determined whether sensitivity to rewarding outcomes
   translates across social and non-social contexts or whether different
   forms of reward sensitivity relate to distinct behavioral tendencies. We
   tested for responsiveness to different types of rewards by assessing
   individuals' neural sensitivity to personal vs. vicarious monetary
   reward outcomes and explored how responses to each related to
   prosociality and well-being. Forty-six participants underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning while winning money for
   themselves and observing a friend and stranger win money. All types of
   reward outcomes engaged the ventral striatum, but neural sensitivity to
   rewards for the self and for others were uncorrelated across
   individuals. Further, while sensitivity to rewards for the self or a
   close friend correlated with individuals' psychological well-being, only
   sensitivity to a friend's rewards correlated with individuals'
   prosociality. These findings highlight the value of independently
   assessing responsiveness to different types of reward and illuminate
   affective mechanisms that may promote prosocial behavior and well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Shared intentionality, or collaborative interactions in which
   individuals have a shared goal and must coordinate their efforts, is a
   core component of human interaction. However, the biological bases of
   shared intentionality and, specifically, the processes by which the
   brain adjusts to the sharing of common goals, remain largely unknown.
   Using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), coordination of
   cerebral hemodynamic activation was found in subject pairs when
   completing a puzzle together in contrast to a condition in which
   subjects completed identical but individual puzzles (same intention
   without shared intentionality). Interpersonal neural coordination was
   also greater when completing a puzzle together compared to two control
   conditions including the observation of another pair completing the same
   puzzle task or watching a movie with a partner (shared experience).
   Further, permutation testing revealed that the time course of neural
   activation of one subject predicted that of their partner, but not that
   of others completing the identical puzzle in different partner sets.
   Results indicate unique brain-to-brain coupling specific to shared
   intentionality beyond what has been previously found by investigating
   the fundamentals of social exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Subjective well-being (SWB) reflects the cognitive and emotional
   evaluations of an individual's life and plays an important role in
   individual's success in health, work and social relationships. Although
   previous studies have revealed the spontaneous brain activity underlying
   SWB, little is known about the relationship between brain network
   interactions and SWB. The present study investigated the static and
   dynamic functional connectivity among large-scale brain networks during
   resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in relation
   to SWB in two large independent datasets. The results showed that SWB is
   negatively correlated with static functional connectivity between the
   salience network (SN) and the anterior default mode network (DMN).
   Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis found that SWB
   is negatively correlated with the fraction of time that participants
   spent in a brain state characterized by weak cross-network connectivity
   (between the DMN, SN and frontal-parietal network {[}FPN]) and strong
   within-network connectivity (within the DMN and within the FPN). This
   connectivity profile may account for the good mental adaptability and
   flexible information communication of people with high levels of SWB.
   The dFNC results were well replicated with different analysis parameters
   and further validated in an independent sample. Taken together, these
   findings reveal that the dynamic interaction between networks involved
   in self-reflection, emotional regulation and cognitive control underlies
   SWB.}},

Abstract = {{Depression is associated with negative attention and attribution biases
   and maladaptive emotion responsivity and regulation, which adversely
   impact self-evaluations and interpersonal relationships. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural
   substrates of these impairments. We compared neural activity recruited
   by 126 clinically depressed and healthy adolescents (ages 11-17 years)
   during social exclusion (Exclusion > Inclusion) using Cyberball. Results
   revealed significant interaction effects within left anterior insula
   (AI)/inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus. Insula
   hyperresponsivity was associated with peer exclusion for depressed
   adolescents but peer inclusion for healthy adolescents. In additional,
   healthy adolescents recruited greater lateral temporal activity during
   peer exclusion. Complementary effect size analyses within independent
   parcellations offered converging evidence, as well as highlighted
   medium-to-large effects within subgenual/ventral anterior cingulate
   cortex and lateral prefrontal, lateral temporal and lateral parietal
   regions implicated in emotion regulation. Depressogenic neural patterns
   were associated with negative self-perceptions and negative information
   processing biases. These findings suggest a neural mechanism underlying
   cognitive biases in depression, as reflected by emotional
   hyperresponsivity and maladaptive regulation/reappraisal of negative
   social evaluative information. This study lends further support for
   salience and central executive network dysfunction underlying social
   threat processing, and in particular, highlights the anterior insula as
   a key region of disturbance in adolescent depression.}},

Abstract = {{A core design feature of human communication systems and expressive
   behaviours is their temporal organization. The cultural evolutionary
   origins of this feature remain unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis
   that regularities in the temporal organization of signalling sequences
   arise in the course of cultural transmission as adaptations to aspects
   of cortical function. We conducted two experiments on the transmission
   of rhythms associated with affective meanings, focusing on one of the
   most widespread forms of regularity in language and music:
   isochronicity. In the first experiment, we investigated how isochronous
   rhythmic regularities emerge and change in multigenerational signalling
   games, where the receiver (learner) in a game becomes the sender
   (transmitter) in the next game. We show that signalling sequences tend
   to become rhythmically more isochronous as they are transmitted across
   generations. In the second experiment, we combined
   electroencephalography (EEG) and two-player signalling games over 2
   successive days. We show that rhythmic regularization of sequences can
   be predicted based on the latencies of the mismatch negativity response
   in a temporal oddball paradigm. These results suggest that forms of
   isochronicity in communication systems originate in neural constraints
   on information processing, which may be expressed and amplified in the
   course of cultural transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Narcissists are prone to risky decision-making, but why? This study
   tested-via behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) measures-two
   accounts: deficiencies in error monitoring and deficiencies in action
   updating. High and low narcissists were a engaged in a monetary gambling
   task by choosing between a high-risk and a low-risk option while the
   electroencephalogram (EEG) was being recorded. Two ERP components
   relevant to outcome evaluation-feedback-related negativity (FRN) and
   P3-were analyzed, with the FRN serving as an index of error monitoring
   and the P3 as an index of action updating. Generally, high and low
   narcissists differed in the high-risk condition but not in the low-risk
   condition. At the behavioral level, high (vs low) narcissists made
   riskier decisions following high-risk decision outcomes, which was in
   line with past findings; at the neurophysiological level, while no FRN
   difference emerged between high and low narcissists, the outcome valence
   effect (positive vs negative) on the P3 was stronger among low
   narcissists than high narcissists following high-risk decision outcomes.
   One possible interpretation of the results is that narcissism is
   associated with reduced action updating. The findings contribute to the
   understanding of narcissistic decision-making and self-regulation.}},

Volume = {{132}},

Abstract = {{Some evidence suggests that there may be a limited ``window of
   opportunity{''} for beneficial effects of hormone therapy after
   menopause in women. We tested whether the timing of cyclic estradiol
   (E2) treatment impacted its effect on cognitive function in aged,
   surgically menopausal (ovariectomized) rhesus monkeys. Monkeys were
   assigned to one of four treatment conditions after ovariectomy: either
   vehicle or E2 treatment for the duration of the protocol, vehicle for
   the first 2 years of the protocol followed by E2 for the remainder
   (delayed treatment), or E2 for the first 11 months of the protocol
   followed by vehicle for the remainder (withdrawn treatment). Delayed
   treatment addressed the hypothesis that E2 treatment initiated more than
   2 years postovariectomy would have a reduced effect on cognitive
   function. Withdrawn treatment mirrored current clinical advice to women
   to use hormone therapy in the initial postmenopausal period then
   discontinue it. Two periods of cognitive testing assessed treatment
   effects on cognition over time. E2 treatment predominantly affected a
   prefrontal cortex-dependent test of spatiotemporal working memory
   (delayed response). Monkeys with delayed E2 treatment modestly improved
   in delayed response performance over time, whereas vehicle-treated
   monkeys declined. Monkeys with withdrawn E2 treatment maintained their
   performance across assessments, as did monkeys treated with E2 across
   the entire protocol. These findings suggest that a ``window of
   opportunity{''} for hormone treatment after cessation of ovarian
   function, if present in nonhuman primates, lasts longer than 2 years.
   They also support the notion that beneficial effects of hormone therapy
   may persist after discontinuation of treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Human affective life changes with age, becoming more positive and less
   negative in later life. This change occurs even as aging leads to
   declines in health and cognitive outcomes. Despite these well-documented
   effects in humans, the extent to which affective processes change as a
   result of aging in nonhuman animals, particularly nonhuman primates, is
   unclear. As a first step toward developing an animal model for human
   affective aging, we tested aged, surgically menopausal aged and
   middle-aged gonadally intact female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) on a
   classic index of affective reactivity in monkeys, the Human Intruder
   Task. The Human Intruder Task evaluates behavioral responses to varying
   levels of threat. Aged, surgically menopausal monkeys received hormone
   replacement therapy consisting of a cyclic estradiol regimen or vehicle
   injections as a control. Average responsivity to threat did not vary by
   condition, but middle-aged monkeys and aged monkeys on estradiol were
   more reactive to the most potent level of threat than to a moderate
   level of threat, replicating previously published results in other age
   groups and male monkeys. In contrast, aged monkeys who were not on
   estradiol did not show such calibration to threat level. These findings
   suggest that estrogen may be important for maintaining more youthful
   affective responding. They also illustrate the utility of behavioral
   assays of affective reactivity in nonhuman primate models of cognitive
   and reproductive aging in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Standard extinction procedures seem to imply an inhibition of the fear
   response, but not a modification of the original fear-memory trace,
   which remains intact (Bouton, 2002, 2004). Typically, the behavioral
   procedure used to modify this trace is the so-called postretrieval
   extinction, consisting of fear-memory reactivation followed by
   extinction applied within the reconsolidation window. However, the
   application of this technique yields mixed results, probably due to a
   series of boundary conditions that limit the effectiveness of
   postretrieval-extinction effects. In this study a number of potential,
   and hitherto unexplored, moderators of such effects are considered.
   Using an interval of 48 hr between extinction and re-extinction, the
   findings show a spontaneous recovery similar to that found in studies
   that use a 24-hr interval. Also, the use of intervals of 10 and 20 min
   between reactivation and extinction led to a similar fear return.
   Finally, the burst of white noise used as an unconditioned stimulus (US)
   here was shown to be as effective as the electric shock normally used in
   the study of fear-memory reconsolidation. These findings suggest that
   postretrieval extinction is an effective behavioral technique for
   modifying the original fear memory and for the elimination of the fear
   return.}},

Abstract = {{Preadolescent mice have been shown to be differentially susceptible to
   the effects of both acute and chronic nicotine exposure on contextual
   fear learning relative to adults. For this study, we tested the effects
   of chronic nicotine exposure in preadolescence on adulthood extinction
   and spontaneous recovery of fear memory in a model in which contextual
   fear acquisition occurred prior to nicotine exposure. Preadolescent
   (postnatal day 23) and adult (postnatal day 53) male C57BL/6J mice
   underwent contextual fear conditioning and were then exposed to chronic
   nicotine at 12.6 mg/kg/day for 12 days via osmotic minipump. Eighteen
   days following the removal of nicotine, both groups of mice underwent
   fear extinction, followed by a spontaneous recovery session a week
   later. History of chronic nicotine did not affect later extinction of
   fear memory in adult-trained mice, whereas adolescent-trained mice
   exhibited a global impairment in retention of fear memory that precluded
   detection of effects of early nicotine on later fear extinction.
   However, it was found that adult spontaneous recovery of fear memory was
   impaired in mice exposed to nicotine as adults and enhanced in mice
   exposed to nicotine as preadolescents. These results may indicate
   greater vulnerability to recurrence of traumatic memory as well as
   compromised inhibitory control in young smokers.}},

Abstract = {{Early life stress (ELS) is associated with altered processing of threat
   signals, and increased lifetime risk of anxiety and affective pathology,
   disorders that disproportionately affect females. We tested the impact
   of a limited bedding paradigm of ELS (from P4-11) on contextual threat
   learning, context memory, footshock sensitivity, and anxietylike
   behavior, in adult male and female mice. To examine contextual threat
   learning, mice conditioned by context/footshock association were tested
   24 hr later for the context memory. To determine the effect of ELS on
   footshock sensitivity, a separate cohort of mice were exposed to
   footshocks of increasing intensity (0.06 to 0.40 mA) and behavioral
   responses (jump and audible vocalization) were assessed by observers
   blind to treatment condition, sex, and cycle stage. ELS impaired context
   memory in female, but not male, mice. ELS increased footshock-induced
   threshold to vocalize, but not to jump, in both sexes. In female mice,
   this effect was most apparent during estrus. Decreased body weight,
   indicative of higher stress incurred by an individual mouse, correlated
   with increased threshold to jump in both sexes reared in ELS, and to
   audibly vocalize in ELS females. As ELS effects on shock sensitivity
   were present in both sexes, the contextual recall deficit in females was
   not likely driven by changes in the salience of aversive footshocks. No
   effects on anxietylike behavior, as measured in the elevated plus maze
   (EPM), were observed. More work is needed to better understand the
   impact of ELS on both somatic and gonadal development, and their
   potential contribution to threat learning.}},

Abstract = {{Glutamate-modulating agents are of increasing interest in
   obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Current pharmacotherapies for OCD
   target the serotonin and dopamine systems, and are limited in efficacy.
   N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an over-the-counter amino acid supplement that
   inhibits glutamate neurotransmission and has been shown in preliminary
   studies to reduce symptoms in OCD and related compulsive disorders.
   Despite growing interest in NAC as a novel psychiatric medication, no
   studies currently exist examining the effects of NAC in animal models of
   compulsive disorders. Here, we investigate NAC in a well-validated mouse
   model of OCD that is predictive of treatment efficacy as well as the
   time course for therapeutic onset of OCD medications. NAC (60 mg/kg/day
   or 120 mg/kg/day) was administered via the drinking water of mice for 3
   weeks prior to behavioral testing. Mice were tested in the delayed
   alternation task (DAT) and open field test following acute serotonin 1B
   receptor (5-HT1B) agonist challenge to induce OCD-related behavior. We
   found that both doses of NAC blocked 5-HT1B agonist-induced deficits on
   the DAT. In a separate study, we administered NAC (60 mg/kg/day) for 1
   week or 3 weeks in the drinking water of mice prior to examining
   OCD-related behavior. We found that blockade of 5-HT1B agonist-induced
   OCD-like behavior is present at 3 weeks, but not 1 week, of NAC
   treatment. Together, our findings suggest that NAC is a novel OCD
   treatment with potential utility as monotherapy and therapeutic effects
   that emerge on a time-course similar to established medications.}},

Title = {{Noradrenergic Receptor Modulation Influences the Acoustic Parameters of

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{269-283}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Rats produce high rates of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in social
   situations; these vocalizations are influenced by multiple
   neurotransmitter systems. Norepinephrine (NE) plays a significant role
   in vocalization biology; however, the contribution of NE to normal,
   prosocial vocal control has not been well established in the rat. To
   address this, we used NE adrenoceptor agonists (Cirazoline, Clonidine)
   and antagonists (Prozasin, Atipamezole, Propranolol) to quantify the
   contribution of specific alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta NE receptors to USV
   parameters in male Long Evans rats during seminaturalistic calling. We
   found that multiple USV acoustic variables (intensity, bandwidth,
   duration, peak frequency, and call profile) are modified by alterations
   in NE signaling. Very generally, agents that increased NE
   neurotransmission (Atipamezole) or activated alpha-1 receptors
   (Cirazoline), led to an increase in intensity and duration,
   respectively. Agents that decreased NE neurotransmission (Clonidine) or
   blocked alpha-1 receptors (Prazosin) reduced call rate, intensity, and
   bandwidth. However, the beta-receptor antagonist, Propranolol, was
   associated with increased call rate, duration, and intensity. Limb motor
   behaviors were largely unaffected by any drug, with the exception of
   Clonidine. Higher doses of Clonidine significantly reduced gross motor,
   grooming, and feeding behavior. These results confirm the involvement of
   NE transmission in vocal control in the rat, and suggest that this USV
   model is useful for studying the neuropharmacology of behavioral
   measures that may have implications for disease states, such as
   Parkinson's disease.}},

Abstract = {{During extracellular dehydration, neural systems that sense deficits in
   body fluid homeostasis operate in tandem with those that mediate
   motivation and reward in order to promote ingestive behaviors that
   restore fluid balance. We hypothesized that hypothalamic orexin (Ox)
   neurons act as an interface to couple brain regions sensing and
   processing information about body fluid status with central nervous
   system motivation and reward systems. An initial set of anterograde and
   retrograde tracing experiments suggested that structures along the
   lamina terminalis (LT), a region of the forebrain that serves to monitor
   and integrate information reflecting body fluid balance, project to
   hypothalamic Ox neurons that, in turn, project to dopamine neurons in
   the ventral tegmental area (VTA). A second set of experiments determined
   whether Ox neuron activation is associated with extracellular
   dehydration and the seeking out and consumption of water and saline. An
   elevation of Fos-like immunoreactivity in Ox neurons was observed in
   fluid-depleted rats that were allowed to ingest water and sodium. A
   final experiment was conducted to determine whether Ox release in the
   VTA promotes thirst and salt appetite. Bilateral microinjection of the
   Ox Type I receptor antagonist SB-408124 into the VTA prior to acute
   extracellular dehydration attenuated fluid intake. Together, these
   studies support the hypothesis that structures along the LT modulate
   activity in the VTA through actions of orexinergic neurons that have
   cell bodies in the hypothalamus. This pathway may function to facilitate
   sustained consumption of fluids necessary for restoration of fluid
   balance.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies show that animals may prefer earned over free food-a
   phenomenon referred to as ``contrafreeloading.{''} In rodents,
   dopamine-which is involved in incentive motivation and
   effort-facilitates the occurrence of such a preference. Here, we
   investigated the behavioral effects of pramipexole (PPX), a dopamine
   D2/3 receptor agonist, on contrafreeloading in pigeons. In Experiment 1,
   2 groups of pigeons (PPX and SAL) were simultaneously exposed to a bowl
   that contained grains only (easy food option) and a bowl that contained
   grains covered with sawdust (harder food option) for 6 sessions. They
   were tested in two treatment conditions (high vs. low amount of food
   available). In Experiment 2, the two groups of pigeons were first
   repeatedly presented with the harder food option (training phase, 6
   sessions) and then with the two options at the same time (test phase, 3
   sessions). In order to potentially increase the physiological effects of
   PPX, the dose was tripled, and there was a 2-week incubation of the drug
   between Sessions 3 and 4 at training. The results indicate that the
   pigeons from both groups preferred to forage on the easy food option,
   and PPX did not alter this preference. Despite indications that PPX was
   effective, its action consisted of reducing-rather than magnifying-the
   attractiveness of the harder food option. It is suggested that pigeons
   are less motivated to deploy foraging effort than rodents in similar
   tasks.}},

Abstract = {{Light has substantial influences on the physiology and behavior of most
   laboratory animals. As such, lighting conditions within animal rooms are
   potentially significant and often underappreciated variables within
   experiments. Disruption of the light/dark cycle, primarily by exposing
   animals to light at night (LAN), disturbs biological rhythms and has
   widespread physiological consequences because of mechanisms such as
   melatonin suppression, sympathetic stimulation, and altered circadian
   clock gene expression. Thus, attention to the lighting environment of
   laboratory animals and maintaining consistency of a light/dark cycle is
   imperative for study reproducibility. Light intensity, as well as
   wavelength, photoperiod, and timing, are all important variables.
   Although modern rodent facilities are designed to facilitate appropriate
   light cycling, there are simple ways to modify rooms to prevent
   extraneous light exposure during the dark period. Attention to lighting
   conditions of laboratory animals by both researchers and research care
   staff ensures best practices for maintaining animal welfare, as well as

Abstract = {{Previous studies have suggested that trait differences in emotional
   awareness (tEA) are clinically relevant, and associated with differences
   in neural structure/function. While multiple leading theories suggest
   that conscious awareness requires widespread information integration
   across the brain, no study has yet tested the hypothesis that higher tEA
   corresponds to more efficient brain-wide information exchange.
   Twenty-six healthy volunteers (13 females) underwent a resting state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, and completed the Levels of
   Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS; a measure of tEA) and the Wechsler
   Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II; a measure of general
   intelligence quotient {[}IQ]). Using a whole-brain (functionally
   defined) region of interest (ROI) atlas, we computed several graph
   theory metrics to assess the efficiency of brain-wide information
   exchange. After statistically controlling for differences in age, gender
   and IQ we first observed a significant relationship between higher LEAS
   scores and greater average degree (i.e. overall whole-brain network
   density). When controlling for average degree, we found that higher LEAS
   scores were also associated with shorter average path lengths across the
   collective network of all included ROIs. These results jointly suggest
   that individuals with higher tEA display more efficient global
   information exchange throughout the brain. This is consistent with the
   idea that conscious awareness requires global accessibility of
   represented information.}},

Abstract = {{Interoception refers to the processing of homeostatic bodily signals.
   Research demonstrates that interoceptive markers can be modulated via
   exteroceptive stimuli and suggests that the emotional content of this
   information may produce distinct interoceptive outcomes. Here, we
   explored the impact of differently valenced exteroceptive information on
   the processing of interoceptive signals. Participants completed a
   repetition-suppression paradigm viewing repeating or alternating faces.
   In experiment 1, faces wore either angry or pained expressions to
   explore the interoceptive response to different types of negative
   stimuli in the observer. In experiment 2, expressions were happy or sad
   to compare interoceptive processing of positive and negative
   information. We measured the heartbeat evoked potential (HEP) and visual
   evoked potentials (VEPs) as a respective marker of intero- and
   exteroceptive processing. We observed increased HEP amplitude to
   repeated sad and pained faces coupled with reduced HEP and VEP amplitude
   to repeated angry faces. No effects were observed for positive faces.
   However, we found a significant correlation between suppression of the
   HEP and VEP to repeating angry faces. Results highlight an effect of
   emotional expression on interoception and suggest an attentional
   trade-off between internal and external processing domains as a
   potential account of this phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions offer an ecologically valid model for examining
   individual differences in affective decision-making. They convey an
   emotional signal from a social agent and provide important predictive
   information about one's environment (presence of potential rewards or
   threats). Although some expressions provide clear predictive information
   (angry, happy), others (surprised) are ambiguous in that they predict
   both positive and negative outcomes. Thus, surprised faces can delineate
   an individual's valence bias, or the tendency to interpret ambiguity as
   positive or negative. Our initial negativity hypothesis suggests that
   the initial response to ambiguity is negative, and that positivity
   relies on emotion regulation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing
   brain activity during explicit emotion regulation (reappraisal) and
   while freely viewing facial expressions, and measuring the relationship
   between brain activity and valence bias. Brain regions recruited during
   reappraisal showed greater activity for surprise in individuals with an
   increasingly positive valence bias. Additionally, we linked amygdala
   activity with an initial negativity, revealing a pattern similarity in
   individuals with negative bias between viewing surprised faces and
   maintaining negativity. Finally, these individuals failed to show normal
   habituation to clear negativity. These results support the initial
   negativity hypothesis, and are consistent with emotion research in both
   children and adult populations.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence increasingly suggests that neural structures that respond to
   primary and secondary rewards are also implicated in the processing of
   social rewards. The `like'-a popular feature on social media-shares
   features with both monetary and social rewards as a means of feedback
   that shapes reinforcement learning. Despite the ubiquity of the Like,
   little is known about the neural correlates of providing this feedback
   to others. In this study, we mapped the neural correlates of providing
   Likes to others on social media. Fifty-eight adolescents and young
   adults completed a task in the MRI scanner designed to mimic the social
   photo-sharing app Instagram. We examined neural responses when
   participants provided positive feedback to others. The experience of
   providing Likes to others on social media related to activation in brain
   circuity implicated in reward, including the striatum and ventral
   tegmental area, regions also implicated in the experience of receiving
   Likes from others. Providing Likes was also associated with activation
   in brain regions involved in salience processing and executive function.
   We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of
   the neural processing of social rewards, as well as the neural processes
   underlying social media use.}},

Abstract = {{Stress engendered by stereotype threatening situations may facilitate

   performance among women in science, technology, engineering and
   mathematics (STEM). It is unclear, however, whether this process is
   comprised of the same neurophysiological mechanisms evident in any
   emotional memory encoding context, or if this encoding bias directly
   undermines positive self-perceptions in the stigmatized domain. A total
   of 160 men and women completed a math test that provided veridical
   positive and negative feedback, a memory test for feedback, and math
   self-enhancing and valuing measures in a stereotype threatening or
   neutral context while continuous electroencephalography activity and
   startle probe responses to positive and negative feedback was recorded.
   Indexing amygdala activity to feedback via startle responses and
   emotional memory network connectivity elicited during accurate
   recognition of positive and negative feedback via graph analyses, only
   stereotype threatened women encoded negative feedback better when they
   exhibited increased amygdala activity and emotional memory network
   connectivity in response to said feedback. Emotional memory biases, in
   turn, predicted decreases in women's self-enhancing, math valuing and
   performance. Findings provide an emotional memory encoding-based
   mechanism for well-established findings indicating that women have more
   negative math self-perceptions compared with men regardless of actual

Abstract = {{Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated with abnormalities
   in cortical thickness and autonomic function. Adolescence is a time
   notable for brain development and MDD onset. In healthy adolescents,
   greater resting state vagal activity (RVA) is associated with lower
   cortical thickness. The relationship between brain structural thickness
   and RVA in adolescents with MDD has not previously been studied. This
   secondary analysis drew on a sample of 37 non-depressed controls and 53
   adolescents with MDD. Resting state heart rate and two indices of RVA
   (HF-HRV and RMSSD) were recorded during a neuroimaging session. Cortical
   thickness within fronto-limbic regions of interest was measured using
   Freesurfer analysis of T1-weighted high-resolution structural images.
   Self-reports of depression severity showed a significant interaction
   with cortical thickness of the right insula in predicting RMSSD {[}t=
   2.22, P=0.030, beta=5.44; model fit of the interaction term as indicated
   by the `Bayes Factor' (BF): 7.58J and HF-HRV (t = 2.09, P=0.041,
   beta=4.72; BF: 7.94). Clinician ratings of depression severity showed
   further interactions. Findings underscore the important relationships
   between RVA and cortical development, suggesting two possible
   explanations: (i) in adolescent MDD, greater fronto-limbic thickness is
   compensatory for deficits in autonomic regulation or (ii) increased
   autonomic arousal results in delayed fronto-limbic maturation.
   Longitudinal research is necessary to further clarify the nature of the
   relationship between autonomic functioning and cortical development.}},

Abstract = {{Psychological resilience reflects the capacity to bounce back from
   stress, which plays an important role in health and well-being. However,
   less is known about the neural substrate for psychological resilience
   and the underlying mechanism for how psychological resilience enhances
   subjective well-being in the healthy brain. To investigate these issues,
   we employed fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF)
   measured with resting-state fMRI in 100 young healthy adults. The
   correlation analysis found that higher psychological resilience was
   related to lower fALFF in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which is
   involved in reward-related processing and emotion regulation.
   Furthermore, the mediation analysis indicated that psychological
   resilience acted as a full mediator of the association between the fALFF
   in left OFC and subjective well-being indicators (i.e. life satisfaction
   and hedonic balance). Importantly, these results remained significant
   after controlling for the effect of gray matter volume and regional
   homogeneity in the region. Overall, the present study provides the
   further evidence for functional neural substrates of psychological
   resilience and reveals a potential mechanism that psychological
   resilience mediates the effect of spontaneous brain activity on
   subjective well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Since prior diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies reported no
   significant differences in white matter organizations between
   individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their unaffected
   siblings, the neural correlates for developing a clinical diagnosis
   among people with endophenotypes remain undetermined. We obtained DTI
   data from a total of 60 participants consisting of 30 people with
   endophenotypes and 30 people without. We first followed a conventional
   approach by comparing individuals with ASD and their unaffected
   siblings. Using region-of-interest approach, we then performed
   bootstrapping to examine whether the differences in white matter
   organizations between individuals with ASD and their unaffected siblings
   were substantially large, considering the distribution of differences
   between typically developing (TD) siblings. Conventional approaches
   revealed no significant differences in white matter organizations
   between individuals with ASD and their unaffected siblings.
   Bootstrapping revealed a significantly large difference in axial
   diffusivity in the left stria terminalis between individuals with ASD
   and their unaffected siblings after accounting for the distribution of
   differences in axial diffusivity among TD siblings (99.998 percentile).
   The results remained significant after controlling for multiple
   comparisons with Bonferroni method. We assumed that one aspect of this
   tract was associated with the development of a clinical diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual assault is a frequent interpersonal trauma, which often leads to
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Among other postassault
   characteristics, self-blame attributions were suggested to play an
   important role in sexually assaulted individuals' coping and were
   consistently associated with PTSD in this population. The present study
   aimed to elucidate the neural underpinnings that may associate
   self-blame and PTSD in women who experienced sexual assault at
   adulthood, using structural and resting-state functional MRI.
   Thirty-eight sexually assaulted women and 24 non-exposed matched
   controls were studied (mean age: 25 years). Among the sexually assaulted
   participants, assault-related self-blame was negatively correlated with
   gray matter volume (GMV) bilaterally in the lingual gyrus and adjacent
   intracalcarine cortex. GMV in this cluster was also predicted by
   intrusion symptoms and negative social reactions. Resting-state
   functional connectivity (rs-FC) of this cluster with the left anterior
   temporal fusiform cortex significantly differed between PTSD and
   non-PTSD sexually assaulted participants, and was inversely correlated
   with intrusion symptoms and with peritraumatic dissociation. Finally,
   lingual cluster's GMV and rs-FC with the anterior fusiform mediated the
   association between self-blame and intrusion symptoms across sexually
   assaulted participants. These findings link assault-related self-blame,
   disrupted postassault recovery and the neural circuitry involved in the
   processing of traumatic memories.}},

Abstract = {{To analyse the functioning of the amygdala in depression, we performed
   the first voxel-level resting state functional-connectivity neuroimaging
   analysis of depression of voxels in the amygdala with all other voxels
   in the brain, with 336 patients with major depressive disorder and 350
   controls. Amygdala voxels had decreased functional connectivity (FC)
   with the orbitofrontal cortex, temporal lobe areas, including the
   temporal pole, inferior temporal gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus.
   The reductions in the strengths of the FC of the amygdala voxels with
   the medial orbitofrontal cortex and temporal lobe voxels were correlated
   with increases in the Beck Depression Inventory score and in the
   duration of illness measures of depression. Parcellation analysis in 350
   healthy controls based on voxel-level FC showed that the basal division
   of the amygdala has high FC with medial orbitofrontal cortex areas, and
   the dorsolateral amygdala has strong FC with the lateral orbitofrontal
   cortex and related ventral parts of the inferior frontal gyrus. In
   depression, the basal amygdala division had especially reduced FC with
   the medial orbitofrontal cortex, which is involved in reward; and the
   dorsolateral amygdala subdivision had relatively reduced FC with the
   lateral orbitofrontal cortex, which is involved in non-reward.}},

   encephalogram that reflects motivational significance. Participants
   completed a trait measure of behavioral inhibition system (BIS)
   sensitivity. Then they affirmed (or did not affirm) a core personal
   value before viewing a series of emotionally evocative pictures.
   Affirming a core value increased LPP responses to negative emotional
   pictures among individuals higher in BIS. Self-affirmation thus appeared
   to alter the motivational significance of negative pictures among
   threat-prone individuals, consistent with a reduction in the defensive
   avoidance of aversive stimuli. These findings suggest that affirming
   values may influence responses associated with basic (non-self)
   motivational systems among individuals sensitive to threat.}},

   phenomenon, known as paying-it-forward (PIF) reciprocity, crucially
   contributes to the maintenance of a cooperative human society by passing
   kindness among strangers and has been widely studied in evolutionary
   biology. To further examine its neural implementation and underlying
   computations, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging together
   with computational modeling. In a modified PIF paradigm, participants
   first received a monetary split (i.e. greedy, equal or generous) from
   either a human partner or a computer. They then chose between two
   options involving additional amounts of money to be allocated between
   themselves and an uninvolved person. Behaviorally, people forward the
   previously received greed/generosity towards a third person. The social
   impact of previous treatments is integrated into computational signals
   in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right temporoparietal
   junction during subsequent decision making. Our findings provide
   insights to understand the proximal origin of PIF reciprocity.}},

Abstract = {{The role of facial coding in body language comprehension was
   investigated by event-related potential recordings in 31 participants
   viewing 800 photographs of gestures (iconic, deictic and emblematic),
   which could be congruent or incongruent with their caption. Facial
   information was obscured by blurring in half of the stimuli. The task
   consisted of evaluating picture/caption congruence. Quicker response
   times were observed in women than in men to congruent stimuli, and a
   cost for incongruent vs congruent stimuli was found only in men. Face
   obscuration did not affect accuracy in women as reflected by omission
   percentages, nor reduced their cognitive potentials, thus suggesting a
   better comprehension of face deprived pantomimes. N170 response
   (modulated by congruity and face presence) peaked later in men than in
   women. Late positivity was much larger for congruent stimuli in the
   female brain, regardless of face blurring. Face presence specifically
   activated the right superior temporal and fusiform gyri, cingulate
   cortex and insula, according to source reconstruction. These regions
   have been reported to be insufficiently activated in face-avoiding
   individuals with social deficits. Overall, the results corroborate the
   hypothesis that females might be more resistant to the lack of facial
   information or better at understanding body language in face-deprived
   social information.}},

Abstract = {{Our ability to understand others' communicative intentions in speech is
   key to successful social interaction. Indeed, misunderstanding an
   `excuse me' as apology, while meant as criticism, may have important
   consequences. Recent behavioural studies have provided evidence that
   prosody, that is, vocal tone, is an important indicator for speakers'
   intentions. Using a novel audio-morphing paradigm, the present
   functional magnetic resonance imaging study examined the neurocognitive
   mechanisms that allow listeners to `read' speakers' intents from vocal
   prosodic patterns. Participants categorized prosodic expressions that
   gradually varied in their acoustics between criticism, doubt, and
   suggestion. Categorizing typical exemplars of the three intentions
   induced activations along the ventral auditory stream, complemented by
   amygdala and mentalizing system. These findings likely depict the
   stepwise conversion of external perceptual information into abstract
   prosodic categories and internal social semantic concepts, including the
   speaker's mental state. Ambiguous tokens, in turn, involved
   cingulo-opercular areas known to assist decision-making in case of
   conflicting cues. Auditory and decision-making processes were flexibly
   coupled with the amygdala, depending on prosodic typicality, indicating
   enhanced categorization efficiency of overtly relevant, meaningful
   prosodic signals. Altogether, the results point to a model in which
   auditory prosodic categorization and socio-inferential conceptualization
   cooperate to translate perceived vocal tone into a coherent
   representation of the speaker's intent.}},

Abstract = {{Rejection by parents is an important aspect of child maltreatment.
   Altered neural responses to social rejection have been observed in
   maltreated individuals. The current study is the first to examine the
   impact of experienced and perpetrated abuse and neglect on neural
   responses to social exclusion by strangers versus family using a
   multigenerational family design, including 144 participants. The role of
   neural reactivity to social exclusion in the intergenerational
   transmission of maltreatment was also examined. Exclusion by strangers
   was especially associated with increased activation in the left insula,
   while exclusion by a family member was mainly associated with increased
   activation in the ACC. Neural reactivity to social exclusion by
   strangers in the insula, ACC and dmPFC, was associated with experienced
   maltreatment but not with perpetrated maltreatment. In abusive parents,
   altered neural reactivity during exclusion was found in other brain
   areas, indicating different neural correlates of experienced and
   perpetrated maltreatment. Hence, no mechanisms could be identified that
   are involved in the transmission of maltreatment. Hypersensitivity to
   social rejection by strangers in neglected individuals underscores the
   importance to distinguish between effects of abuse and neglect and
   suggests that the impact of experiencing rejection and maltreatment by
   your own parents extends beyond the family context.}},

Abstract = {{Activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during persuasive messages
   predicts future message-consistent behavior change, but there are
   significant limitations to the types of persuasion processes that can be
   invoked inside an MRI scanner. For instance, real world persuasion often
   involves multiple people in conversation. Functional near infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS) allows us to move out of the scanner and into more
   ecologically valid contexts. As a first step, the current study used
   fNIRS to replicate an existing fMRI persuasion paradigm (i.e. the
   sunscreen paradigm) to determine if mPFC shows similar predictive value
   with this technology. Consistent with prior fMRI work, activity in mPFC
   was significantly associated with message-consistent behavior change,
   above and beyond self-reported intentions. There was also a difference
   in this association between previous users and non-users of sunscreen.
   Activity differences based on messages characteristics were not
   observed. Finally, activity in a region of right dorsolateral PFC
   (dlPFC), which has been observed with counterarguing against persuasive
   messages, correlated negatively with future behavior. The current
   results suggest it is reasonable to use fNIRS to examine persuasion
   paradigms that go beyond what is possible in the MRI scanner
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and its main oscillatory feature, frontal
   theta, have been related to the processing of recent emotional memories.
   As memories constitute much of the source material for our dreams, we
   explored the link between REM frontal theta and the memory sources of
   dreaming, so as to elucidate the brain activities behind the formation
   of dream content. Twenty participants were woken for dream reports in
   REM and slow wave sleep (SWS) while monitored using
   electroencephalography. Eighteen participants reported at least one REM
   dream and 14 at least one SWS dream, and they, and independent judges,
   subsequently compared their dream reports with log records of their
   previous daily experiences. The number of references to recent
   waking-life experiences in REM dreams was positively correlated with
   frontal theta activity in the REM sleep period. No such correlation was
   observed for older memories, nor for SWS dreams. The emotional intensity
   of recent waking-life experiences incorporated into dreams was higher
   than the emotional intensity of experiences that were not incorporated.
   These results suggest that the formation of wakefulness-related dream
   content is associated with REM theta activity, and accords with theories
   that dreaming reflects emotional memory processing taking place in REM
   sleep.}},

Abstract = {{Social rejection is a distressing and painful event that many people
   must cope with on a frequent basis. Mindfulness-defined here as a mental
   state of receptive attentiveness to internal and external stimuli as
   they arise, moment-to-moment-may buffer such social distress. However,
   little research indicates whether mindful individuals adaptively
   regulate the distress of rejection-or the neural mechanisms underlying
   this potential capacity. To fill these gaps in the literature,
   participants reported their trait mindfulness and then completed a
   social rejection paradigm (Cyberball) while undergoing functional
   magnetic resonance imaging. Approximately 1 hour after the rejection
   incident, participants reported their level of distress during rejection
   (i.e. social distress). Mindfulness was associated with less distress
   during rejection. This relation was mediated by lower activation in the
   left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during the rejection incident, a
   brain region reliably associated with the inhibition of negative affect.
   Mindfulness was also correlated with less functional connectivity
   between the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral
   amygdala and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, which play a critical
   role in the generation of social distress. Mindfulness may relate to
   effective coping with rejection by not over-activating top-down
   regulatory mechanisms, potentially resulting in more effective
   long-termemotion-regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Links between individual differences in risk processing and high-risk
   behaviors such as binge-drinking have long been the focus of active
   research. However, investigations in this area almost exclusively
   utilize decision-making focused paradigms. This emphasis makes it
   difficult to assess links between risk behaviors and raw risk reactivity
   independent of decision and feedback processes. A deeper understanding
   of this association has the potential to shed light on the role of risk
   reactivity in high-risk behavior susceptibility. To contribute toward
   this aim, this study utilizes a popular risk-taking game, the crocodile
   dentist, to assess links between individual differences in decision-free
   risk-reactivity and reported binge-drinking frequency levels. In this
   task, participants engage in a series of decision-free escalating risk
   responses. Risk-reactivity was assessed by measuring late positive
   potential responses toward risk-taking action initiation cues using
   high-density 256-Channel EEG. The results indicate that, after
   controlling for overall alcohol consumption frequency, higher rates of
   reported binge-drinking are associated with both increased general
   risk-taking responsivity and increased risk-reactivity escalation as a
   function of risk level. These findings highlight intriguing links
   between risk reactivity and binge-drinking frequency, making key
   contributions in the areas of risk-taking and affective science.}},

Abstract = {{Reconsolidation theory has supported the notion that active memory is
   vulnerable to the effects of an amnesic agent. An extension of
   reconsolidation theory posits that active memory, while necessary for
   creating vulnerability in memory, is not sufficient. Prediction error
   (i.e., when expectation is inconsistent with reality) may be a key
   factor in the destabilization of memory. The present study examined the
   role of prediction error in appetitive memory reconsolidation. Rats
   learned to dig in cups of scented sand to retrieve buried sweet cereal
   rewards. Forty-eight hours following acquisition, a single reactivation
   trial was given during which a prediction error or no prediction error
   was included. The prediction error consisted of a single extinction
   trial, while the no prediction error condition consisted of an
   additional reinforced trial. Cycloheximide (CHX; 1 mg/kg) or vehicle
   (VEH: distilled water; 1 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally
   immediately following reactivation. One week following reactivation,
   rats received 2 nonreinforced test trials. Results showed longer
   latencies to dig for rats that received CHX following a prediction error
   (CHX/PE) compared to rats that received VEH (VEH/PE) or did not receive
   a prediction error (CHX/NoPE or VEH/NoPE). These results add to a
   growing literature demonstrating that protein synthesis is necessary in
   appetitive memory reconsolidation only when reactivation includes a
   prediction error.}},

   A Dissociation of Perirhinal Cortical-Dependent Behaviors}},

Volume = {{132}},

Abstract = {{The perirhinal cortex (PRC) supports associative memory and perception,
   and PRC dysfunction impairs animals' abilities to associate stimulus
   features across sensory modalities. PRC damage also leads to deficits in
   discriminating between stimuli that share features. Although
   PRC-dependent stimulus discrimination has been shown to be impaired with
   advanced age, data regarding the abilities of older adults and other
   animals to form PRC-dependent associations have been equivocal.
   Moreover, the extent to which similar neural computations within the PRC
   support associative memory versus discrimination abilities have not been
   directly examined. In the current study, young and aged rats were
   crosscharacterized on two PRC-dependent crossmodal object recognition
   (CMOR) tasks to test associative memory, and a LEGO object
   discrimination task. In the CMOR tasks, rats were familiarized with an
   object with access to tactile input and then tested for recognition with
   visual input only. The relative exploration time of novel versus
   familiar objects indicated that aged rats showed preference for the
   novel over familiar object with and without an epoch of multimodal
   preexposure to the familiar object prior to the testing session.
   Furthermore, crossmodal recognition performance between young and aged
   rats was not significantly different. In contrast, for the LEGO object
   discrimination task, aged rats were impaired relative to young rats.
   Notably, aged rats that performed poorly on the LEGO object
   discrimination task had better performance on the CMOR tasks. The
   dissociation of discrimination and association abilities with age
   suggests that these behaviors rely on distinct neural computations
   within PRC-medial temporal lobe circuit.}},

Title = {{Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids Alter Decision Making in a Balanced Rodent

Volume = {{132}},

Abstract = {{Anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) abuse is implicated in maladaptive
   decision making such as increased risk taking and problem gambling.
   Endogenous testosterone correlates with economic risk taking in both the
   stock market (Coates \& Herbert, 2008) and in the laboratory, as
   measured by the Iowa Gambling Task (Stanton, Liening, \& Schultheiss,
   2011). Additionally, AAS use has been associated with problem gambling
   behavior in adolescents (Proimos, DuRant, Pierce, \& Goodman, 1998).
   Thus, AAS may impair economic decision making. However, studies of human
   AAS users cannot control for preexisting risky behavior or normalize
   androgen levels. Accordingly, the present study investigated AAS effects
   on decision making in rats using a novel, balanced rodent model of the
   IGT. Adolescent male Long-Evans rats were treated chronically with
   high-dose testosterone (7.5 mg/kg) or vehicle (13\% cyclodextrin in
   water) sc, and trained to work for sugar pellets in an operant chamber
   equipped with 4 levers, each associated with a different schedule of
   reward magnitude (number of pellets), probability, and punishment
   (time-out) duration. By RM-ANOVA, there was a main effect of lever
   (F-3,F-78 = 25.33, p < .05), such that all rats preferred lever L4
   offering a large reward (4 pellets), but with low probability (45\%) and
   a long (35 sec) time-out. There was also a significant interaction of
   testosterone x lever (F-3,F-78 = 2.78, p < .05), with testosterone
   increasing preference for L4 and decreasing preference for the other
   levers, relative to vehicle-treated controls. These data extend our
   previous findings of altered decision making in AAS-treated rats, and
   suggest that AAS may alter economic decision making in human users.}},

Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{In a recent study, having participants make three retrieval attempts
   (i.e., retrieval practice) when learning information strengthened memory
   against the detrimental effects of psychological stress. We aimed to
   determine whether learning to criterion, in which only one successful
   retrieval attempt is made, would similarly buffer memory against stress,
   or whether multiple retrieval attempts are necessary to achieve that
   effect. In Experiment 1, participants learned to criterion and then
   engaged in additional restudying (CLS) or retrieval practice (CLR).
   Twenty-four hours later, stress was induced and stress-related increases
   in cortisol were observed. However, no differences in recall performance
   were observed between any of the groups. Experiment 2 was similar but
   introduced a 1-week delay between encoding and retrieval. Recall
   performance was impaired for both groups under stress, but recall for
   those in the CLR group was still better than either pre- or post-stress
   performance for those in the CLS group. Thus, criterial learning may
   protect memory against stress in the short-term, but additional
   retrieval practice is more beneficial for achieving this effect in the
   long-term.}},

Abstract = {{Childhood adversity is associated with exaggerated threat processing and
   earlier alcohol use initiation. Conclusive links remain elusive, as
   childhood adversity typically co-occurs with detrimental socioeconomic
   factors, and its impact is likely moderated by biological sex. To
   unravel the complex relationships among childhood adversity, sex, threat
   estimation, and alcohol use initiation, we exposed female and male
   Long-Evans rats to early adolescent adversity (EAA). In adulthood, > 50
   days following the last adverse experience, threat estimation was
   assessed using a novel fear discrimination procedure in which cues
   predict a unique probability of footshock: danger (p = 1.00),
   uncertainty (p = .25), and safety (p = .00). Alcohol use initiation was
   assessed using voluntary access to 20\% ethanol, >90 days following the
   last adverse experience. During development, EAA slowed body weight gain
   in both females and males. In adulthood, EAA selectively inflated female
   threat estimation, exaggerating fear to uncertainty and safety, but
   promoted alcohol use initiation across sexes. Meaningful relationships
   between threat estimation and alcohol use initiation were not observed,
   underscoring the independent effects of EAA. Results isolate the
   contribution of EAA to adult threat estimation, alcohol use initiation,
   and reveal moderation by biological sex.}},

Abstract = {{Secreted in the evening and the night, melatonin suppresses activity of
   the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, a brain pathway involved in reward
   processing. However, exposure to bright light diminishes-or even
   prevents-melatonin secretion. Thus, we hypothesized that reward
   processing, in the evening, is more pronounced in bright light (vs. dim
   light). Healthy human participants carried out three tasks that tapped
   into various aspects of reward processing (effort expenditure for
   rewards task {[}EEfRT]; two-armed bandit task {[}2ABT]; balloon analogue
   risk task {[}BART). Brightness was manipulated within-subjects (bright
   vs. dim light), in separate evening sessions. During the EEfRT,
   participants used reward-value information more strongly when they were
   exposed to bright light (vs. dim light). This finding supported our
   hypothesis. However, exposure to bright light did not significantly
   affect task behavior on the 2ABT and the BART. While future research is
   necessary (e.g., to zoom in on working mechanisms), these findings have
   potential implications for the design of physical work environments.}},

   control. Similarly, being in a state of motor learning has been strongly
   associated only with an upregulation of feedback responses at
   transcortical latencies and beyond. In two separate experiments, the
   current study examined the task-dependent modulation of stretch reflexes
   by perturbing the hand of human subjects while they were waiting for a
   ``Go{''} signal to move at the different stages of a classic kinematic
   learning task (visuomotor rotation). Although the subjects had to resist
   all haptic perturbations equally across task stages, the study leveraged
   that task-dependent feedback controllers may already be ``loaded{''} at
   the movement anticipation stage. In addition to an upregulation of
   reflex gains during early exposure to the visual distortion, I found a
   relative inhibition of reflex responses in the ``washout{''} stage
   (sensory realignment state). For more distal muscles (brachioradialis)
   this inhibition also extended to the monosynaptic reflex response
   ({''}R1{''}). Moreover, these R1 gains reflected individual motor
   learning performance in the visuomotor task. The results demonstrate
   that the system's ``control policy{''} in visuomotor adaptation can also
   include inhibition of proprioceptive reflexes, and that aspects of this
   policy can affect monosynaptic spinal circuits. The latter finding
   suggests a novel form of state-related control, probably realized by
   independent control of fusimotor neurons, through which segmental
   circuits can tune to higher-level features of a sensorimotor task.}},

Abstract = {{Applied to video games, Csikszentmihalyi's work on flow evidences that a
   positive gaming experience is intrinsically self-rewarding and primarily
   determined by the skill/challenge balance. A multi-layered measure of
   enjoyment is built to take these components into account. Gamers were
   asked to report the concentration-enjoyment they experienced during a
   first-person shooter game, and to better assess the gap between skill
   and challenge, the challenge enjoyment was also rated. Along with
   concentration level, concentration enjoyment is used to build a gaming
   experience typology that accounts for the self-rewarding component. An
   enjoyment-based challenge mapping is also drawn up, crossing challenge
   enjoyment and challenge level. The results show that this integrative
   enjoyment measure strengthens the causal link between challenge and
   gaming experience. Most importantly, the findings suggest that challenge
   or concentration-based enjoyment measures outweigh the standard
   concentration and difficulty measures as they are more likely to ensure
   a pleasant and positive experience (flow or relaxation) for the gamers.
   Indeed, regardless of the reported level of challenge, a gamer is more
   likely to have a positive experience when challenged at a level she
   perceives as pleasant. This article emphasizes the importance for game
   publishers of gathering enjoyment-based concentration and challenge
   assessments to ensure a positive gaming experience and gamers'
   commitment.}},

Abstract = {{While we may think about harm as primarily being about physical injury,
   harm can also take the form of negative psychological impact. Using
   functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the extent to which

   reasoning or theory of mind, a key cognitive process for moral judgment.
   First, univariate analyses reveal item-specific features that lead to
   greater recruitment of theory of mind regions for psychological harm
   versus physical harm. Second, multivariate pattern analyses reveal
   sensitivity to the psychological/physical distinction in two regions
   implicated in theory of mind: the right temporoparietal junction and the
   precuneus. Third, we find no reliable differences between neurotypical
   adults and adults with autism spectrum disorder with regard to neural
   activity related to theory of mind during moral evaluations of
   psychological and physical harm. Altogether, these results reveal neural

Abstract = {{Adolescents are notorious for engaging in risky, reward-motivated
   behavior, and this behavior occurs most often in response to social
   reward, typically in the form of peer contexts involving intense
   positive affect. A combination of greater neural and behavioral
   sensitivity to peer positive affect may characterize adolescents who are
   especially likely to engage in risky behaviors. To test this hypothesis,
   we examined 50 adolescents' reciprocal positive affect and neural
   response to a personally relevant, ecologically valid pleasant stimulus:
   positive affect expressed by their best friend during a conversation
   about past and future rewarding mutual experiences. Participants were
   typically developing community adolescents (age 14-18 years, 48.6\%
   female), and risky behavior was defined as a factor including domains
   such as substance use, sexual behavior and suicidality. Adolescents who
   engaged in more real-life risk-taking behavior exhibited either a
   combination of high reciprocal positive affect behavior and high
   response in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex-a region associated
   with impulsive sensation-seeking-or the opposite combination. Behavioral
   and neural sensitivity to peer influence could combine to contribute to
   pathways from peer influence to risky behavior, with implications for
   healthy development.}},

Abstract = {{Creating real-life dynamic contexts to study interactive behaviors is a
   fundamental challenge for the social neuroscience of interpersonal
   relations. Real synchronic interpersonal motor interactions involve
   online, inter-individual mutual adaptation (the ability to adapt one's
   movements to those of another in order to achieve a shared goal). In
   order to study the contribution of the left anterior Intra Parietal
   Sulcus (aIPS) (i.e. a region supporting motor functions) to mutual
   adaptation, here, we combined a behavioral grasping task where pairs of
   participants synchronized their actions when performing mutually
   adaptive imitative and complementary movements, with the inhibition of
   activity of aIPS via non-invasive brain stimulation. This approach
   allowed us to investigate whether aIPS supports online complementary and
   imitative interactions. Behavioral results showed that inhibition of
   aIPS selectively impairs pair performance during complementary compared
   to imitative interactions. Notably, this effect depended on pairs'
   mutual adaptation skills and was higher for pairs composed of
   participants who were less capable of adapting to each other. Thus, we
   provide the first causative evidence for a role of the left aIPS in
   supporting mutually adaptive interactions and show that the inhibition
   of the neural resources of one individual of a pair is compensated at
   the dyadic level.}},

Abstract = {{Social rejection is a painful event that often increases aggression.
   However, the neural mechanisms of this rejection-aggression link remain
   unclear. A potential clue may be that rejected people often recruit the
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex's (VLPFC) self-regulatory processes to
   manage the pain of rejection. Using functional MRI, we replicated
   previous links between rejection and activity in the brain's mentalizing
   network, social pain network and VLPFC. VLPFC recruitment during
   rejection was associated with greater activity in the brain's reward
   network (i.e. the ventral striatum) when individuals were given an
   opportunity to retaliate. This retaliation-related striatal response was
   associated with greater levels of retaliatory aggression.
   Dispositionally aggressive individuals exhibited less functional
   connectivity between the ventral striatum and the right VLPFC during
   aggression. This connectivity exerted a suppressing effect on
   dispositionally aggressive individuals' greater aggressive responses to
   rejection. These results help explain how the pain of rejection and
   reward of revenge motivate rejected people to behave aggressively.}},

Abstract = {{Humans typically display inequality aversion in social situations, which
   manifests itself as a preference for fairer distributions of resources.
   However, people differ in the degree to which they dislike being worse
   off {[}disadvantageous inequality (DI) aversion] or better off
   {[}advantageous inequality (AI) aversion] than others. Competing models
   explain such behavior by focusing on aversion to payoff differences,
   maximization of total payoff or reciprocity. Using functional
   near-infrared spectroscopy, we asked which of these theories could
   better explain dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) activity while
   participants accepted or punished fair vs unfair monetary transfers in
   an anonymous norm compliance task. We found that while all participants
   exhibited DI aversion, there were substantial differences in preferences
   for AI, which were strongly predicted by dlPFC activation. Model
   comparisons revealed that both punishment behavior and prefrontal
   activity were best explained by a model that allowed for AI seeking
   rather than imposing aversion. Moreover, enhancing this model by taking
   into account behavioral response times, as a proxy for choice
   difficulty, further improved model fits. Our data provide evidence that
   the dlPFC encodes subjective values of payoff inequality and that this
   representation is richer than envisaged by standard models of social
   preferences.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we utilized a novel fMRI paradigm to examine the
   behavioral and neural correlates of parenting self-evaluation in a
   sample of mothers with at least one child under the age of 4 (N = 37).
   Prior self-report, behavioral and observational research document the
   implications of parenting self-evaluations for parent well-being and
   caregiving behavior; however, relatively little is known about the
   neural circuitry underlying these self-referential processes and to what
   extent they are influenced by caregiving experience. Although
   neuroimaging paradigms indexing other aspects of parental function
   exist, this is the first to use functional neuroimaging to study
   parenting self-evaluation in a controlled laboratory setting. We found
   parenting self-evaluations elicited significantly greater activity
   across most cortical midline structures, including the medial prefrontal
   cortex compared to control evaluations; these findings converge with
   previous work on the neural underpinning of general trait
   self-evaluation. Notable differences by parity were observed in
   exploratory analyses: specifically, primiparous mothers endorsed a
   higher number of developmentally supportive traits, exhibited faster

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a time of increased social-affective sensitivity, which
   is often related to heightened health-risk behaviors. However, moderate
   levels of social sensitivity, relative to either low (social vacuum) or
   high levels exceptionally attuned), may confer benefits as it
   facilitates effective navigation of the social world. The present fMRI
   study tested a curvilinear relationship between social sensitivity and
   adaptive decision-making. Participants ages 12-16; N - 35) played the
   Social Analogue Risk Task, which measures participants' willingness to
   knock on doors in order to earn points. With each knock, the facial
   expression of the house's resident shifted from happy to somewhat
   angrier. If the resident became too angry, the door slammed and
   participants lost points. Social sensitivity was defined as the extent
   to which adolescents adjusted their risky choices based on shifting
   facial expressions. Results confirmed a curvilinear relationship between
   social sensitivity and self-reported adaptive decision-making at the
   behavioral and neural level. Moderate adolescent social sensitivity was
   modulated via heightened tracking of social cues in the temporoparietal
   junction, insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and related to
   adaptive decision-making. These findings suggest that social-affective
   sensitivity may positively impact outcomes in adolescence and have
   implications for interventions to help adolescents reach mature social
   goals into adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{Every day, humans make countless decisions that require the integration
   of information about potential benefits (i.e. rewards) with other
   decision features (i.e. effort required, probability of an outcome or
   time delays). Here, we examine the overlap and dissociation of
   behavioral preferences and neural representations of subjective value in
   the context of three different decision features (physical effort,
   probability and time delays) in a healthy adult life span sample. While
   undergoing functional neuroimaging, participants (N = 75) made incentive
   compatible choices between a smaller monetary reward with lower physical
   effort, higher probability, or a shorter time delay versus a larger
   monetary reward with higher physical effort, lower probability, or a
   longer time delay. Behavioral preferences were estimated from observed
   choices, and subjective values were computed using individual hyperbolic
   discount functions. We found that discount rates were uncorrelated
   across tasks. Despite this apparent behavioral dissociation between
   preferences, we found overlapping subjective value-related activity in
   the medial prefrontal cortex across all three tasks. We found no
   consistent evidence for age differences in either preferences or the
   neural representations of subjective value across adulthood. These
   results suggest that while the tolerance of decision features is
   behaviorally dissociable, subjective value signals share a common
   representation across adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{The functional organization of human emotion systems as well as their
   neuroanatomical basis and segregation in the brain remains unresolved.
   Here, we used pattern classification and hierarchical clustering to
   characterize the organization of a wide array of emotion categories in
   the human brain. We induced 14 emotions (6 `basic', e.g. fear and anger;
   and 8 `non-basic', e.g. shame and gratitude) and a neutral state using
   guided mental imagery while participants' brain activity was measured
   with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twelve out of 14
   emotions could be reliably classified from the haemodynamic signals. All
   emotions engaged a multitude of brain areas, primarily in midline
   cortices including anterior and posterior cingulate gyri and precuneus,
   in subcortical regions, and in motor regions including cerebellum and
   premotor cortex. Similarity of subjective emotional experiences was
   associated with similarity of the corresponding neural activation
   patterns. We conclude that different basic and non-basic emotions have
   distinguishable neural bases characterized by specific, distributed
   activation patterns in widespread cortical and subcortical circuits.
   Regionally differentiated engagement of these circuits defines the
   unique neural activity pattern and the corresponding subjective feeling
   associated with each emotion.}},

Abstract = {{There is accumulating evidence that youths with antisocial behavior or
   psychopathic traits show deficits in facial emotion recognition, but
   little is known about the neuralmechanisms underlying these impairments.
   A number of neuroimaging studies have investigated brain activity during
   facial emotion processing in youths with Conduct Disorder (CD) and
   adults with psychopathy, but few of these studies tested for group
   differences in effective connectivity-i.e. changes in connectivity
   during emotion processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   and psycho-physiological interaction methods, we investigated the impact
   of CD and psychopathic traits on amygdala activity and effective
   connectivity in 46 male youths with CD and 25 typically-developing
   controls when processing emotional faces. All participants were aged
   16-21 years. Relative to controls, youths with CD showed reduced
   amygdala activity when processing angry or sad faces relative to neutral
   faces, but the groups did not significantly differ in amygdala-related
   effective connectivity. In contrast, psychopathic traits were negatively
   correlated with amygdala-ventral anterior cingulate cortex connectivity
   for angry vs neutral faces, but were unrelated to amygdala responses to
   angry or sad faces. These findings suggest that CD and psychopathic
   traits have differential effects on amygdala activation and functional
   interactions between limbic regions during facial emotion processing.}},

Abstract = {{The success of our political institutions, environmental stewardship and

   collective-interest over self-interest. Despite considerable interest in
   the neuro-cognitive processes that underlie group cooperation, the
   evidence to date is inconsistent. Several papers support models of
   prosocial restraint, while more recent work supports models of prosocial
   intuition. We evaluate these competing models using a sample of lesion
   patients with damage to brain regions previously implicated in intuition
   and deliberation. Compared to matched control participants (brain
   damaged and healthy controls), we found that patients with dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) damage were less likely to cooperate in a
   modified public goods game, whereas patients with ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) damage were more likely to cooperate. In
   contrast, we observed no association between cooperation and amygdala
   damage relative to controls. These findings suggest that the dlPFC,
   rather than the vmPFC or amygdala, plays a necessary role in group-based
   cooperation. These findings suggest cooperation does not solely rely on
   intuitive processes. Implications for models of group cooperation are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{There is abundant evidence suggesting that the right ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex (rVLPFC) plays an important role in down-regulating
   the emotional response to social exclusion. However, a causal
   relationship between rVLPFC function and explicit emotional regulation
   is not clear in the context of social exclusion. This study employed
   anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to activate rVLPFC
   while participants used emotional regulation to reappraise pictures of
   social exclusion. Forty-four participants were randomly assigned to an
   active tDCS group or a sham group. Both groups viewed social exclusion
   images under two conditions: in the no-reappraisal condition,
   participants were instructed to passively view social exclusion images;
   in the reappraisal condition, they reappraised the images to
   down-regulate negative emotional responses. Compared to sham
   stimulation, anodal tDCS over the rVLPFC resulted in less negative
   emotion ratings, and produced significantly smaller pupil diameter in
   the reappraisal, compared to no-reappraisal block. The tDCS also led to
   longer fixation durations to rejectees and shorter fixation durations to
   rejecters. Taken together, these findings suggest a causal role for
   rVLPFC in down-regulation of negative emotions produced by social
   exclusion. This study has implications for clinical interventions
   targeting emotional regulation deficits.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy is crucial for successful interpersonal interactions, and it is
   impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders.
   Action-perception matching, or action simulation mechanisms, has been
   suggested to facilitate empathy by supporting the simulation of
   perceived experience in others. However, this remains unclear, and the
   involvement of the action simulation circuit in cognitive empathy (the
   ability to adopt another's perspective) vs emotional empathy (the
   capacity to share and react affectively to another's emotional
   experience) has not been quantitatively compared. Presently, healthy
   adults completed a classic cognitive empathy task (false belief), an
   emotional empathy task and an action simulation button-pressing task
   during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Conjunction analyses
   revealed common recruitment of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), thought
   to be critical for action-perception matching, during both action
   simulation and emotional, but not cognitive, empathy. Furthermore,
   activation was significantly greater in action simulation regions in the
   left IFG during emotional vs cognitive empathy, and activity in this
   region was positively correlated with mean feeling ratings during the
   emotional empathy task. These findings provide evidence for greater
   involvement of action simulation mechanisms in emotional than cognitive
   empathy. Thus, the action simulation circuit may be an important target
   for delineating the pathophysiology of disorders featuring emotional
   empathy impairments.}},

Abstract = {{Functional dysconnection is increasingly recognized as a core
   pathological feature in schizophrenia. Aberrant interactions between
   regions of the cortico-limbic circuitmay underpin the abnormal emotional
   processing associated with this illness. We used a functionalmagnetic
   resonance imaging paradigmdesigned to dissociate the various components
   of the corticolimbic circuit (i.e. a ventral automatic circuit that is
   intertwined with a dorsal cognitive circuit), to explore bottom-up
   appraisal as well as top-down control during emotion processing. In
   schizophrenia patients compared with healthy controls, bottom-up
   processes were associated with reduced interaction between the amygdala
   and both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex. Contrariwise, top-down control processes led to
   stronger connectivity between the ventral affective and the dorsal
   cognitive circuits, i.e. heightened interactions between the ventral ACC
   and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as between dorsal and
   ventral ACC. These findings offer a comprehensive view of the
   cortico-limbic dysfunction in schizophrenia. They confirmprevious
   results of impaired propagation of information between the amygdala and
   the prefrontal cortex and suggest a defective functional segregation in
   the dorsal cognitive part of the cortico-limbic circuit.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout our lives we must perform tasks while being observed by
   others. Previous studies have shown that the presence of an audience can
   cause increases in an individual's performance as compared to when they
   are not being observed-a phenomenon called `social facilitation'.
   However, the neural mechanisms underlying this effect, in the context of
   skilled-task performance for monetary incentives, are not well
   understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to monitor
   brain activity while healthy human participants performed a skilled-task
   during conditions in which they were paid based on their performance and
   observed and not observed by an audience. We found that during social
   facilitation, social signals represented in the dorsomedial prefrontal
   cortex (dmPFC) enhanced reward value computations in ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). We also found that functional connectivity
   between dmPFC and ventral striatum was enhanced when participants
   exhibited social facilitation effects, indicative of a means by which
   social signals serve to modulate brain regions involved in regulating
   behavioral motivation. These findings illustrate how neural processing
   of social judgments gives rise to the enhanced motivational state that
   results in social facilitation of incentive-based performance.}},

Abstract = {{The way we view ourselves may play an important role in our responses to
   interpersonal interactions. In this study, we investigate how feedback
   valence, consistency of feedback with self-knowledge and global
   self-esteem influence affective and neural responses to social feedback.
   Participants (N = 46) with a high range of self-esteem levels performed
   the social feedback task in an MRI scanner. Negative, intermediate and
   positive feedback was provided, supposedly by another person based on a
   personal interview. Participants rated their mood and applicability of
   feedback to the self. Analyses on trial basis on neural and affective
   responses are used to incorporate applicability of individual feedback
   words. Lower self-esteem related to low mood especially after receiving
   non-applicable negative feedback. Higher self-esteem related to
   increased posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus activation (i.e.
   self-referential processing) for applicable negative feedback. Lower
   self-esteem related to decreased medial prefrontal cortex, insula,
   anterior cingulate cortex and posterior cingulate cortex activation
   (i.e. self-referential processing) during positive feedback and
   decreased temporoparietal junction activation (i.e. other referential
   processing) for applicable positive feedback. Self-esteem and
   consistency of feedback with self-knowledge appear to guide our
   affective and neural responses to social feedback. This may be highly
   relevant for the interpersonal problems that individuals face with low
   self-esteem and negative self-views.}},

   vocalizations were (i) free, (ii) auditorily cued, (iii) visually cued
   or (iv) with interactive feedback. In addition to distributed language
   networks, cued emotions increased activity in auditory and-in case of
   visual stimuli-visual cortex. Responses were larger in posterior
   superior temporal gyrus at the right hemisphere and the ventral striatum
   when participants were listened to and received feedback from the
   experimenter. Sensory, language and reward networks contributed to
   prosody production and were modulated by cues and social context. The

Abstract = {{Early life stress has been associated with disrupted functional

   but it is unknown how early in development stress-related differences in
   amygdala-mPFC connectivity emerge. In a resting-state functional
   connectivity (rs-FC) analysis with 79 four-to seven-year-old children,
   we found a significant correlation between more adverse experiences and
   weaker amygdala-mPFC rs-FC. We also found that weaker amygdala-mPFC
   rs-FC was associated with higher levels of aggressive behavior and
   attention problems. These findings suggest that the impact of stress on
   emotional circuitry is detectable in early childhood and that this
   impact is associated with mental health difficulties. Connectivity in
   this circuit may be useful as a marker for mental health risk and for

Abstract = {{Interoception, i.e. the perception and appraisal of internal bodily
   signals, is related to the phenomenon of craving, and is reportedly
   disrupted in alcohol use disorders. The hormone oxytocin influences
   afferent transmission of bodily signals and, through its potential
   modulation of craving, is proposed as a possible treatment for alcohol
   use disorders. However, oxytocin's impact on interoception in alcohol
   users remains unknown. Healthy alcohol users (n = 32) attended two
   laboratory sessions to perform tests of interoceptive ability (heartbeat
   tracking: attending to internal signals and, heartbeat discrimination:
   integrating internal and external signals) after intranasal
   administration of oxytocin or placebo. Effects of interoceptive
   accuracy, oxytocin administration and alcohol intake, were tested using
   mixed-effects models. On the tracking task, oxytocin reduced
   interoceptive accuracy, but did not interact with alcohol consumption.
   On the discrimination task, we found an interaction between oxytocin
   administration and alcohol intake: Oxytocin, compared with placebo,
   increased interoceptive accuracy in heavy drinkers, but not in light
   social drinkers. Our study does not suggest a pure interoceptive
   impairment in alcohol users but instead potentially highlights reduced
   flexibility of internal and external attentional resource allocation.
   Importantly, this impairment seems to be mitigated by oxytocin. This
   attentional hypothesis needs to be explicitly tested in future research.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with adults, adolescent behavior is often characterized by
   reduced behavioral flexibility, increased sensitivity to reward, and
   increased likelihood to take risks. These traits, which have been
   hypothesized to confer heightened vulnerability to psychopathologies
   such as substance use disorders (SUDs), have been the focus of studies
   in laboratory animal models that seek to understand their neural
   underpinnings. However, rodent studies to date have typically used only
   males and have adopted standard methodological practices (e.g., weight
   loss inducing food restriction) that are likely to have a disparate
   impact on adolescents compared with adults. Here, we used adolescent and
   adult Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes to study instrumental behavior
   tasks that assess behavioral flexibility (strategy shifting and reversal
   learning; Experiment 1), sensitivity to reward value (outcome
   devaluation; Experiment 2), and risky decision making (probability
   discounting; Experiment 3). In Experiment 1, we found that adolescents
   were faster to acquire reversal learning than adults but there were no
   differences in strategy shifting. In Experiments 2 and 3, adolescents
   and adults were equally sensitive to changes in reward value and
   exhibited similar reductions in preference for a large reward when
   reinforcement probability was decreased. However, adolescents responded
   more efficiently and earned reinforcers at a higher rate than their
   same-sex, adult counterparts. Together, these findings provide only
   limited support for the existence of an ``adolescent-typical{''}
   phenotype in Sprague-Dawley rats and instead suggest that age
   differences in the expression of these behaviors may depend on
   conditions such as pubertal status and motivational state.}},

Abstract = {{Animals choose between sensory stimuli, a highly complex behavior which
   includes detection, discrimination. preference. and memory processes.
   Rodents are reported to display robust preferences for some odors, for
   instance, in the context of choosing among passible mates or food items.
   In contrast to the apparent robustness of responses toward these and
   other ``ethologically relevant{''} odors, little is known about the
   robustness of behaviors toward odors which have no overt role in the
   rodent ecological niche, so-called ``nonethologically relevant{''}
   odors. We developed an apparatus for monitoring the nose-poking behavior
   of mice and used this apparatus to explore the prevalence and stability
   of choices among different odors both across mice, and within mice over
   successive days. Mice were tested with a panel of either ethologically
   relevant or nonethologically relevant odors in an olfactory
   multiple-choice test. Significant preferences to nonethologically
   relevant odors were observed across the population of mice, with longer
   investigation durations to some odors more than to others. However, we
   found substantial inter-mouse variability in these responses, and that
   responses to these odors even varied within mice across days of
   testing.. Tests with ethologically relevant odors revealed that
   responses toward these odors were also variable across mice, but within
   individual mice, responses were somewhat stable. This work establishes
   an olfactory multiple-choice test for monitoring odor investigation,
   choice, and preference behaviors and the application of this apparatus
   to assess across- and within-mouse odor-preference choice stability.
   These results highlight that odor preferences, as assayed by measuring
   choice behaviors, are variable.}},

Abstract = {{Representation mediated learning is a behavioral paradigm that could be
   used to potentially capture psychotic symptoms including hallucinations
   and delusions in schizophrenia. In studies of mediated learning,
   representations of prior experience can enter into current associations.
   Using a ketamine model of schizophrenia, we investigated whether mice
   exposed to ketamine during late adolescence subsequently showed an
   increased tendency to use a representation of a prior gustatory
   experience to form associations in learning. Mice were given prior
   experience of an odor and a taste presented together. The odor was
   subsequently presented alone with gastrointestinal illness induced by a
   lithium chloride injection. A consumption test was then given to assess
   whether the taste, despite its absence during conditioning, entered into
   an association with the induced illness. Such learning would be mediated
   via a representation of the taste activated by the odor. Our results
   showed that control mice displayed no aversion to the taste following
   the procedures just described, but mice that had been treated
   developmentally with ketamine exhibited a significant taste aversion,
   suggesting a greater propensity for mediated learning. Complementary to
   that finding, ketamine-exposed mice also showed a greater susceptibility
   to mediated extinction. Chronic treatment with the antipsychotic drug,
   risperidone, in ketamine-exposed mice attenuated mediated learning, a
   finding that may be related to its known efficacy in reducing the
   positive symptoms of schizophrenia. These data provide a setting with
   potential relevance to preclinical research on schizophrenia, to study
   the neural mechanisms underlying a propensity for aberrant associations
   and assessment of therapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that chronic undernutrition has detrimental
   impacts on brain development and maturation. However, protein
   malnutrition during the period specifically encompassing the brain
   growth spurt has not been widely studied, particularly regarding its
   effects on adolescent and adult offspring behavior. Here, we assessed
   the effects of a protein-free diet during the 1st 10 postnatal days on
   the macronutrient content of the milk produced by lactating Wistar rats,
   on their maternal behavior, and on the offspring's behavior. Lactating
   dams were fed either a protein-free or a normoprotein diet from litter
   parturition to Postnatal Day 10 (P10). All dams received the
   normoprotein diet after P10. Offspring were tested in the elevated
   plus-maze (anxiety-like behavior), hole board arena (novelty-seeking and
   locomotor activity), and radial arm water maze (memory-learning) at
   either P40 (adolescents) or P90 (adults). The protein-free diet reduced
   milk protein content at P10 but not at P20. Carbohydrate and lipid
   contents were unaffected. Serum corticosterone levels in the offspring
   (at P10. P40, or P90) and dams (at P21) were not affected by the
   protein-free diet. Maternal behavior was also unchanged. In the
   offspring, no differences were observed between groups regarding
   anxiety-like behaviors at both ages. The protein-free diet increased
   adolescent locomotor activity as well as adult novelty-seeking behavior
   and memory performance. Our results indicate that the brain growth spurt
   period is particularly sensitive to protein malnutrition, showing that
   even a brief nutritional insult during this period can cause specific
   age-dependent behavioral effects on the offspring.}},

   neural basis of social decision-making and reward processing. The
   present study employed a within-subject design and compared the reward
   positivity (RewP), an event-related potential component that is present
   following favorable feedback and absent or reduced following unfavorable
   feedback, during monetary and social reward tasks. Specifically, 114
   participants (75 females) completed a monetary reward task and a novel
   social reward task that were matched on trial structure, timing, and
   feedback stimuli in a counterbalanced order. Results indicated that the
   monetary and social RewP were of similar magnitude, positively
   correlated and demonstrated comparable psychometric properties,
   including reliability and dependability. Across both the monetary and
   social tasks, women demonstrated a greater RewP compared with men. This
   study provides a novel methodological approach toward examining the
   electrocortical response to social reward that is comparable to monetary
   reward.}},

Abstract = {{Despite accruing evidence showing that positive emotions facilitate
   stress recovery, the neural basis for this effect remains unclear. To
   identify the underlying mechanism, we compared stress recovery for
   people reflecting on a stressor while in a positive emotional context
   with that for people in a neutral context. While blood-oxygen-level
   dependent data were being collected, participants (N = 43) performed a
   stressful anagram task, which was followed by a recovery period during
   which they reflected on the stressor while watching a positive or
   neutral video. Participants also reported positive and negative emotions
   throughout the task as well as retrospective thoughts about the task.
   Although there was no effect of experimental context on emotional
   recovery, we found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
   activation during the stressor predicted more positive emotions during
   recovery, which in turn predicted less negative emotions during
   recovery. In addition, the relationship between vmPFC activation and
   positive emotions during recovery was mediated by decentering-the
   meta-cognitive detachment of oneself from one's feelings. In sum,
   successful recovery from a stressor seems to be due to activation of
   positive emotion-related regions during the stressor itself as well as
   to their downstream effects on certain cognitive forms of emotion
   regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Independent vs interdependent self-construal is a concept that reflects
   how people perceive the relationship between self and other people,
   which has been extensively examined across disciplines. However, little
   evidence on the whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) pattern of
   independent vs interdependent self-construal has been reported. Here, in
   a sample of 51 healthy participants, we used resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based FC analysis (i.e. FC strength
   and seed-based FC) by measuring the temporal correlation of blood oxygen
   level-dependent signals between spatially separate brain regions to
   investigate the neural mechanism of independent vs interdependent
   self-construal. First, we found that FC strength of bilateral posterior
   cingulate cortex and precuneus, and left inferior frontal gyrus were
   positively correlated with the independent vs interdependent score.
   Seed-based FC analysis with these three regions as seeds revealed that,
   FC within default mode network and executive control network was
   positively correlated with the independent vs interdependent score.
   Negative correlation with independent vs interdependent score was shown
   in the connections between default mode network and executive control
   regions. Taking together, our results provide a comprehensive FC
   architecture of the independent vs interdependent self-construal and
   advance the understanding of the interplay between culture, mind and
   brain.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral inhibition (BI) is an early temperamental profile
   characterized by negative reactivity to novelty, withdrawal from social

   associated BI assessed in early childhood to striatal hypersensitivity

   among 10 year-olds, characterized with BI at ages 24 and 36 months on
   measures of temperamental reactivity. Participants (n = 40) were studied
   at age 10 using a reward processing task during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI). Child- and maternal-report of social anxiety
   symptoms was collected at ages 10 and 13. Findings indicate greater
   caudate activation and stronger striatal connectivity in high, compared
   to low, behaviorally inhibited children. Caudate activation related to
   social anxiety symptoms at both ages. These findings suggest that
   enhanced striatal responsivity reliably manifests among high
   behaviorally inhibited children as early as age 10. This may reflect
   hyper-sensitivity to reward or excessive motivation to avoid errors.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep suffers during adolescence and is related to academic, emotional
   and social behaviors. How this normative change relates to ongoing brain
   development remains unresolved. The default mode network (DMN), a
   large-scale brain network important for complex cognition and
   socioemotional processing, undergoes intra-network integration and
   inter-network segregation during adolescence. Using resting state
   functional connectivity and actigraphy over 14 days, we examined
   correlates of naturalistic individual differences in sleep duration and
   quality in the DMN at rest in 45 human adolescents (ages 14-18).
   Variation in sleep quality, but not duration, was related to weaker
   intrinsic DMN connectivity, such that those with worse quality sleep
   evinced weaker intra-network connectivity at rest. These novel findings
   suggest sleep quality, a relatively unexplored sleep index, is related
   to adolescent brain function in a network that contributes to behavioral
   maturation and undergoes development during adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{Goal-directed behavior and lifelong well-being often depend on the
   ability to control appetitive motivations, such as cravings. Cognitive
   reappraisal is an effective way to modulate emotional states, including
   cravings, but is often studied under explicit instruction to regulate.
   Despite the strong prediction from Self-Determination Theory that choice
   should enhance task engagement and regulation success, little is known
   empirically about whether and how regulation is different when
   participants choose (vs are told) to exert control. To investigate how
   choice affects neural activity and regulation success, participants
   reappraised their responses to images of personally-craved foods while
   undergoing functional neuroimaging. Participants were either instructed
   to view or reappraise ('no-choice') or chose freely to view or
   reappraise ('yes-choice'). Choice increased activity in the
   frontoparietal control network. We expected this activity would be
   associated with increased task engagement, resulting in better
   regulation success. However, contrary to this prediction, choice
   slightly reduced regulation success. Follow-up multivariate functional
   neuroimaging analyses indicated that choice likely disrupted allocation
   of limited cognitive resources during reappraisal. While unexpected,
   these results highlight the importance of studying upstream processes
   such as regulation choice, as they may affect the ability to regulate
   cravings and other emotional states.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional processing often continues beyond the presentation of
   emotionally evocative stimuli, which can result in affective biasing or
   coloring of subsequently encountered events. Here, we describe neural
   correlates of affective coloring and examine how individual differences
   in affective style impact the magnitude of affective coloring. We
   conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging in 117 adults who
   passively viewed negative, neutral and positive pictures presented 2 s
   prior to neutral faces. Brain responses to neutral faces were modulated
   by the valence of preceding pictures, with greater activation for faces
   following negative (vs positive) pictures in the amygdala, dorsomedial
   and lateral prefrontal cortex, ventral visual cortices, posterior
   superior temporal sulcus, and angular gyrus. Three days after the
   magnetic resonance imaging scan, participants rated their memory and
   liking of previously encountered neutral faces. Individuals higher in
   trait positive affect and emotional reappraisal rated faces as more
   likable when preceded by emotionally arousing (negative or positive)
   pictures. In addition, greater amygdala responses to neutral faces
   preceded by positively valenced pictures were associated with greater
   memory for these faces 3 days later. Collectively, these results reveal
   individual differences in how emotions spill over onto the processing of
   unrelated social stimuli, resulting in persistent and affectively biased
   evaluations of such stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between pain expectancy and motor system plays a
   crucial role in the human defensive system. Here, we took advantage of
   the inhibitory modulation of the motor pathway to the muscle of the hand
   receiving painful stimuli, by recording motor-evoked potentials (MEPs)
   to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). We employed a classical
   conditioning paradigm in which neutral (visual and auditory) stimuli
   were conditioned by pairing either painful or not-painful stimuli
   (electric shocks) in separated groups. Only the Pain Group showed clear
   motor responses: i.e. a significant decrease in MEPs amplitude, with
   respect to the neutral condition, not only in conditioning stimuli, when
   actual shocks were paired with neutral stimuli, but also in conditioned
   stimuli, when shocks were only expected. Significant differences between
   the two groups suggest that the MEPs decrease is specific for pain
   expectancy and does not pertain to anticipation in general. Furthermore,
   in the Pain Group, a significant negative correlation between
   physiological responses to conditioned stimuli and the participants'
   anxiety traits was found: the lower the MEPs amplitude, the higher the
   participants' anxiety scores. The present findings suggest that, in

Abstract = {{Proactive interference (PI) is the tendency for information learned
   earlier to interfere with more recently learned information. In the
   present study, we induced PI by presenting items from the same category
   over several trials. This results in a build-up of PI and reduces the
   discriminability of the items in each subsequent trial. We introduced
   emotional (e.g. disgust) and neutral (e.g. furniture) categories and
   examined how increasing levels of PI affected performance for both
   stimulus types. Participants were scanned using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) performing a 5-item probe recognition task. We
   modeled responses and corresponding response times with a hierarchical
   diffusion model. Results showed that PI effects on latent processes
   (i.e. reduced drift rate) were similar for both stimulus types, but the
   effect of PI on drift rate was less pronounced PI for emotional compared
   to neutral stimuli. The decline in the drift rate was accompanied by an
   increase in neural activation in parahippocampal regions and this
   relationship was more strongly observed for neutral stimuli compared to
   emotional stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{A high frequency of outgroup contact-as experienced by urban dwellers
   and migrants-possibly increases schizophrenia risk. This risk might be
   further amplified by genetic and environmental risk factors, such as the
   A-allele of rs1006737 within the calcium voltage-gated channel subunit
   alpha1 C gene and childhood interpersonal trauma (CIT). Both have been
   related to ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) functioning. We
   investigated vACC functioning, during ingroup and outgroup emotion
   perception in relation to rs1006737 and CIT. Group membership was
   manipulated through a minimal group paradigm. Thus, in our functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study, a group of healthy Caucasian
   participants (n = 178) viewed video-recorded facial emotions (happy vs
   angry) of actors artificially assigned to represent the ingroup or the
   outgroup. Rs1006737 and CIT were related to brain activation for group
   and emotion specific processing. The group-emotion interaction in the
   vACC showed reduced sensitivity to emotional valence for outgroup member
   processing. Specifically for the angry outgroup condition, we found a
   gene by environment interaction in vACC activity. We speculate that the
   increased schizophrenia risk in migrants and urban dwellers could
   therefore be facilitated via this pathophysiological pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive-motivational styles describe predominant patterns of
   processing or biases that broadly influence human cognition and
   performance. Here we focus on the impact of cognitive-motivational
   styles on the response to cues predicting the availability of food or
   addictive drugs. An individual may preferably conduct an analysis of the
   motivational significance of reward cues, with the result that such cues
   per se are perceived as rewarding and worth approaching and working for.
   Alternatively, a propensity for a ``cold{''} analysis of the behavioral
   utility of a reward cue may yield search behavior for food or drugs but
   not involve cue approach. Animal models for studying the neuronal
   mechanisms mediating such styles have originated from research
   concerning behavioral indices that predict differential vulnerability to
   addiction-like behaviors. Rats classified as sign-or goal-trackers (STs,
   GTs) were found to have opposed attentional biases (bottom-up or
   cue-driven attention vs. top-down or goal-driven attentional control)
   that are mediated primarily via relatively unresponsive versus elevated
   levels of cholinergic neuromodulation in the cortex. The capacity for
   cholinergic neuromodulation in STs is limited by a neuronal choline
   transporter (CHT) that fails to support increases in cholinergic
   activity. Moreover, in contrast to STs, the frontal dopamine system in
   GTs does not respond to the presence of drug cues and, thus, biases
   against cue-oriented behavior. The opponent cognitive-motivational
   styles that are indexed by sign-and goal-tracking bestow different
   cognitive-behavioral vulnerabilities that may contribute to the
   manifestation of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{132}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{During the postretrieval reconsolidation ``window{''}, memories can be
   disrupted, strengthened, or updated using various pharmacological and
   behavioral manipulations. Behavioral manipulations are more ecologically
   valid, thus allowing better understating of memory modification under
   natural conditions, but they can also be less potent compared to
   pharmacological interventions. In this review we present the current
   human and animal literature, aiming to understand the modulatory factors
   (i.e., task relevance, complexity, intensity) that promote
   reconsolidation disruption in purely behavioral means. The reviewed
   studies have suggested that both very simple tasks and more complex
   learning paradigms can be used to disrupt or update memory
   reconsolidation, even of stronger emotional memories. Stress exposure is
   a possible interference task, yet the conflicting results leave many
   open questions regarding its required timing and intensity. Going from
   bench to bedside and back again, we point to the need for more research
   in clinical populations to establish the therapeutic potential of
   reconsolidation-based treatments. Several findings from outside the
   laboratory offer promising leads for future research.}},

Title = {{Overlapping Brain Network and Alpha Power Changes Suggest Visuospatial

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{132}},

Abstract = {{When humans perform prolonged, continuous tasks, their performance
   fluctuates. The etiology of these fluctuations is multifactorial, but
   they are influenced by changes in attention reflected in underlying
   neural dynamics. Previous work with electroencephalography has suggested
   that prestimulus alpha power is a neural signature of attention
   allocation with higher power portending relatively poorer performance.
   The functional mechanisms subserving these changes in alpha power and
   behavior are postulated to be the result of networked neural activity
   that permits flexibility in the allocation of attention. Here, we
   directly examine the similarity between prestimulus alpha connectivity
   and power in relation to performance fluctuations in a continuous
   driving task. Participants were asked to maintain their vehicle in the
   center of a simulated highway, and we evaluated their performance by
   randomly perturbing the vehicle and assessing their steering correction.
   We then used the 3 seconds of neural activity before the unexpected
   event to derive alpha functional connectivity in the first analysis and
   alpha power in the second analysis, and we employed linear regression to
   separately investigate their relationship to 3 metrics of driving
   performance ( lane deviation, reaction time (RT), and heading error). We
   find that the locations involved in our network analysis also show the
   strongest modulation of alpha activity. Interestingly, the network
   pattern suggests a posterior to anterior directionality, consistent with
   bottom-up theories of attention, and these results may reflect a gain
   control model of attention in which ongoing attention is modulated
   through coordinated, network activity.}},

Abstract = {{In nearly every vertebrate species examined thus far arginine
   vasopressin (AVP) and its homologues modulate behavior; thus, providing
   rich systems for comparative research. In rodents, AVP is best known for
   its modulation of social behavior; however, to date, research on AVPs
   effects on behavior have been limited to laboratory models and a few
   experiments using large outdoor enclosures. To extend our understanding
   of AVPs role in modulating social behavior and communication in an
   ecologically relevant context, we examined the effects of AVP on
   behavior of free-living Richardson's ground squirrels (Urocitellus
   richardsonii). To test the hypothesis that AVP influences social
   behavior and communication, we implanted osmotic minipumps into
   Richardson's ground squirrels and centrally administered AVP or saline
   as a control. Three different behavioral experiments quantifying
   behavior before and after AVP or saline administration were performed: a
   general behavior survey, a predator model presentation, and a social
   challenge test. AVP administration increased male vocalization rate when
   approached by a conspecific, but not when presented with a predator
   model. In males, social aggression decreased, but antipredator vigilance
   increased with AVP administration. Finally, AVP-treated females had
   increased ``anxiety-like{''} behaviors during the social challenge test.
   Our data reveal that AVP has sex-specific effects on vocalizations and
   antipredator vigilance, as well as other social behaviors. Further, our
   data illustrate the importance of social context to AVPs modulation of
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome recapitulates the hallmark areas
   of dysfunction that characterize the human disorder, including impaired
   performance in tasks designed to tap hippocampus-dependent learning and
   memory. Unfortunately, performance in the water maze tasks most commonly
   used for this purpose can be affected by behavioral and/or physiological
   abnormalities characteristic of Ts65Dn mice (e.g., thigmotaxis,
   susceptibility to hypothermia, stress reactivity), which complicates
   interpretation of impaired performance. The current study assessed
   hippocampal function in Ts65Dn mice using the social transmission of
   food preference (STFP) paradigm, which does not entail water escape or
   aversive reinforcement, and thus avoids these interpretive confounds. We
   tested Ts65Dn mice and disomic controls on this task using 1- and 7-day
   retention intervals. The Ts65Dn mice exhibited normal learning and
   memory following the 1-day retention interval, but rapid forgetting of
   the socially acquired information, evidenced by impaired performance
   following the 7-day retention interval. The STFP paradigm can be a
   valuable tool for studies using the Ts65Dn mouse model to evaluate
   potential therapies that may ameliorate hippocampal dysfunction and
   aging-related cognitive decline in Down syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the enduring effects of predictable versus unpredictable
   fear conditioning early in life on memory and relearning in adulthood.
   At postnatal Day 17 or 25 (P17 or P25), rats either remained naive, or
   were fear conditioned using paired (predictable) or unpaired
   (unpredictable) presentations of white noise and foot shocks. At 2
   months of age (adulthood), each group was fear conditioned (or
   reconditioned) with either paired or unpaired training, and then was
   tested for fear extinction the next day. Initial findings replicate
   previous work from our lab and others, demonstrating a difference in
   adult memory retention based on age of acquisition. Specifically, rats
   that received paired conditioning at P25, but not P17, show increased
   freezing to the cue when tested in adulthood. We further show that
   paired as well as unpaired conditioning at P17 potentiates paired
   conditioning in adulthood; however, paired, but not unpaired,
   conditioning at P25 potentiates paired and unpaired conditioning in
   adulthood. These findings suggest that early predictable versus
   unpredictable aversive learning at P17 or P25 differentially modulate
   memory retention and future learning.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal immune activation (MIA) during gestation is a significant risk
   factor for development of schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental
   diseases. In animal models of this risk factor, MIA during pregnancy can
   produce offspring that recapitulate certain aspects of the behavioral
   and neurophysiological impairments seen in schizophrenia. Here, the
   authors tested the effect of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly
   I:C)-induced MIA in a task that explicitly assays the interaction
   between motivation and cognition. In our paradigm, discrimination
   accuracy during a sustained-attention task is differentially impacted by
   environmental cues that signal the probability of reward for accurate
   performance. Cognition-motivation interactions are implicated in
   producing functional impairments in patients. Therefore, to the extent
   that this MIA model recapitulates such impairments, the authors
   predicted impaired ability of reward-associated signals to modulate
   cognitive performance in MIA rat offpsring. Adult offspring of dams in
   which MIA was induced displayed impaired prepulse inhibition relative to
   controls, verifying a functional effect of poly I: C induction. Despite
   this deficit, there were no differences between MIA and control rats in
   any aspects of task learning or performance, including under extinction
   and reacquisition conditions. These results indicate that MIA spares
   functioning of some of the cognitive, motivational, and decision-making
   processes that are impacted in schizophrenia and suggest that MIA as an
   isolated manipulation does not model the full range and nuance of the
   cognitive and motivational impairments in the disease. The authors
   suggest that some aspects of the functional impairment in schizophrenia
   and other neurodevelopmental diseases may be better modeled using
   multiple ``hit{''} models of disease risk.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep plays an important role for successful fear memory consolidation.
   Growing evidence suggests that sleep disturbances might contribute to
   the development and the maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD), a disorders characterized by dysregulations in fear learning
   mechanisms, as well as exaggerated arousal and salience processing.
   Against this background, the present study examined the effects of sleep
   deprivation (SD) on the acquisition of fear and the subsequent neural
   consolidation. To this end, the present study assessed fear acquisition
   and associated changes in fMRI-based amygdala-functional connectivity
   following 24 h of SD. Relative to non-sleep deprived controls, SD
   subjects demonstrated increased fear ratings and skin conductance
   responses (SCR) during fear acquisition. During fear consolidation SD
   inhibited increased amygdala-ventromendial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
   connectivity and concomitantly increased changes in amygdala-insula
   connectivity. Importantly, whereas in controls fear indices during
   acquisition were negatively associated with amygdala-vmPFC connectivity
   during consolidation, fear indices were positively associated with
   amygdala-insula coupling following SD. Together the findings suggest
   that SD may interfere with vmPFC control of the amygdala and increase
   bottom-up arousal signaling in the amygdala-insula pathway during fear
   consolidation, which might mediate the negative impact of sleep
   disturbances on PSTD symptomatology.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity to adaptively respond to negative emotion is in part
   dependent upon lateral areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Lateral PFC
   areas are particularly susceptible to age-related atrophy, which affects
   executive function (EF). We used structural and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) to test the hypothesis that older age is
   associated with greater medial PFC engagement during processing of
   negative information, and that this engagement is dependent upon the
   integrity of grey matter structure in lateral PFC as well as EF.
   Participants (n = 64, 38-79 years) viewed negative and neutral scenes
   while in the scanner, and completed cognitive tests as part of a larger
   study. Grey matter probability (GMP) was computed to index grey matter
   integrity. FMRI data demonstrated less activity in the left
   ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) and greater ventromedial PFC (VMPFC) activity
   with increasing age during negative-picture viewing. Age did not
   correlate with amygdala responding. GMP in VLPFC and EF were negatively
   associated with VMPFC activity. We conclude that this change from
   lateral to medial PFC engagement in response to picture-induced negative
   affect reflects decreased reliance on executive function-related
   processes, possibly associated with reduced grey matter in lateral PFC,
   with advancing age to maintain emotional functioning.}},

Abstract = {{While prior work has demonstrated that fear-conditioning changes the
   neural representation of previously neutral stimuli, it remains unknown
   to what extent this new representation abstracts away from specific
   fears and which brain areas are involved therein. To investigate this
   question, we sought commonalities between experimentally-induced fear
   via electric shocks and pre-existing phobia. Using functional MRI, we
   tested the effect of fear-conditioning pictures of dogs in 21
   spider-fearful participants across three phases: baseline,
   post-conditioning, and extinction. Considering phobic stimuli as a
   reference point for the state of fear allowed us to examine whether
   fear-conditioning renders information patterns of previously neutral
   stimuli more similar to those of phobic stimuli. We trained a
   classification algorithm to discriminate information patterns of neutral
   stimuli (rats) and phobic stimuli and then tested the algorithm on
   information patterns from the conditioned stimuli (dogs). Performing
   this cross-decoding analysis at each experimental phase revealed brain
   regions in which dogs were classified as rats during baseline, as
   spiders following conditioning, and again as rats after extinction. A
   follow-up analysis showed that changes in visual perception information
   cannot explain the changing classification performance. These results
   demonstrate a common neural representation for processing fear-eliciting
   information, either pre-existing or acquired by classical conditioning.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to correctly understand the emotional expression of another
   person is essential for social relationships and appears to be a partly
   inherited trait. The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin have been

   Here, recognition of the emotional content of faces and voices,
   separately and combined, was investigated in 492 subjects, genotyped for
   25 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes encoding
   proteins important for oxytocin and vasopressin neurotransmission. The
   SNP rs4778599 in the gene encoding aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear
   translocator 2 (ARNT2), a transcription factor that participates in the
   development of hypothalamic oxytocin and vasopressin neurons, showed an
   association that survived correction for multiple testing with emotion
   recognition of audio-visual stimuli in women (). This study demonstrates

Abstract = {{Individuals react differently to social experiences; for example, people
   who are more sensitive to negative social experiences, such as being
   excluded, may be more likely to adapt their behavior to fit in with
   others. We examined whether functional brain connectivity during social
   exclusion in the fMRI scanner can be used to predict subsequent
   conformity to peer norms. Adolescent males (n = 57) completed a two-part
   study on teen driving risk: a social exclusion task (Cyberball) during
   an fMRI session and a subsequent driving simulator session in which they
   drove alone and in the presence of a peer who expressed risk-averse or
   risk-accepting driving norms. We computed the difference in functional
   connectivity between social exclusion and social inclusion from each
   node in the brain to nodes in two brain networks, one previously
   associated with mentalizing (medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal
   junction, precuneus, temporal poles) and another with social pain
   (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula). Using predictive
   modeling, this measure of global connectivity during exclusion predicted
   the extent of conformity to peer pressure during driving in the
   subsequent experimental session. These findings extend our understanding
   of how global neural dynamics guide social behavior, revealing
   functional network activity that captures individual differences.}},

Abstract = {{Aberrant rule- and reward-based processes underpin abnormalities of
   socio-emotional behaviour in major dementias. However, these processes
   remain poorly characterized. Here we used music to probe rule decoding
   and reward valuation in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
   syndromes and Alzheimer's disease (AD) relative to healthy age-matched
   individuals. We created short melodies that were either harmonically
   resolved ('finished') or unresolved ('unfinished'); the task was to
   classify each melody as finished or unfinished (rule processing) and
   rate its subjective pleasantness (reward valuation). Results were
   adjusted for elementary pitch and executive processing; neuroanatomical
   correlates were assessed using voxel-based morphometry. Relative to
   healthy older controls, patients with behavioural variant FTD showed
   impairments of both musical rule decoding and reward valuation, while
   patients with semantic dementia showed impaired reward valuation but
   intact rule decoding, patients with AD showed impaired rule decoding but
   intact reward valuation and patients with progressive non-fluent aphasia
   performed comparably to healthy controls. Grey matter associations with
   task performance were identified in anterior temporal, medial and
   lateral orbitofrontal cortices, previously implicated in computing
   diverse biological and non-biological rules and rewards. The processing
   of musical rules and reward distils cognitive and neuroanatomical
   mechanisms relevant to complex socio-emotional dysfunction in major
   dementias.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has demonstrated that the Action-Observation Network
   (AON) is involved in both emotional-embodiment (empathy) and
   action-embodiment mechanisms. In this study, we hypothesized that
   interfering with the AON will impair action recognition and that this
   impairment will be modulated by empathy levels. In Experiment 1 (n =
   90), participants were asked to recognize facial expressions while their
   facial motion was restricted. In Experiment 2 (n = 50), we interfered
   with the AON by applying transcranial Direct Current Stimulation to the
   motor cortex. In both experiments, we found that interfering with the
   AON impaired the performance of participants with high empathy levels;
   however, for the first time, we demonstrated that the interference
   enhanced the performance of participants with low empathy. This novel
   finding suggests that the embodiment module may be flexible, and that it
   can be enhanced in individuals with low empathy by simple manipulation
   of motor activation.}},

Abstract = {{Direct eye gaze is a powerful stimulus in social interactions, yet
   people vary considerably in the range of gaze lines that they accept as
   being direct (cone of direct gaze, CoDG). Here, we searched for a
   possible neural trait marker of these individual differences. We
   measured the width of the CoDG in 137 healthy participants and related
   their individual CoDG to their neural baseline activation as measured
   with resting electroencephalogram. Using a source-localization
   technique, we found that resting theta current density in the left
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and adjacent posterior superior temporal
   sulcus (pSTS) was associated with the width of CoDG. Our findings
   suggest that the higher the baseline cortical activation in the left
   TPJ/pSTS, the wider the CoDG and thus the more liberal the individuals'
   judgments were in deciding whether a looker stimulus was making eye
   contact or not. This is a first demonstration of the neural signatures
   underlying individual differences in the feeling of being looked at.}},

Abstract = {{The personality dimensions of neuroticism and extraversion are strongly
   associated with emotional experience and affective disorders. Previous
   studies reported functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity
   correlates of these traits, but no study has used brain-based measures
   to predict them. Here, using a fully cross-validated approach, we
   predict novel individuals' neuroticism and extraversion from functional
   connectivity (FC) data observed as they simply rested during fMRI
   scanning. We applied a data-driven technique, connectome-based
   predictive modeling (CPM), to resting-state FC data and neuroticism and
   extraversion scores (self-reported NEO Five Factor Inventory) from 114
   participants of the Nathan Kline Institute Rockland sample. After
   dividing the whole brain into 268 nodes using a predefined functional
   atlas, we defined each individual's FC matrix as the set of correlations
   between the activity timecourses of every pair of nodes. CPM identified
   networks consisting of functional connections correlated with
   neuroticism and extraversion scores, and used strength in these networks
   to predict a left-out individual's scores. CPM predicted neuroticism and
   extraversion in novel individuals, demonstrating that patterns in
   resting-state FC reveal trait-level measures of personality. CPM also
   revealed predictive networks that exhibit some anatomical patterns
   consistent with past studies and potential new brain areas of interest
   in personality.}},

Abstract = {{Facial expressions and voice modulations are among the most important
   communicational signals to convey emotional information. The ability to
   correctly interpret this information is highly relevant for successful
   social interaction and represents an integral component of emotional
   competencies that have been conceptualized under the term emotional
   intelligence. Here, we investigated the relationship of emotional
   intelligence as measured with the
   Salovey-Caruso-Emotional-Intelligence-Test (MSCEIT) with cerebral voice
   and face processing using functional and structural magnetic resonance
   imaging. MSCEIT scores were positively correlated with increased
   voice-sensitivity and gray matter volume of the insula accompanied by
   voice-sensitivity enhanced connectivity between the insula and the
   temporal voice area, indicating generally increased salience of voices.
   Conversely, in the face processing system, higher MSCEIT scores were
   associated with decreased face-sensitivity and gray matter volume of the
   fusiform face area. Taken together, these findings point to an
   alteration in the balance of cerebral voice and face processing systems
   in the form of an attenuated face-vs-voice bias as one potential factor
   underpinning emotional intelligence.}},

Title = {{Neuroanatomical correlates of donating behavior in middle childhood}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{541-552}},
Abstract = {{The neurobiological correlates of prosocial behavior are largely
   unknown. We examined brain structure and functional connectivity
   correlates of donating to a charity, a specific, costly, form of
   prosocial behavior. In 163 children, donating was measured using a
   promotional clip for a charity including a call for donations. Children
   could decide privately whether and how much they wanted to donate from
   money they had received earlier. Whole brain structural MRI scans were
   obtained to study associations between cortical thickness and donating
   behavior. In addition, resting state functional MRI scans were obtained
   to study whole brain functional connectivity and to examine functional
   connectivity between regions identified using structural MRI. In the
   lateral orbitofrontal cortex/pars orbitalis and pre-/postcentral cortex,
   a thicker cortex was associated with higher donations. Functional
   connectivity with these regions was not associated with donating
   behavior. These results suggest that donating behavior is not only
   situationally driven, but is also related brain morphology. The absence
   of functional connectivity correlates might imply that the associations
   with cortical thickness are involved in different underlying mechanisms
   of donating.}},

Title = {{The role of the amygdala in incongruity resolution: the case of humor
   comprehension}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{553-565}},
Abstract = {{A dominant theory of humor comprehension suggests that people understand
   humor by first perceiving some incongruity in an expression and then
   resolving it. This is called ``the incongruity-resolution theory.{''}
   Experimental studies have investigated the neural basis of humor
   comprehension, and multiple neural substrates have been proposed;
   however, the specific substrate for incongruity resolution is still
   unknown. The reason may be that the resolution phase, despite its
   importance in humor comprehension, has not been successfully
   distinguished from the perception phase because both phases occur almost
   simultaneously. To reveal the substrate, we conducted a functional
   magnetic resonance study using 51 healthy participants. We used a
   humor-producing frame of ``Given A, I'd say B, because C{''} so as to
   focus on the resolution phase independently by suspending humor
   processing just after the perception phase. This frame allowed us to
   separate the two phases. Based on our results, incongruity resolution
   evoked positive emotion and activated the left amygdala, which is known
   to be related to positive emotion. On the basis of these findings, we
   argue that the amygdala plays an important role in humor comprehension,
   considering its functional role in emotional evaluation, particularly
   the relevance detection for incoming stimuli.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{566-578}},
Abstract = {{Psychologists have long debated whether self-enhancement is universal or
   varies across cultures. Extant studies using explicit and implicit
   measures have provided mixed results. In this study (N = 93; 35 European
   American, 58 Chinese: 28 tested in English, 30 tested in Mandarin), we
   measured self-enhancement covertly using an ERP paradigm.
   Self-enhancement was also assessed via self-report and reaction-time
   based measures. Americans showed strong evidence of self-enhancement
   across all measures, whereas this effect was absent or weaker among
   Chinese, who instead showed an other-enhancing bias across measures.
   Language did not affect self-enhancement tendencies among Chinese
   participants, with the exception of one self-report measure. Nor did the
   two cultural groups differ in enhancement for a close other. This is the
   first study to directly compare self-enhancement across cultural groups
   using ERPs and provides evidence that positive self-regard does indeed
   vary by culture.}},

Pages = {{579-593}},
Abstract = {{Error monitoring, cognitive control and motor inhibition control are
   proposed as cognitive alterations disrupted in obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OCD). OCD has also been associated with an increased
   sensitivity to social evaluations. The effect of a social simulation
   over electro-physiological indices of cognitive alterations in OCD was
   examined. A case-control cross-sectional study measuring event-related
   potentials (ERP) for error monitoring (Error-Related Negativity),
   cognitive control (N2) and motor control (LRP) was conducted. We
   analyzed twenty OCD patients and twenty control participants. ERP were
   recorded during a social game consisting of a visual discrimination
   task, which was performed in the presence of a simulated superior or an
   inferior player. Significant social effects (different ERP amplitudes in
   Superior vs. Inferior player conditions) were found for OCD patients,
   but not for controls, in all ERP components. Performing the task against
   a simulated inferior player reduced abnormal ERP responses in OCD to
   levels observed in controls. The hierarchy-induced ERP effects were
   accompanied effects over reaction times in OCD patients. Social context
   modulates signatures of abnormal cognitive functioning in OCD, therefore
   experiencing a social superiority position impacts over cognitive
   processes in OCD such as error monitoring mechanisms. These results open
   the door for the research of new therapeutic choices.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{594-601}},
Abstract = {{Schizophrenia patients have impairments of biological motion (BM)
   perception, which provides critical information about social cognition.
   Because social cognition is underpinned by attention, the impairments of
   BM perception in schizophrenia could be partially attributable to
   altered attention. To elucidate the impairments in attention and social
   perception in schizophrenia, we investigated the neural basis of
   impaired BM processing using MRI in respect to attention deficits by eye
   tracker. Voxel-based morphometry was performed to evaluate the
   relationship between BM perception and gray matter (GM) volume. The
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and anterior superior temporal sulcus
   (aSTS) were related to task accuracy. However, when the effect of
   attention (i.e., eye movement) was controlled, the relationship in TPJ
   became non-significant, while aSTS showed a significant relationship
   with BM perception. Alteration in TPJ might be associated with
   inefficient attentional strategy, whereas dysfunctional aSTS might be
   correlated with deficit in higher order BM processing per se. Several
   cognitive levels as well as corresponding brain areas are possibly
   involved in the manifestation of social cognitive deficits in
   schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Physical activity can combat detrimental effects of stress. The current
   study examined the potential protective effects of exercise against a

   addition of CMS during the final 2 weeks. Half of the voles were allowed
   access to a running wheel during this final 2 weeks, while the other
   half remained sedentary. Animals underwent behavioral tests to assess
   depressive- and anxietybehaviors. In a subset of animals, plasma was
   collected 10 minutes after behavioral testing for corticosterone
   analysis. In a separate subset, brains were collected 2 hours after
   behavioral testing for cFos analysis in the paraventricular nucleus
   (PVN). Voles in the exercise group displayed significantly lower
   depressive- and anxiety-behaviors, and displayed significantly lower
   corticosterone levels, compared to animals in the sedentary group. There
   was no difference in PVN cFos activity between groups. Interestingly,
   animals that moderately exercised displayed lower levels of
   depressive-behavior and attenuated corticosterone reactivity compared to
   animals in the low and high activity subgroups. These findings suggest
   that physical activity can protect against a combination of social and

Title = {{Empathizers and systemizers process social information differently}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{616-627}},
Abstract = {{Using the empathizing-systemizing theory as our framework, we
   investigated how people with high self-reported empathizing (having good
   social skills and being interested in people) and systemizing (being
   interested in physical things and processes) differ in the social
   information processing of emotionally negative photographs of people
   during ``spontaneous watching{''} and emotional and cognitive empathy
   tasks. Empathizers evaluated the pictures as more emotionally touching
   and the reactions in the photographs more understandable than the
   systemizers. Compared to the empathizers, systemizers had stronger
   activations in the posterior cingulate cortex, an area related to
   cognitive empathy, as well as in the left superior temporal gyrus and
   middle frontal gyrus when watching emotional photographs spontaneously.
   During guided emotional and cognitive empathy tasks, these differences
   disappeared. However, during the emotional empathy task, higher
   systemizing was associated with weaker activation of the right inferior
   frontal gyrus /insula. Furthermore, during emotional and cognitive
   empathy tasks, empathizing was related to increased activations of the
   amygdala which were in turn related to higher behavioral ratings of
   emotional and cognitive empathy. The results suggest that empathizers
   and systemizers engage in social information processing differently:
   systemizers in more cognitive terms and empathizers with stronger
   automatic emotional reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Social lives have shifted, at least in part, for large portions of the

   associated with brain structures is still largely unknown. In this
   manuscript, we describe two preliminary studies aimed at exploring this
   issue. The first study (n = 276) showed that Facebook users reported on
   increased social-semantic and mentalizing demands, and that such
   increases were positively associated with people's level of Facebook
   use. The second study (n = 33) theorized on and examined likely
   anatomical correlates of such changes in demands on the brain. Findings
   indicated that the grey matter volumes of the posterior parts of the
   bilateral middle and superior temporal, and left fusiform gyri were
   positively associated with the level of Facebook use. These results
   provided preliminary evidence that grey matter volumes of brain
   structures involved in social-semantic and mentalizing tasks may be
   linked to the extent of social networking sites use.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions with conspecifics are key to any social species. In order
   to navigate this social world, it is crucial for individuals to learn
   from and about others. From learning new skills by observing parents
   perform them tomaking complex collective decisions, understanding the
   mechanisms underlying social cognitive processes has been of
   considerable interest to psychologists and neuroscientists. Here, we
   review studies that have used computational modelling techniques,
   combined with neuroimaging, to shed light on how people learn and make
   decisions in social contexts. As opposed to standard social neuroscience
   methods, the computational approach allows one to directly examine where
   in the brain particular computations, as estimated by models of
   behavior, are implemented. Findings suggest that people use several
   strategies tolearn from others: vicarious reward learning, where one
   learns from observing the reward outcomes of another agent; action
   imitation, which relies on encoding a prediction error between the
   expected and actual actions of the other agent; and social inference,
   where one learns by inferring the goals and intentions of others. These
   computations are implemented indistinct neural networks, which may be
   recruited adaptively depending on task demands, the environment and
   other social factors.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{648-666}},
Abstract = {{Relational Models Theory or RMT proposes that there are four universal
   ways in which socio-economic relations can be organized. According to
   the RMT, each of its four relational models (Communal Sharing, Authority
   Ranking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing) is associated with a
   distinct cognitive representation, with a cumulative pattern in which
   each relational model is a superset of the next lower model. This report
   for the first time uses a combination of cognitive and the social
   neuroscience to put this model to the test.RMT proposes that members of
   every culture use all four relational models, just in different
   proportions. It should therefore be possible to study their neural
   correlates in a mono-cultural sample. In this study, thirty-nine
   European-American students were imaged in a 3T Siemens Trio with a
   24-channel head coil while rating the extent to which each relational
   model organized relationships with each of thirty-two
   acquaintances/friend/relatives in a boxcar design. FreeSurfer Functional
   Analysis Stream (FS-FAST) analyses revealed distinct patterns of
   activation for each of the relational models. The activations did not
   follow a cumulative hierarchical pattern, suggestive that this aspect of
   the RMT model should be revised.}},

Abstract = {{How do we decide to keep interacting (e.g., stay) with a social partner
   or to switch (e.g., leave) to another? This paper investigated the
   neural mechanisms of stay/leave decision-making. We hypothesized that
   these decisions fit within a framework of value-based decision-making,
   and explored four potential mechanisms underlying a hypothesized bias to
   stay. Twenty-six participants underwent functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (fMRI) while completing social and nonsocial versions of a
   stay/leave decision-making task. On each trial, participants chose
   between four alternative options, after which they received a monetary
   reward. Crucially, in the social condition, reward magnitude was
   ostensibly determined by the generosity of social partners, whereas in
   the nonsocial condition, reward amounts were ostensibly determined in a
   pre-programmed manner. Results demonstrated that participants were more
   likely to stay with options of relatively high expected value, with
   these values updated through Reinforcement Learning mechanisms and
   represented neurally within ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, we
   demonstrated that greater brain activity in ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex, caudate nucleus, and septo-hypothalamic regions for social
   versus nonsocial decisions to stay may underlie a bias towards staying
   with social partners in particular. These findings complement existing
   social psychological theories by investigating the neural mechanisms of
   actual stay/leave decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The physical space individuals share is known as interpersonal space. As

   different people. In the current study, we sought to examine the role of

   preferences. Contrary to previous studies that reported a preference for
   increased space following intranasal OT, we predicted that following OT
   administration individuals would exhibit increased active approach
   towards a protagonist. Accordingly, we measured active approach towards
   friends and strangers. The results indicated that OT increased social
   approach, particularly to strangers, suggesting that the OT system plays
   a major role in regulating social approach, depending on type of
   protagonist. The results are in line with the social salience and

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{701-709}},
Abstract = {{Equity, fairness and cooperative behavior are crucial for everyday
   social interactions. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is involved in the evaluation of
   violations of fairness rules, though difficulties remain to determine
   its role in implementing retaliating or forgiving responses to
   unfairness. Accordingly, we applied repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (rTMS) to the left and right DLPFC and investigated the
   impact of the DLPFC on retaliation and selfishness using a sequential
   neuroeconomic task establishing a role reversal. That is, participants
   first played an Ultimatum Game (in the role of a recipient) against fair
   or unfair proposers, followed by a Dictator Game in the role of a
   proposer. Following inhibition of the right DLPFC, subjects showed an
   increased punishment rate regarding previously unfair opponents.
   Surprisingly, previously fair opponents were also treated less fairly
   after rTMS to the right DLPFC, but not after left or sham rTMS. Previous
   work suggests that the right DLPFC provides top-down cognitive control
   over prepotent emotional responses to unfairness. Our results indicate,
   however, that the right DLPFC may be involved in controlling selfish
   behavior and that its suppression leads to maximization of one's own
   benefit, regardless of another's fairness or unfairness in previous
   encounters.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of pain serves as a way for animals to communicate
   potential dangers to nearby conspecifics. Recent research demonstrated
   that mice undergoing alcohol or morphine withdrawal, or inflammation,
   could socially communicate their hyperalgesia to nearby mice. However,
   it is unknown whether such social transfer of hyperalgesia can be
   observed in other species of rodents. Therefore, the present study
   investigated if the social transfer of hyperalgesia occurs in the highly
   social prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster). We observe that adult female
   prairie voles undergoing withdrawal from voluntary two-bottle choice
   alcohol drinking display an increase in nociception. This alcohol
   withdrawal-induced hypersensitiity is socially transferred to female
   siblings within the same cage and female strangers housed in separate
   cages within the same room. These experiments reveal that the social
   transfer of pain phenomenon is not specific to inbred mouse strains and
   that prairie voles display alcohol withdrawal and social
   transfer-induced hyperalgesia.}},

Title = {{Spatio-temporal dynamics of the mirror neuron system during social
   intentions}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{718-738}},
Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that specific goals and intentions influence
   a person's allocation of social attention. From a neural viewpoint, a
   growing body of evidence suggests that the inferior fronto-parietal
   network, including the mirror neuron system, plays a role in the
   planning and the understanding of motor intentions. However, it is
   unclear whether and when the mirror neuron system plays a role in social
   intentions. Combining a behavioral task with electrical neuroimaging in
   22 healthy male participants, the current study investigates whether the
   temporal brain dynamic of the mirror neuron system differs during two
   types of social intentions i.e., lust vs. romantic intentions. Our
   results showed that 62\% of the stimuli evoking lustful intentions also
   evoked romantic intentions, and both intentions were sustained by
   similar activations of the inferior frontal gyrus and the inferior
   parietal lobule/angular gyrus for the first 432ms after stimulus onset.
   Intentions to not love or not lust, on the other hand, were
   characterized by earlier differential activations of the inferior
   fronto-parietal network i.e., as early as 244ms after stimulus onset.
   These results suggest that the mirror neuron system may not only code
   for the motor correlates of intentions, but also for the social meaning
   of intentions and its valence at both early/automatic and later/more
   elaborative stages of information processing.}},

   in situations of justified and unjustified violence}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{739-755}},
Abstract = {{The role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in moral decision-making is
   well established. However, OFC activity is highly context dependent. It
   is affected by the extent to which choices are morally justified and
   whom they concern. In the current study, we specifically focus on
   contextual factors and investigate the differential role of the OFC
   during justified and unjustified violence towards ingroup versus
   outgroup members. Muslims were chosen as the outgroup, as they are
   currently stereotypically seen as an outgroup and a potential threat by
   some Non-Muslims. Importantly, we also introduce a context where
   participants are the actual agents responsible for doing harm. During
   fMRI scanning, Non-Muslim participants had to decide to either shoot a
   Non-Muslim (i.e., ingroup member) or Muslim (outgroup member) depending
   on whether they believed the target was holding a gun or an object.
   Neuroimaging results showed increased activation in the lateral OFC
   (lOFC) in the three contrasts that were distressing: 1) during
   unjustifiable killing; 2) when being killed; and 3) when confronted by
   an outgroup member with a gun. Together, these results provide important
   insights into the neurocognitive mechanisms involved in intergroup
   violence and highlight the critical role of the lOFC in context
   dependent social decision-making.}},

   appreciation: An event-related fMRI study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{756-768}},
Abstract = {{Previous research and theory implicate that personality traits, such as
   extraversion and neuroticism, influence the processing of humor, as
   indicated by alterations in the activation of fronto-temporal and
   mesocorticolimbic brain regions during humor processing. In the current
   study, we sought to complement these findings by testing whether
   inter-individual differences in functional connectivity of humor-related
   brain regions are modulated by stable personality characteristics during
   humor processing. Using fMRI techniques, we studied 19 healthy subjects
   during the processing of standardized humorous and neutral cartoons. In
   order to isolate the specific effects of humor appreciation, subjective
   funniness ratings, collected during the scanning procedure, were
   implemented in the analysis as parametric modulation. Two distinct
   clusters in the right amygdala and the left insula were identified.
   Seed-to-voxel connectivity analysis investigating the effects of
   personality on inter-individual differences in functional connectivity
   revealed that amygdala and insula connectivity with brain areas
   previously related to humor comprehension (e.g. middle temporal gyrus)
   and appreciation (e.g. caudate nucleus) were significantly modulated by
   personality dimensions. These results underscore the sensitivity of
   humor processing to moderating influences, such as personality, and call
   attention to the importance of brain connectivity measures for the
   investigation of inter-individual differences in the processing of
   humor.}},

Abstract = {{Morality is an important social construct necessary for understanding

   have used a wide variety of paradigms and implicated many different

   in the present study, a series of activation likelihood estimation (ALE)
   meta-analyses were conducted on 123 datasets (inclusive of 1963
   participants) to address this question. The ALE meta-analyses revealed a
   series of common brain areas associated with all moral tasks, including
   medial prefrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala,
   temporoparietal junction, and precuneus. However, individual and
   contrast analyses also revealed unique networks associated with each
   moral modality, suggesting that different moral tasks recruit

Pages = {{399-415}},
Abstract = {{Adhering to standard procedures (impartiality), returning favors
   (reciprocity) or giving based on individuals' needs (charity) may all be
   considered moral and/or fair ways to allocate resources. However, these
   allocation behaviors may be perceived as differently motivated, and
   their moral evaluation may make different demands on theory of mind
   (ToM) - the capacity to process information about mental states,
   including motives. In Studies 1 and 2, we examined participants' moral
   judgments of allocations based on (1) impartiality, (2) reciprocity, (3)
   charity and (4) unspecified criteria as depicted in vignettes, as well
   as participants' perceptions of allocators' motivations. In Study 3, we
   used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate how brain
   regions for ToM were recruited during moral evaluation of the same
   vignettes. Reciprocity and charity were processed similarly, in that
   they recruited ToM regions to the same extent, i.e., precuneus, dorsal
   and ventral medial prefrontal cortex and left temporoparietal junction
   (LTPJ). In turn, impartiality and the unspecified condition were
   processed similarly, recruiting the same ToM regions to a lesser extent.
   Nevertheless, reciprocity elicited greater activity relative to
   impartiality and unspecified in the ToM regions of interest. Overall,
   evaluations of different allocation behaviors depend differently on ToM,
   with charity and reciprocity eliciting greater attention to individuals'
   unique states and motivations.}},

Abstract = {{Social neuroscience research investigating autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) has yielded inconsistent findings, despite ASD being
   well-characterized by difficulties in social interaction and
   communication through behavioral observation. In particular, specific
   etiologies and functional and structural assays of the brain in autism
   have not been consistently identified. To date, most social neuroscience
   research has focused on a single person viewing static images. Research
   utilizing interactive social neuroscience featuring dual-brain recording
   offers great promise for the study of neurodevelopmental disabilities.
   Reward processing has been implicated in the pathology of ASD, yet mixed
   findings have brought uncertainty about the role reward processing
   deficits may play in ASD. The current study employed dual-brain EEG
   recording to examine reward processing during live interaction and its
   relation to autistic traits. Sixteen typically developing (TD) adults
   played a competitive treasure-hunt game against a computer and against a
   human partner. EEG results revealed enhanced neural sensitivity to
   reward outcome during live interaction with a human competitor. Further,
   individuals with higher levels of autistic traits demonstrated reduced
   sensitivity to reward outcome during live interaction. These findings
   provide novel insight into reward processing mechanisms associated with
   autistic traits, as well as support the necessary utility of interactive
   social neuroscience techniques to study developmental disorders.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{429-438}},
Abstract = {{Rejection sensitivity (RS) can be defined as the disposition of a person
   to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection.
   Individuals with high RS are likely to suffer from mental disorders. The
   association between individual differences in RS and spontaneous
   neuronal activity at resting state has not yet been investigated. In
   this study, resting state data were used to investigate the relationship
   between RS and spontaneous neuronal activity in a large sample of
   healthy men (137) and women (172). The participants completed the
   rejection sensitivity questionnaire and underwent resting-state magnetic
   resonance imaging scan. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to
   examine the correlation between the regional amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations (ALFF) and rejection sensitivity scores adjusted for age
   and sex. Results showed that the ALFF value in the subgenual anterior
   cingulate cortex (sgACC) was positively associated with RS. Furthermore,
   functional connectivity with the middle frontal gyrus was negatively
   correlated with RS when sgACC was used as the seed region. These
   findings suggest that the spontaneous neuronal activity of sgACC and its
   functional connectivity with the lateral prefrontal cortex which are
   involved in experiencing social exclusion and regulating negative
   emotions are associated with individual differences in RS.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{439-450}},
Abstract = {{The current study investigated whether changes in the neural processing
   of faces of infants with a facial abnormality - a cleft lip - mediate
   effects of the cleft lip on judgments of infant cuteness and
   approachability. Event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to pictures
   of faces of healthy infants and infants with a cleft lip, and ratings of
   cuteness and approachability of these infant faces, were obtained from
   30 females. Infants with a cleft lip were rated as less attractive (less
   cute and approachable) than healthy infants, and both the N170 and P2
   components of the ERP were of reduced amplitude in response to pictures
   of infants with a cleft lip. Importantly, decreased configural
   processing of infant faces with a cleft lip, as evidenced by reduced
   N170 amplitudes, mediated the reduced attractiveness ratings for infants
   with a cleft lip compared to healthy infants. Our findings help
   elucidate the mechanisms behind the less favorable responses to infants
   with a cleft lip, highlighting the role of face-specific rather than
   domain-general neural processes.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{451-470}},
Abstract = {{For individuals high in Rejection Sensitivity (RS), a learned
   orientation to anxiously expect rejection from valued others, negative
   feedback from social sources may disrupt engagement with learning
   opportunities, impeding recovery from mistakes. One context in which
   this disruption may be particularly pronounced is among women high in RS
   following evaluation by a male in authority. To investigate this
   prediction, 40 college students (50\% female) answered general knowledge
   questions followed by immediate performance feedback and the correct
   answer while we recorded event-related potentials. Error correction was
   measured with a subsequent surprise retest. Performance feedback was
   either nonsocial (asterisk/tone) or social (male professor's
   face/voice). Attention and learning were indexed respectively by the
   anterior frontal P3a (attentional orienting) and a set of negative-going
   waveforms over left inferior-posterior regions associated with
   successful encoding. For women, but not men, higher RS scores predicted
   poorer error correction in the social condition. A path analysis
   suggested that, for women, high RS disrupted attentional orienting to
   the social-evaluative performance feedback, which affected subsequent
   memory for the correct answer by reducing engagement with learning
   opportunities. These results suggest a mechanism for how social feedback
   may impede learning among women who are high in RS.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{471-479}},
Abstract = {{The corpus callosum (CC) is vulnerable to severe traumatic brain injury
   (TB!). Social cognition requires integration of non-verbal and verbal
   information in order to understand social behaviour and may be
   compromised if the CC is damaged. 17 adults with severe, chronic TBI and
   17 control participants underwent structural MRI and Diffusion Tensor
   Imaging. A region of interest analysis examined fractional anisotropy
   (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) across regions of the CC. Performance on
   The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT): part 1 (emotion
   recognition) and parts 2 and 3 (social inference), was examined in
   relation to FA and MD. Across participants, higher genu FA values were
   related to higher TASIT part 3 scores. Increased splenium FA was
   associated with better performance for TASIT parts 1-3. There was no
   association between DTI values and TASIT in the controls alone. In the
   TBI group, FA of the genu and splenium was correlated with TASIT part 3.
   The pattern of performance was similar when controlling for nonsocial
   cognitive ability. In conclusion, social information is complex and
   multi-modal requiring inter-hemispheric connection. People with TBI,
   regardless of focal grey matter injury, may lose social cognitive
   ability due to trauma related changes to the corpus callosum.}},

Title = {{Motivated malleability: Frontal cortical asymmetry predicts the
   susceptibility to social influence}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{480-494}},
Abstract = {{Humans, just as many other animals, regulate their behavior in terms of
   approaching stimuli associated with pleasure and avoiding stimuli linked
   to harm. A person's current and chronic motivational direction - that
   is, approach versus avoidance orientation - is reliably reflected in the
   asymmetry of frontal cortical low-frequency oscillations. Using resting
   electroencephalography (EEG), we show that frontal asymmetry is
   predictive of the tendency to yield to social influence: Stronger right-
   than left-side frontolateral activation during a resting-state session
   prior to the experiment was robustly associated with a stronger
   inclination to adopt a peer group's judgments during perceptual
   decision-making (Study 1). We posit that this reflects the role of a
   person's chronic avoidance orientation in socially adjusted behavior.
   This claim was strongly supported by additional survey investigations
   (Studies 2a, 2b, 2c), all of which consistently revealed that trait
   avoidance was positively linked to the susceptibility to social
   influence. The present contribution thus stresses the relevance of
   chronic avoidance orientation in social conformity, refining (yet not
   contradicting) the longstanding view that socially influenced behavior
   is motivated by approach-related goals. Moreover, our findings valuably
   underscore and extend our knowledge on the association between frontal
   cortical asymmetry and a variety of psychological variables.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{495-510}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated whether the ERP responses observed during
   a verbal irony comprehension task might represent the cortical
   manifestation of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC) activity. We
   performed a tDCS-EEG study in which we analyzed the effects of tDCS
   polarities (anode, cathode, sham) over the MPFC during a verbal irony
   task. We presented visual short stories portraying everyday situations
   followed by written statements in either an ironic or literal condition,
   whose meaning was referred to in the previous context. We manipulated
   the valence of the stimuli by presenting positive sentences or negative
   sentences in the ironic and literal conditions. The results revealed
   that the participants who received the anodal stimulation showed no
   differences in the N400 amplitude in response to the literal and the
   ironic condition. This could suggest that anodal stimulation has
   modulatory effects on N400 responses during irony comprehension. Our
   results indicated that the MPFC might be critical in accessing ironic
   information at the initial stage of irony comprehension. Finally, we
   found that the ironic compliments were more difficult to understand
   compared to the literal ones, suggesting that irony comprehension is
   affected by the valence of the information presented.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{173-183}},
Abstract = {{Animal models have shown that social isolation and other forms of social
   stress lead to depressive- and anxiety-relevant behaviors, as well as
   neuroendocrine and physiological dysfunction. The goal of this study was
   to investigate the effects of prior social isolation on neurotransmitter
   content following acute restraint in prairie voles. Animals were either
   paired with a same-sex sibling or isolated for 4 weeks. Plasma adrenal
   hormones and ex vivo tissue concentrations of monoamine
   neurotransmitters and their metabolites were measured following an acute
   restraint stressor in all animals. Isolated prairie voles displayed
   significantly increased circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone levels,
   as well as elevated serotonin and dopamine levels in the hypothalamus,
   and potentially decreased levels of serotonin in the frontal cortex.
   However, no group differences in monoamine levels were observed in the
   hippocampus or raphe. The results suggest that social stress may bias
   monoamine neurotransmission and stress hormone function to subsequent
   acute stressors, such as restraint. These findings improve our
   understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the
   consequences of social stress.}},

Title = {{tDCS potentiation provides no evidence for a link between right
   dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortical activity and empathic responding}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{190-201}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies suggest the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is
   involved in processing of empathic concern. This has not been
   experimentally tested to date. We tested the hypotheses that electrical
   potentiation in the right DLPFC would be associated with increased
   empathic concern and prosocial behavior. Participants were randomly
   allocated to one of three transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)
   conditions: (a) relative right potentiation, (b) relative left
   potentiation, and (c) sham. Participants viewed images of African
   children in distressing circumstances, and completed measures of
   empathic concern pre-and post-tDCS manipulation. Contrary to our
   prediction, neither effects, nor interactions of heightened empathic
   concern were observed. These results conflict with previous studies
   using this bilateral tDCS montage. Explanations could be that
   stimulation used in this study had been simply too weak (1.5 mA).
   Alternatively, the area of the DLPFC involved in emotion regulation is
   closer to the cortex than the area involved in empathic concern, and
   more easily potentiated by tDCS. Therefore, the DLPFC potentiation in
   the present study may have linked empathic concern with adaptive emotion
   regulation strategies. Future research could examine this possibility
   using measures of emotion regulation and higher fidelity
   neurostimulation (e.g., repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
   {[}rTMS]).}},

Title = {{Language-based social feedback processing with randomized ``senders{''}:
   An ERP study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{202-213}},
Abstract = {{Recently, several event-related potential (ERP) studies investigated the
   impact of sender attributions on language-based social feedback
   processing. Results showed very early responses to the social context,
   while interactions or effects of emotional content started later.
   However, in these studies, sender attribution was varied across blocks,
   possibly inducing unspecific, anticipatory effects. Here, who was giving
   feedback was disclosed simultaneously with the decision itself.
   Participants' ERPs differentiated between attributed senders starting
   with the early posterior negativity. P3 and late positive potential
   (LPP) amplitudes were also enlarged for the ``human sender{''}. Emotion
   effects occurred in the P3 and LPP time windows. Further, we found an
   interaction on the P3: ``Human{''} emotional feedback was selectively
   amplified. Source analysis localized enhanced processing of
   ``human{''}-generated feedback in visual areas from around 300 ms after
   feedback onset and from 400 ms also in temporal regions. Enhancement of
   ``human{''} emotional feedback resulted from increased activations in
   the left visual word form area.
   These findings highlight that decoding who is giving feedback precedes
   content processing, both in blocked and in randomly alternating
   situations. Further, in quasi-realistic social contexts, processing of
   emotional content is selectively amplified. Finally, involvement of
   semantic language processing structures indicates reintegration of words
   in a salient context.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{214-225}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown right parietal activation in response to
   observing irrational actions. Behavioral studies show that people
   sometimes imitate irrational actions, a phenomenon called overimitation.
   However, limitations on movement in functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) mean that the neural basis of overimitation has not been
   studied. To address this, our study employed a less restrictive
   neuroimaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).
   Measurements were taken while participants observed either rational or
   irrational movements before performing movements on a computerized
   puzzle task. Observing irrational actions produced greater activation in
   right anterior inferior parietal lobule (aIPL), replicating results from
   the fMRI literature. This is a proof of principle that fNIRS can be used
   as an alternative to fMRI in social cognition experiments, and that
   parietal cortex has a core role in responding to irrational actions.}},

Pages = {{226-240}},
Abstract = {{The role of emotional processes in driving moral choices remains
   debated. In particular, diminished emotional processing and reduced
   empathy have been associated with unusual high rates of utilitarian
   responses in moral judgments while, to date, the effects of diminished
   emotional processing and empathy on moral decision-making have been only
   partially considered. In this study, we investigated the influence of
   empathy and alexithymia on behavior and emotional responses while
   participants performed a moral decision task. Self-report (valence and
   arousal ratings) and physiological (skin conductance and heart rate)
   measures were collected during the task. Results showed that empathy and
   alexithymia shaped emotional reactions to moral decisions but did not
   bias moral choices. The more empathic the participants, the more
   dilemmas were perceived as unpleasant and arousing, and the greater the
   increase in skin conductance. Conversely, alexithymia was characterized
   by a reduced physiological activation during moral decisions, but normal
   self-report ratings. Heart rate was not modulated by empathy or
   alexithymia. These results add new evidence to the field of moral
   decision showing that empathy and alexithymia modulate emotional
   reactions to moral decision.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{241-245}},
Abstract = {{Background: Difficulties with the regulation of negative affect have
   been extensively studied in neuroimaging research. However,
   dysregulation of a specific emotion, disgust, has hardly been
   investigated. In the present study, we used voxel-based morphometry to
   identify whether gray matter volume (GMV) of frontal regions is
   correlated with personality traits associated with general and
   disgust-specific emotion regulation difficulties.
   Method: We analyzed T1-weighted images of 49 females (mean age = 22.8
   years, SD = 3.2). The women rated their disgust sensitivity (DS)
   (temporally stable tendency to experience disgust as uncontrollable and
   extremely aversive) as well as general difficulties with emotion
   regulation.
   Results: DS and general emotion regulation deficits were positively
   associated with a heightened GMV of the orbitofrontal cortex. DS
   additionally showed a negative association with GMV of the medial
   prefrontal cortex.
   Conclusion: The present study revealed shared and distinct contributions
   of frontal brain regions to disgust-specific and general emotion
   regulation difficulties.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{246-256}},
Abstract = {{The coupling of perception and action has been strongly indicated by
   evidence that the observation of an action primes a response in the
   observer. It has been proposed that these primed responses may be
   inhibited when the observer is able to more closely distinguish between
   self-and other-generated actions - the greater the distinction, then the
   greater the inhibition of the primed response. This self-other
   distinction is shown to be enhanced following a period of visual
   feedback of self-generated action. The present study was designed to
   examine how sensorimotor experiences pertaining to self-generated action
   affect primed responses from observed actions. Single-pulse transcranial
   magnetic stimulation was used to investigate corticospinal activity
   elicited during the observation of index-and little-finger actions
   before and after training (self-generated action). For sensorimotor
   training, participants executed finger movements with or without visual
   feedback of their own movement. Results showed that the increases in
   muscle-specific corticospinal activity elicited from action-observation
   persisted after training without visual feedback, but did not emerge
   following training with visual feedback. This inhibition in
   corticospinal activity during action-observation following training with
   vision could have resulted from the refining of internal models of
   self-generated action, which then led to a greater distinction between
   ``self{''} and ``other{''} actions.}},

   psychology}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{257-267}},
Abstract = {{In fMRI research, the goal of correcting for multiple comparisons is to
   identify areas of activity that reflect true effects, and thus would be
   expected to replicate in future studies. Finding an appropriate balance
   between trying to minimize false positives (Type I error) while not
   being too stringent and omitting true effects (Type II error) can be
   challenging. Furthermore, the advantages and disadvantages of these
   types of errors may differ for different areas of study. In many areas
   of social neuroscience that involve complex processes and considerable
   individual differences, such as the study of moral judgment, effects are
   typically smaller and statistical power weaker, leading to the
   suggestion that less stringent corrections that allow for more
   sensitivity may be beneficial and also result in more false positives.
   Using moral judgment fMRI data, we evaluated four commonly used methods
   for multiple comparison correction implemented in Statistical Parametric
   Mapping 12 by examining which method produced the most precise overlap
   with results from a meta-analysis of relevant studies and with results
   from nonparametric permutation analyses. We found that voxelwise
   thresholding with familywise error correction based on Random Field
   Theory provides a more precise overlap (i.e., without omitting too few
   regions or encompassing too many additional regions) than either
   clusterwise thresholding, Bonferroni correction, or false discovery rate
   correction methods.}},

Abstract = {{Rejection sensitivity is a cognitive-affective processing disposition

   guanine (G) is substituted for adenine (A), has been associated with
   less support-seeking behaviors. In the current study, among 376
   undergraduate students, it was shown that the relationship between
   rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms was mediated by multiple
   group memberships. Furthermore, the relation between rejection
   sensitivity and group memberships was only evident among individuals
   possessing the A allele on the OXTR gene. These findings further support
   the psychosocial deficits characteristic of individuals possessing the
   OXTR polymorphism, which in turn is linked to poor mood.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{277-288}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that the effects of meditation practice on
   affective processing and resilience have the potential to induce
   neuroplastic changes within the amygdala. Notably, literature speculates
   that meditation training may reduce amygdala activity during negative
   affective processing. Nonetheless, studies have thus far not verified
   this speculation. In this longitudinal study, participants (N=21, 9 men)
   were trained in awareness-based compassion meditation (ABCM) or matched
   relaxation training. The effects of meditation training on amygdala
   activity were examined during passive viewing of affective and neutral
   stimuli in a non-meditative state. We found that the ABCM group
   exhibited significantly reduced anxiety and right amygdala activity
   during negative emotion processing than the relaxation group.
   Furthermore, ABCM participants who performed more compassion practice
   had stronger right amygdala activity reduction during negative emotion
   processing. The lower right amygdala activity after ABCM training may be
   associated with a general reduction in reactivity and distress. As all
   participants performed the emotion processing task in a non-meditative
   state, it appears likely that the changes in right amygdala activity are
   carried over from the meditation practice into the non-meditative state.
   These findings suggest that the distress-reducing effects of meditation
   practice on affective processing may transfer to ordinary states, which
   have important implications on stress management.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{289-300}},
Abstract = {{Sibling and friend relationships have significant impact on individuals'
   socio-emotional development. Hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) and
   paraventricular nucleus (PVN) synthesize and secrete neuropeptides,
   including oxytocin, associated with attachment behaviors. Here, using
   fMRI, we investigate the implication of these two hypothalamic nuclei in
   the visual processing of personally known faces. Faces of same-sex
   sibling, best friend, celebrity, and unknown person appear in the middle
   of the screen while participants perform a task requiring a button click
   each time a central white dot turns red. Ratings of familiarity (time
   spent together) and emotionality (feelings toward individual) toward the
   four individuals are recorded. Local activation within the hypothalamus
   is assessed via two complementary methods: (1) voxel-based analyses
   within inclusive mask of the hypothalamus; (2) region-of-interest (ROI)
   analysis of partial hypothalamic volumes using SON and PVN as center of
   mass coordinates, with percent signal change extracted and analyzed
   within these ROIs. Results suggest that the SON responds to all familiar
   individuals while the PVN has increased response to sibling compared to
   friend faces and is correlated to familiarity but not emotionality.
   These findings support differential involvement of local hypothalamic
   substructures SON and PVN in response to faces of individuals with
   different social relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Video games with violent content have raised considerable concern in
   popular media and within academia. Recently, there has been considerable
   attention regarding the claim of the relationship between aggression and
   video game play. The authors of this study propose the use of a new
   class of tools developed via computational models to allow examination
   of the question of whether there is a relationship between violent video
   games and aggression. The purpose of this study is to computationally
   model and compare the General Aggression Model with the Diathesis Mode
   of Aggression related to the play of violent content in video games. A
   secondary purpose is to provide a method of measuring and examining
   individual aggression arising from video game play. Total participants
   examined for this study are N=1065. This study occurs in three phases.
   Phase 1 is the development and quantification of the profile combination
   of traits via latent class profile analysis. Phase 2 is the training of
   the artificial neural network. Phase 3 is the comparison of each model
   as a computational model with and without the presence of video game
   violence. Results suggest that a combination of environmental factors
   and genetic predispositions trigger aggression related to video games.}},

Abstract = {{The present event-related potential (ERP) study investigated for the

   ERPs in early and later time windows (P100, N170, late positivity
   {[}LP]), as well as affective ratings (valence and arousal) for the
   faces, were recorded. SAD patients rated the faces as generally more
   arousing, regardless of the type of emotion and intensity. Moreover,
   they displayed enhanced right-parietal LP (350-650ms). Both arousal
   ratings and LP reflect stimulus intensity. Therefore, this study

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{328-332}},
Abstract = {{Facial expressions of disgust, which involve movement of the levator
   labii muscles on the nose, allow an organism to restrict the intake of
   potentially aversive stimuli by constricting the air cavities in the
   nostrils and reducing the speed of air intake. In the current research,
   we used fMRI of the thoracic spinal cord to measure neural activity
   related to (1) the contraction of the intercostal muscles that modulate
   the velocity of air intake and (2) the sensory feedback associated with
   this contraction. Thirteen participants completed two spinal fMRI runs
   in which the thoracic segments of the spinal cord were measured. Each
   five-minute 40-second run consisted of three 60-second blocks in which
   participants repeatedly generated a disgusted facial expression or a
   non-emotional expression consisting of repeated stretching of the lips
   (which did not involve the nasal cavity). Forty-second rest blocks were
   interleaved between each expression block. The results demonstrated that
   generating emotional expressions of disgust produces significantly more
   activity than producing non-emotional facial expressions. This activity
   occurred in both ventral (motoric) and dorsal (sensory) regions of the
   upper segments of the thoracic spinal cord and demonstrates a link
   between the generation of facial expressions and embodied emotional
   responses.}},

Abstract = {{Functional neuroimaging research suggests that status-based evaluations
   may not solely depend on the level of social status but also on the
   conferred status dimension. However, no reports to date have studied how

   early status-based person evaluations, event-related brain potential
   data were collected from 29 participants while they indicated the status
   level and dimension of faces that had been previously trained to be
   associated with one of four status types: high moral, low moral, high
   financial, or low financial. Analysis of the P300 amplitude (previously
   implicated in social evaluation) revealed an interaction of status level
   and status dimension such that enhanced P300 amplitudes were observed in
   response to targets of high financial and low moral status relative to
   targets of low financial and high moral status. Implications of these
   findings are discussed in the context of our current understanding of
   status-based evaluation and, more broadly, of the processes by which

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{346-354}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a picture system that can be used in functional
   imaging experiments exploring interpersonal relations. This is important
   for psychotherapy research to understand the neural basis of
   psychological treatment effects. Pictures have many advantages for the
   design of functional imaging experiments, but no picture system
   illustrating interpersonal behavior patterns is, to date, available. We
   therefore developed, on the basis of a validated card-sorting test, the
   Interpersonal Relations Picture System. In summary, 43 pictures with 2
   or more stick figures in different social situations and 9 control
   pictures were composed. To test the relation between each picture and
   the appropriate description, two successive online surveys, including
   1058 and 675 individuals respectively, were conducted. Using two
   question types, the grade expressiveness of each picture was assessed.
   In total, 24 pictures and 6 control pictures met our criteria for
   sufficient strength and consistency with the appropriate description.
   Both measures are correlated with each other in all pictures
   illustrating interpersonal behavior, but not in the control pictures.
   Relations to other stimulus types and the applicability of the new
   picture system in functional neuroimaging methods are discussed. It is
   concluded that the new system will be helpful in studying the profound
   effect of relational change in psychotherapy.}},

   idea that BIS activation is associated with increased attention, Study 2
   used electroencephalography to demonstrate that both mortality- and

Abstract = {{Behavioral research suggests that reminding both mortality and negative
   affect influences self-related thoughts. Using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI), we tested the hypothesis that reminders of
   mortality and physical pain decrease brain activity underlying
   self-related thoughts. Three groups of adults underwent priming
   procedures during which they answered questions pertaining to mortality,
   physical pain, or leisure time, respectively. Before and after priming,
   participants performed personality trait judgments on oneself or a
   celebrity, identified the font of words, or passively viewed a fixation.
   The default-mode activity and neural activity underlying self-reflection
   were identified by contrasting viewing a fixation vs. font judgment and
   trait judgments on oneself vs. a celebrity, respectively. The analyses
   of the pre-priming functional MRI (fMRI) data identified the
   default-mode activity in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), ventral
   medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and parahippocampal gyrus, and the
   activity underlying instructed self-reflection in both the ventral and
   dorsal regions of the MPFC. The analyses of the post-priming fMRI data
   revealed that, relative to leisure time priming, reminding mortality
   significantly reduced the default-mode PCC activity, and reminding
   physical pain significantly decreased the dorsal MPFC activity during
   instructed self-reflection. Our findings suggest distinct neural
   underpinnings of the effect of reminding morality and aversive emotion
   on default-mode and instructed self-reflection.}},

Abstract = {{Difficulty with emotion perception is a core feature of autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) that is also associated with the broader autism
   phenotype. The current study explored the neural underpinnings of
   conscious and nonconscious perceptions of affect in typically developing
   individuals with varying levels of autistic-like traits, as measured by
   the Autism Quotient (AQ). We investigated the relationship between
   autistic traits and face processing efficiency using event-related
   potentials (ERPs). In 20 typically developing adults, we utilized ERPs
   (the P100, N170, and P300) to measure differences in face processing for
   emotional faces that were presented either (a) too quickly to reach
   conscious awareness (16 ms) or (b) slowly enough to be consciously
   observed (200 ms). All individuals evidenced increased P100 and P300
   amplitude and shorter N170 latencies for nonconscious versus consciously
   presented faces. Individuals with high AQ scores evidenced delayed ERP
   components. Nonconsciously perceived emotional faces elicited enhanced
   neural responses regardless of AQ score. Higher levels of autistic
   traits were associated with inefficient face perception (i.e., longer
   latency of ERP components). This delay parallels processing delays
   observed in ASD. These data suggest that inefficient social perception
   is present in individuals with subclinical levels of social impairment.}},

Pages = {{52-60}},
Abstract = {{Social categorization is the foundation of stereotype activation, and
   the process from social categorization to stereotype activation is
   rapid. However, the time from social categorization to stereotype
   activation is unknown. This study involves a real-time measurement of
   the time course of gender-stereotype activation beginning with gender
   categorization using event-related potential technology with a face as
   the priming stimulus. We found that 195 ms after a face stimulus was
   presented, brain waves stimulated by male or female gender
   categorization showed a clear separation, with male faces stimulating
   larger N200 waves. In addition, 475 ms after a face stimulus appeared or
   280 ms after the gendercategorization process occurred,
   gender-stereotype-consistent and gender-stereotype-inconsistent stimuli
   were distinct, with gender-stereotype-inconsistent stimuli inducing
   larger N400 waves. These results indicate that during gender-stereotype
   activation by face perception, gender categorization occurs
   approximately 195 ms after seeing a face stimulus and a gender
   stereotype is activated at approximately 475 ms.}},

Abstract = {{Conflict is a ubiquitous feature of interpersonal relationships, yet
   many of these relationships preserve their value following conflict. Our
   ability to refrain from punishment despite the occurrence of conflict is
   a characteristic of human beings. Using a combination of behavioral and
   neuroimaging techniques, we show that prosocial decision-making is
   modulated by relationship closeness. In an iterated social exchange,
   participants were more likely to cooperate with their partner compared
   to an unknown person by accepting unfair exchanges. Importantly, this
   effect was not influenced by how resources were actually being shared
   with one's partner. The medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) was activated
   when the partner, rather than the unknown person, behaved unfairly and,
   in the same context, the MPFC demonstrated greater functional
   connectivity with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (DACC). MPFC-DACC
   connectivity was inversely associated with participants' tendency to
   ``forgive{''} their partner for unfairness as well as performance
   outside the scanner on a behavioral measure of forgiveness. We conclude
   that relationship closeness modulates a neural network comprising the
   MPFC/DACC during economic exchanges.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{74-93}},
Abstract = {{Eyewitness testimony has been shown to be unreliable and susceptible to
   false memories. Whether eyewitness memory errors are influenced by the
   victim's group membership (relative to both the eyewitness and
   perpetrator) is underexplored. The current study used complementary
   behavioral and neuroimaging approaches to test the hypothesis that
   intragroup conflict heightens participants' susceptibility to subsequent
   false memories. Healthy young adults witnessed and later answered
   questions about events in which the perpetrator and victim were either
   1) identified as in-group members relative to each other and the
   eyewitness, 2) out-group members relative to the eyewitness, but not
   each other, or 3) out-group members relative to each other (Experiments
   1a and 1b). When perpetrators and victims were in-group members
   (intragroup conflict), participants showed heightened false memory
   rates. Moreover, false memories increased upon crime realization.
   Neuroimaging data analysis revealed that salient (as compared to
   ambiguous) intragroup conflict elicited heightened activation in neural
   regions associated with resolving cognitive conflict (anterior cingulate
   cortex; ACC). Increased functional connectivity between the ACC and
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex was associated with subsequent false
   memories (Experiment 2). Results suggest that the social salience of the
   intragroup conflict may have been associated with participants'
   increased susceptibility to false memories.}},

Abstract = {{High-level cognitive and emotional experience arises from brain

   Attentional activation in the anterior cingulate and frontal eye fields

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that the amygdala is more involved in
   processing animate categories, such as humans and animals, than
   inanimate objects, but little is known regarding whether this animate
   advantage applies to auditory stimuli. To address this issue, we
   performed a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study with
   emotion and category as factors, in which subjects heard sounds from
   different categories (i.e., humans, animals, and objects) in negative
   and neutral dimensions. Emotional levels and semantic familiarity were
   matched across categories. The results showed that the amygdala
   responded more to human vocalization than to animal vocalization and
   sounds of inanimate objects in both negative and neutral valences, and
   more to animal sounds than to objects in neural condition. In addition,
   the amygdala, together with the insula and the right superior temporal
   sulcus, further distinguished human voices from animal sounds. These
   data indicated that the amygdala is prepared to respond to animate
   sources, especially human vocalizations in auditory modality.}},

Abstract = {{This meta-analysis compares the brain structures and mechanisms involved
   in facial and vocal emotion recognition. Neuroimaging studies
   contrasting emotional with neutral (face: N = 76, voice: N = 34) and
   explicit with implicit emotion processing (face: N = 27, voice: N = 20)
   were collected to shed light on stimulus and goal-driven mechanisms,
   respectively. Activation likelihood estimations were conducted on the
   full data sets for the separate modalities and on reduced,
   modality-matched data sets for modality comparison. Stimulus-driven
   emotion processing engaged large networks with significant modality
   differences in the superior temporal (voice-specific) and the medial
   temporal (face-specific) cortex. Goal-driven processing was associated
   with only a small cluster in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex for
   voices but not faces. Neither stimulus- nor goal-driven processing
   showed significant modality overlap. Together, these findings suggest
   that stimulus-driven processes shape activity in the social brain more
   powerfully than goal-driven processes in both the visual and the
   auditory domains. Yet, whereas faces emphasize subcortical emotional and
   mnemonic mechanisms, voices emphasize cortical mechanisms associated
   with perception and effortful stimulus evaluation (e.g. via
   subvocalization). These differences may be due to sensory stimulus
   properties and highlight the need for a modality-specific perspective
   when modeling emotion processing in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Despite robust associations between the ventral anterior cingulate
   cortex (vACC) and social evaluation, the role of vACC in social
   evaluation remains poorly understood. Two hypotheses have emerged from
   existing research: detection of positive valence and detection of
   opportunities for subjective reward. It has been difficult to understand
   whether one or both hypotheses are supported because previous research
   conflated positive valence with subjective reward. Therefore, the
   current functional magnetic resonance imaging study drew on a social
   evaluation paradigm that disentangled positive valence and subjective
   reward. Participants evaluated in-group and out-group politicians in a
   social evaluation paradigm that crossed trait valence with opportunity
   for subjectively rewarding affirmation (i.e. a chance to affirm positive
   traits about in-group politicians and affirm negative traits about
   out-group politicians). Participants rated in-group politicians more
   positively and out-group politicians more negatively. One subregion of
   vACC was modulated by positive valence and another relatively posterior
   region of vACC was modulated by opportunity for subjective reward (i.e.
   a politician x valence interaction). The current findings demonstrate
   the importance of incorporating vACC function into models of social
   cognition and provide new avenues for sharpening our understanding of
   the psychological significance of vACC function in social evaluation and
   related domains such as reward and affect.}},

Abstract = {{Those who are high in external motivation to respond without prejudice
   (EMS) tend to focus on non-racial attributes when describing others.
   This fMRI study examined the neural processing of race and an
   alternative yet stereotypically relevant attribute (viz., socioeconomic
   status: SES) as a function of the perceiver's EMS. Sixty-one White
   participants privately formed impressions of Black and White faces
   ascribed with high or low SES. Analyses focused on regions supporting
   race- and status-based reward/salience (NAcc), evaluation (VMPFC) and
   threat/relevance (amygdala). Consistent with previous findings from the
   literature on status-based evaluation, we observed greater neural
   responses to high-status (vs low-status) targets in all regions of
   interest when participants were relatively low in EMS. In contrast, we
   observed the opposite pattern when participants were relatively high in
   EMS. Notably, all effects were independent of target race. In summary,
   White perceivers' race-related motivations similarly altered their
   neural responses to the SES of Black and White targets. Specifically,
   the findings suggest that EMS may attenuate the positive value and/or
   salience of high status in a mixed-race context. Findings are discussed
   in the context of the stereotypic relationship between race and SES.}},

Abstract = {{The neural underpinnings of repetitive behaviors (RBs) in autism
   spectrum disorders (ASDs), ranging from cognitive to motor
   characteristics, remain unknown. We assessed RB symptomatology in 50 ASD
   and 52 typically developing (TD) children and adolescents (ages 8-17
   years), examining intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of
   corticostriatal circuitry, which is important for reward-based learning
   and integration of emotional, cognitive and motor processing, and
   considered impaired in ASDs. Connectivity analyses were performed for
   three functionally distinct striatal seeds (limbic, frontoparietal and
   motor). Functional connectivity with cortical regions of interest was
   assessed for corticostriatal circuit connectivity indices and ratios,
   testing the balance of connectivity between circuits. Results showed
   corticostriatal overconnectivity of limbic and frontoparietal seeds, but
   underconnectivity of motor seeds. Correlations with RBs were found for
   connectivity between the striatal motor seeds and cortical motor
   clusters from the whole-brain analysis, and for frontoparietal/limbic
   and motor/limbic connectivity ratios. Division of ASD participants into
   high (n = 17) and low RB subgroups (n = 19) showed reduced
   frontoparietal/limbic and motor/limbic circuit ratios for high RB
   compared to low RB and TD groups in the right hemisphere. Results
   suggest an association between RBs and an imbalance of corticostriatal
   iFC in ASD, being increased for limbic, but reduced for frontoparietal

Abstract = {{Political conservatism is associated with an increased negativity bias,
   including increased attention and reactivity toward negative and
   threatening stimuli. Although the human amygdala has been implicated in
   the response to threatening stimuli, no studies to date have
   investigated whether conservatism is associated with altered amygdala
   function toward threat. Furthermore, although an influential theory
   posits that connectivity between the amygdala and bed nucleus of the
   stria terminalis (BNST) is important in initiating the response to
   sustained or uncertain threat, whether individual differences in
   conservatism modulate this connectivity is unknown. To test whether
   conservatism is associated with increased reactivity in neural threat
   circuitry, we measured participants' self-reported social and economic
   conservatism and asked them to complete high-resolution fMRI scans while
   under threat of an unpredictable shock and while safe. We found that
   economic conservatism predicted greater connectivity between the BNST
   and a cluster of voxels in the left amygdala during threat vs safety.
   These results suggest that increased amygdala-BNST connectivity during
   threat may be a key neural correlate of the enhanced negativity bias
   found in conservatism.}},

Pages = {{52-62}},

Abstract = {{In social interactions, strategic uncertainty arises when the outcome of
   one's choice depends on the choices of others. An important question is
   whether strategic uncertainty can be resolved by assessing subjective
   probabilities to the counterparts' behavior, as if playing against
   nature, and thus transforming the strategic interaction into a risky
   (individual) situation. By means of functional magnetic resonance
   imaging with human participants we tested the hypothesis that choices
   under strategic uncertainty are supported by the neural circuits
   mediating choices under individual risk and deliberation in social
   settings (i.e. strategic thinking). Participants were confronted with
   risky lotteries and two types of coordination games requiring different
   degrees of strategic thinking of the kind `I think that you think that I
   think etc.' We found that the brain network mediating risk during
   lotteries (anterior insula, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and parietal
   cortex) is also engaged in the processing of strategic uncertainty in
   games. In social settings, activity in this network is modulated by the
   level of strategic thinking that is reflected in the activity of the
   dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These results suggest
   that strategic uncertainty is resolved by the interplay between the
   neural circuits mediating risk and higher order beliefs (i.e. beliefs
   about others' beliefs).}},

Abstract = {{People tell lies not only for their own self-interests but sometimes
   also to help others. Little is known about the ways in which different
   types of goals modulate behaviors and neural responses in deception. The
   present study investigated the neural processes associated with
   spontaneous deception that occurs with altruistic reasons (i.e. the
   money would be donated to charity), self-serving reasons (i.e. the
   participant receives all of the money) and mixed goals (i.e. the money
   would be equally split between the participant and the charity).
   Altruistic motivation for deception reduced the intensity of moral
   conflict and the subsequent mental cost of resolving this conflict,
   reflected by a smaller N2-P3 effect in the purely altruistic condition.
   When making decisions about whether to lie, self-interest was a stronger
   motivator than others' interests, and the participants tended to lie
   more for themselves than for others. When the lie could be mutually
   beneficial for both of the self and others, the participants tended to
   lie even when they knew that they could be easily caught, but they
   actually lied for their own self-interest rather than for altruistic
   reasons. These findings shed light on the neural basis of `good lies'
   and decision-making in mutually beneficial situations.}},

Abstract = {{The frequency-tagging approach has generally been confined to study
   low-level sensory processes and always found related activation over the
   occipital region. Here for the first time, we investigated with it,
   high-level socio-cognitive functions, i.e. the processing of what other
   people are looking at which is referred to as level 1 visual perspective
   taking (VPT). Sixteen participants were presented with visual scenes
   alternating at 2.5 Hz which were depicting a person and an object in a
   room, while recording electrophysiological brain activity. The person
   orientation and object position changed at every stimulus but the person
   in the room always faced the object, except on every fifth stimulus. We
   found responses in the electroencephalography (EEG) spectrum exactly at
   the frequency corresponding to the presentation of the scenes where the
   person could not see the object, i.e. 0.5 Hz. While the 2.5 Hz
   stimulation rate response focused on typical medial occipital sites, the
   specific 0.5 Hz response was found mainly over a centro-parietal region.
   Besides a robust group effect, these responses were significant and
   quantifiable for most individual participants. Overall, these
   observations reveal a clear measure of level 1-VPT representation,
   highlighting the potential of EEG frequency-tagging to capture
   high-level socio-cognitive functions in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{HIV is most prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM), and
   although most MSM use condoms consistently during casual sex, some take
   risks. To better understand the psychology of those risky decisions, we
   examined neural correlates of playing a virtual sexual `hook up' game in
   an functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner in MSM who had, in the
   past 90 days, been sexually risky (N = 76) or safe (N = 31). We found
   that during potentially risky sexual choices, previously risky MSM had
   more right insula activity than previously safe MSM. Real-life sexual
   risk was related to trait positive and negative urgency. Insula activity
   that differentiated risky and safe MSM was related to trait positive and
   negative urgency. Future work should further examine if, and to what
   extent, insula activation during safe sex negotiation drives MSM's rash
   risky sexual decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Social exclusion has been found to impair visual working memory (WM),
   while the underlying neural processes are currently unclear. Using two
   experiments, we tested whether the poor WM performance caused by
   exclusion was due to reduced storage capacity, impaired attentional
   filtering ability or both. The Cyberball game was used to manipulate
   social exclusion. Seventy-four female participants performed WM tasks
   while event-related potentials were recorded. In Experiment 1,
   participants were made to remember the orientations of red rectangles
   while ignoring salient green rectangles. Results showed that exclusion
   impaired the ability to filter out irrelevant items from WM, as
   reflected by the similar contralateral delay activity (CDA) amplitudes
   for one-target-one-distractor condition and two-targets condition, as
   well as the similar CDA amplitudes for two-targets-two-distractors
   condition and four-targets condition in excluded individuals. In
   Experiment 2, participants were asked to remember 1-5 colored squares.
   Results showed that exclusion reduced storage capacity, as the CDA
   amplitudes reached asymptote at loads of two items for exclusion group
   and at loads of three items for inclusion group. Together, these two
   experiments provided complementary evidence that WM deficits caused by
   social exclusion were due to reduced storage capacity and impaired
   attentional filtering ability.}},

Abstract = {{The superior temporal sulcus (STS) is a major component of the human
   face perception network, implicated in processing dynamic changeable
   aspects of faces. However, it remains unknown whether STS holds
   functionally segregated subdivisions for different categories of facial
   movements. We used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) at 7T in 16 volunteers to compare STS activation with faces
   displaying angry or happy expressions, eye-gaze shifts and lip-speech
   movements. Combining univariate and multivariate analyses, we show a
   systematic topological organization within STS, with gaze-related
   activity predominating in the most posterior and superior sector,
   speech-related activity in the anterior sector and emotional expressions
   represented in the intermediate middle STS. Right STS appeared to hold a
   finer functional segregation between all four types of facial movements,
   and best discriminative abilities within the face-selective posterior
   STS (pSTS). Conversely, left STS showed greater overlap between
   conditions, with a lack of distinction between mouth movements
   associated to speech or happy expression and better discriminative
   abilities (for gaze and speech vs emotion conditions) outside pSTS.
   Differential sensitivity to upper (eye) or lower (mouth) facial features
   may contribute to, but does not appear to fully account for, these
   response patterns.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally thought that the effect of acute stress on higher-order
   functions such as working memory is, for an important part, mediated by
   central catecholamine activity. However, little is known about the
   association between neuroendocrine stress responses and
   catecholamine-dependent working memory-related brain function in the
   absence of stress. Here, we investigate for the first time in healthy
   humans (n = 18) how neuroendocrine responses to stress (cortisol and
   alpha-amylase) relate to fronto-parietal working memory activity changes
   in response to atomoxetine, a noradrenaline transporter inhibitor that
   selectively increases extracellular cortical dopamine and noradrenaline.
   We observed positive correlations between stress-induced cortisol
   (Pearson's r = 0.75, P < 0.001) and alpha amylase (r = 0.69, P = 0.02)
   increases and catecholamine-dependent working memory-related activity in
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Stress-induced cortisol increases
   furthermore correlated with supramarginal gyrus working memory-related
   activity (r = 0.79, P < 0.001). Comparing high vs low stress responders
   revealed that these correlations were driven by decreased working memory
   activity on placebo and greater working memory activity increases
   following atomoxetine in high stress responders. These results further
   corroborate the notion that neuroendocrine responses to stress are an
   informative proxy of catecholamine function relevant to higher order
   functions and provide novel hints on the complex relationship between
   acute stress, catecholamine function and working memory.}},

Abstract = {{Maltreatment is associated with increased risk of a range of psychiatric
   disorders, many of which are characterized by altered risk-taking
   propensity. Currently, little is known about the neural correlates of
   risk-taking in children exposed to maltreatment, nor whether their
   risk-taking is atypically modulated by peer influence. Seventy-five 10-
   to 14-year-old children {[}maltreated (MT) group: N = 41; non-maltreated
   Group (NMT): N = 34] performed a Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART),
   under three different peer influence conditions: while alone, while
   being observed by a peer and while being encouraged by a peer to take
   risks. The MT group engaged in less risk-taking irrespective of peer
   influence. There was no differential effect of peer influence on
   risk-taking behaviour across groups. At the neural level, the right
   anterior insula (rAI) exhibited altered risk sensitivity across
   conditions in the MT group. Across groups and conditions, rAI risk
   sensitivity was negatively associated with risk-taking and within the MT
   group greater rAI risk sensitivity was related to more anxiety symptoms.
   These findings suggest that children with a history of maltreatment show
   reduced risk-taking but typical responses to peer influence. Abnormal
   rAI functioning contributes to the pattern of reduced risk-taking and
   may predispose children exposed to maltreatment to develop future
   psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{In the natural world, faces are not isolated objects but are rather
   encountered in the context of the whole body. Previous work has studied
   the perception of combined faces and bodies using behavioural and
   electrophysiological measurements, but the neural correlates of
   emotional face-body perception still remain unexplored. Here, we
   combined happy and fearful faces and bodies to investigate the influence
   of body expressions on the neural processing of the face, the effect of
   emotional ambiguity between the two and the role of the amygdala in this
   process. Our functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses showed that
   the activity in motor, prefrontal and visual areas increases when facial
   expressions are presented together with bodies rather than in isolation,
   consistent with the notion that seeing body expressions triggers both
   emotional and action-related processes. In contrast, psychophysiological
   interaction analyses revealed that amygdala modulatory activity
   increases after the presentation of isolated faces when compared to
   combined faces and bodies. Furthermore, a facial expression combined
   with a congruent body enhanced both cortical activity and amygdala
   functional connectivity when compared to an incongruent face-body
   compound. Finally, the results showed that emotional body postures
   influence the processing of facial expressions, especially when the
   emotion conveyed by the body implies danger.}},

Abstract = {{People tend to be more prosocial after synchronizing behaviors with
   others, yet the underlying neural mechanisms are rarely known. In this
   study, participant dyads performed either a coordination task or an
   independence task, with their brain activations recorded via the
   functional near-infrared spectroscopy hyperscanning technique.
   Participant dyads in the coordination group showed higher synchronized
   behaviors and greater subsequent inclination to help each other than
   those in the independence group, indicating the prosocial effect of
   interpersonal synchrony. Importantly, the coordination group
   demonstrated the significant task-related brain coherence, namely the
   interbrain synchronization, at the left middle frontal area. The
   detected interbrain synchronization was sensitive to shared
   intentionality between participants and was correlated with the mutual
   prosocial inclination. Further, the task-related brain coherence played
   a mediation role in the prosocial effect of interpersonal synchrony.
   This study reveals the relevance of brain-to-brain synchronization among
   individuals with subsequent mutual prosocial inclination and suggests
   the neural mechanism associating with shared cognition for the
   facilitation of interpersonal synchrony on prosociality.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin ( OT) influences other-oriented mental processes ( e.g. trust
   and empathy) and the underlying neural substrates. However, whether and
   how OT modulates self-oriented processes and the underlying brain
   activity remains unclear. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled
   between-subjects design, we manipulated memory encoding and retrieval of
   trait adjectives related to the self, a friend and a celebrity in a
   self-referential task in male adults. Experiment 1 ( N = 51) found that
   OT vs placebo treatments reduced response times during encoding
   self-related trait adjectives but increased recognition scores of
   self-related information during memory retrieval. Experiment 2 ( N = 50)
   showed similar OT effects on response times during encoding self-related
   trait adjectives. Moreover, functional magnetic resonance imaging (
   fMRI) results revealed that OT vs placebo treatments decreased the
   activity in the medial prefrontal cortex ( MPFC) involved in encoding of
   self-related trait adjectives and weakened the coupling between the MPFC
   activity and a cultural trait ( i.e. interdependence). Experiment 3 ( N
   = 52) revealed that OT vs placebo treatments increased the right
   superior frontal activity during memory retrieval of self-related
   information. The results provide behavioral and fMRI evidence for OT
   effects on self-referential processing and suggest distinct patterns of
   OT modulations of brain activities engaged in encoding and retrieval of
   self-related information.}},

Abstract = {{Although theoretical discourse and experimental studies on the self- and
   reward-biases have a long tradition, currently we have only a limited
   understanding of how the biases are represented in the brain and, more
   importantly, how they relate to each other. We used multi-voxel pattern
   analysis to test for common representations of self and reward in
   perceptual matching in healthy human subjects. Voxels across an
   anterior-posterior axis in ventromedial prefrontal cortex ( vmPFC)
   distinguished ( i) self-others and ( ii) high-low reward, but
   cross-generalization between these dimensions decreased from anterior to
   posterior vmPFC. The vmPFC is characterized by a shift from a common
   currency for value to independent, distributed representations of self
   and reward across an anterior-posterior axis. This shift reflected
   changes in functional connectivity between the posterior part of the
   vmPFC and the frontal pole when processing self- associated stimuli, and
   the middle frontal gyrus when processing stimuli associated with high
   reward. The changes in functional connectivity were correlated with
   behavioral biases, respectively, to the self and reward. The distinct
   representations of self and reward in the posterior vmPFC are associated
   with self- and reward-biases in behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the effects of media violence exposure has shown robust
   associations among violent media exposure, increased aggressive
   behavior, and decreased empathy. Preliminary research indicates that
   frequent players of violent video games may have differences in
   emotional and cognitive processes compared to infrequent or nonplayers,
   yet research examining the amount and content of game play and the
   relation of these factors with affective and cognitive outcomes is
   limited. The present study measured neural correlates of response
   inhibition in the context of implicit attention to emotion, and how
   these factors are related to empathic responding in frequent and
   infrequent players of video games with graphically violent content.
   Participants completed a self-report measure of empathy as well as an
   affective stop-signal task that measured implicit attention to emotion
   and response inhibition during electroencephalography. Frequent players
   had lower levels of empathy as well as a reduction in brain activity as
   indicated by P100 and N200/P300 event related potentials. Reduced P100
   amplitude evoked by happy facial expressions was observed in frequent
   players compared to infrequent players, and this effect was moderated by
   empathy, such that low levels of empathy further reduced P100 amplitudes
   for happy facial expressions for frequent players compared to infrequent
   players. Compared to infrequent players, frequent players had reduced
   N200/P300 amplitude during response inhibition, indicating less neural
   resources were recruited to inhibit behavior. Results from the present
   study illustrate that chronic exposure to violent video games modulates
   empathy and related neural correlates associated with affect and
   cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Impulsive aggression is common among military personnel after deployment
   and may arise because of impaired top-down regulation of the amygdala by
   prefrontal regions. This study sought to further explore this hypothesis
   via resting-state functional connectivity analyses in impulsively
   aggressive combat veterans. Male combat veterans with ( n = 28) and
   without ( n = 30) impulsive aggression problems underwent resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Functional connectivity analyses
   were conducted with the following seed-regions: basolateral amygdala (
   BLA), centromedial amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC), and
   anterior insular cortex ( AIC). Regions-of-interest analyses focused on
   the orbitofrontal cortex and periaqueductal gray, and yielded no
   significant results. In exploratory cluster analyses, we observed
   reduced functional connectivity between the ( bilateral) BLA and left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the impulsive aggression group,
   relative to combat controls. This finding indicates that combat-related
   impulsive aggression may be marked by weakened functional connectivity
   between the amygdala and prefrontal regions, already in the absence of
   explicit emotional stimuli. Group differences in functional connectivity
   were also observed between the ( bilateral) ACC and left cuneus, which
   may be related to heightened vigilance to potentially threatening visual
   cues, as well as between the left AIC and right temporal pole, possibly
   related to negative memory association in impulsive aggression.}},

Abstract = {{The activities we choose to spend our leisure time with are
   intrinsically motivating and vary across individuals. Yet it is unknown
   how impulse control or neural activity changes when processing a
   preferred stimulus related to a hobby or interest. Developing a task
   that assesses the response to preferred interests is of importance as it
   would be relevant to a range of psychiatric disorders that have hyper-
   or hypo-arousal to such cues. During functional Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging ( fMRI), 39 healthy adults completed a novel task to test
   approach behavior and cognitive control to cues that were personalized
   to the participants' interests compared to stimuli the participants
   identified as being of non-interest and colored shapes. fMRI results
   showed that cues of one's interest elicited activation in the anterior
   insula compared to colored shapes. Interests did not change inhibition
   compared to non-interests and colored shapes and all stimuli equally
   engaged a frontostriatal circuit. Together the results suggest that
   adults were sensitive to their interests but were effective at
   regulating their impulses towards these cues, a skill that is critical
   for navigating the temptations and distractions in our daily
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{While a persuasion network has been proposed, little is known about how
   network connections between brain regions contribute to attitude change.
   Two possible mechanisms have been advanced. One hypothesis predicts that
   attitude change results from increased connectivity between structures
   implicated in affective and executive processing in response to
   increases in argument strength. A second functional perspective suggests
   that highly arousing messages reduce connectivity between structures
   implicated in the encoding of sensory information, which disrupts
   message processing and thereby inhibits attitude change. However,
   persuasion is a multi-determined construct that results from both
   message features and audience characteristics. Therefore, persuasive
   messages should lead to specific functional connectivity patterns among
   a priori defined structures within the persuasion network. The present
   study exposed 28 subjects to anti-drug public service announcements
   where arousal, argument strength, and subject drug-use risk were
   systematically varied. Psychophysiological interaction analyses provide
   support for the affective-executive hypothesis but not for the
   encoding-disruption hypothesis. Secondary analyses show that video-level
   connectivity patterns among structures within the persuasion network
   predict audience responses in independent samples ( one college-aged,
   one nationally representative). We propose that persuasion neuroscience
   research is best advanced by considering network-level effects while
   accounting for interactions between message features and target audience
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The current study aimed to capture empathy processing in an
   interpersonal context. Mother-adolescent dyads ( N = 22) each completed
   an empathy task during fMRI, in which they imagined the target person in
   distressing scenes as either themselves or their family ( i.e. child for
   the mother, mother for the child). Using multi-voxel pattern approach,
   we compared neural pattern similarity for the self and family conditions
   and found that mothers showed greater perceptual similarity between self
   and child in the fusiform face area ( FFA), representing high self-child
   overlap, whereas adolescents showed significantly less self-mother
   overlap. Adolescents' pattern similarity was dependent upon family
   relationship quality, such that they showed greater self-mother overlap
   with higher relationship quality, whereas mothers' pattern similarity
   was independent of relationship quality. Furthermore, adolescents'
   perceptual similarity in the FFA was associated with increased social
   brain activation ( e.g. temporal parietal junction). Mediation analyses
   indicated that high relationship quality was associated with greater
   social brain activation, which was mediated by greater self-mother
   overlap in the FFA. Our findings suggest that adolescents show more
   distinct neural patterns in perceiving their own vs their mother's
   distress, and such distinction is sensitive to mother-child relationship
   quality. In contrast, mothers' perception for their own and child's
   distress is highly similar and unconditional.}},

Abstract = {{Self-control and the ability to resist temptation are critical for
   successful completion of long-term goals. Contemporary models in
   cognitive neuroscience emphasize the primary role of prefrontal
   cognitive control networks in aligning behavior with such goals. Here,
   we use gaze pattern analysis and dynamic functional connectivity fMRI
   data to explore how individual differences in the ability to resist
   temptation are related to intrinsic brain dynamics of the cognitive
   control and salience networks. Behaviorally, individuals exhibit greater
   gaze distance from target location ( e.g. higher distractibility) during
   presentation of tempting erotic images compared with neutral images.
   Individuals whose intrinsic dynamic functional connectivity patterns
   gravitate toward configurations in which salience detection systems are
   less strongly coupled with visual systems resist tempting distractors
   more effectively. The ability to resist tempting distractors was not
   significantly related to intrinsic dynamics of the cognitive control
   network. These results suggest that susceptibility to temptation is
   governed in part by individual differences in salience network dynamics
   and provide novel evidence for involvement of brain systems outside
   canonical cognitive control networks in contributing to individual
   differences in self-control.}},

Abstract = {{Fluency with simple arithmetic, typically achieved in early elementary
   school, is thought to be one of the building blocks of mathematical
   competence. Behavioral studies with adults indicate that math anxiety (
   feelings of tension or apprehension about math) is associated with poor
   performance on cognitively demanding math problems. However, it remains
   unclear whether there are fundamental differences in how high and low
   math anxious individuals approach overlearned simple arithmetic problems
   that are less reliant on cognitive control. The current study used
   functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural correlates
   of simple arithmetic performance across high and low math anxious
   individuals. We implemented a partial least squares analysis, a
   data-driven, multivariate analysis method to measure distributed
   patterns of whole-brain activity associated with performance. Despite
   overall high simple arithmetic performance across high and low math
   anxious individuals, performance was differentially dependent on the
   fronto-parietal attentional network as a function of math anxiety.
   Specifically, low-compared to high-math anxious individuals perform
   better when they activate this network less-a potential indication of
   more automatic problem-solving. These findings suggest that low and high
   math anxious individuals approach even the most fundamental math
   problems differently.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to form positive mental images may be an important aspect of
   mental health and well-being. We have previously demonstrated that the
   vividness of positive prospective imagery is increased in healthy older
   adults following positive imagery cognitive training. The rostral
   anterior cingulate cortex ( rACC) is involved in the simulation of
   future affective episodes. Here, we investigate the effect of positive
   imagery training on rACC activity during the imagination of novel,
   ambiguous scenarios vs closely matched control training. Seventy-five
   participants received 4 weeks of positive imagery or control training.
   Participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan,
   during which they completed an Ambiguous Sentences Task, which required
   them to form mental images in response to cues describing ambiguous
   social events. rACC activity was positively correlated with the
   pleasantness ratings of images formed. Positive imagery training
   increased rACC and bilateral hippocampal activity compared with the
   control training. Here, we demonstrate that rACC activity during
   positive imagery can be changed by the cognitive training. This is
   consistent with other evidence that this training enhances the vividness
   of positive imagery, and suggests the training may be acting to increase
   the intensity and affective quality of imagery simulating the future.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid extraction of facial identity and emotional expressions is
   critical for adapted social interactions. These biologically relevant
   abilities have been associated with early neural responses on the face
   sensitive N170 component. However, whether all facial expressions
   uniformly modulate the N170, and whether this effect occurs only when
   emotion categorization is task-relevant, is still unclear. To clarify
   this issue, we recorded high-resolution electrophysiological signals
   while 22 observers perceived the six basic expressions plus neutral. We
   used a repetition suppression paradigm, with an adaptor followed by a
   target face displaying the same identity and expression ( trials of
   interest). We also included catch trials to which participants had to
   react, by varying identity ( identity-task), expression (
   expression-task) or both ( dual-task) on the target face. We extracted
   single-trial Repetition Suppression ( stRS) responses using a
   data-driven spatiotemporal approach with a robust hierarchical linear
   model to isolate adaptation effects on the trials of interest.
   Regardless of the task, fear was the only expression modulating the
   N170, eliciting the strongest stRS responses. This observation was
   corroborated by distinct behavioral performance during the catch trials
   for this facial expression. Altogether, our data reinforce the view that
   fear elicits distinct neural processes in the brain, enhancing attention
   and facilitating the early coding of faces.}},

Abstract = {{As models of shared expectations, social norms play an essential role in
   our societies. Since our social environment is changing constantly, our
   internal models of it also need to change. In humans, there is mounting
   evidence that neural structures such as the insula and the ventral
   striatum are involved in detecting norm violation and updating internal
   models. However, because of methodological challenges, little is known
   about the possible involvement of midbrain structures in detecting norm
   violation and updating internal models of our norms. Here, we used

   a norm adaptation paradigm in healthy adults to investigate the role of

Abstract = {{Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT) has been widely used to treat the major
   depressive disorder ( MDD), especially for treatment-resistant
   depression. However, the neuroanatomical basis of ECT remains an open
   problem. In our study, we combined the voxel-based morphology ( VBM),
   resting-state functional connectivity ( RSFC) and granger causality
   analysis ( GCA) to identify the longitudinal changes of structure and
   function in 23 MDD patients before and after ECT. In addition,
   multivariate pattern analysis using linear support vector machine ( SVM)
   was applied to classify 23 depressed patients from 25 gender, age and
   education matched healthy controls. VBM analysis revealed the increased
   gray matter volume of left superficial amygdala after ECT. The following
   RSFC and GCA analyses further identified the enhanced functional
   connectivity between left amygdala and left fusiform face area ( FFA)
   and effective connectivity from FFA to amygdala after ECT, respectively.
   Moreover, SVM-based classification achieved an accuracy of 83.33\%, a
   sensitivity of 82.61\% and a specificity of 84\% by leave-one-out
   cross-validation. Our findings indicated that ECT may facilitate the
   neurogenesis of amygdala and selectively enhance the feedforward
   cortical-subcortical connectivity from FFA to amygdala. This study may
   shed new light on the pathological mechanism of MDD and may provide the
   neuroanatomical basis for ECT.}},

Abstract = {{The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is an important sensorimotor region
   mediating the acquisition of goal-directed instrumental reward learning
   and behavioral flexibility. However, whether the DMS also regulates
   Pavlovian cue-food learning is less clear. The current study used
   excitotoxic lesions to determine whether the DMS is critical in
   Pavlovian appetitive learning and behavior, using discriminative
   conditioning and reversal paradigms. The results showed that DMS lesions
   transiently retarded cue-food learning and subsequent reversal of this
   learning. Rats with DMS lesions selectively attenuated responding to a
   food cue but not a control cue, early in training, suggesting the DMS is
   involved when initial associations are formed. Similarly, initial
   reversal learning was attenuated in rats with DMS lesions, which
   suggests impaired flexibility to adjust behavior when the cue meaning is
   reversed. We also examined the effect of DMS lesions on food intake
   during tests with access to a highly palatable food along with standard
   chow diet. Rats with DMS lesions showed an altered pattern of intake,
   with an initial reduction in high-fat diet followed by an increase in
   chow consumption. These results demonstrate that the DMS has a role in
   mediating cue-food learning and its subsequent reversal, as well as
   changes in food intake when a choice is provided. Together, these
   results demonstrate the DMS is involved in reward associative learning
   and reward consumption, when behavioral flexibility is needed to adjust
   responding or consumption to match the current value.}},

Abstract = {{The midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) coordinates the expression and
   topography of defensive behaviors to threat and also plays an important
   role in Pavlovian fear learning itself. Whereas the role of PAG in the
   expression of defensive behavior is well understood, the relationship
   between the activity of PAG neurons and fear learning, the exact timing
   of PAG contributions to learning during the conditioning trial, and the
   contributions of different PAG columns to fear learning are poorly
   understood. We assessed the effects of optogenetic inhibition of lateral
   (LPAG) and ventrolateral PAG (VLPAG) neurons on fear learning. Using
   adenoassociated viral vectors expressing halorhodopsin, we show that
   brief optogenetic inhibition of LPAG or VLPAG during delivery of the
   shock unconditioned stimulus (US) augments acquisition of contextual or
   cued fear conditioning, and we also show that this inhibition augments
   postencounter defensive responses to a nonnoxious threat. Taken
   together, these results show that LPAG and VLPAG serve a key role in the
   regulation of Pavlovian fear learning at the time of US delivery. These
   findings provide strong support for existing models that state that LPAG
   and VLPAG contribute to a fear prediction error signal determining
   variations in the effectiveness of the aversive US in supporting
   learning.}},

Abstract = {{Physical exercise in rodents has repeatedly been shown to trigger
   positive effects on brain function, including increased neurotrophic
   factors and improved learning and memory. However, most of this work has
   focused on the adult hippocampus and hippocampal-dependent behavior.
   Here we examined the effect of running wheel exercise in adult and
   adolescent male rats on ABA renewal of extinguished instrumental
   conditioning, in which acquisition occurs in Context A, extinction in
   Context B, and renewal testing occurs back in Context A. In the first
   experiment, rats were given unlocked (exercise) or locked (no exercise)
   running wheel access in their home cages beginning at postnatal Day 30
   (adolescent) or postnatal Day 56 (adult). Rats underwent lever-press
   acquisition in Context A and extinction in Context B. ABA renewal
   testing took place 2 weeks after the start of running wheel exposure.
   Nonexercising adolescent rats showed greater ABA renewal than
   nonexercising adult rats and exercise reduced ABA renewal in adolescents
   but not adults. ABA renewal depends on medial prefrontal cortex
   function. In a second experiment, we compared adolescent and adult
   apical dendrite branch length, branch number, and spine density of
   medial prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons after 2 weeks of unlocked or
   locked running wheel access. The results revealed a higher density of
   dendritic spines and a lower dendritic branch length in adolescent
   exercisers than adolescent nonexercisers. Adult exercisers and
   nonexercisers did not differ. Collectively, these experiments suggest
   that exercise may have particularly strong effects on adolescent medial
   prefrontal cortex function and structure.}},

Abstract = {{The current study applied a rodent-based Morris water maze (MWM)
   protocol to an investigation of search performance differences between
   young and older adult humans. To investigate whether similar age-related
   decline in search performance could be seen in humans based on the
   rodent-based protocol, we implemented a virtual MWM (vMWM) that has
   characteristics similar to those of the MWM used in previous studies of
   spatial learning in mice. Through the use of a proximity to platform
   measure, robust differences were found between healthy young and older
   adults in search performance. After dividing older adults into good and
   poor performers based on a median split of their corrected cumulative
   proximity values, the age effects in place learning were found to be
   largely related to search performance differences between the young and
   poor-performing older adults. When compared with the young,
   poor-performing older adults exhibited significantly higher proximity
   values in 83\% of 24 place trials and overall in the probe trials that
   assessed spatial learning in the absence of the hidden platform. In
   contrast, good-performing older adults exhibited patterns of search
   performance that were comparable with that of the younger adults in most
   place and probe trials. Taken together, our findings suggest that the
   low search accuracy in poor-performing older adults stemmed from
   potential differences in strategy selection, differences in assumptions
   or expectations of task demands, as well as possible underlying
   functional and/or structural changes in the brain regions involved in
   vMWM search performance.}},

Volume = {{131}},

Abstract = {{Age-related decrements in cognitive ability have been proposed to stem
   from deteriorating function of the hippocampus. Many birds are long
   lived, especially for their relatively small body mass and elevated
   metabolism, making them a unique model of resilience to aging.
   Nevertheless, little is known about avian age-related changes in
   cognition and hippocampal physiology. We studied spatial cognition and
   hippocampal expression of the age-related gene, Apolipoprotein D (ApoD),
   and the immediate early gene Egr-1 in zebra finches at various
   developmental time points. In a first experiment, middle-aged adult
   males outperformed middle-aged females in learning correct food
   locations in a four-arm maze, but all birds remembered the task equally
   well after a 5- or 10-day delay. In a second experiment comparing young
   and old birds, aged birds showed minimal evidence for deterioration in
   spatial cognition or motivation relative to young birds, except that
   aged females showed less rapid gains in accuracy during spatial learning
   than young females. These findings indicate that sex differences in
   hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and decline with age are
   phylogenetically conserved. With respect to hippocampal gene expression,
   adult females expressed Egr-1 at significantly greater levels than males
   after memory retrieval, perhaps reflecting a neurobiological
   compensation. Contrary to mammals, ApoD expression was elevated in young
   zebra finches compared with aged birds. This may explain the near
   absence of decrements in spatial memory due to age, possibly indicating
   an alternative mechanism of managing oxidative stress in aged birds.}},

Abstract = {{Social isolation can be used to study behavioral, neural, and hormonal
   mechanisms that regulate interactions in social animals. Although
   isolation effects have been reported in social mammals and various fish
   species, systematic studies with isolated zebrafish are rare. Here, the
   authors examined behavior (social and nonsocial), physiological stress
   (whole-body cortisol levels), and neurochemicals (serotonin, dopamine,
   and their metabolites), following acute and chronic social isolation in
   adult zebrafish. To observe how isolated fish respond behaviorally to
   social stimuli, they exposed zebrafish to live conspecifics or animated
   images after acute (24 hr) or chronic (6 months) social isolation. The
   authors observed that isolation did not affect locomotor activity, but
   acute isolation had weak nonsignificant anxiogenic effects in adult
   zebrafish. They also found that all isolated fish responded to both live
   and animated social stimuli, and the stress hormone, cortisol was lower
   in chronically isolated fish. Finally, neurochemical analyses showed
   that serotonin levels increased when fish were exposed to social
   stimulus after acute isolation, but its metabolite 5HIAA decreased in
   response to social stimulus following both acute and chronic isolation.
   Levels of both dopamine and its metabolite DOPAC were also reduced in
   fish exposed to social stimulus after acute and chronic isolation.
   Overall, these results show that isolation in zebrafish is an effective
   tool to study fundamental mechanisms controlling social interaction at
   behavioral and physiological levels.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy, the ability to understand others' emotions, can occur through
   perspective taking and experience sharing. Neural systems active when
   adults empathize include regions underlying perspective taking (e.g.
   medial prefrontal cortex; MPFC) and experience sharing (e.g. inferior
   parietal lobule; IPL). It is unknown whether adolescents utilize
   networks implicated in both experience sharing and perspective taking
   when accurately empathizing. This question is critical given the
   importance of accurately understanding others' emotions for developing
   and maintaining adaptive peer relationships during adolescence. We
   extend the literature on empathy in adolescence by determining the
   neural basis of empathic accuracy, a behavioral assay of empathy that
   does not bias participants toward the exclusive use of perspective
   taking or experience sharing. Participants (N = 155, aged 11.1-15.5
   years) watched videos of `targets' describing emotional events and
   continuously rated the targets' emotions during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging scanning. Empathic accuracy related to activation in
   regions underlying perspective taking (MPFC, temporoparietal junction
   and superior temporal sulcus), while activation in regions underlying
   experience sharing (IPL, anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula)
   related to lower empathic accuracy. These results provide novel insight
   into the neural basis of empathic accuracy in adolescence and suggest
   that perspective taking processes may be effective for increasing
   empathy.}},

Abstract = {{Social neuroscience uses increasingly complex paradigms to improve
   ecological validity, as investigating aggressive interactions with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Standard analyses for fMRI
   data typically use general linear models (GLM), which require a priori
   models of task effects on neural processes. These may inadequately model
   non-stimulus-locked or temporally overlapping cognitive processes, as
   mentalizing about other agents. We used the data-driven approach of
   independent component analysis (ICA) to investigate neural processes
   involved in a competitive interaction. Participants were confronted with
   an angry-looking opponent while having to anticipate the trial outcome
   and the opponent's behaviour. We show that several spatially distinctive
   neural networks with associated temporal dynamics were modulated by the
   opponent's facial expression. These results dovetail and extend the main
   effects observed in the GLM analysis of the same data. Additionally, the
   ICA approach identified effects of the experimental condition on neural
   systems during inter-trial intervals. We demonstrate that cognitive
   processes during aggressive interactions are poorly modelled by simple
   stimulus onset/duration variables and instead have more complex temporal
   dynamics. This highlights the utility of using data-driven analyses to
   elucidate the distinct cognitive processes recruited during complex
   social paradigms.}},

Abstract = {{Fear generalization is a prominent feature of anxiety disorders and
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is defined as enhanced fear
   responding to a stimulus that bears similarities, but is not identical
   to a threatening stimulus. Pattern separation, a hippocampal-dependent
   process, is critical for stimulus discrimination; it transforms similar
   experiences or events into non-overlapping representations. This study
   is the first in humans to investigate the extent to which fear
   generalization relies on behavioral pattern separation abilities.
   Participants (N = 46) completed a behavioral task taxing pattern
   separation, and a neuroimaging fear conditioning and generalization
   paradigm. Results show an association between lower behavioral pattern
   separation performance and increased generalization in shock expectancy
   scores, but not in fear ratings. Furthermore, lower behavioral pattern
   separation was associated with diminished recruitment of the subcallosal
   cortex during presentation of generalization stimuli. This region showed
   functional connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex and ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex. Together, the data provide novel experimental
   evidence that pattern separation is related to generalization of threat
   expectancies, and reduced fear inhibition processes in frontal regions.
   Deficient pattern separation may be critical in overgeneralization and
   therefore may contribute to the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders and
   PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{Social value orientation (SVO) is a stable personality trait that
   reflects how people evaluate interdependent outcomes for themselves and

   two types: proselfs and prosocials. The present study examined how SVO
   affects the processing of outcome evaluation temporally using the

   participated in a simple gambling task in which they received outcome
   distributions for themselves and others. The results showed that for the
   self outcomes, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) was more negative
   for self-loss than self-gain, and the P3 and late positive component
   (LPC) was larger for self-gain than self-loss in both prosocial and
   proself groups. For the other outcomes, however, the FRN, P3 and LPC
   were sensitive to other's gain and loss only in the prosocial group but
   not in the proself group. These findings suggest that outcomes for

Abstract = {{The role of neuromodulators in the enforcement of cooperation is still
   not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that intranasal applied
   oxytocin, an important hormone for modulating social behavior, enhances
   the inclination to sanction free-riders in a social dilemma situation.
   Contrary to the notion of oxytocin being a pro-social hormone, we found
   that participants treated with oxytocin exhibited an amplification of
   self-reported negative social emotions such as anger towards
   free-riders, ultimately resulting in higher magnitude and frequency of
   punishment of free-riders compared to placebo. Furthermore, we found
   initial evidence that oxytocin contributes to the positive effects of a
   punishment institution by rendering cooperation preferable in the
   oxytocin condition for even the most selfish players when punishment was
   available. Together, these findings imply that the neural circuits
   underlying altruistic punishment are partly targeted by the oxytonergic
   system and highlight the importance of neuromodulators in group cohesion
   and norm enforcement within social groups.}},

Abstract = {{To what extent is the mirror neuron mechanism malleable to experience?
   The answer to this question can help characterising its ontogeny and its
   role in social cognition. Some suggest that it develops through
   sensorimotor associations congruent with our own actions. Others argue
   for its extreme volatility that will encode any sensorimotor association
   in the environment. Here, we added to this debate by exploring the
   effects of short goal-directed `mirror' and `counter-mirror' trainings
   (a `mirror' training is defined as the first type of training
   encountered by the participants) on human auditory mirror motor-evoked
   potentials (MEPs). We recorded MEPs in response to two tones void of
   previous motor meaning, before and after mirror and counter-mirror
   trainings in which participants generated two tones of different pitch
   by performing free-choice button presses. The results showed that mirror
   MEPs, once established, were protected against an equivalent
   counter-mirror experience: they became manifest very rapidly and the
   same number of training trials that lead to the initial association did
   not suffice to reverse the MEP pattern. This steadiness of the
   association argues that, by serving direct-matching purposes, the mirror
   mechanism is a good solution for social cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Pre-electoral surveys typically attempt, and sometimes fail, to predict
   voting behavior on the basis of explicit measures of agreement or
   disagreement with a candidate or political position. Here, we assessed
   whether a specific brain signature of disagreement with one's social
   values, the event-related potential component N400, could be predictive
   of voting behavior. We examined this possibility in the context of the
   EU referendum in the UK. In the 5 weeks preceding the referendum, we
   recorded the N400 while participants with different vote intentions
   expressed their agreement or disagreement with pro- and against-EU
   statements. We showed that the N400 responded to statements incongruent
   with one's view regarding the EU. Crucially, this effect predicted
   actual voting behavior in decided as well as undecided voters. The N400
   was a better predictor of voting choice than an explicit index of
   preference based on the behavioral responses. Our findings demonstrate
   that well-defined patterns of brain activity can forecast future voting
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained anticipatory anxiety is central to Generalized Anxiety
   Disorder (GAD). During anticipatory anxiety, phasic threat responding
   appears to be mediated by the amygdala, while sustained threat
   responding seems related to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
   (BNST). Although sustained anticipatory anxiety in GAD patients was
   proposed to be associated with BNST activity alterations, firm evidence
   is lacking. We aimed to explore temporal characteristics of BNST and
   amygdala activity during threat anticipation in GAD patients. Nineteen
   GAD patients and nineteen healthy controls (HC) underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a temporally unpredictable
   threat anticipation paradigm. We defined phasic and a systematic
   variation of sustained response models for blood oxygen level-dependent
   responses during threat anticipation, to disentangle temporally
   dissociable involvement of the BNST and the amygdala. GAD patients
   relative to HC responded with increased phasic amygdala activity to
   onset of threat anticipation and with elevated sustained BNST activity
   that was delayed relative to the onset of threat anticipation. Both the
   amygdala and the BNST displayed altered responses during threat
   anticipation in GAD patients, albeit with different time courses. The
   results for the BNST activation hint towards its role in sustained
   threat responding, and contribute to a deeper understanding of
   pathological sustained anticipatory anxiety in GAD.}},

Abstract = {{A recent debate about Theory of Mind (ToM) concerns whether spontaneous
   and explicit mentalizing are based on the same mechanisms. However, only
   a few neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural bases of
   spontaneous ToM, with inconsistent results. The present study had two
   goals: first, to investigate whether the right Temporo-Parietal Junction
   (rTPJ) is crucially involved in spontaneous ToM and second, to gain
   insight into the role of the rTPJ in ToM. For the first time, we applied
   rTMS to the rTPJ while participants were engaged in a spontaneous false
   belief task. Participants watched videos of a scene including an agent
   who acquires a true or false belief about the location of an object. At
   the end of the movie, participants reacted to the presence of the
   object. Results show that, during stimulation of the control site, RTs
   were affected by both the participant's expectations and the belief of
   the agent. Stimulation of the rTPJ significantly modulated task
   performance, supporting the idea that spontaneous ToM, as well as
   explicit ToM, relies on TPJ activity. However, we did not observe a
   disruption of the representation of the agent's belief. Rather, the
   stimulation interfered with participant's predictions, supporting the
   idea that rTPJ is crucially involved in self-other distinction.}},

Abstract = {{Borderline personality disorder (BPD) patients' hypersensitivity for
   emotionally relevant stimuli has been suggested be due to abnormal
   activity and connectivity in (para-)limbic and prefrontal brain regions
   during stimulus processing. The neuropeptide oxytocin has been shown to
   modulate activity and functional connectivity in these brain regions,
   thereby optimizing the processing of emotional and neutral stimuli. To
   investigate whether oxytocin would be capable of attenuating BPD
   patients' hypersensitivity for such stimuli, we recorded brain activity
   and gaze behavior during the processing of complex scenes in 51 females
   with and 48 without BPD after intranasal application of either oxytocin
   or placebo. We found divergent effects of oxytocin on BPD and healthy
   control (HC) participants' (para-)limbic reactivity to emotional and
   neutral scenes: Oxytocin decreased amygdala and insula reactivity in BPD
   participants but increased it in HC participants, indicating an
   oxytocin-induced normalization of amygdala and insula activity during
   scene processing. In addition, oxytocin normalized the abnormal coupling
   between amygdala activity and gaze behavior across all scenes in BPD
   participants. Overall, these findings suggest that oxytocin may be
   capable of attenuating BPD patients' hypersensitivity for complex
   scenes, irrespective of their valence.}},

Abstract = {{Limb apraxia (LA) is a high-order motor disorder linked to
   left-hemisphere damage. It is characterized by defective execution of
   purposeful actions upon delayed imitation, or verbal command when the
   actions are performed in isolated, non-naturalistic, conditions. Whether
   interpersonal interactions provide social affordances that activate
   neural resources different from those requested by individual action
   execution, which may improve LA performance, is unknown. To fill this
   gap, we measured interaction performance, behavioral and kinematic
   indexes of left-brain damaged patients with/without LA in a social
   reach-to-grasp task involving two different degrees of spatio-temporal
   interactivity with an avatar. We found that LA patients' impairment in
   coordinating with the virtual partner was abolished in highly
   interactive conditions (where patients selected their actions on-line
   based on the behavior of the virtual partner) with respect to low
   interactive conditions (where actions were selected beforehand based on
   abstract instructions). Voxel-based-Lesion-Symptom-Mapping indicated
   that impairments in low-interactive conditions were underpinned by
   lesions of premotor, motor and insular areas, and of the basal ganglia.
   Our approach expands current understanding of the behavioral and neural
   correlates of interactive motor performance by highlighting the
   important role of social affordances, and provides novel, potentially
   important, views on rehabilitation of higher-order motor cognition
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Rumination and cognitive reactivity (dysfunctional cognitions after sad
   mood-induction) remain high in remitted Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
   and can contribute to new episodes. These factors have been linked to
   increased fMRI resting-state functional-connectivity within the
   Default-Mode Network (DMN). It remains unclear whether (I) increased
   DMN-connectivity persists during MDD-remission, and (II) whether sad
   mood-induction differentially affects DMN-connectivity in remitted-MDD
   vs controls. Moreover, DMN-connectivity studies in remitted-MDD were
   previously confounded by antidepressant-use. Sixty-two MDD-patients
   remitted from a parts per thousand<yen>2 episodes,
   psychotropic-medication free, and 41 controls, participated in two 5-min
   neutral and sad mood-inductions by autobiographical-recall and
   neutral/sad music, each followed by 8-min resting-state fMRI-scanning.
   We identified DMN-components using Independent Component Analysis and
   entered subject- and sessions-specific components into a repeated
   measures analysis of variance. Connectivity-differences were extracted
   and correlated with baseline cognitive reactivity and rumination as
   measures of vulnerability for recurrence. After sad vs neutral
   mood-induction, controls, but not remitted-MDD, showed an increase in
   connectivity between the posterior-DMN and a cluster consisting mostly
   of the hippocampus (P = 0.006). Less posterior-DMN-hippocampal
   connectivity was associated with higher cognitive reactivity (r = -0.21,
   P = 0.046) and rumination (r = -0.27, P = 0.017). After recalling sad
   autobiographical-memories, aberrant posterior-DMN-hippocampal
   connectivity, associated with cognitive reactivity and rumination,
   remains a neural vulnerability in MDD-remission.}},

   associated with a loud noise burst (threat) or not (non-threat). Results
   demonstrated attentional capture across all conditions as evidenced by
   the typical reaction time costs of the distractor. However, only after
   inhibitory rTMS to the right PPC reaction time cost in the threatening
   distractor condition was increased relative to the non-threatening
   distractor condition, suggesting that attention lingered longer on the
   threatening distractor. We propose that the right PPC is involved in
   disengagement of attention from emotionally salient stimuli in order to
   re-orient attention to task relevant stimuli and may have implications
   for anxiety disorders associated with difficulties to disengage from
   threatening stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Developing a better understanding of how and under what circumstances
   alcohol affects the emotions, cognitions and neural functions that
   precede and contribute to dangerous behaviors during intoxication may
   help to reduce their occurrence. Alcohol intoxication has recently been
   shown to reduce defensive reactivity and anxiety more during uncertain
   vs certain threat. However, alcohol's effects on emotionally motivated
   attention to these threats are unknown. Alcohol may disrupt both
   affective response to and attentional processing of uncertain threats
   making intoxicated individuals less able to avoid dangerous and costly
   behaviors. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of a broad
   range of blood alcohol concentrations on 96 participants' sub-cortically
   mediated defensive reactivity (startle potentiation), retrospective
   subjective anxiety (self-report) and cortically assessed emotionally
   motivated attention (probe P3 event related potential) while they
   experienced visually cued uncertain and certain location electric shock
   threat. As predicted, alcohol decreased defensive reactivity and
   subjective anxiety more during uncertain vs certain threat. In a novel
   finding, alcohol dampened emotionally motivated attention during
   uncertain but not certain threat. This effect appeared independent of
   alcohol's effects on defensive reactivity and subjective anxiety. These
   results suggest that alcohol intoxication dampens processing of
   uncertain threats while leaving processing of certain threats intact.}},

Abstract = {{The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is a collection of brain regions best
   known for their role in perception, memory, and emotional behavior.
   Within the MTL, the perirhinal cortex (PRh) plays a critical role in
   perceptual representation and recognition memory, although its
   contribution to emotional regulation is still debated. Here, rhesus
   monkeys with neonatal perirhinal lesions (Neo-PRh) and controls (Neo-C)
   were tested on the Human Intruder (HI) task at 2 months, 4.5 months, and
   5 years of age to assess the role of the PRh in the development of
   emotional behaviors. The HI task presents a tiered social threat to
   which typically developing animals modulate their emotional responses
   according to the level of threat. Unlike animals with neonatal amygdala
   or hippocampal lesions, Neo-PRh animals were not broadly hyper- or
   hyporesponsive to the threat presented by the HI task as compared with
   controls. Instead, Neo-PRh animals displayed an impaired ability to
   modulate their freezing and anxiety-like behavioral responses according
   to the varying levels of threat. Impaired transmission of perceptual
   representation generated by the PRh to the amygdala and hippocampus may
   explain the animals' inability to appropriately assess and react to
   complex social stimuli. Neo-PRh animals also displayed fewer hostile
   behaviors in infancy and more coo vocalizations in adulthood. Neither
   stress-reactive nor basal cortisol levels were affected by the Neo-PRh
   lesions. Overall, these results suggest that the PRh is indirectly
   involved in the expression of emotional behavior and that effects of
   Neo-PRh lesions are dissociable from neonatal lesions to other temporal
   lobe structures.}},

Abstract = {{We administered a stop-change paradigm, an extended version of the stop
   task that requires (a) stopping an ongoing motor response and (b)
   changing to an alternative (change) response. Performance of a group of
   patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) and taking dopaminergic
   medication was compared with that of matched healthy control (HC)
   participants. Behavioral results indicated that response latencies to
   the initial go signal did not distinguish between the 2 groups, but that
   stopping latencies were prolonged in PD patients. In addition, the
   change response was delayed in the clinical group, indicating
   difficulties in flexibly changing to alternative motor actions upon
   external cues. The change deficit in PD related to the inhibition
   deficit. This dependence points to a serial processing architecture in
   PD according to which the stopping process has to finish before the
   change process can be initiated. In contrast, the HC group showed
   parallel stop and change processing. Analyses of sequential trial
   effects suggest that both HC and PD patients are susceptible to
   aftereffects of action override, due to the consequences of the
   automatic retrieval of recent associations between action and goal
   representations. Interestingly, postchange performance of the clinical
   group was hampered disproportionately, suggesting that PD is associated
   with an impairment in overriding previously formed action-goal
   associations. These findings support the notion that both higher-order
   cognitive control processes, such as inhibiting and changing actions, as
   well as lower-order feature binding mechanisms rely on basal ganglia
   functioning and are compromised by the basal ganglia dysfunction caused
   by PD.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of work has implicated the ventral striatum (VS) in aspects
   of reinforcement learning (RL). However, less work has directly examined
   the effects of lesions in the VS, or other forms of inactivation, on
   2-armed bandit RL tasks. We have recently found that lesions in the VS
   in macaque monkeys affect learning with stochastic schedules but have
   minimal effects with deterministic schedules. The reasons for this are
   not currently clear. Because our previous work used short intertrial
   intervals, one possibility is that the animals were using working memory
   to bridge stimulus-reward associations from 1 trial to the next. In the
   present study, we examined learning of 60 pairs of objects, in which the
   animals received only 1 trial per day with each pair. The large number
   of object pairs and the long interval (approximately 24 hr) between
   trials with a given pair minimized the chances that the animals could
   use working memory to bridge trials. We found that monkeys with VS
   lesions were unimpaired relative to controls, which suggests that
   animals with VS lesions can still learn to select rewarded objects even
   when they cannot make use of working memory.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) has been implicated in impulsive choice,
   as measured in delay discounting. The role of dopamine (DA) in impulsive
   choice has received considerable attention, whereas glutamate (Glu) has
   recently been shown to be an important mediator of discounting. However,
   research has not examined how DA or Glu receptors in NAcc mediate
   different aspects of delay discounting performance, that is, (a)
   sensitivity to reinforcer magnitude and (b) sensitivity to delayed
   reinforcement. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were first trained in a
   delay discounting task, in which the delay to a large magnitude food
   reinforcer increased across blocks of trials. Following behavioral
   training, rats received bilateral implantation of guide cannulas into
   NAcc. Half of the rats (n = 12) received infusions of the DA-selective
   ligands SKF 38393 (D-1-like agonist: 0.03 or 0.1 mu g), SCH 23390
   (D-1-like antagonist: 0.3 or 1.0 mu g), quinpirole (D-2-like agonist:
   0.3 or 1.0 mu g), and eticlopride (D-2-like antagonist: 0.3 or 1.0 mu
   g). The other half received infusions of the ionotropic Glu ligands
   MK-801 (NMDA uncompetitive antagonist: 0.3 or 1.0 mu g), AP-5 (NMDA
   competitive antagonist: 0.3 or 1.0 mu g), ifenprodil (noncompetitive
   antagonist at NR2B-containing NMDA receptors: 0.3 or 1.0 mu g), and CNQX
   (AMPA competitive antagonist: 0.2 or 0.5 mu g). Results showed that SCH
   23390 (0.3 mu g) decreased sensitivity to reinforcer magnitude without
   altering impulsive choice, whereas ifenprodil (1.0 mu g) decreased
   sensitivity to delayed reinforcement (i.e., impulsive choice). The
   current results show that DA and NMDA receptors in NAcc mediate distinct
   aspects of discounting performance.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the behavioral effects of scopolamine on rats that bar
   pressed for trains of electrically stimulating pulses under concurrent
   variable interval schedules of reward. For the first half of the session
   (30 min) a 1:4 ratio in the programmed number of stimulation trains
   delivered at each option was in effect. At the start of the second half
   of the session, an unsignaled reversal in the relative train number
   (4:1) occurred. We tracked the relative magnitude of reward estimated
   for each contiguous pair of reinforced visits to competing options.
   Scopolamine hydrobromide led to a reduction in the relative magnitude of
   reward. A similar result was obtained in a follow-up test in which
   relative magnitude was manipulated by varying the pulse frequency of
   stimulation, while equating the train number at each option. The effect
   of scopolamine hydrobromide could not be attributed to undermatching,
   side bias, nor to an effect of scopolamine on the reward integration
   process. When the same rats were treated with scopolamine methylbromide,
   no effects on matching behavior were observed. Our results suggest a
   cholinergic basis for the computation of choice variables related to
   matching behavior.}},

   region (5-HTTLPR) has been connected to decision making, suggesting that
   short-allele carriers (s) are more risk averse than long-allele
   homozygotes (ll). However, previous research has not identified if this
   occurs because s-carriers (i) are more sensitive to the uncertainty of
   the outcomes or (ii) are more sensitive to the magnitude of the
   outcomes. This issue was disentangled using a willingness-to-pay task,
   where the participants evaluated prospects involving certain gains,
   uncertain gains, and ambiguous gains. The results clearly favored the
   hypothesis that s-carriers react more to the magnitude of the outcomes.
   Self-reported measures of everyday risk-taking behavior also favored
   this hypothesis. We discuss how these results are in line with recent
   research on the serotonergic impact on reward processing.}},

Abstract = {{Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from trauma- and
   stressor-related disorders. The development of improved therapeutic
   interventions is contingent upon a more complete grasp of both the
   neural and behavioral dynamics of the stress response in females. The
   rodent forced swim test (FST) is a valuable animal model for exploring
   the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for selection of active and
   passive responses to inescapable stressors, but it is often neglected in
   2-day FST studies is the dissociation of innate (Day 1) versus learned
   (Day 2) coping responses. Here, we used a modified, long-term (4-week)
   FST paradigm and immunohistological analysis to study the interactions
   of sex, strain, and housing arrangement on selection of active and
   passive coping strategies in Sprague Dawley (SD) and Long Evans (LE)
   rats. We observed significant strain x sex interactions in both forced
   swim sessions with respect to both passive (immobility) and active
   (climbing and headshakes) responses. In immobility measures, we observed
   stable sex differences in SD rats and a stable lack of sex differences
   in LE rats across tests. In addition, both SD and LE females displayed
   significantly more headshakes than males during Test 1 and more climbing
   in Test 2. Most notably, males, but not females, exhibited a cross-test
   increase in immobility, suggesting that males and females may engage
   different learning processes in a 2-day FST. These sex differences
   corresponded to c-fos expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),
   indicating that the mPFC may contribute to sexually dimorphic behavior
   in the FST.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have found that in mature animals habituation is

   contextual information to rapidly habituate their freezing response to a
   series of sudden acoustic stimuli. Our study is the 1st to show
   context-specific habituation in this avian species, a result in
   agreement with those of previous findings in adult male zebra finches
   (Taeniopygia guttata). Furthermore, although our study does not intend
   to provide a systematic investigation of the ontogeny of habituation in
   this species, our findings show that a few days after hatching, juvenile
   chicks are capable of a sophisticated associative learning process that
   takes into account complex environmental information.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to adaptively regulate emotion is essential for mental and

   terms their behavioral characteristics, underlying psychological
   processes and supporting neural systems. A key feature of this
   multi-level framework is its conceptualization of the psychological
   processes in terms of two orthogonal dimensions that describe (i) the
   nature of the emotion regulation goal (ranging from to implicit to
   explicit) and (ii) the nature of the emotion change process (ranging
   from more automatic to more controlled). After describing the core
   elements of the framework, we use it to review human and animal research

Abstract = {{Although managing social information and decision making on the basis of
   reward is critical for survival, it remains uncertain whether differing
   reward type is processed in a uniform manner. Previously, we
   demonstrated that monetary reward and the social reward of good
   reputation activated the same striatal regions including the caudate
   nucleus and putamen. However, it remains unclear whether overlapping
   activations reflect activities of identical neuronal populations or two
   overlapping but functionally independent neuronal populations. Here, we
   re-analyzed the original data and addressed this question using
   multivariate-pattern-analysis and found evidence that in the left
   caudate nucleus and bilateral nucleus accumbens, social vs monetary
   reward were represented similarly. The findings suggest that social and
   monetary rewards are processed by the same population of neurons within
   these regions of the striatum. Additional findings demonstrated similar
   neural patterns when participants experience high social reward compared
   to viewing others receiving low social reward (potentially inducing
   schadenfreude). This is possibly an early indication that the same
   population of neurons may be responsible for processing two different
   types of social reward (good reputation and schadenfreude). These
   findings provide a supplementary perspective to previous research,
   helping to further elucidate the mechanisms behind social vs non-social
   reward processing.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothalamic peptide oxytocin (OT) is crucial in social adaptation
   and used to treat emotional and social deficits. Here, we conducted a
   systematic, quantitative meta-analysis of functional-MRI studies
   intranasally administering OT (IN-OT) to uncover neural substrates
   underlying the IN-OT effects and to elucidate differential IN-OT effects
   between healthy and clinical populations. Meta-analyses were conducted
   on 66 IN-OT fMRI studies, stratified by psychopathology, valence and
   sex. IN-OT increased bilateral amygdala, caudate head, and superior
   temporal activity in healthy individuals and increased dorsal anterior
   cingulate activity in patients. Moreover, IN-OT decreased amygdala
   activity in both patients and healthy individuals but did so to a
   greater degree in patients than healthy individuals. The OT-increased
   amygdala activity was only found on the negative social and affective
   processes, whereas the OT-decreased amygdala activity was mainly
   contributed by contrasts on negative-valenced processes. IN-OT increased
   parahippocampal activity and decreased amygdala activity during negative
   socio-affective processing. During positive socio-affective processes,
   IN-OT increased caudate head activity. This study indicates convergent
   neural substrates and the underlying neuropsychological mechanisms for
   IN-OT effects on social and affective processes. The common and
   different effects of IN-OT on patients and healthy individuals and the
   modulation of OT effects by valence have critical implications.}},

Abstract = {{Strong social ties correspond with better health and well being, but the
   neural mechanisms linking social contact to health remain speculative.
   This study extends work on the social regulation of brain activity by
   supportive handholding in 110 participants (51 female) of diverse racial
   and socioeconomic origins. In addition to main effects of social
   regulation by handholding, we assessed the moderating effects of both
   perceived social support and relationship status (married, cohabiting,
   dating or platonic friends). Results suggest that, under threat of
   shock, handholding by familiar relational partners attenuates both
   subjective distress and activity in a network associated with salience,
   vigilance and regulatory self-control. Moreover, greater perceived
   social support corresponded with less brain activity in an extended
   network associated with similar processes, but only during partner
   handholding. In contrast, we did not observe any regulatory effects of
   handholding by strangers, and relationship status did not moderate the
   regulatory effects of partner handholding. These findings suggest that
   contact with a familiar relational partner is likely to attenuate
   subjective distress and a variety of neural responses associated with
   the presence of threat. This effect is likely enhanced by an
   individual's expectation of the availability of support from their wider

Abstract = {{People generally prefer rewards sooner rather than later. This
   phenomenon, temporal discounting, underlies many societal problems,
   including addiction and obesity. One way to reduce temporal discounting
   is to imagine positive future experiences. Since there is overlap in the
   neural circuitry associated with imagining future experiences and
   remembering past events, here we investigate whether recalling positive
   memories can also promote more patient choice. We found that
   participants were more patient after retrieving positive
   autobiographical memories, but not when they recalled negative memories.
   Moreover, individuals were more impulsive after imagining novel positive
   scenes that were not related to their memories, showing that positive
   imagery alone does not drive this effect. Activity in the striatum and
   temporo parietal junction during memory retrieval predicted more patient
   choice, suggesting that to the extent that memory recall is rewarding
   and involves perspective-taking, it influences decision-making.
   Furthermore, representational similarity in the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex between memory recall and decision phases correlated with the
   behavioral effect across participants. Thus, we have identified a novel
   manipulation for reducing temporal discounting-remembering the positive
   past-and have begun to characterize the psychological and neural
   mechanisms behind}},

Abstract = {{The subthalamic nucleus (STN) occupies a strategic position in the motor
   network, slowing down responses in situations with conflicting
   perceptual input. Recent evidence suggests a role of the STN in emotion
   processing through strong connections with emotion recognition
   structures. As deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the STN in patients with
   Parkinson's disease (PD) inhibits monitoring of perceptual and
   value-based conflict, STN DBS may also interfere with emotional conflict
   processing. To assess a possible interference of STN DBS with emotional
   conflict processing, we used an emotional Stroop paradigm. Subjects
   categorized face stimuli according to their emotional expression while
   ignoring emotionally congruent or incongruent superimposed word labels.
   Eleven PD patients ON and OFF STN DBS and eleven age-matched healthy
   subjects conducted the task. We found conflict-induced response slowing
   in healthy controls and PD patients OFF DBS, but not ON DBS, suggesting
   STN DBS to decrease adaptation to within-trial conflict. OFF DBS,
   patients showed more conflict induced slowing for negative conflict
   stimuli, which was diminished by STN DBS. Computational modelling of STN
   influence on conflict adaptation disclosed DBS to interfere via
   increased baseline activity.}},

Abstract = {{Postpartum depression may disrupt socio-affective neural circuitry and
   compromise provision of positive parenting. Although work has evaluated
   how parental response to negative stimuli is related to caregiving,
   research is needed to examine how depressive symptoms during the
   postpartum period may be related to neural response to positive stimuli,
   especially positive faces, given depression's association with biased
   processing of positive faces. The current study examined the association
   between neural response to adult happy faces and observations of
   maternal caregiving and the moderating role of postpartum depression, in
   a sample of 18-to 22-year old mothers (n = 70) assessed at 17 weeks
   (s.d. = 4.7 weeks) postpartum. Positive caregiving was associated with
   greater precuneus and occipital response to positive faces among mothers
   with lower depressive symptoms, but not for those with higher symptoms.
   For mothers with higher depressive symptoms, greater ventral and dorsal
   striatal response to positive faces was associated with more positive
   caregiving, whereas the opposite pattern emerged for mothers with lower
   symptoms. There was no association between negative caregiving and
   neural response to positive faces or negative faces. Processing of
   positive stimuli may be an important prognostic target in mothers with
   depressive symptoms, given its link with healthy caregiving behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout history and into the modern era, human groups have been
   continually subjected to a wide range of societal threats, from natural
   disasters to pandemics to terrorism. Yet despite this fundamental aspect
   of human existence, there has been little research on how societal
   threat affects social coordination at both the neural and the behavioral
   level. Here, we show for the first time that individuals are better able
   to coordinate under high societal threat as compared to low or no threat
   (Experiment 1). Using a method of hyperscanning electroencephalography
   (EEG), which simultaneously measures brain activity among interacting
   subjects, we further illustrate that interbrain synchrony of gamma band
   oscillations is enhanced when people are under high threat, and
   increased gamma interbrain synchrony is associated with lower dyadic
   interpersonal time lag (i.e. higher coordination) (Experiment 2). To our
   knowledge, the current work provides some of the first empirical
   evidence that gamma interbrain synchrony is associated with social
   coordination when humans are under threat.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined as an individual's capacity to
   accurately perceive, understand, reason about, and regulate emotions,
   and to apply that information to facilitate thought and achieve goals.
   Although EI plays an important role in mental health and success in
   academic, professional and social realms, the neurocircuitry underlying
   this capacity remains poorly characterized, and no study to date has yet
   examined the relationship between EI and intrinsic neural network
   function. Here, in a sample of 54 healthy individuals (28 women, 26
   men), we apply independent components analysis (ICA) with dual
   regression to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired
   while subjects were resting in the scanner to investigate brain circuits
   (intrinsic resting state networks) whose activity is associated with
   greater self-reported (i.e. Trait) and objectively measured (i.e.
   Ability) EI. We show that higher Ability EI, but not Trait EI, is
   associated with stronger negatively correlated spontaneous fMRI signals
   between the basal ganglia/limbic network (BGN) and posterior default
   mode network (DMN), and regions involved in emotional processing and
   regulation. Importantly, these findings suggest that the functional
   connectivity within and between intrinsic networks associated with
   mentation, affective regulation, emotion processing, and reward are
   strongly related to ability EI.}},

Abstract = {{This study used an emotional go/no-go task to explore inhibitory
   spillover (how intentional cognitive inhibition `spills over' to inhibit
   neural responses to affective stimuli) within 23 adolescents.
   Adolescents were shown emotional faces and asked to press a button
   depending on the gender of the face. When asked to inhibit with
   irrelevant affective stimuli present, adolescents recruited prefrontal
   cognitive control regions (rIFG, ACC) and ventral affective areas
   (insula, amygdala). In support of the inhibitory spillover hypothesis,
   increased activation of the rIFG and down-regulation of the amygdala
   occurred during negative, but not positive, inhibition trials compared
   with go trials. Functional connectivity analysis revealed coupling of
   the rIFG pars opercularis and ventral affective areas during negative
   no-go trials. Age was negatively associated with activation in frontal
   and temporal regions associated with inhibition and sensory integration.
   Internalizing symptoms were positively associated with increased
   bilateral IFG, ACC, putamen and pallidum. This is the first study to
   test the inhibitory spillover emotional go/no-go task within
   adolescents, who may have difficulties with inhibitory control, and to
   tie it to internalizing symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{The attitude towards one's own imperfection strongly varies between
   individuals. Here, we investigated variations in error related activity
   depending on two sub-traits of perfectionism, Personal Standard
   Perfectionism (PSP) and Evaluative Concern Perfectionism (ECP) in a
   large scale functional magnetic resonance imaging study (N = 75) using a
   digit-flanker task. Participants with higher PSP scores showed both more
   post-error slowing and more neural activity in the medial-frontal gyrus
   including anterior cingulate cortex after errors. Interestingly, high-EC
   perfectionists with low PSP showed no post-error slowing and the highest
   activity in the middle frontal gyrus, whereas high-EC perfectionists
   with high PSP showed the lowest activity in this brain area and more
   post-error slowing. Our findings are in line with the hypothesis that
   perfectionists with high concerns but low standards avoid performance
   monitoring to avoid the worry-inducing nature of detecting personal
   failure and the anticipation of poor evaluation by others. However, the
   stronger goal-oriented performance motivation of perfectionists with
   high concerns and high standards may have led to less avoidance of error
   processing and a more intense involvement with the imperfect behaviour,
   which is essential for improving future performance.}},

Abstract = {{Dopaminergic pathways play a crucial role in reward processing, and
   advanced age can modulate its efficiency. DARPP-32 controls dopaminergic
   function and is a chemical nexus of reward processing. In 61 younger
   (20-30 years) and older adults (54\% female) (65-74 years), we examined
   how blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activation to emotional faces,
   vary over genotypes at three single nucleotide polymorphism(SNPs),
   coding for DARPP-32 (rs879606; rs907094; 3764352). We also assessed
   age-magnification of DARPP-32 effects on BOLD activation. We found that
   major homozygote G, T or A genotypes, with higher cortical expression of
   DARPP-32, higher dopamine receptor efficacy, and greater bias toward
   positive cues, had increased functional connectivity in
   cortical-subcortical circuits in response to happy faces, engaging the
   dorsal prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), fusiform gyrus (FG) and the midbrain
   (MB). Local BOLD response to happy faces in FG, and MB was age
   dependent, so that older carriers of the major G, T or A alleles showed
   lesser activation than minor genotypes. These genetic variants of
   DARPP-32 did not modulate BOLD response to angry faces, or engagement of
   the inferior occipital gyrus, to happy or angry faces. Taken together
   our results lend support for a potential role of DARPP-32 genetic
   variants in neural response to potential reward triggering cues.}},

Abstract = {{Altered performance monitoring has been demonstrated after
   administration of different pharmacological compounds and in various
   clinical populations, such as excessive neurophysiological responses to
   mistakes in anxiety disorders. Here, a novel social pharmacological
   approach was applied to investigate whether oxytocin administration (24
   IU) enhances performance monitoring for errors that have negative
   consequences for another individual, so-called social mistakes. Healthy
   male volunteers (N = 24) participated in a placebo-controlled crossover
   design. EEG measures were obtained while pairs of participants performed
   a speeded choice reaction-time task in an individual and social context.
   Following oxytocin administration, error-related negativity amplitudes
   were increased for social compared with individual mistakes. This
   increase was not found in the placebo condition. No effects of oxytocin
   were present in the individual context. The current study shows that
   oxytocin enhances performance monitoring specifically for social
   mistakes. This outcome is in line with a presumed role for oxytocin in
   salience attribution to social cues and underlines its
   context-dependency. Combining these processes may thus open up new
   research avenues and advance our understanding of individual differences
   in performance monitoring and oxytocin responses from a social
   neurocognitive, pharmacological and clinical perspective.}},

Abstract = {{What is a good life and how it can be achieved is one of the fundamental
   issues. When considering a good life, there is a division between
   hedonic (pleasure attainment) and eudaimonic well-being (meaning
   pursuing and self-realization). However, an integrated approach that can
   compare the brain functional and structural differences of these two
   forms of well-being is lacking. Here, we investigated how the individual
   tendency to eudaimonic well-being relative to hedonic wellbeing,
   measured using eudaimonic and hedonic balance (EHB) index, is reflected
   in the functional and structural features of a key network of
   well-being-the default mode network (DMN). We found that EHB was
   positively correlated with functional connectivity of bilateral ventral
   medial prefrontal cortex within anterior DMN and bilateral precuneus
   within posterior DMN. Brain morphometric analysis showed that EHB was
   also positively correlated with gray matter volume in left precuneus.
   These results demonstrated that the relative dominance of one form of
   well-being to the other is reflected in the morphometric characteristics
   and intrinsic functions of DMN.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we conducted the first study to explore how motivations expressed
   through speech are processed in real-time. Participants listened to
   sentences spoken in two types of well-studied motivational tones
   (autonomy-supportive and controlling), or a neutral tone of voice. To
   examine this, listeners were presented with sentences that either
   signaled motivations through prosody (tone of voice) and words
   simultaneously (e.g. `You absolutely have to do it my way' spoken in a
   controlling tone of voice), or lacked motivationally biasing words (e.g.
   `Why don't we meet again tomorrow' spoken in a motivational tone of
   voice). Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) in response to motivations
   conveyed through words and prosody showed that listeners rapidly
   distinguished between motivations and neutral forms of communication as
   shown in enhanced P2 amplitudes in response to motivational when
   compared with neutral speech. This early detection mechanism is argued
   to help determine the importance of incoming information. Once assessed,
   motivational language is continuously monitored and thoroughly
   evaluated. When compared with neutral speech, listening to controlling
   (but not autonomy-supportive) speech led to enhanced late potential ERP
   mean amplitudes, suggesting that listeners are particularly attuned to
   controlling messages. The importance of controlling motivation for
   listeners is mirrored in effects observed for motivations expressed
   through prosody only. Here, an early rapid appraisal, as reflected in
   enhanced P2 amplitudes, is only found for sentences spoken in
   controlling (but not autonomy-supportive) prosody. Once identified as
   sounding pressuring, the message seems to be preferentially processed,
   as shown by enhanced late potential amplitudes in response to
   controlling prosody. Taken together, results suggest that motivational
   and neutral language are differentially processed; further, the data
   suggest that listening to cues signaling pressure and control cannot be
   ignored and lead to preferential, and more in-depth processing
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Gray's Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) asserts three core
   personality systems: the behavioral approach system (BAS), the
   fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS) and the revised behavioral inhibition
   system (r-BIS). Past models of frontal activity link greater relative
   left frontal activity with Carver and White's (1994) BAS scale and trait
   impulsivity and greater relative right frontal activity with Carver and
   White's (1994) BIS scale. However, the original BIS scale assesses both
   FFFS and r-BIS. Past work linking the BIS scale and right frontal
   activity does not indicate which system is related to right frontal
   activity. The current study (n = 182) examined frontal asymmetric
   activity with personality traits associated with approach (BAS),
   withdrawal (FFFS-Fear), behavioral inhibition (BIS-Anxiety) and
   impulsivity (UPPS-P). Resting frontal cortical activity was recorded
   using electroencephalography (EEG), and the traditional alpha band was
   examined. Greater BIS-Anxiety related to greater relative right frontal
   activity. Impulsivity related to less relative right frontal activity.
   BAS and FFFS-Fear (approach and withdrawal motivation) did not relate to
   asymmetric frontal activity. Regulatory control processes associated
   with r-BIS and impulsivity, rather than withdrawal motivation associated
   with FFFS, may be more closely related to right frontal activity.}},

Abstract = {{A long-standing literature implicates activity within the default mode
   network (DMN) to processes linked to the self. However, contemporary
   work suggests that other large-scale networks networks might also be
   involved. For instance, goal-directed autobiographical planning requires
   positive functional connectivity (FC) between DMN and frontoparietal
   control (FPCN) networks. The present study examined the
   inter-relationship between trait self-focus (measured via a
   self-consciousness scale; SCS), incidental memory in a self-reference
   paradigm, and resting state FC of large-scale networks. Behaviourally,
   we found that private SCS was linked to stronger incidental memory for
   self-relevant information. We also examined how patterns of FC differed
   according to levels of self-consciousness by using the SCS data to drive
   multiple regression analyses with seeds from the DMN, the FPCN and the
   limbic network. High levels of SCS was not linked to differences in the
   functional behaviour of the DMN, however, it was linked to stronger FC
   between FPCN and a cluster extending into the hippocampus, which meta
   analytic decoding using Neurosynth linked to episodic memory retrieval.
   Subsequent analysis demonstrated that trait variance in this pattern of
   FC was a moderator for the observed relationship between private SCS and
   enhanced memory for self-items. Together these findings suggest that
   interactions between the FPCN and hippocampus may support the memory
   advantage of self-relevant information associated with SCS and confirm
   theoretical positions that argue that that self-related processing does
   not simply depend upon the DMN, but instead relies on complex patterns
   of interactions between multiple large-scale networks.}},

Abstract = {{In intertemporal choices between immediate and delayed rewards, people
   tend to prefer immediate rewards, often even when the delayed reward is
   larger. This is known as temporal discounting. It has been proposed that
   this tendency emerges because immediate rewards are more emotionally
   arousing than delayed rewards. However, in our previous research, we
   found no evidence for this but instead found that arousal responses
   (indexed with pupil dilation) in intertemporal choice are
   context-dependent. Specifically, arousal tracks the subjective value of
   the more variable reward option in the paradigm, whether it is immediate
   or delayed. Nevertheless, people tend to choose the less variable option
   in the choice task. In other words, their choices are
   reference-dependent and depend on variance in their recent history of
   offers. This suggests that there may be a causal relationship between
   reference-dependent choice and arousal, which we investigate here by
   reducing arousal pharmacologically using propranolol. Here, we show that
   propranolol reduces reference-dependence, leading to choices that are
   less influenced by recent history and more internally consistent.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge about interactions between reward and negative processing is
   rudimentary. Here, we employed functional MRI to probe how potential
   reward signaled by advance cues alters aversive distractor processing
   during perception. Behaviorally, the influence of aversive stimuli on
   task performance was reduced during the reward compared to no-reward
   condition. In the brain, at the task phase, paralleling the observed
   behavioral pattern, we observed significant interactions in the anterior
   insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, such that responses during
   the negative (vs neutral) condition were reduced during the reward
   compared to no-reward condition. Notably, negative distractor processing
   in the amygdala appeared to be independent of the reward manipulation.
   During the initial cue phase, we observed increased reward-related
   responses in the ventral striatum/accumbens, which were correlated with
   behavioral interference scores at the subsequent task phase, revealing
   that participants with increased reward-related responses exhibited a
   greater behavioral benefit of reward in reducing the adverse effect of
   negative images. Furthermore, during processing of reward (vs no-reward)
   cues, the ventral striatum exhibited stronger functional connectivity
   with fronto-parietal regions important for attentional control.
   Together, our findings contribute to the understanding of how potential
   reward influences attentional control and reduces negative distractor
   processing in the human brain.}},

Abstract = {{Deficits in theory of mind (ToM) are common after neurological insult
   acquired in the first and second decade of life, however the
   contribution of large-scale neural networks to ToM deficits in children
   with brain injury is unclear. Using paediatric traumatic brain injury
   (TBI) as a model, this study investigated the sub-acute effect of
   paediatric traumatic brain injury on grey-matter volume of three
   large-scale, domain-general brain networks (the Default Mode Network,
   DMN; the Central Executive Network, CEN; and the Salience Network, SN),
   as well as two domain-specific neural networks implicated in
   social-affective processes (the Cerebro-Cerebellar Mentalizing Network,
   CCMN and the Mirror Neuron/Empathy Network, MNEN). We also evaluated
   prospective structure-function relationships between these large-scale
   neural networks and cognitive, affective and conative ToM. 3D T1-
   weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences were acquired sub-acutely
   in 137 children {[}TBI: n = 103; typically developing (TD) children: n =
   34]. All children were assessed on measures of ToM at 24-months
   post-injury. Children with severe TBI showed sub-acute volumetric
   reductions in the CCMN, SN, MNEN, CEN and DMN, as well as reduced
   grey-matter volumes of several hub regions of these neural networks.
   Volumetric reductions in the CCMN and several of its hub regions,
   including the cerebellum, predicted poorer cognitive ToM. In contrast,
   poorer affective and conative ToM were predicted by volumetric
   reductions in the SN and MNEN, respectively. Overall, results suggest
   that cognitive, affective and conative ToM may be prospectively
   predicted by individual differences in structure of different neural
   systems-the CCMN, SN and MNEN, respectively. The prospective
   relationship between cerebellar volume and cognitive ToM outcomes is a
   novel finding in our paediatric brain injury sample and suggests that
   the cerebellum may play a role in the neural networks important for ToM.
   These findings are discussed in relation to neurocognitive models of
   ToM. We conclude that detection of sub-acute volumetric abnormalities of
   large-scale neural networks and their hub regions may aid in the early
   identification of children at risk for chronic social-cognitive
   impairment.}},

Abstract = {{The nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell lies anatomically at a critical
   intersection within the brain's reward system circuitry, however, its
   role in voluntary choice behavior remains unclear. Rats with
   electrolytic lesions in the NAc shell were tested in a novel foraging
   paradigm. Over a continuous two-week period they freely chose among four
   nutritionally identical but differently flavored food pellets by
   pressing corresponding levers. We examined the lesion's effects on three
   behavioral dynamics components: motivation (when to eat), preference
   bias (what to choose) and persistence (how long to repeat the same
   choice). The lesion led to a marked increase in the preference bias:
   i.e., increased selection of the most-preferred choice option, and
   decreased selection of the others. We found no effects on any other
   behavioral measures, suggesting no effect on motivation or choice
   persistence. The results implicate the NAc shell in moderating the
   instrumental valuation process by inhibiting excessive bias toward
   preferred choice options.}},

Abstract = {{Affect labeling (putting feelings into words) is a form of incidental
   emotion regulation that could underpin some benefits of expressive
   writing (i.e. writing about negative experiences). Here, we show that
   neural responses during affect labeling predicted changes in
   psychological and physical well-being outcome measures 3 months later.
   Furthermore, neural activity of specific frontal regions and amygdala
   predicted those outcomes as a function of expressive writing. Using
   supervised learning (support vector machines regression), improvements
   in four measures of psychological and physical health (physical
   symptoms, depression, anxiety and life satisfaction) after an expressive
   writing intervention were predicted with an average of 0.85\% prediction
   error {[}root mean square error (RMSE) \%]. The predictions were
   significantly more accurate with machine learning than with the
   conventional generalized linear model method (average RMSE: 1.3\%).
   Consistent with affect labeling research, right ventrolateral prefrontal
   cortex (RVLPFC) and amygdalae were top predictors of improvement in the
   four outcomes. Moreover, RVLPFC and left amygdala predicted benefits due
   to expressive writing in satisfaction with life and depression outcome
   measures, respectively. This study demonstrates the substantial merit of
   supervised machine learning for real-world outcome prediction in social
   and affective neuroscience.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing emotional dynamics in the brain offers insight into the
   fundamental neural and psychological mechanisms underlying emotion. One
   such dynamic is emotional inertia-the influence of one's emotional state
   at one time point on one's emotional state at a subsequent time point.
   Emotion inertia reflects emotional rigidity and poor emotion regulation
   as evidenced by its relationship to depression and neuroticism. In this
   study, we assessed changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) from before to
   after an emotional task and used these changes to predict stress,
   positive and negative emotional inertia in daily life events. Cerebral
   blood flow changes in the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) predicted
   decreased non-specific emotional inertia, suggesting that the lPFC may
   feature a general inhibitory mechanism responsible for limiting the
   impact that an emotional state from one event has on the emotional state
   of a subsequent event. CBF changes in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   and lateral occipital cortex were associated with positive emotional
   inertia and negative/stress inertia, respectively. These data advance
   the blossoming literature on the temporal dynamics of emotion in the
   brain and on the use of neural indices to predict mental health-relevant
   behavior in daily life.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research suggests that exposure to early life stress (ELS)
   affects the structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus (UF), a
   frontolimbic white matter tract that undergoes protracted development
   throughout adolescence. Adolescence is an important transitional period
   characterized by the emergence of internalizing psychopathology such as
   anxiety, particularly in individuals with high levels of stress
   sensitivity. We examined the relations among sensitivity to ELS,
   structural integrity of the UF, and anxiety symptoms in 104 early
   adolescents. We conducted structured interviews to assess exposure to
   ELS and obtained subjective and objective ratings of stress severity,
   from which we derived an index of ELS sensitivity. We also acquired
   diffusion MRI and conducted deterministic tractography to visualize UF
   trajectories and to compute measures of structural integrity from three
   distinct segments of the UF: frontal, insular, temporal. We found that
   higher sensitivity to ELS predicted both reduced fractional anisotropy
   in right frontal UF and higher levels of anxiety symptoms. These
   findings suggest that fibers in frontal UF, which are still developing
   throughout adolescence, are most vulnerable to the effects of heightened
   sensitivity to ELS, and that reduced structural integrity of frontal UF
   may underlie the relation between early stress and subsequent
   internalizing psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional stimuli attract attention and lead to increased activity in
   the visual cortex. The present study investigated the impact of personal
   relevance on emotion processing by presenting emotional words within
   sentences that referred to participants' significant others or to
   unknown agents. In event-related potentials, personal relevance
   increased visual cortex activity within 100 ms after stimulus onset and
   the amplitudes of the Late Positive Complex (LPC). Moreover, personally
   relevant contexts gave rise to augmented pupillary responses and higher
   arousal ratings, suggesting a general boost of attention and arousal.
   Finally, personal relevance increased emotion-related ERP effects
   starting around 200 ms after word onset; effects for negative words
   compared to neutral words were prolonged in duration. Source
   localizations of these interactions revealed activations in prefrontal
   regions, in the visual cortex and in the fusiform gyrus. Taken together,
   these results demonstrate the high impact of personal relevance on
   reading in general and on emotion processing in particular.}},

Abstract = {{Having a depressed mother is one of the strongest predictors for
   developing depression in adolescence. Given the role of aberrant reward
   processing in the onset and maintenance of depression, we examined the
   association between mothers' and their daughters' neural response to the
   anticipation of reward and loss. Fifteen non-depressed mothers with a
   history of recurrent depression and their never-disordered daughters,
   and 23 mothers without past or current depression and their
   never-disordered daughters, underwent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging while performing the monetary incentive delay task. To assess
   mother-daughter concordance, we first identified ROIs involved in the
   anticipation of reward and loss across all mother-daughter pairs. Within
   each of these ROIs, we examined the association between mothers' and
   daughters' neural response, and the interaction between group status and
   mothers' neural response in predicting daughters' neural response. We
   found a significant association between mothers' and daughters' putamen
   response to the anticipation of loss, regardless of mother's depression
   history. Furthermore, pubertal stage moderated the association between
   mother-daughter putamen concordance. Our findings suggest a unique role
   of the putamen in the maternal transmission of reward learning and have
   important implications for understanding disorders characterized by
   disturbances in reward learning and processing, such as major
   depression.}},

Abstract = {{Pedophilia is a sexual preference that is often associated with child
   sex offending (CSO). Sexual urges towards prepubescent children and
   specifically acting upon those urges are universally regarded as
   immoral. However, up until now, it is completely unknown whether moral
   processing of sexual offenses is altered in pedophiles. A total of 31
   pedophilic men and 19 healthy controls were assessed by using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in combination with a moral judgment
   paradigm consisting of 36 scenarios describing different types of
   offenses.
   Scenarios depicting sexual offenses against children compared to those
   depicting adults were associated with higher pattern of activation in
   the left temporo-parietal-junction (TPJ) and left posterior insular
   cortex, the posterior cingulate gyrus as well as the precuneus in
   controls relative to pedophiles, and vice versa. Moreover, brain
   activation in these areas were positively associated with ratings of
   moral reprehensibility and negatively associated with decision
   durations, but only in controls. Brain activation, found in key areas
   related to the broad network of moral judgment, theory of mind and
   (socio-)moral disgust - point to different moral processing of sexual
   offenses in pedophilia in general. The lack of associations between
   brain activation and behavioral responses in pedophiles further suggest
   a biased response pattern or dissected implicit valuation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathy comprises interpersonal, affective, lifestyle and antisocial
   facets that vary dimensionally in the population and are associated with
   criminal offending and adverse psychosocial outcomes. Evidence
   associating these facets with white matter microstructure of the
   uncinate fasciculus and the cingulum tracts is inconsistent and derives
   principally from studies of male offenders. In a sample of 99 young
   women presenting a range of scores on the Psychopathy Checklist:
   Screening Version, we used Diffusion Tensor Imaging, tractography and
   Tract-Based Spatial Statistics to investigate microstructure across the
   brain and of the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum. Right uncinate
   fasciculus microstructure was negatively associated with the
   interpersonal facet, while cingulum integrity was not associated with
   any facet of psychopathy. Whole-brain analyses revealed that both
   affective and lifestyle facets were negatively correlated with white
   matter microstructure adjacent to the fusiform gyrus, and the
   interpersonal facet correlated negatively with the integrity of the
   fornix. Findings survived adjustment for the other facet scores, and
   age, verbal and performance IQ. A similar negative association between
   the interpersonal facet and uncinate fasciculus integrity was previously
   observed in male offenders. Thus, previous evidence showing that
   psychopathic traits are associated with functional and structural
   abnormalities within limbic networks may also apply to females.}},

Abstract = {{Negative emotionality (NE) refers to individual differences in the
   propensity to experience and react with negative emotions and is
   associated with increased risk of psychological disorder. However,
   research on the neural bases of NE has focused almost exclusively on
   amygdala activity during emotional face processing. This study broadened
   this framework by examining the relationship between observed NE in
   early childhood and subsequent neural responses to emotional faces in
   both the amygdala and the fusiform face area (FFA) in a late
   childhood/early adolescent sample. Measures of NE were obtained from
   children at age 3 using laboratory observations, and functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected when these children were
   between the ages of 9 and 12 while performing a visual stimulus identity
   matching task with houses and emotional faces as stimuli. Multiple
   regression analyses revealed that higher NE at age 3 is associated with
   significantly greater activation in the left amygdala and left FFA but
   lower functional connectivity between these two regions during the face
   conditions. These findings suggest that those with higher early NE have
   subsequent alterations in both activity and connectivity within an
   extended network during face processing.}},

Abstract = {{The lateral habenula plays a central role in reward and punishment
   processing and has been suggested to drive the cardinal symptom of
   anhedonia in depression. This hypothesis is largely based on
   observations of habenula hypermetabolism in animal models of depression,
   but the activity of habenula and its relationship with clinical symptoms
   in patients with depression remains unclear. High-resolution functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modelling were used
   to investigate the activity of the habenula during a probabilistic
   reinforcement learning task with rewarding and punishing outcomes in 21
   unmedicated patients with major depression and 17 healthy participants.
   High-resolution anatomical scans were also acquired to assess group
   differences in habenula volume. Healthy individuals displayed the
   expected activation in the left habenula during receipt of punishment
   and this pattern was confirmed in the computational analysis of
   prediction error processing. In depressed patients, there was a trend
   towards attenuated left habenula activation to punishment, while greater
   left habenula activation was associated with more severe depressive
   symptoms and anhedonia. We also identified greater habenula volume in
   patients with depression, which was associated with anhedonic symptoms.
   Habenula dysfunction may contribute to abnormal response to punishment
   in patients with depression, and symptoms such as anhedonia.}},

Abstract = {{The framing effect refers the tendency to be risk-averse when options
   are presented positively but be risk-seeking when the same options are
   presented negatively during decision-making. This effect has been found
   to be modulated by the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) and the
   catechol-o-methyltransferase gene (COMT) polymorphisms, which are on the
   dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways and which are associated with
   affective processing. The current study aimed to identify new genetic
   variations of genes on dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways that may
   contribute to individual differences in the susceptibility to framing.
   Using genome-wide association data and the gene-based principal
   components regression method, we examined genetic variations of 26 genes
   on the pathways in 1317 Chinese Han participants. Consistent with
   previous studies, we found that the genetic variations of the SLC6A4
   gene and the COMT gene were associated with the framing effect. More
   importantly, we demonstrated that the genetic variations of the
   aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase (DDC) gene, which is involved in the
   synthesis of both dopamine and serotonin, contributed to individual
   differences in the susceptibility to framing. Our findings shed light on
   the understanding of the genetic basis of affective decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is a key hub of the `social
   brain', but little is known about specific processes supported by this
   region. Using focal high-definition transcranial direct current
   stimulation (HD-tDCS) and a social cognitive battery with differing
   demands on self-other processing, we demonstrate specific involvement of
   the dmPFC in tasks placing high demands on self-other processing.
   Specifically, excitatory (anodal) HD-tDCS enhanced the integration of
   external information into the self for explicit higher-order
   socio-cognitive tasks across cognitive domains; i.e. visual perspective
   taking (VPT) and episodicmemory. These effects were task specific, as no
   stimulation effects were found for attributingmental states from the
   eyes or implicit VPT. Inhibitory (cathodal) HD-tDCS had weaker effects
   in the opposite direction towards reduced integration of external
   information into the self. We thus demonstrate for the first time a
   specific and causal role of the dmPFC in integrating higher-order
   information from others/external source into that of the self across
   cognitive domains.}},

Abstract = {{People frequently engage in more prosocial behavior toward members of
   their own groups, as compared to other groups. Such group-based
   prosociality may reflect either strategic considerations concerning
   one's own future outcomes or intrinsic value placed on the outcomes of
   in-group members. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment,
   we examined vicarious reward responses to witnessing the monetary gains
   of in-group and out-group members, as well as prosocial behavior towards
   both types of individuals. We found that individuals' investment in
   their group-a motivational component of social identification-tracked
   the intensity of their responses in ventral striatum to in-group (vs
   out-group) members' rewards, as well as their tendency towards
   group-based prosociality. Individuals with strong motivational
   investment in their group preferred rewards for an in-group member,
   whereas individuals with low investment preferred rewards for an
   out-group member. These findings suggest that the motivational
   importance of social identity-beyond mere similarity to group
   members-influences vicarious reward and prosocial behavior. More
   broadly, these findings support a theoretical framework in which salient
   social identities can influence neural representations of subjective
   value, and suggest that social preferences can best be understood by
   examining the identity contexts in which they unfold.}},

Abstract = {{It is a common experience-and well established experimentally-that music
   can engage us emotionally in a compelling manner. The mechanisms
   underlying these experiences are receiving increasing scrutiny. However,
   the extent to which other domains of aesthetic experience can similarly
   elicit strong emotions is unknown. Using psychophysiology, neuroimaging
   and behavioral responses, we show that recited poetry can act as a
   powerful stimulus for eliciting peak emotional responses, including
   chills and objectively measurable goosebumps that engage the primary
   reward circuitry. Importantly, while these responses to poetry are
   largely analogous to those found for music, their neural underpinnings
   show important differences, specifically with regard to the crucial role
   of the nucleus accumbens. We also go beyond replicating previous
   music-related studies by showing that peak aesthetic pleasure can
   co-occur with physiological markers of negative affect. Finally, the
   distribution of chills across the trajectory of poems provides insight
   into compositional principles of poetry.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental aspect of behavior in many animal species is `social
   facilitation', the positive effect of the mere presence of conspecifics
   on performance. To date, the neuronal counterpart of this ubiquitous
   phenomenon is unknown. We recorded the activity of single neurons from
   two prefrontal cortex regions, the dorsolateral part and the anterior
   cingulate cortex in monkeys as they performed a visuomotor task, either
   in the presence of a conspecific (Presence condition) or alone. Monkeys
   performed better in the presence condition than alone (social
   facilitation), and analyses of outcome-related activity of 342
   prefrontal neurons revealed that most of them (86\%) were sensitive to
   the performance context. Two populations of neurons were discovered:
   `social neurons', preferentially active under social presence and
   `asocial neurons', preferentially active under social isolation. The
   activity of these neurons correlated positively with performance only in
   their preferred context (social neurons under social presence; asocial
   neurons under social isolation), thereby providing a potential neuronal
   mechanism of social facilitation. More generally, the fact that
   identical tasks recruited either social or asocial neurons depending on
   the presence or absence of a conspecific also brings a new look at the
   social brain hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional experiences are frequently shaped by the emotional responses
   of co-present others. Research has shown that people constantly monitor
   and adapt to the incoming social-emotional signals, even without
   face-to-face interaction. And yet, the neural processes underlying such
   emotional transmissions have not been directly studied. Here, we
   investigated how the human brain processes emotional cues which arrive
   from another, co-attending individual. We presented continuous emotional
   feedback to participants who viewed a movie in the scanner. Participants
   in the social group (but not in the control group) believed that the
   feedback was coming from another person who was co-viewing the same
   movie. We found that social-emotional feedback significantly affected
   the neural dynamics both in the core affect and in the medial prefrontal
   regions. Specifically, the response time-courses in those regions
   exhibited increased similarity across recipients and increased neural
   alignment with the timeline of the feedback in the social compared with
   control group. Taken in conjunction with previous research, this study
   suggests that emotional cues from others shape the neural dynamics
   across the whole neural continuum of emotional processing in the brain.
   Moreover, it demonstrates that interpersonal neural alignment can serve
   as a neural mechanism through which affective information is conveyed
   between individuals.}},

Abstract = {{According to theories of emotion dynamics, emotions unfold across two
   phases in which different types of processes come to the fore: emotion
   onset and emotion offset. Differences in onset-bound processes are
   reflected by the degree of explosiveness or steepness of the response at
   onset, and differences in offset-bound processes by the degree of
   accumulation or intensification of the subsequent response. Whether
   onset-and offset-bound processes have distinctive neural correlates and,
   hence, whether the neural basis of emotions varies over time, still
   remains unknown. In the present fMRI study, we address this question
   using a recently developed paradigm that allows to disentangle
   explosiveness and accumulation. Thirty-one participants were exposed to
   neutral and negative social feedback, and asked to reflect on its
   contents. Emotional intensity while reading and thinking about the
   feedback was measured with an intensity profile tracking approach. Using
   non-negative matrix factorization, the resulting profile data were
   decomposed in explosiveness and accumulation components, which were
   subsequently entered as continuous regressors of the BOLD response. It
   was found that the neural basis of emotion intensity shifts as emotions
   unfold over time with emotion explosiveness and accumulation having
   distinctive neural correlates.}},

Abstract = {{Time-dependent variability in mood and anxiety suggest that related
   neural phenotypes, such as threat-related amygdala reactivity, may also
   follow a diurnal pattern. Here, using data from 1,043 young adult
   volunteers, we found that threat-related amygdala reactivity was
   negatively coupled with time of day, an effect which was stronger in the
   left hemisphere (beta = -0.1083, p-fdr = 0.0012). This effect was
   moderated by subjective sleep quality (beta = -0.0715, p-fdr = 0.0387);
   participants who reported average and poor sleep quality had relatively
   increased left amygdala reactivity in the morning. Bootstrapped
   simulations suggest that similar cross-sectional samples with at least
   300 participants would be able to detect associations between amygdala
   reactivity and time of scan. In control analyses, we found no
   associations between time and V1 activation. Our results provide initial
   evidence that threat-related amygdala reactivity may vary diurnally, and
   that this effect is potentiated among individuals with average to low
   sleep quality. More broadly, our results suggest that considering time
   of scan in study design or modeling time of scan in analyses, as well as
   collecting additional measures of circadian variation, may be useful for
   understanding threat-related neural phenotypes and their associations
   with behavior, such as fear conditioning, mood and anxiety symptoms, and

Abstract = {{Most previous studies regarding social anxiety disorder (SAD) have
   focused on the role of emotional dysfunction, while impairments in
   self-and theory of mind (ToM)-processing have relatively been neglected.
   This study utilised functional connectivity density (FCD), resting-state
   functional connectivity (RSFC) and discriminant analyses to investigate
   impairments in self-and ToM-related networks in patients with SAD.
   Patients with SAD exhibited decreased long-range FCD in the right
   rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and decreased short-range FCD
   in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG)-key nodes involved in
   self-and ToM-processing, respectively. Decreased RSFC of the right rACC
   and STG with widespread frontal, temporal, posteromedial, sensorimotor,
   and somatosensory, regions was also observed in patients with SAD.
   Altered RSFC between the right rACC and bilateral superior frontal
   gyrus, between the right rACC and right middle frontal gyrus, and within
   the right STG itself provided the greatest contribution to individual
   diagnoses of SAD, with an accuracy of 84.5\%. These results suggest that
   a lack of cognitive inhibition on emotional self-referential processing
   as well as impairments in social information integration may play
   critical roles in the pathomechanism of SAD and highlight the importance
   of recognising such features in the diagnosis and treatment of SAD.}},

Abstract = {{Applying electrical stimulation over the prefrontal cortex can help
   nicotine dependents reduce cigarette craving. However, the underlying
   mechanism remains ambiguous. This study investigates this issue with
   functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-twomale chronic smokers
   received real and sham stimulation over dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex
   (DLPFC) separated by 1week. The neuroimaging data of the resting state,
   the smoking cue-reactivity task and the emotion task after stimulation
   were collected. The craving across the cue-reactivity task was
   diminished during real stimulation as compared with sham stimulation.
   The whole-brain analysis on the cue-reactivity task revealed a
   significant interaction between the stimulation condition (real vs sham)
   and the cue type (smoking vs neutral) in the left superior frontal gyrus
   and the leftmiddle frontal gyrus. The functional connectivity between
   the left DLPFC and the right parahippocampal gyrus, as revealed by both
   psychophysical interaction analysis and the resting state functional
   connectivity, is altered by electrical stimulation. Moreover, the
   craving change across the real and sham condition is predicted by
   alteration of functional connectivity revealed by psychophysical
   interaction analysis. The local and long-distance coupling, altered by
   the electrical stimulation, might be the underlying neural mechanism of
   craving regulation.}},

Abstract = {{The present functional neuroimaging study focuses on the iconography of
   mourning. A culture-specific pattern of body postures of mourning
   individuals, mostly suggesting withdrawal, emerged from a survey of
   visual material. When used in different combinations in stylized
   drawings in our neuroimaging study, this material activated cortical
   areas commonly seen in studies of social cognition (temporo-parietal
   junction, superior temporal gyrus, and inferior temporal lobe), empathy
   for pain (somatosensory cortex), and loss (precuneus, middle/posterior
   cingular gyrus). This pattern of activation developed over time. While
   in the early phases of exposure lower association areas, such as the
   extrastriate body area, were active, in the late phases activation in
   parietal and temporal association areas and the prefrontal cortex was
   more prominent. These findings are consistent with the conventional and
   contextual character of iconographic material, and further differentiate
   it from emotionally negatively valenced and high-arousing stimuli. In
   future studies, this neuroimaging assay may be useful in characterizing
   interpretive appraisal of material of negative emotional valence.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of literature demonstrates that racial group membership
   can influence neural responses, e.g. when individuals perceive or
   interact with persons of another race. However, little attention has
   been paid to social class, a factor that interacts with racial
   inequalities in American society. We extend previous literature on
   race-related neural activity by focusing on how the human brain responds
   to racial out-groups cast in positively valued social class positions vs
   less valued ones. We predicted that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   (vmPFC) and the amygdala would have functionally dissociable roles, with
   the vmPFC playing a more significant role within socially valued
   in-groups (i.e. the middle-class) and the amygdala having a more crucial
   role for socially ambivalent and threatening categories (i.e. upper and
   lower class). We tested these predictions with two complementary
   studies: (i) a neuropsychological experiment with patients with the
   vmPFC or amygdala lesions, contrasted with brain damaged and normal
   comparison participants, and (ii) a functional magnetic resonance
   imaging experiment with 15 healthy adults. Our findings suggest that two
   distinct mechanisms underlie class-based racial evaluations, one
   engaging the vmPFC for positively identified in-group class and another
   recruiting the amygdala for the class groups that are marginalized or
   perceived as potential threats.}},

Abstract = {{Synchrony in social groups may confer significant evolutionary
   advantages by improving group cohesion and social interaction. However,
   the neurobiological mechanisms translating social synchrony into refined
   social information transmission between interacting individuals are
   still elusive. In two successively conducted experiments involving a
   total of 306 healthy volunteers, we explored the involvement of the
   neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) in reciprocal social interaction. First, we
   show that synchronous social interactions evoke heightened endogenous
   OXT release in dyadic partners. In a second step, we examined the
   consequences of elevated OXT concentrations on emotion transmission by
   intranasally administering synthetic OXT before recording emotional
   expressions. Intriguingly, our data demonstrate that the subjects'
   facial and vocal expressiveness of fear and happiness is enhanced after
   OXT compared with placebo administration. Collectively, our findings
   point to a central role of social synchrony in facilitating reciprocal
   communication between individuals via heightened OXT signaling. Elevated
   OXT concentrations among synchronized individuals seem to augment the
   partners' emotional expressiveness, thereby contributing to improved
   transmission of emotional information in social communication.}},

   patients suffering from posterior lesions use the mouth instead of the
   eyes for face identification. Whether this bias is present for the
   recognition of facial expressions of emotion has not yet been addressed.
   We tested PS, a pure case of acquired prosopagnosia with bilateral
   occipitotemporal lesions anatomically sparing the regions dedicated for
   facial expression recognition. PS used mostly the mouth to recognize
   facial expressions even when the eye area was the most diagnostic.
   Moreover, PS directed most of her fixations towards the mouth. Her
   impairment was still largely present when she was instructed to look at
   the eyes, or when she was forced to look at them. Control participants
   showed a performance comparable to PS when only the lower part of the
   face was available. These observations suggest that the deficits
   observed in PS with static images are not solely attentional, but are
   rooted at the level of facial information use. This study corroborates
   neuroimaging findings suggesting that the Occipital Face Area might play
   a critical role in extracting facial features that are integrated for
   both face identification and facial expression recognition in static
   images.}},

Abstract = {{Faces are processed best when they are presented in the left visual
   field (LVF), a phenomenon known as LVF superiority. Although one eye
   contributes more when perceiving faces, it is unclear how the dominant
   eye (DE), the eye we unconsciously use when performing a monocular task,
   affects face processing. Here, we examined the influence of the DE on
   the LVF superiority for faces using event-related potentials. Twenty
   left-eye-dominant (LDE group) and 23 right-eye-dominant (RDE group)
   participants performed the experiments. Face stimuli were randomly
   presented in the LVF or right visual field (RVF). The RDE group
   exhibited significantly larger N170 amplitudes compared with the LDE
   group. Faces presented in the LVF elicited N170 amplitudes that were
   significantly more negative in the RDE group than they were in the LDE
   group, whereas the amplitudes elicited by stimuli presented in the RVF
   were equivalent between the groups. The LVF superiority was maintained
   in the RDE group but not in the LDE group. Our results provide the first
   neural evidence of the DE's effects on the LVF superiority for faces. We
   propose that the RDE may be more biologically specialized for face
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Several theories conceptualise emotions along two main dimensions:
   valence (a continuum from negative to positive) and arousal (a continuum
   that varies from low to high). These dimensions are typically treated as
   independent in many neuroimaging experiments, yet recent behavioural
   findings suggest that they are actually interdependent. This result has
   impact on neuroimaging design, analysis and theoretical development. We
   were interested in determining the extent of this interdependence both
   behaviourally and neuroanatomically, as well as teasing apart any
   activation that is specific to each dimension. While we found extensive
   overlap in activation for each dimension in traditional emotion areas
   (bilateral insulae, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdalae), we also found
   activation specific to each dimension with characteristic relationships
   between modulations of these dimensions and BOLD signal change.
   Increases in arousal ratings were related to increased activations
   predominantly in voice-sensitive cortices after variance explained by
   valence had been removed. In contrast, emotions of extreme valence were
   related to increased activations in bilateral voice-sensitive cortices,
   hippocampi, anterior and midcingulum and medial orbito- and superior
   frontal regions after variance explained by arousal had been accounted
   for. Our results therefore do not support a complete segregation of
   brain structures underpinning the processing of affective dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{The study aimed to explore the humor processing elicited through the
   manipulation of artistic drawings. Using the Comprehension-Elaboration
   Theory of humor as the main research background, the experiment
   manipulated the head portraits of celebrities based on the independent
   variables of facial deformation (large/small) and addition of affective
   features (positive/negative). A 64-channel electroencephalography was
   recorded in 30 participants while viewing the incongruous drawings of
   celebrities. The electroencephalography temporal and spectral responses
   were measured during the three stages of humor which included
   incongruity detection, incongruity comprehension and elaboration of
   humor. Analysis of event-related potentials indicated that for humorous
   vs non-humorous drawings, facial deformation and the addition of
   affective features significantly affected the degree of humor elicited,
   specifically: large > small deformation; negative > positive affective
   features. The N170, N270, N400, N600-800 and N900-1200 components showed
   significant differences, particularly in the right prefrontal and
   frontal regions. Analysis of event-related spectral perturbation showed
   significant differences in the theta band evoked in the anterior
   cingulate cortex, parietal region and posterior cingulate cortex; and in
   the alpha and beta bands in the motor areas. These regions are involved
   in emotional processing, memory retrieval, and laughter and feelings of
   amusement induced by elaboration of the situation.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined the relative contributions of the prefrontal
   cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to visual working
   memory. Evidence from a number of different techniques has led to the
   theory that the PFC controls access to working memory (i.e., filtering),
   determining which information is encoded and maintained for later use
   whereas the parietal cortex determines how much information is held at 1
   given time, regardless of relevance (i.e., capacity; McNab \& Klingberg,
   2008; Vogel, McCollough, \& Machizawa, 2005). To test this theory, we
   delivered transcranial DC stimulation (tDCS) to the right PFC and right
   PPC and measured visual working memory capacity and filtering abilities
   both during and immediately following stimulation. We observed no
   evidence that tDCS to either the PFC or PPC significantly improved
   visual working memory. Although the present results did not allow us to
   make firm theoretical conclusions about the roles of the PFC and PPC in
   working memory, the results add to the growing body of literature
   surrounding tDCS and its associated behavioral and neurophysiological
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are extracellular matrix structures that
   preferentially surround mature GABAergic neurons that express the
   calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). It has been suggested that
   aberrant PNN formation in humans may contribute to psychological
   disorders, many of which emerge during childhood and adolescence. The
   present experiment investigated the normative developmental trajectory
   of PNN formation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral
   amygdala (BLA) in juvenile (P24), adolescent (P35-36), and adult
   (similar to P70) rats. Dual-immunofluorescence staining revealed that
   there was a marked increase in the number of PNNs in both the prelimbic
   and infralimbic regions of the mPFC across the transition from the
   juvenile to adolescent period. Although there were no differences in the
   number of PV neurons across age groups, adolescent and adult rats had
   more PNNs surrounding PV neurons than juveniles. In contrast to the
   mPFC, juvenile and adolescent rats had similar total numbers of PNNs in
   the BLA, and total numbers of PNNs were even higher in adults in this
   region. In the BLA, adults had more PNNs around non-PV cells whereas the
   number of PV cells with PNNs did not differ across ages. However,
   expression patterns differed within subregions of the BLA such that
   adults had the most PNNs around both PV and non-PV cells in the lateral
   nucleus, with no age differences observed in the basal nucleus. These
   findings demonstrate that the juvenile to adolescent developmental
   period is an important time for the formation of prefrontal PNNs and the
   maturation of PV inhibitory neurons.}},

Volume = {{131}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a region of the
   extended amygdala that is implicated in addiction, anxiety, and stress
   related behaviors. This region has been identified in mediating the
   aversive state of naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal (MWD) and
   cannabinoid Type I (CB1) receptors have been found to modulate
   neurotransmission within this region. Previous findings suggest that the
   CB1 antagonist/ inverse agonist, AM251, administered systemically or by
   infusion into the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) prevented the
   aversive affective properties of MWD as measured by conditioned place
   aversion learning. As well, when administered systemically or by
   infusion into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) or the
   interoceptive insular cortex, the monoaclyglycerol lipase (MAGL)
   inhibitor, MJN110 (which elevates 2-arachidonlyglycerol), also prevented
   a naloxone-precipitated MWD induced place aversion. Given the
   connectivity of these regions and the BNST, the present study sought to
   determine whether cannabinoid modulation of the BNST would also prevent
   the affective properties of naloxone precipitated MWD-induced place
   aversion learning. Prior to conditioning trials, rats received
   intra-BNST infusions of AM251, in Experiment 1, or MJN110 in Experiment
   2. AM251, but not MJN110, prevented the establishment of the MWD-induced
   place aversion. The current findings emphasize an important role for the
   BNST in opioid withdrawal and suggest that the ameliorative effects of
   systemically administered CB1 antagonists are mediated, in part, by
   their actions within this region.}},

Abstract = {{Acetylcholine contributes to accurate performance on some navigational
   tasks, but details of its contribution to the underlying brain signals
   are not fully understood. The medial septal area provides widespread
   cholinergic input to various brain regions, but selective damage to
   medial septal cholinergic neurons generally has little effect on
   landmark-based navigation, or the underlying neural representations of
   location and directional heading in visual environments. In contrast,
   the loss of medial septal cholinergic neurons disrupts navigation based
   on path integration, but no studies have tested whether these path
   integration deficits are associated with disrupted head direction (HD)
   cell activity. Therefore, we evaluated HD cell responses to visual cue
   rotations in a familiar arena, and during navigation between familiar
   and novel arenas, after muscarinic receptor blockade with systemic
   atropine. Atropine treatment reduced the peak firing rate of HD cells,
   but failed to significantly affect other HD cell firing properties.
   Atropine also failed to significantly disrupt the dominant landmark
   control of the HD signal, even though we used a procedure that
   challenged this landmark control. In contrast, atropine disrupted HD
   cell stability during navigation between familiar and novel arenas,
   where path integration normally maintains a consistent HD cell signal
   across arenas. These results suggest that acetylcholine contributes to
   path integration, in part, by facilitating the use of idiothetic cues to
   maintain a consistent representation of directional heading.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) often face important
   health-related and financial decisions that involve trade-offs between
   short-term and long-term benefits, yet decision making is rarely studied
   in MS patients. The temporal discounting paradigm is a useful tool for
   investigating such time-dependent choices in humans. Here, we
   investigated whether patients with relapsing-remitting MS differed from
   healthy controls when making choices between hypothetical monetary
   rewards available at different points in time. Participants were tested
   in two conditions: in one, the choice was between a smaller amount of
   money available immediately and a larger amount of money available at a
   later date; in the other, a fixed delay of 60 days was added to both
   options. We found that, compared with healthy controls, MS patients
   favored less the sooner reward in the condition involving an immediate
   reward, whereas no difference between MS patients and the control group
   emerged in the condition involving only delayed rewards. Moreover, the
   decreased immediacy bias was corroborated by lower scores at scale that
   assesses responsiveness to rewards in MS patients. Taken together, these
   findings indicate reduced sensitivity to immediate reward and a
   consequent stronger willingness to defer gratification in MS
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The brain constantly has to interpret stimuli from a range of modalities
   originating from the same or different objects to create unambiguous
   percepts. The mechanisms of such multisensory processing have been
   intensely studied with respect to the time window of integration or the
   effect of spatial separation. However, the neural mechanisms remain
   elusive with respect to the role of alerting effects and multisensory
   integration. We addressed this issue by choosing a test paradigm where
   we could manipulate potentially alerting stimuli and simultaneously
   activating stimuli independently: We measured the temporal ventriloquism
   effect in European starlings by using the temporal order judgment
   paradigm with subjects judging the temporal order of the lighting of 2
   spatially separated lights. If spatially non-informative acoustic
   stimuli were added to the visual stimuli the performance improved when
   the 2 visual stimuli were flanked by acoustic cues with a small
   time-offset compared to synchronous presentation. Two acoustic cues
   presented with asymmetric offsets showed that this effect was mainly
   driven by the cue trailing the second visual stimulus, while an acoustic
   cue leading the first visual stimulus had less effect. In contrast, 1
   singleton acoustic cue prior to the first visual stimulus, without a
   second acoustic cue, enhanced performance. Our results support the
   hypothesis that the first stimulus pair with the leading sound activates
   alerting mechanisms and enhances neural processing, while the second
   stimulus pair with the trailing sound drives multisensory integration by
   simultaneous activation within the temporal binding window.}},

Abstract = {{Caffeine is a psychostimulant frequently consumed by adults and
   children, often in combination with high levels of sugar. Chronic
   pretreatment with either substance can amplify both amphetamine and
   cocaine-induced hyperactivity in rodents. The present study sought to
   elucidate whether age at the time of exposure to sugar and/or caffeine
   alters sensitivity to an acute illicit psychostimulant (methamphetamine,
   {[}METH]) challenge in adulthood. Adult and adolescent (Postnatal Day 35
   on first day of treatment) male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 26
   days with water, caffeine (0.6 g/L), 10\% sucrose or their combination.
   Locomotor behavior was measured on the first and last day of treatment.
   Following 9-days treatment free, animals were challenged with saline (1
   ml/kg, i.p.) or METH (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and locomotor activity was
   measured. During the treatment period, adolescent rats maintained a
   higher caffeine (mg/kg) dose than their adult counterparts. Adding sugar
   to caffeine increased adolescent consumption and the highest caffeine
   dose consumed was measured in these animals. Drinking sugarsweetened
   caffeinated water or combination did not produce cross-sensitization to
   METH administration in either age group. Nevertheless, the finding that
   regular exposure through adolescence to caffeinated sugar-sweetened
   beverages could increase consumption of caffeine and sugar later in life
   is important, as there is a large body of evidence that has linked
   excess consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages to a broad range of
   other negative physical and mental health outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The present study tested whether the neural patterns that support
   imagining `performing an action', `feeling a bodily sensation' or `being
   in a situation' are directly involved in understanding other people's
   actions, bodily sensations and situations. Subjects imagined the content
   of short sentences describing emotional actions, interoceptive
   sensations and situations (self-focused task), and processed scenes and
   focused on how the target person was expressing an emotion, what this
   person was feeling, and why this person was feeling an emotion
   (other-focused task). Using a linear support vector machine classifier
   on brain-wide multi-voxel patterns, we accurately decoded each
   individual class in the self-focused task. When generalizing the
   classifier from the self-focused task to the other-focused task, we also
   accurately decoded whether subjects focused on the emotional actions,
   interoceptive sensations and situations of others. These results show
   that the neural patterns that underlie self-imagined experience are
   involved in understanding the experience of other people. This supports
   the theoretical assumption that the basic components of emotion
   experience and understanding share resources in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{The recent call to move from focus on one brain's functioning to
   two-brain communication initiated a search for mechanisms that enable
   two humans to coordinate brain response during social interactions.
   Here, we utilized the mother-child context as a developmentally salient
   setting to study two-brain coupling. Mothers and their 9-year-old
   children were videotaped at home in positive and conflictual
   interactions. Positive interactions were microcoded for social synchrony
   and conflicts for overall dialogical style. Following, mother and child
   underwent magnetoencephalography while observing the positive vignettes.
   Episodes of behavioral synchrony, compared to non-synchrony, increased
   gamma-band power in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), hub of social
   cognition, mirroring and mentalizing. This neural pattern was coupled
   between mother and child. Brain-to-brain coordination was anchored in
   behavioral synchrony; only during episodes of behavioral synchrony, but
   not during non-synchronous moments, mother's and child's STS gamma power
   was coupled. Importantly, neural synchrony was not found during
   observation of unfamiliar mother-child interaction Maternal
   empathic/dialogical conflict style predicted mothers' STS activations
   whereas child withdrawal predicted attenuated STS response in both
   partners. Results define a novel neural marker for brain-to-brain
   synchrony, highlight the role of rapid bottom-up oscillatory mechanisms
   for neural coupling and indicate that behavior-based processes may drive
   synchrony between two brains during social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Experiences such as mind-wandering illustrate that cognition is not
   always tethered to events in the here-and-now. Although converging
   evidence emphasises the default mode network (DMN) in mind-wandering,
   its precise contribution remains unclear. The DMN comprises cortical
   regions that are maximally distant from primary sensory and motor
   cortex, a topological location that may support the
   stimulus-independence of mind-wandering. The DMN is functionally
   heterogeneous, comprising regions engaged by memory, social cognition
   and planning; processes relevant to mind-wandering content. Our study
   examined the relationships between: (i) individual differences in
   resting-state DMN connectivity, (ii) performance on memory, social and
   planning tasks and (iii) variability in spontaneous thought, to
   investigate whether the DMN is critical to mind-wandering because it
   supports stimulus-independent cognition, memory retrieval, or both.
   Individual variation in task performance modulated the functional
   organization of the DMN: poor external engagement was linked to stronger
   coupling between medial and dorsal subsystems, while decoupling of the
   core from the cerebellum predicted reports of detailed memory retrieval.
   Both patterns predicted off-task future thoughts. Consistent with
   predictions from component process accounts of mind-wandering, our study
   suggests a 2-fold involvement of the DMN: (i) it supports experiences
   that are unrelated to the environment through strong coupling between
   its sub-systems; (ii) it allows memory representations to form the basis
   of conscious experience.}},

Abstract = {{A central assumption that underpins much of the discussion of the role
   played by social cognition in brain evolution is that social cognition
   is unusually cognitively demanding. This assumption has never been
   tested. Here, we use a task in which participants read stories and then
   answered questions about the stories in a behavioural experiment (39
   participants) and an fMRI experiment (17 participants) to show that
   mentalising requires more time for responses than factual memory of a
   matched complexity and also that higher orders of mentalising are
   disproportionately more demanding and require the recruitment of more
   neurons in brain regions known to be associated with theory of mind,
   including insula, posterior STS, temporal pole and cerebellum. These
   results have significant implications both for models of brain function
   and for models of brain evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain tracks dynamic changes within the social environment,
   forming and updating representations of individuals in our social
   milieu. This mechanism of social navigation builds an increasingly
   complex map of persons with whom we are familiar and form attachments to
   guide adaptive social behaviors. We examined the neural representation
   of known others along a continuum of attachment using fMRI. Heterosexual
   adults 16 females), in romantic relationships for more than 2 years,
   made trait judgments for a romantic partner, parent, close friend,
   familiar acquaintance and self-during scanning. Multivariate analysis,
   partial least squares, was used to identify whole-brain patterns of
   brain activation associated with trait judgments of known others across
   a continuum of attachment. Across conditions, trait judgments engaged
   the default network and lateral prefrontal cortex. Judgments about
   oneself and a partner were associated with a common activation pattern
   encompassing anterior and middle cingulate, posterior superior temporal
   sulcus, as well as anterior insula. Parent and close friend judgments
   engaged medial and anterior temporal lobe regions. These results provide
   novel evidence that mentalizing about known familiar others results in
   differential brain activity. We provide initial evidence that the
   representation of adult attachment is a distinguishing feature of these
   differences.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a dynamic-interactive model of person construal (DI model) has
   been proposed, whereby the social categories a person represents are
   determined on the basis of an iterative integration of bottom-up and
   top-down influences. The current study sought to test this model by
   leveraging the high temporal resolution of event-related brain
   potentials (ERPs) as 65 participants viewed male faces that varied by
   race (White vs Black), fixating either between the eyes or on the
   forehead. Within face presentations, the effect of fixation, meant to
   vary bottom-up visual input, initially was large but decreased across
   early latency neural responses identified by a principal components
   analysis (PCA). In contrast, the effect of race, reflecting a
   combination of top-down and bottom-up factors, initially was small but
   increased across early latency principal components. These patterns
   support the DI model prediction that bottom-up and top-down processes
   are iteratively integrated to arrive at a stable construal within 230
   ms. Additionally, exploratory multilevel modeling of single trial ERP
   responses representing a component linked to outgroup categorization
   (the P2) suggests change in effects of the manipulations over the course
   of the experiment. Implications of the findings for the DI model are
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperation in social systems such as tax honesty is of central
   importance in our modern societies. However, we know little about
   cognitive and neural processes driving decisions to evade or pay taxes.
   This study focuses on the impact of perceived tax authority and examines
   the mental chronometry mirrored in ERP data allowing a deeper
   understanding about why humans cooperate in tax systems. We
   experimentally manipulated coercive and legitimate authority and studied
   its impact on cooperation and underlying cognitive (experiment 1, 2) and
   neuronal (experiment 2) processes. Experiment 1 showed that in a
   condition of coercive authority, tax payments are lower, decisions are
   faster and participants report more rational reasoning and enforced
   compliance, however, less voluntary cooperation than in a condition of
   legitimate authority. Experiment 2 confirmed most results, but did not
   find a difference in payments or self-reported rational reasoning.
   Moreover, legitimate authority led to heightened cognitive control
   (expressed by increased MFN amplitudes) and disrupted attention
   processing (expressed by decreased P300 amplitudes) compared to coercive
   authority. To conclude, the neuronal data surprisingly revealed that
   legitimate authority may led to higher decision conflict and thus to
   higher cognitive demands in tax decisions than coercive authority.}},

Abstract = {{Moral cognition is associated with activation of the default network,
   regions implicated in mentalizing about one's own actions or the
   intentions of others. Yet little is known about the initial detection of
   moral information. We examined the neural correlates of moral processing
   during a narrative completion task, which included an implicit moral
   salience manipulation. During fMRI scanning, participants read a brief
   vignette and selected the most semantically congruent sentence from two
   options to complete the narrative. The options were immoral, moral or
   neutral statements. RT was fastest for the selection of neutral
   statements and slowest for immoral statements. Neuroimaging analyses
   revealed that responses involving morally laden content engaged default
   and executive control network brain regions including medial and rostral
   prefrontal cortex, and core regions of the salience network, including
   anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate. Immoral moral conditions
   additionally engaged the salience network. These results implicate the
   salience network in the detection of moral information, which may
   modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in
   the service of complex moral reasoning and decision-making processes.
   These findings suggest that moral cognition involves both bottom-up and
   top-down attentional processes, mediated by discrete large-scale brain
   networks and their interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Placebo analgesia (PA) depends crucially on the prefrontal cortex (PFC),
   which is assumed to be responsible for initiating the analgesic
   response. Surprisingly little research has focused on the psychological
   mechanisms mediated by the PFC and underlying PA. One increasingly
   accepted theory is that cognitive reappraisal-the reinterpretation of
   the meaning of adverse events-plays an important role, but no study has
   yet addressed the possible functional relationship with PA. We studied
   the influence of individual differences in reappraisal ability on PA and
   its prefrontal mediation. Participants completed a cognitive reappraisal
   ability task, which compared negative affect evoked by pictures in a
   reappraise versus a control condition. In a subsequent fMRI session, PA
   was induced using thermal noxious stimuli and an inert skin cream. We
   found a region in the left dorsolateral PFC, which showed a positive
   correlation between placebo-induced activation and (i) the reduction in
   participants' pain intensity ratings; and (ii) cognitive reappraisal
   ability scores. Moreover, this region showed increased placebo-induced
   functional connectivity with the periaqueductal grey, indicating its
   involvement in descending nociceptive control. These initial findings
   thus suggest that cognitive reappraisal mechanisms mediated by the
   dorsolateral PFC may play a role in initiating pain inhibition in PA.}},

   brain activity. Despite suggestions that this relationship represents a

   a `cognitive reappraisal' paradigm with functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to study the neural correlates of emotional regulation in a

   = 53) and healthy controls (n = 64). As compared with healthy controls,
   young people with depression were less able to reduce negative affect
   during reappraisal, which corresponded to blunted modulation of amygdala
   activity. While in healthy individuals amygdala activation was modulated
   by age, no such relationship was observed in depressed individuals.
   Heightened activation of the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex (vmPFC) and
   reduced activation of the dorsal midline cortex was also found for the
   depressed group. Overall, these findings suggest that brain systems that
   support cognitive reappraisal are functionally altered in youth
   depression. We argue that excessive engagement of the vmPFC in
   particular, may be central to understanding how the process of putting a
   `positive spin' on negative emotional material may be altered in
   depressed youth.}},

Abstract = {{The association between moral purity and physical cleanliness has been
   widely discussed recently. Studies found that moral threat initiates the
   need of physical cleanliness, but actual physical cleaning and priming
   of cleaning have inconsistent effects on subsequent attitudes and
   behaviors. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to explore the underlying neural mechanism of actual physical
   cleaning and priming of cleaning. After recalling moral transgression
   with strong feelings of guilt and shame, participants either actually
   cleaned their faces with a wipe or were primed with cleanliness through
   viewing its pictures. Results showed that actual physical cleaning
   reduced the spontaneous brain activities in the right insula and MPFC,
   regions that involved in embodied moral emotion processing, while
   priming of cleaning decreased activities in the right superior frontal
   gyrus and middle frontal gyrus, regions that participated in executive
   control processing. Additionally, actual physical cleaning also changed
   functional connectivity between insula/MPFC and emotion related regions,
   whereas priming of cleaning modified connectivity within both moral and
   sensorimotor areas. These findings revealed that actual physical
   cleaning and priming of cleaning led to changes in different brain
   regions and networks, providing neural evidence for the inconsistent
   effects of cleanliness on subsequent attitudes and behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies indicate that positive mood broadens the scope of
   visual attention, which can manifest as heightened distractibility. We
   used event-related potentials (ERP) to investigate whether music-induced
   positive mood has comparable effects on selective attention in the
   auditory domain. Subjects listened to experimenter-selected happy,
   neutral or sad instrumental music and afterwards participated in a
   dichotic listening task. Distractor sounds in the unattended channel
   elicited responses related to early sound encoding (N1/MMN) and
   bottom-up attention capture (P3a) while target sounds in the attended
   channel elicited a response related to top-down-controlled processing of
   task-relevant stimuli (P3b). For the subjects in a happy mood, the
   N1/MMN responses to the distractor sounds were enlarged while the P3b
   elicited by the target sounds was diminished. Behaviorally, these
   subjects tended to show heightened error rates on target trials
   following the distractor sounds. Thus, the ERP and behavioral results
   indicate that the subjects in a happy mood allocated their attentional
   resources more diffusely across the attended and the to-be-ignored
   channels. Therefore, the current study extends previous research on the
   effects of mood on visual attention and indicates that even unfamiliar
   instrumental music can broaden the scope of auditory attention via its
   effects on mood.}},

Abstract = {{Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by callous lack of
   empathy, impulsive antisocial behavior, and criminal recidivism. Studies
   of brain structure and function in psychopathy have frequently
   identified abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex. However, findings
   have not yet converged to yield a clear relationship between specific
   subregions of prefrontal cortex and particular psychopathic traits. We
   performed a multimodal neuroimaging study of prefrontal cortex volume
   and functional connectivity in psychopathy, using a sample of adult male
   prison inmates . We conducted volumetric analyses in prefrontal
   subregions, and subsequently assessed resting-state functional
   connectivity in areas where volume was related to psychopathy severity.
   We found that overall psychopathy severity and Factor 2 scores (which
   index the impulsive/antisocial traits of psychopathy) were associated
   with larger prefrontal subregion volumes, particularly in the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Furthermore,
   Factor 2 scores were also positively correlated with functional
   connectivity between several areas of the prefrontal cortex. The results
   were not attributable to age, race, IQ, substance use history, or brain
   volume. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for co-localized
   increases in prefrontal cortex volume and intra-prefrontal functional
   connectivity in relation to impulsive/antisocial psychopathic traits.}},

Abstract = {{Acute stress is associated with beneficial as well as detrimental
   effects on cognition in different individuals. However, it is not yet
   known how stress can have such opposing effects. Stroop-like tasks
   typically show this dissociation: stress diminishes speed, but improves
   accuracy. We investigated accuracy and speed during a stroop-like task
   of 120 healthy male subjects after an experimental stress induction or
   control condition in a randomized, counter-balanced cross-over design;
   we assessed brain-behavior associations and determined the influence of
   individual brain connectivity patterns on these associations, which may
   moderate the effect and help identify stress resilience factors. In the
   mean, stress was associated to increase in accuracy, but decrease in
   speed. Accuracy was associated to brain activation in a distributed set
   of brain regions overlapping with the executive control network (ECN)
   and speed to temporo-parietal activation. In line with a stress-related
   large-scale network reconfiguration, individuals showing an upregulation
   of the salience and down-regulation of the executive-control network
   under stress displayed increased speed, but decreased performance. In
   contrast, individuals who upregulate their ECN under stress show
   improved performance. Our results indicate that the individual
   large-scale brain network balance under acute stress moderates cognitive
   consequences of threat.}},

Abstract = {{Health communication via mass media is an important strategy when
   targeting risky drinking, but many questions remain about how health
   messages are processed and how they unfold their effects within
   receivers. Here we examine how the brains of young adults-a key target
   group for alcohol prevention-'tune in' to real-life health prevention
   messages about risky alcohol use. In a first study, a large sample of
   authentic public service announcements (PSAs) targeting the risks of
   alcohol was characterized using established measures of message
   effectiveness. In the main study, we used inter-subject correlation
   analysis of fMRI data to examine brain responses to more and less
   effective PSAs in a sample of young adults. We find that more effective
   messages command more similar responses within widespread brain regions,
   including the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, insulae and precuneus. In
   previous research, these regions have been related to processing
   narratives, emotional stimuli, self-relevance and attention towards
   salient stimuli. The present study thus suggests that more effective
   health prevention messages have greater `neural reach', i.e. they engage
   the brains of audience members' more widely. This work outlines a
   promising strategy for assessing the effects of health communication at
   a neural level.}},

   significantly increases activation in the social brain of healthy,
   neurotypical participants when compared with activation for the exact
   same stimuli observed in a free-viewing mode. In addition, using PPI
   analysis, we show that the degree of amygdala connectivity with the rest
   of the brain is enhanced for the constrained view for all emotions
   tested except for fear, and that anxiety and alexithymia modulate the
   strength of amygdala connectivity for each emotion differently. Finally,
   we show that autistic traits have opposite effects on amygdala
   connectivity for fearful and angry emotional expressions, suggesting
   that these emotions should be treated separately in studies

Abstract = {{In dialogue, language processing is adapted to the conversational
   partner. We hypothesize that the brain facilitates partner-adapted
   language processing through preparatory neural configurations (task
   sets) that are tailored to the conversational partner. In this
   experiment, we measured neural activity with functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) while healthy participants in the scanner (a)
   engaged in a verbal communication task with a conversational partner
   outside of the scanner, or (b) spoke outside of a conversational context
   (to test the microphone). Using multivariate searchlight analysis, we
   identify cortical regions that represent information on whether speakers
   plan to speak to a conversational partner or without having a partner.
   Most notably a region that has been associated with processing
   social-affective information and perspective taking, the ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex, as well as regions that have been associated with
   prospective task representation, the bilateral ventral prefrontal
   cortex, are involved in encoding the speaking condition. Our results
   suggest that speakers prepare, in advance of speaking, for the social
   context in which they will speak.}},

Abstract = {{Moral emotions elicited in response to others' suffering are mediated by
   empathy and affect how we respond to their pain. South Africa provides a
   unique opportunity to study group processes given its racially divided
   past. The present study seeks insights into aspects of the moral brain
   by investigating behavioral and functional MRI responses of White and
   Black South Africans who lived through apartheid to in-and out-group
   physical and social pain. Whereas the physical pain task featured faces
   expressing dynamic suffering, the social pain task featured victims of
   apartheid violence from the South African Truth and Reconciliation
   Commission to elicit heartfelt emotion. Black participants' behavioral
   responses were suggestive of in group favoritism, whereas White
   participants' responses were apparently egalitarian. However, all
   participants showed significant in-group biases in activation in the
   amygdala (physical pain), as well as areas involved in mental state
   representation, including the precuneus, temporoparietal junction (TPJ)
   and frontal pole (physical and social pain). Additionally, Black
   participants reacted with heightened moral indignation to own-race
   suffering, whereas White participants reacted with heightened shame to
   Black suffering, which was associated with blunted neural empathic
   responding. These findings provide ecologically valid insights into some
   behavioral and brain processes involved in complex moral situations.}},

Abstract = {{Empathy has been supposed to be a proximate mechanism of altruistic
   behavior. We investigated whether empathy for pain drives actions
   without altruistic effects and how such actions modulate neural
   responses to others' pain. In two experiments, we asked healthy adults
   to press a button for no reason when viewing video clips showing faces
   with pain expressions receiving needle penetration or faces with neutral
   expressions receiving a cotton swab touch. Experiment 1 found that
   participants pressed a button with greater response force when watching
   painful than non-painful stimuli. Participants who reported greater
   unpleasant feelings pressed the button harder when viewing painful
   stimuli. Experiment 2 revealed that passively viewing painful vs
   non-painful stimuli increased blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals in
   the middle cingulate cortex, supplementary motor cortex, and bilateral
   second somatosensory and inferior frontal cortex, which, however, were
   reduced by the action of button press without altruistic effects. In
   addition, individuals who reported higher personal distress illustrated
   greater decrease of the second somatosensory activity induced by button
   press. Our results indicate that empathy for pain motivates simple
   actions without altruistic effects that in turn reduce neural responses
   to others' pain, suggesting a functional role of action execution in
   self distress relief when viewing others' suffering.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored the temporal course of vocal and emotional sound
   processing. Participants detected rare repetitions in a stimulus stream
   comprising neutral and surprised non-verbal exclamations and spectrally
   rotated control sounds. Spectral rotation preserved some acoustic and
   emotional properties of the vocal originals. Event-related potentials
   elicited to unrepeated sounds revealed effects of voiceness and emotion.
   Relative to non-vocal sounds, vocal sounds elicited a larger
   centro-parietally distributed N1. This effect was followed by greater
   positivity to vocal relative to non-vocal sounds beginning with the P2
   and extending throughout the recording epoch (N4, late positive
   potential) with larger amplitudes in female than in male listeners.
   Emotion effects overlapped with the voiceness effects but were smaller
   and differed topographically. Voiceness and emotion interacted only for
   the late positive potential, which was greater for vocal-emotional as
   compared with all other sounds. Taken together, these results point to
   amulti-stage process in which voiceness and emotionality are represented
   independently before being integrated in amanner that biases responses
   to stimuli with socio-emotional relevance.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality salience (MS) has been shown to lead to derogation of others

   interdependent SC indeed show greater tolerance toward
   worldview-threatening other in the MS (vs control) condition, thus
   replicating the prior research. Extending this research, we also found
   that interdependent people's tolerance toward worldview-threatening
   other was mediated by increased activity in the right ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex in the MS condition. These data suggested that when
   exposed to death-related stimuli, highly interdependent individuals may
   spontaneously activate their neural self-control system which may serve
   to increase tolerance toward others.}},

   event-related potentials (ERPs) during a passive viewing task were used
   to compare incidental memory traces for repeated vs single presentations
   of previously unfamiliar social (faces) and nonsocial (houses) images in
   15 children with the deletion subtype and 13 children with maternal
   uniparental disomy (mUPD). While all participants perceived faces as
   different from houses (N170 responses), repeated faces elicited more
   positive ERP amplitudes ('old/new' effect, 250-500ms) only in children
   with the deletion subtype. Conversely, the mUPD group demonstrated
   reduced amplitudes suggestive of habituation to the repeated faces. ERP
   responses to repeated vs single house images did not differ in either
   group. The results suggest that faces hold different motivational value

Abstract = {{The Reward Hypersensitivity Model of bipolar disorder argues that
   hypersensitivity to reward-relevant cues characterizes risk for
   hypo/mania. This hypersensitivity leads to increased goal-directed
   motivation during reward-relevant life events that, in the extreme, is
   reflected in hypo/manic symptoms. In line with this perspective,
   individuals with bipolar disorder display elevated activation in a
   cortico-striatal reward circuit including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc)
   and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). To date, however, research on
   reward-related neural circuitry underlying bipolar symptoms focuses on
   syndromal bipolar disorder (bipolar I, bipolar II), and typically
   examines neural regions in isolation of each other. Accordingly, this
   study examines the relationship between subsyndromal hypo/mania
   proneness and structural connectivity between the NAcc and both the mOFC
   and amygdala in a medication-free sample. Fifty-four community
   participants completed diffusion-weighted imaging and a self-report
   measure of bipolar risk (hypo/mania proneness). As predicted, elevated
   structural connectivity between the NAcc and both the mOFC and amygdala
   were associated with elevated hypo/mania proneness. This relationship
   was specific to NAcc-centered reward connectivity, as there was no
   relationship between hypo/mania proneness and either whole-brain or
   cortico-amygdala connectivity. Results suggest that reward-relevant
   tractography from cortical (mOFC) and subcortical (amygdala) regions
   amplify NAcc-centered reward processing in bipolar risk.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to mentally represent future events is a significant human
   psychological achievement. A challenge that people encounter is that
   they often lack detailed specifics about distant relative to near future
   events. Construal level theory proposes that people represent distant
   future events by their abstract and essential features-a process
   referred to as high-level construal. As events become temporally
   proximal, people represent events by their increasingly available and
   reliable concrete and idiosyncratic features-a process referred to as
   low-level construal. The present fMRI experiment provides direct neural
   evidence for these assertions. Using the why-how localizer as a measure
   of construal level, results revealed brain regions associated with both
   temporal distance and high-level construal (medial prefrontal cortex),
   as well as temporal proximity and low-level construal (precuneus). We
   discuss the implications of these findings for the neuroscience of
   mental time travel and cognitive representation.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{948-955}},

Abstract = {{The resting connectivity of the brain's salience network, particularly
   the ventral subsystem of the salience network, has been previously
   associated with various measures of affective reactivity. Numerous
   studies have demonstrated that increased affective arousal leads to
   enhanced consolidation of memory. This suggests that individuals with
   greater ventral salience network connectivity will exhibit greater
   responses to affective experience, leading to a greater enhancement of
   memory by affect. To test this hypothesis, resting ventral salience
   connectivity was measured in 41 young adults, who were then exposed to
   neutral and negative affect inductions during a paired associate memory
   test. Memory performance for material learned under both negative and
   neutral induction was tested for correlation with resting connectivity
   between major ventral salience nodes. The results showed a significant
   interaction between mood induction (negative vs neutral) and
   connectivity between ventral anterior insula and pregenual anterior
   cingulate cortex, indicating that salience node connectivity predicted
   memory for material encoded under negative, but not neutral induction.
   These findings suggest that the network state of the perceiver, measured
   prior to affective experience, meaningfully influences the extent to
   which affect modulates memory. Implications of these findings for
   individuals with affective disorder, who show alterations in both
   connectivity and memory, are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Even in predominantly religious societies, there are substantial
   individual differences in religious commitment. Why is this? One
   possibility is that differences in social conformity (i.e. the tendency
   to think and behave as others do) underlie inclination towards
   religiosity. However, the link between religiosity and conformity has
   not yet been directly examined. In this study, we tested the notion that
   non-religious individuals show dampened social conformity, using both
   self-reported and neural (EEG-based ERPs) measures of sensitivity to
   others' influence. Non-religious vs religious undergraduate subjects
   completed an experimental task that assessed levels of conformity in a
   domain unrelated to religion (i.e. in judgments of facial
   attractiveness). Findings showed that, although both groups yielded to
   conformity pressures at the self-report level, non-religious individuals
   did not yield to such pressures in their neural responses. These
   findings highlight a novel link between religiosity and social
   conformity, and hold implications for prominent theories about the
   psychological functions of religion.}},

Abstract = {{There is substantial evidence for behavioral sex differences in risk
   trajectories for alcohol and substance use, with internalizing factors
   such as negative affectivity contributing more to female risk. Because
   the neural development of emotion circuitry varies between males and
   females across adolescence, it represents a potential mechanism by which
   underlying neurobiology contributes to risk for substance use.
   Longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted in
   males and females (n = 18 each) with a family history of alcohol use
   disorders starting at ages 8-13 years. Participants performed an
   affective word task during functional magnetic resonance imaging at 1-
   to 2-year intervals, covering the age range of 8.5-17.6 years (3-4 scans
   per participant). Significant age-related sex differences were found in
   the right amygdala and right precentral gyrus for the negative vs
   neutral word condition. Males showed a significant decrease in both
   amygdala and precentral gyrus activation with age, whereas the response
   in females persisted. The subjective experience of internalizing
   symptomatology significantly increased with age for females but not for
   males. Taken together, these results reveal sex differences in negative
   affect processing in at-risk adolescents, and offer longitudinal neural
   evidence for female substance use risk through internalizing pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Fear acquisition and extinction have been demonstrated as core
   mechanisms for the development and maintenance of mental disorders, with
   different contributions of processing cues vs contexts. The hypothalamic
   peptide oxytocin (OXT) may have a prominent role in this context, as it
   has been shown to affect fear learning. However, investigations have
   focused on cue conditioning, and fear extinction. Its differential role
   for cue and context fear acquisition is still not known. In a
   randomized, double-blind, placebo (PLC)-controlled design, we
   administered an intranasal dose of OXT or PLC before the acquisition of
   cue and context fear conditioning in healthy individuals (n = 52), and
   assessed brain responses, skin conductance responses and self-reports
   (valence/arousal/contingency). OXT compared with PLC significantly
   induced decreased responses in the nucleus accumbens during early cue
   and context acquisition, and decreased responses of the anterior
   cingulate cortex and insula during early as well as increased
   hippocampal response during late context, but not cue acquisition. The
   OXT group additionally showed significantly higher arousal in late cue
   and context acquisition. OXT modulates various aspects of cue and
   context conditioning, which is relevant from a mechanism-based
   perspective and might have implications for the treatment of fear and
   anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional states can guide the actions and decisions we make in our
   everyday life through their influence on cognitive processes such as
   working memory (WM). We investigated the long-lasting interference that
   an unpleasant emotional state had on goal-relevant WM representations
   from an electrophysiological perspective. Participants performed a
   change detection task that was preceded by the presentation of
   unpleasant or neutral task-irrelevant pictures in a blocked fashion. We
   focused on the contralateral delay activity (CDA), an event-related
   potential that is sensitive to the number of task-relevant items stored
   in WM. We found that the asymptotic limit for the CDA amplitude was
   lower during the unpleasant emotional state than during the neutral one;
   that is, an emotional state was capable of reducing how many
   task-relevant items the participants could hold in WM. Furthermore, both
   the individuals who experienced more intrusive thoughts and those who
   were dispositionally anxious were more susceptible to the influence of
   the emotional state. We provide evidence that an unpleasant emotional
   state diminished visual WM for task-relevant items, particularly in
   susceptible individuals. These results open new avenues to uncover the
   emotional-cognitive processing that underlies maladaptive WM
   representations and the role of such processing in the development of
   mental illness.}},

   anti-depressant use, family history of Alzheimer's disease, APOE epsilon

   with greater cerebral glucose metabolism across para-/limbic, frontal,
   temporal and parietal regions. Our findings provide evidence that
   positive affect in late midlife is associated with greater brain health
   in regions involved in affective processing and also known to be
   susceptible to early neuropathological processes. The current findings

   affect to attenuate early neuropathological changes in at-risk

Abstract = {{Psychometric research has identified stable traits that predict
   inter-individual differences in appetitive motivation and approach
   behavior. Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System
   (BIS/BAS) scales have been developed to quantitatively assess these
   traits. However, neural mechanisms corresponding to the proposed
   constructs reflected in BIS/BAS are still poorly defined. The ventral
   striatum (VS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are implicated in
   subserving reward-related functions that are also associated with the
   BAS. In this study, we examined whether functional connectivity between
   these regions predicts components of these scales. We employed
   resting-state functional connectivity and BIS/BAS scores assessed by a
   personality questionnaire. Participants completed a resting state run
   and the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Systems (BIS/BAS)
   Questionnaire. Using resting-state BOLD, we assessed correlations
   between two basal ganglia ROIs (caudate and putamen) and bilateral OFC
   ROIs, establishing single subject connectivity summary scores. Summary
   scores were correlated with components of BIS/BAS scores. Results
   demonstrate a novel correlation between BAS-fun seeking and
   resting-state connectivity between middle OFC and putamen, implying that
   spontaneous synchrony between reward-processing regions may play a role
   in defining personality characteristics related to impulsivity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent emotion dysregulation models of generalized anxiety disorder
   (GAD) propose chronic worry in GAD functions as a maladaptive attempt to
   regulate anxiety related to uncertain or unpredictable outcomes. Emotion
   acceptance is an adaptive emotion regulation strategy increasingly
   incorporated into newer cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches to
   GAD to counter chronic worry. The current study explores the mechanisms
   of emotion acceptance as an alternate emotion regulation strategy to
   worry or emotion suppression using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Twenty-one female participants diagnosed with GAD followed
   counterbalanced instructions to regulate responses to personally
   relevant worry statements by engaging in either emotion acceptance,
   worry or emotion suppression. Emotion acceptance resulted in lower
   ratings of distress than worry and was associated with increased dorsal
   anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activation and increased ventrolateral
   prefrontal cortex (VLPFC)-amygdala functional connectivity. In contrast,
   worry showed significantly greater distress ratings than acceptance or
   suppression and was associated with increased precuneus, VLPFC, amygdala
   and hippocampal activation. Suppression did not significantly differ
   from acceptance in distress ratings or amygdala recruitment, but
   resulted in significantly greater insula and VLPFC activation and
   decreased VLPFC-amygdala functional connectivity. Emotion acceptance
   closely aligned with activation and connectivity patterns reported in
   studies of contextual extinction learning and mindful awareness.}},

Abstract = {{The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has long been implicated in the ability
   to use the current value of expected outcomes to guide behavior. More
   recently, this specific role has been conceptualized as a special case
   of a more general function that OFC plays in constructing a ``cognitive
   map{''} of the behavioral task space by labeling the current task state
   and learning relationships among task states. Here, we have used single
   unit recording data from 2 prior studies to examine whether and how
   information relating different states within and across trials is
   represented in medial versus lateral OFC in rats. Using a hierarchical
   clustering analysis, we examined how neurons from each area represented
   information about differently valued trial types, defined by the
   cue-outcome pairings, versus how those same neurons represented
   information about similar epochs between these different trial types,
   such as the stimulus sample, delay, and reward consumption epochs. This
   analysis revealed that ensembles in the lateral OFC (lOFC) group states
   according to trial epoch, whereas those in the medial OFC (mOFC)
   organize the same states by trial type. These results suggest that the
   lOFC and mOFC construct cognitive maps that emphasize different features
   of the behavioral landscape, with lOFC tracking events based on local
   similarities, irrespective of their values and mOFC tracking more distal
   or higher order relationships relevant to value.}},

Abstract = {{Converging evidence suggests that the cognitive control processes that
   enable the inhibition of irrelevant information on a perceptual versus a
   memorial basis are qualitatively different and are underlain by unique
   neural systems that may be affected differentially in aging. In the
   current study, we investigated whether individual differences in
   performance on these 2 types of inhibitory processes were attributable
   to region-specific patterns of cortical thinning. Clinically healthy
   older adults completed a pair of behavioral memory and perceptual
   inhibition tasks and then underwent structural brain imaging. We found
   that worse memory inhibition was associated with reduced cortical
   thickness in the left ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), an area
   that has been functionally associated with memory inhibition, but not in
   either the right or left superior parietal lobule (SPL), areas that have
   been functionally associated with perceptual inhibition. On the
   contrary, while impaired perceptual inhibition was associated with
   cortical thinning in the right SPL, it was not associated with cortical
   thickness in either the left VLPFC or SPL. These results suggest a
   double dissociation between performance on 2 types of inhibitory control
   tasks and cortical thinning in specific brain areas, previously shown to
   be uniquely associated with functional activation of each these 2 types

Abstract = {{Reward cues can be perceived as highly attractive stimuli because of
   their acquired motivational properties. However, because the
   motivational value of reward changes after reward receipt, a debated
   question is whether the attentional salience of reward cues changes
   accordingly. In Experiment 1, thirsty participants learned 3 cue-reward
   associations involving different contingencies. Then, while thirsty,
   participants performed a visual-search task under extinction, during
   which the previous reward cues appeared as irrelevant stimuli containing
   target and distractor items. Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1,
   except that participants drank ad libitum before the visual-search task.
   In Experiment 3, instead, participants quenched their thirst at the
   beginning of the learning session. The results of Experiment 1 showed
   that attention was preferentially deployed toward the cue that best
   predicted the reward in the previous conditioning phase. Crucially,
   Experiment 2 revealed that the attentional bias persisted despite reward
   devaluation. By contrast, no attentional bias was found in Experiment 3.
   The novelty of our study is that the attentional salience of a reward
   cue can outlast reward devaluation, suggesting that some incentive
   properties of the cue can become independent from those of the reward.}},

   fear: Experiments 2-3). At both high (10 ml/kg 0.15 M LiCl, 10 ml/kg 1.5
   M NaCl) and low dose levels (2 ml/kg 0.15 M LiCl, 4 ml/kg 1.5 M NaCl),
   pairing a taste with either LiCl-induced nausea or internal pain
   produced by hypertonic NaCl caused reductions in voluntary consumption,
   in appetitive taste reactivity responses, and in lick cluster size.
   However, only pairing with LiCl resulted in conditioned aversive taste
   reactivity responses to the taste. In contrast, pairing with hypertonic
   NaCl resulted in the taste eliciting higher levels of immobility
   (reflecting fear) than did pairing the taste with LiCl. The clearly
   dissociable effects of LiCl and hypertonic saline on aversive taste
   reactivity and fear responses, despite equivalent effects on
   consumption, demonstrates selective conditioning effects between
   internal pain and nausea.}},

Abstract = {{In hamsters, individuals attacked by adults during puberty become
   aggressive adults. Perhaps, enhanced aggression observed as repeated
   attacks toward opponents is associated with a lack of impulse control.
   We examined impulsive action in male golden hamsters exposed daily to
   aggressive adults from postnatal Day 28 to 42. These animals were
   trained in conditioning chambers and tested during adulthood in a
   go-no-go task addressing action inhibition. Overall, previously stressed
   hamsters were less likely to inhibit a conditioned lever pressing
   response during no-go trials. Because this effect could be the result of
   an extinction impairment, additional animals were tested to evaluate
   their response to omission of reward associated with conditioned lever
   pressing. In this experiment, all animals were equally capable of
   inhibiting their conditioned response. The capacity to inhibit a
   conditioned response was further addressed by testing responses to a
   60-s reward delay after lever pressing. In this case, previously
   stressed animals were faster to inhibit lever pressing and stopped
   showing a preference for the proximity of the lever. These studies show
   selective condition-dependent effects on lever pressing activity and
   support the possibility that stress in early puberty enhances impulsive
   action in adulthood. These experiments may be relevant to the study of
   mental disorders associated with early trauma in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple lines of research indicate that fathers often treat boys and
   girls differently in ways that impact child outcomes. The complex
   picture that has emerged, however, is obscured by methodological
   challenges inherent to the study of parental caregiving, and no studies
   to date have examined the possibility that gender differences in
   observed real-world paternal behavior are related to differential
   paternal brain responses to male and female children. Here we compare
   fathers of daughters and fathers of sons in terms of naturalistically
   observed everyday caregiving behavior and neural responses to child
   picture stimuli. Compared with fathers of sons, fathers of daughters
   were more attentively engaged with their daughters, sang more to their
   daughters, used more analytical language and language related to sadness
   and the body with their daughters, and had a stronger neural response to
   their daughter's happy facial expressions in areas of the brain
   important for reward and emotion regulation (medial and lateral
   orbitofrontal cortex {[}OFC]). In contrast, fathers of sons engaged in
   more rough and tumble play (RTP), used more achievement language with
   their sons, and had a stronger neural response to their son's neutral
   facial expressions in the medial OFC (mOFC). Whereas the mOFC response
   to happy faces was negatively related to RTP, the mOFC response to
   neutral faces was positively related to RTP, specifically for fathers of
   boys. These results indicate that real-world paternal behavior and brain
   function differ as a function of child gender.}},

Abstract = {{Attractive individuals are perceived as possessing more positive
   personal traits than unattractive individuals. This reliance on
   aesthetic features to infer moral character suggests a close link
   between aesthetic and moral valuation. Here we aimed to investigate the
   neural underpinnings of the interaction between aesthetic and moral
   valuation by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with a
   priming paradigm designed to assess the Beauty-is-Good stereotype.
   Participants evaluated the trustworthiness of a series of faces
   (targets), each of which was preceded by an adjective describing
   desirable, undesirable, or neutral aesthetic qualities (primes). TMS was
   applied between prime and target to interfere with activity in two
   regions known to be involved in aesthetic and moral valuation: the
   dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, a core region in social cognition)
   and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, critical in decision
   making). Our results showed that when TMS was applied over vertex
   (control) and over the dlPFC, participants judged faces as more
   trustworthy when preceded by positive than by negative aesthetic primes
   (as also shown in two behavioral experiments). However, when TMS was
   applied over the dmPFC, primes had no effect on trustworthiness
   judgments. A second Experiment corroborated this finding. Our results
   suggest that mPFC plays a causal role linking moral and aesthetic
   valuation.}},

Abstract = {{The tribal character of the affective link between football fans and
   their teams is a well-recognized phenomenon. Other forms of love such as
   romantic or maternal attachment have previously been studied from a
   neuroimaging point of view. Here we aimed to investigate the neural
   basis of this tribal form of love, which implies both the feeling of
   belongingness and rivalry against opposing teams. A pool of 56
   participants was submitted to an fMRI experimental design involving the
   presentation of winning and losing football moments of their loved,
   rival or neutral teams. We found recruitment of amygdala and reward
   regions, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra
   (SN), as well as other limbic regions involved in emotional cognition,
   for `positive vs neutral' and `positive vs negative' conditions. The
   latter contrast was correlated with neuropsychological scores of
   fanaticism in the amygdala and regions within the reward system, as the
   VTA and SN. The observation of increased response patterns in critical
   components of the reward system, in particular for positive content
   related to the loved team, suggests that this kind of non-romantic love
   reflects a specific arousal and motivational state, which is biased for
   emotional learning of positive outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has implicated altered neural response to interpersonal
   feedback as an important factor in adolescent depression, with existing
   studies focusing on responses to feedback from virtual peers. We
   investigated whether depressed adolescents differed from healthy youth
   in neural response to social evaluative feedback from mothers. During
   neuroimaging, twenty adolescents in a current episode of major
   depressive disorder (MDD) and 28 healthy controls listened to previously
   recorded audio clips of their own mothers' praise, criticism and neutral
   comments. Whole-brain voxelwise analyses revealed that MDD youth, unlike
   controls, exhibited increased neural response to critical relative to
   neutral clips in the parahippocampal gyrus, an area involved in episodic
   memory encoding and retrieval. Depressed adolescents also showed a
   blunted response to maternal praise clips relative to neutral clips in
   the parahippocampal gyrus, as well as areas involved in reward and
   self-referential processing (i.e. ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
   precuneus, and thalamus/caudate). Findings suggest that maternal
   criticism may be more strongly encoded or more strongly activated during
   memory retrieval related to previous autobiographical instances of
   negative feedback from mothers in depressed youth compared to healthy
   youth. Furthermore, depressed adolescents may fail to process the reward
   value and self-relevance of maternal praise.}},

Abstract = {{Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by affective
   instability, but self-injurious behavior appears to have an
   emotion-regulating effect. We investigated whether pain-mediated affect
   regulation can be altered at the neural level by residential Dialectical
   Behavior Therapy (DBT), providing adaptive emotion regulation
   techniques. Likewise, we investigated whether pain thresholds or the
   appraisal of pain change after psychotherapy. We investigated 28
   patients with BPD undergoing DBT (self-referral), 15 patients with
   treatment as usual and 23 healthy control subjects at two time points 12
   weeks apart. We conducted an fMRI experiment eliciting negative emotions
   with picture stimuli and induced heat pain to investigate the role of
   pain in emotion regulation. Additionally, we assessed heat and cold pain
   thresholds.
   At first measurement, patients with BPD showed amygdala deactivation in
   response to painful stimulation, as well as altered connectivity between
   left amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. These effects were
   reduced after DBT, as compared with patients with treatment as usual.
   Pain thresholds did not differ between the patient groups. We replicated
   the role of pain as a means of affect regulation in BPD, indicated by
   increased amygdala coupling. For the first time, we could demonstrate
   that pain-mediated affect regulation can be changed by DBT.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala responds to stimulus novelty, which may correspond to an
   evaluation of novel stimuli for potential threat, and trait anxiety may
   modulate this response. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)
   may also be sensitive to novelty as it responds to both uncertainty and
   threat. If so, a BNST novelty response may also be affected by trait
   anxiety and interact with stimulus negativity. We presented participants
   with novel and repeated negative and neutral images while measuring
   brain activity via fMRI, and assessed participants' self-reported trait
   anxiety. We expected to replicate past findings of novelty responses in
   the hippocampus and amygdala that are independent of stimulus
   negativity. We also expected BNST novelty-sensitivity and that trait
   anxiety would predict greater sensitivity to both novelty and negativity
   in the amygdala and BNST, but not the hippocampus. Our a priori analyses
   replicated past findings of a novelty response that was independent of
   valence in the hippocampus and amygdala. The BNST exhibited a novelty
   response for negative, but not neutral, images. Trait anxiety did not
   modulate the response to novelty or negativity in any of the ROIs
   investigated. Our findings suggest that the BNST plays a role in the
   detection of novelty.

Abstract = {{Social categorization has been viewed as necessarily resulting in

   test the degree to which race perception and stereotyping are
   conditionally automatic. Participants performed a sequential priming
   task while either explicitly attending to the race of face primes or
   directing attention away from their semantic nature. We find a
   dissociation between the perceptual encoding of race and subsequent
   activation of associated stereotypes, with race perception occurring in
   both task conditions, but implicit stereotyping occurring only when
   attention is directed to the race of the face primes. These results
   support a clear conceptual distinction between categorization and
   stereotyping and show that the encoding of racial category need not

Abstract = {{Positive mood broadens attention and builds additional mental resources.
   However, its effect on performance monitoring and reward prediction
   errors remain unclear. To examine this issue, we used a standard mood
   induction procedure (based on guided imagery) and asked 45 participants
   to complete a gambling task suited to study reward prediction errors by
   means of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and mid-frontal theta
   band power. Results showed a larger FRN for negative feedback as well as
   a lack of reward expectation modulation for positive feedback at the
   theta level with positive mood, relative to a neutral mood condition. A
   control analysis showed that this latter result could not be explained
   by the mere superposition of the event-related brain potential component
   on the theta oscillations. Moreover, these neurophysiological effects
   were evidenced in the absence of impairments at the behavioral level or
   increase in autonomic arousal with positive mood, suggesting that this
   mood state reliably altered brain mechanisms of reward prediction errors
   during performance monitoring. We interpret these new results as
   reflecting a genuine mood congruency effect, whereby reward is
   anticipated as the default outcome with positive mood and therefore
   processed as unsurprising (even when it is unlikely), while negative
   feedback is perceived as unexpected.}},

Abstract = {{Anxious individuals tend to show a negative affective bias in attention
   that likely reflects reduced executive control, a cognitive function
   associated with the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), particularly its
   posterior segment, pars opercularis. Here, we investigated the relations
   among gray matter volume in the pars opercularis of IFC, trait anxiety,
   and negative biases in attention, in healthy participants. Sixty-two
   adults underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging scanning,
   completed a trait anxiety measure, and performed an Affective Go/No-Go
   (AGN) task. IFC volumes were extracted using Freesurfer, and negative
   bias scores were calculated from AGN performance. Trait anxiety
   correlated negatively with left IFC volume, and positively with the
   negative bias in reaction time. Furthermore, trait anxiety mediated the
   negative relation between the IFC volume and the negative bias measure.
   Overall, the present findings extend previous understanding of the IFC
   involvement in anxiety at the structural level, and may inform the
   development of intervention programs targeting anxiety.}},

Abstract = {{This study combined multiple levels of analysis to examine whether
   disrupted neural and pupillary reactivity to emotional faces serves as a
   state- or trait-like marker of adolescent major depressive disorder
   (MDD). The study examined differences in pupil dilation and the
   event-related potential (ERP) late positive potential (LPP) component to
   emotional faces before and after a negative mood induction between 71
   adolescents (age 11-18 years) with (i) a current diagnosis of MDD, (ii)
   a past episode of MDD currently in full remission and (iii) no lifetime
   history of any Axis I disorder. Relative to healthy control (HC) youth,
   adolescents with current or remitted MDD exhibited an enhanced LPP and
   pupillary response to all emotional facial expressions (fearful, happy
   and sad). This difference in reactivity between remitted depressed and
   HC adolescents persisted following the negative mood induction. Results
   also revealed that LPP and pupillary responses to emotional faces were
   significantly related, but only among the currently depressed
   adolescents. This study suggests that increased physiological and neural
   activation in response to social-emotional stimuli may not only
   characterize currently depressed adolescents, but also remains following
   MDD remission, potentially serving as a mechanism of risk for future
   depression relapse.}},

Abstract = {{Loss or reduction of awareness is common in neuropsychiatric disorders
   and culturally influenced dissociative phenomena but the underlying
   brain mechanisms are poorly understood. fMRI was combined with
   suggestions for automatic writing in 18 healthy highly hypnotically
   suggestible individuals in a within-subjects design to determine whether
   clinical alterations in awareness of thought and movement can be
   experimentally modelled and studied independently of illness. Subjective
   ratings of control, ownership, and awareness of thought and movement,
   and fMRI data were collected following suggestions for thought insertion
   and alien control of writing movement, with and without loss of
   awareness. Subjective ratings confirmed that suggestions were effective.
   At the neural level, our main findings indicated that loss of awareness
   for both thought and movement during automatic writing was associated
   with reduced activation in a predominantly left-sided posterior cortical
   network including BA 7 (superior parietal lobule and precuneus), and
   posterior cingulate cortex, involved in self-related processing and
   awareness of the body in space. Reduced activity in posterior parietal
   cortices may underlie specific clinical and cultural alterations in
   awareness of thought and movement. Clinically, these findings may assist
   development of imaging assessments for loss of awareness of
   psychological origin, and interventions such as neurofeedback.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to successfully suppress impulses and angry affect is
   fundamental to control aggressive reactions following provocations. The
   aim of this study was to examine neural responses to provocations and
   aggression using a laboratory model of reactive aggression. We used a
   novel functional magnetic resonance imaging point-subtraction aggression
   paradigm in 44 men, of whom 18 were incarcerated violent offenders and
   26 were control non-offenders. We measured brain activation following
   provocations (monetary subtractions), while the subjects had the
   possibility to behave aggressively or pursue monetary rewards. The
   violent offenders behaved more aggressively than controls (aggression
   frequency 150 vs 84, P = 0.03) and showed significantly higher brain
   reactivity to provocations within the amygdala and striatum, as well as
   reduced amygdala-prefrontal and striato-prefrontal connectivity.
   Amygdala reactivity to provocations was positively correlated with
   task-related behavior in the violent offenders. Across groups, striatal
   and prefrontal reactivity to provocations was positively associated with
   trait anger and trait aggression. These results suggest that violent
   individuals display abnormally high neural sensitivity to social
   provocations, a sensitivity related to aggressive behavior. These
   findings provide novel insight into the neural pathways that are
   sensitive to provocations, which is critical to more effectively shaped
   interventions that aim to reduce pathological aggressive behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The human face conveys emotional and social information, but it is not
   well understood how these two aspects influence face perception. In
   order to model a group situation, two faces displaying happy, neutral or
   angry expressions were presented. Importantly, faces were either facing
   the observer, or they were presented in profile view directed towards,
   or looking away from each other. In Experiment 1 (n = 64), face pairs
   were rated regarding perceived relevance, wish-to-interact, and
   displayed interactivity, as well as valence and arousal. All variables
   revealed main effects of facial expression (emotional > neutral), face
   orientation (facing observer > towards > away) and interactions showed
   that evaluation of emotional faces strongly varies with their
   orientation. Experiment 2 (n = 33) examined the temporal dynamics of
   perceptual-attentional processing of these face constellations with
   event-related potentials. Processing of emotional and neutral faces
   differed significantly in N170 amplitudes, early posterior negativity
   (EPN), and sustained positive potentials. Importantly, selective
   emotional face processing varied as a function of face orientation,
   indicating early emotion-specific (N170, EPN) and late threat-specific
   effects (LPP, sustained positivity). Taken together, perceived personal
   relevance to the observer-conveyed by facial expression and face
   direction-amplifies emotional face processing within triadic group
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{Emotion dysregulation (ED) reflects deficits in understanding and
   managing negative emotions and may serve as a transdiagnostic mechanism
   of risk for trauma-related psychiatric disorders. Therefore,
   understanding neurobiological substrates of ED in traumatized
   individuals is critical. The present study examined associations between
   ED and baseline structural differences and patterns of functional
   activity during an emotional task in a sample of African American women
   (n = 136) recruited from an urban hospital. Participants engaged in a
   structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) session. A subsample (n =
   92) also viewed emotional face stimuli during functional MRI. ED was
   related to greater dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) surface area
   (P-corr < 0.05) and increased dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and
   ventromedial PFC activation to fearful stimuli (P-corr < 0.05),
   independent of the trauma and psychiatric symptoms. DMPFC activation was
   also associated with posttraumatic stress disorder and depression
   symptoms. Mediation analyses showed a significant mediation effect of ED
   on the relation between dmPFC activation and psychiatric symptoms. These
   findings are important since dACC and dmPFC play central roles in fear
   expression and attention to emotional stimuli. Future longitudinal
   research is needed to help solidify a model of risk for how such neural
   substrates may be impacted by traumatic experiences to create ED.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Previous neuroimaging work has shown that increased reward-related
   activity following exposure to food cues is predictive of self-control
   failure. The balance model suggests that self-regulation failures result
   from an imbalance in reward and executive control mechanisms. However,
   an open question is whether the relative balance of activity in brain
   systems associated with executive control (vs reward) supports
   self-regulatory outcomes when people encounter tempting cues in daily
   life. Sixty-nine chronic dieters, a population known for frequent lapses
   in self-control, completed a food cue-reactivity task during an fMRI
   scanning session, followed by a weeklong sampling of daily eating
   behaviors via ecological momentary assessment. We related participants'
   food cue activity in brain systems associated with executive control and
   reward to real-world eating patterns. Specifically, a balance score
   representing the amount of activity in brain regions associated with
   self-regulatory control, relative to automatic reward-related activity,
   predicted dieters' control over their eating behavior during the
   following week. This balance measure may reflect individual self-control
   capacity and be useful for examining self-regulation success in other
   domains and populations.}},

Abstract = {{Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has recently garnered
   attention as a putative depression treatment. However, the cognitive
   mechanisms by which it exerts an antidepressant effect are unclear: tDCS
   may directly alter `hot' emotional processing biases, or alleviate
   depression through changes in `cold' (non-emotional) cognitive function.
   Here, 75 healthy participants performed a facial emotion identification
   task during 20 minutes of anodal or sham tDCS over the left dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in a double-blind, within-subject crossover
   design. A subset of 31 participants additionally completed a task
   measuring attentional distraction during stimulation. Compared to sham
   stimulation, anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC resulted in an increase in
   response latency across all emotional conditions. Bayesian analysis
   showed definitively that tDCS exerted no emotion-dependent effect on
   behaviour. Thus, we demonstrate that anodal tDCS produces a general,
   rather than an emotion-specific, effect. We also report a preliminary
   finding in the subset of participants who completed the distractibility
   task: increased distractibility during active stimulation correlated
   significantly with the degree to which tDCS slowed emotion
   identification. Our results provide insight into the possible mechanisms
   by which DLPFC tDCS may treat symptoms of depression, suggesting that it
   may not alter emotional biases, but instead may affect `cold' cognitive
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of social/emotional information in working memory
   (SWM/EWM) has recently been the topic of multiple neuroimaging studies.
   However, some studies find that SWM/EWM involves a medial
   frontal-parietal network while others instead find lateral
   frontal-parietal activations similar to studies of verbal and
   visuospatial WM. In this study, we asked 26 healthy volunteers to
   complete an EWM task designed to examine whether different cognitive
   strategies- maintaining emotional images, words, or feelings- might
   account for these discrepant results. We also examined whether
   differences in EWM performance were related to general intelligence
   (IQ), emotional intelligence (EI), and emotional awareness (EA). We
   found that maintaining emotional feelings, even when accounting for
   neural activation attributable to maintaining emotional images/words,
   still activated a left lateral frontal-parietal network (including the
   anterior insula and posterior dorsomedial frontal cortex). We also found
   that individual differences in the ability to maintain feelings were
   positively associated with IQ and EA, but not with EI. These results
   suggest that maintaining the feelings of others (at least when perceived
   exteroceptively) involves similar frontal-parietal control networks to
   exteroceptive WM, and that it is similarly linked to IQ, but that it
   also may be an important component of EA.}},

Abstract = {{Mirror neurons are a subset of brain cells that discharge during action
   execution and passive observation of similar actions. An open question
   concerns the functional role of their ability to match observed and
   executed actions. Since understanding of goals requires conscious
   perception of actions, we expect that mirror neurons potentially
   involved in action goal coding, will be modulated by changes in action
   perception level. Here, we manipulated perception level of action videos
   depicting short hand movements and measured the corresponding fMRI BOLD
   responses in mirror regions. Our results show that activity levels
   within a network of regions, including the sensorimotor cortex, primary
   motor cortex, dorsal premotor cortex and posterior superior temporal
   sulcus, are sensitive to changes in action perception level, whereas
   activity levels in the inferior frontal gyrus, ventral premotor cortex,
   supplementary motor area and superior parietal lobule are invariant to
   such changes. In addition, this parcellation to two sub-networks
   manifest as smaller functional distances within each group of regions
   during task and resting state. Our results point to functional
   differences between regions within the mirror neurons system which may
   have implications with respect to their possible role in action
   understanding.}},

   town were asked to recall three event-based intentions with a strong
   link between prospective and retrospective components, three event-based
   intentions with a weak link, and three time-based intentions. They also
   underwent retrospective episodic memory, executive functions, binding in
   working memory, processing speed, and time estimation assessments.
   Results: Older individuals recalled fewer intentions than young adults.
   While age-related PM decline affected the recall of both prospective and
   retrospective components, the recall of the latter seemed more
   challenging for older individuals when the link was weak. This PM
   decline was linked to an age-related decline in the binding process in
   working memory, as well as in processing speed, executive functioning,
   and episodic memory, depending on the nature of intentions.
   Conclusion: PM appears to be sensitive to ageing, even when the device
   is thought to be ecological. This decline is particularly pronounced
   when controlled processes are needed.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) over
   the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been found to
   alleviate depressive symptoms. However, the mechanisms driving these
   effects are still poorly understood. In the current study, we tested the
   idea that this intervention protects against negative mood shifts
   following emotional provocation. We furthermore explored changes in EEG
   activity (frontal alpha asymmetry) and effects on attentional processing
   (emotional Stroop). To this end, 23 healthy individuals participated in
   two sessions separated by one week, whereby they once received 15 min of
   10Hz rTMS stimulation (1500 pulses) at 110\% of the individual motor
   threshold, and once sham stimulation. Then, negative mood was induced
   using sad movie clips. The results revealed a significantly stronger
   mood decline following rTMS compared to sham stimulation. No changes
   were observed in frontal alpha asymmetry and attentional processing. Our
   findings are at odds with the view that high frequency rTMS over the
   left DLPFC directly protects against the induction of negative mood, but
   rather suggest that it enhances the effects of emotional provocation.
   Possibly, in healthy young individuals, this stimulation protocol
   heightens susceptibility to mood induction procedures in general.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research suggests that people show increased self-referential
   processing when they provide criticism to others, and that this
   self-referential processing can have negative effects on interpersonal
   perceptions and behavior. The current research hypothesized that
   adopting a self-distanced perspective (i.e. thinking about a situation
   from a non-first person point of view), as compared with a typical
   self-immersed perspective (i.e. thinking about a situation from a
   first-person point of view), would reduce self-referential processing
   during the provision of criticism, and in turn improve interpersonal
   perceptions and behavior. We tested this hypothesis in an interracial
   context since research suggests that self-referential processing plays a
   role in damaging interracial relations. White participants prepared for
   mentorship from a self-immersed or self-distanced perspective. They then
   conveyed negative and positive evaluations to a Black mentee while
   electroencephalogram( EEG) was recorded. Source analysis revealed that
   priming a self-distanced (vs self-immersed) perspective predicted
   decreased activity in regions linked to self-referential processing
   (medial prefrontal cortex; MPFC) when providing negative evaluations.
   This decreased MPFC activity during negative evaluations, in turn,
   predicted verbal feedback that was perceived to be more positive, warm
   and helpful. Results suggest that self-distancing can improve
   interpersonal perceptions and behavior by decreasing self-referential
   processing during the provision of criticism.}},

Abstract = {{Negative emotions such as anxiety enhance pain perception. However,
   certain threat characteristics are discussed to have different or even
   divergent effects on pain (hypoalgesia vs hyperalgesia). In order to
   investigate the neurobiological basis of different threats, we compared
   the impact of conditioned threat (CT) vs instructed threat (IT) on pain
   using fMRI. In two groups, participants underwent either Pavlovian
   threat conditioning or an instructed threat procedure. Afterwards, in an
   identical test phase participants watched the same visual cues from the
   previous phase indicating potential threat or safety, and received
   painful thermal stimulation. In the test phase, pain ratings were
   increased in both groups under threat. Group comparisons show elevated
   responses in amygdala and hippocampus for pain under threat in the CT
   group, and higher activation of the mid-cingulate gyrus (MCC) in the IT
   group. Psychophysiological interaction analyses in CT demonstrated
   elevated connectivity of the amygdala and the insula for the comparison
   of pain under threat vs safety. In IT, the same comparison revealed
   elevated functional connectivity of the MCC and the insula. The results
   suggest a similar pain augmenting effect of CT and IT, which, however,
   seems to rely on different networks mediating the impact of threat on
   pain.}},

Abstract = {{Interpersonal violence (IPV) is one of the most frequent causes for the
   development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women.
   Trauma-related triggers have been proposed to evoke automatic emotional
   responses in PTSD. The present functional magnetic resonance study
   investigated the neural basis of trauma-related picture processing in
   women with IPV-PTSD (n = 18) relative to healthy controls (n = 18) using
   a newly standardized trauma-related picture set and a nonemotional
   vigilance task. We aimed to identify brain activation and connectivity
   evoked by trauma-related pictures, and associations with PTSD symptom
   severity. We found hyperactivation during trauma-related vs neutral
   picture processing in both subcortical {[}basolateral amygdala (BLA),
   thalamus, brainstem] and cortical {[}anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),
   medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), insula, occipital cortex] regions in
   IPV-PTSD. In patients, brain activation in amygdala, ACC, insula,
   occipital cortex and brainstem correlated positively with symptom
   severity. Furthermore, connectivity analyses revealed hyperconnectivity
   between BLA and dorsal ACC/mPFC. Results show symptom severity-dependent
   brain activation and hyperconnectivity in response to trauma-related
   pictures in brain regions related to fear and visual processing in women
   suffering from IPV-PTSD. These brain mechanisms appear to be associated
   with immediate responses to trauma-related triggers presented in a
   non-emotional context in this PTSD subgroup.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to voluntarily regulate our emotional response to
   threatening and highly arousing stimuli by using cognitive reappraisal
   strategies is essential for our mental and physical well-being. This
   might be achieved by prefrontal brain regions (e.g. inferior frontal
   gyrus, IFG) down-regulating activity in the amygdala. It is unknown, to
   which degree effective connectivity within the emotion-regulation
   network is linked to individual differences in reappraisal skills. Using
   psychophysiological interaction analyses of functional magnetic
   resonance imaging data, we examined changes in inter-regional
   connectivity between the amygdala and IFG with other brain regions
   during reappraisal of emotional responses and used emotion regulation
   success as an explicit regressor. During down-regulation of emotion,
   reappraisal success correlated with effective connectivity between IFG
   with dorsolateral, dorsomedial and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC).
   During up-regulation of emotion, effective coupling between IFG with
   anterior cingulate cortex, dorsomedial and ventromedial PFC as well as
   the amygdala correlated with reappraisal success. Activity in the
   amygdala covaried with activity in lateral and medial prefrontal regions
   during the up-regulation of emotion and correlated with reappraisal
   success. These results suggest that successful reappraisal is linked to
   changes in effective connectivity between two systems, prefrontal
   cognitive control regions and regions crucially involved in emotional
   evaluation.}},

   underlying such subliminal evaluative priming effects, response
   activation vs semantic processing, are matter of a debate. In this
   study, we determined the relative contribution of semantic processing
   and response activation to masked evaluative priming with pictures and
   words. To this end, we investigated the modulation of masked pictorial
   vs verbal priming by previously activated perceptual vs semantic task
   sets and assessed the electrophysiological correlates of priming using
   event-related potential (ERP) recordings. Behavioral and
   electrophysiological effects showed a differential modulation of
   pictorial and verbal subliminal priming by previously activated task
   sets: Pictorial priming was only observed during the perceptual but not
   during the semantic task set. Verbal priming, in contrast, was found
   when either task set was activated. Furthermore, only verbal priming was
   associated with a modulation of the N400 ERP component, an index of
   semantic processing, whereas a priming-related modulation of earlier
   ERPs, indexing visuo-motor S-R activation, was found for both picture
   and words. The results thus demonstrate that different neuro-cognitive
   processes contribute to unconscious evaluative priming depending on the
   stimulus format.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals differ in their motives and strategies to cooperate in
   social dilemmas. These differences are reflected by an individual's
   social value orientation: proselfs are strategic and motivated to
   maximize self-interest, while prosocials are more trusting and value
   fairness. We hypothesize that when deciding whether or not to cooperate
   with a random member of a defined group, proselfs, more than prosocials,
   adapt their decisions based on past experiences: they `learn'
   instrumentally to form a base-line expectation of reciprocity. We
   conducted an fMRI experiment where participants (19 proselfs and 19
   prosocials) played 120 sequential prisoner's dilemmas against randomly
   selected, anonymous and returning partners who cooperated 60\% of the
   time. Results indicate that cooperation levels increased over time, but
   that the rate of learning was steeper for proselfs than for prosocials.
   At the neural level, caudate and precuneus activation were more
   pronounced for proselfs relative to prosocials, indicating a stronger
   reliance on instrumental learning and self-referencing to update their
   trust in the cooperative strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Social learning is fundamental to human interactions, yet its
   computational and physiological mechanisms are not well understood. One
   prominent open question concerns the role of neuromodulatory
   transmitters. We combined fMRI, computational modelling and genetics to
   address this question in two separate samples (N = 35, N = 47).
   Participants played a game requiring inference on an adviser's
   intentions whose motivation to help or mislead changed over time. Our
   analyses suggest that hierarchically structured belief updates about
   current advice validity and the adviser's trustworthiness, respectively,
   depend on different neuromodulatory systems. Low-level prediction errors
   (PEs) about advice accuracy not only activated regions known to support
   `theory of mind', but also the dopaminergic midbrain. Furthermore, PE
   responses in ventral striatum were influenced by the Met/Val
   polymorphism of the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene. By
   contrast, high-level PEs ('expected uncertainty') about the adviser's
   fidelity activated the cholinergic septum. These findings, replicated in
   both samples, have important implications: They suggest that social
   learning rests on hierarchically related PEs encoded by midbrain and
   septum activity, respectively, in the same manner as other forms of
   learning under volatility. Furthermore, these hierarchical PEs may be
   broadcast by dopaminergic and cholinergic projections to induce
   plasticity specifically in cortical areas known to represent beliefs
   about others.}},

Abstract = {{Humans often give in to temptations that are in conflict with valuable
   long-termgoals like health or saving for the future. Such willpower
   failures represent a prevalent problem in everyday life and in many
   psychiatric disorders. Strategies that increase resistance to
   temptations could therefore improve overall societal well-being. One
   important strategy is to voluntarily precommit, i.e. to restrict one's
   future action space by removing the tempting short-term option from the
   choice set, thereby leaving only the long-term option for
   implementation. The neural mechanisms necessary to implement
   precommitment have remained unknown. Here, we test whether anodal
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the frontopolar
   cortex (FPC) can improve precommitment. Participants performed a
   self-control task in which they could precommit to obtain a delayed
   larger reward by removing an immediately available smaller reward from
   the future choice options. We found that anodal stimulation over FPC
   selectively increased the propensity to precommit. In contrast, tDCS had
   no effects on non-binding decisions, impulse control or reward
   preference. Our data establish a causal role for the FPC in the
   implementation of precommitment, revealing a novel route to improving
   resistance against temptations.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{It has been shown that as cognitive demands of a non-emotional task
   increase, amygdala response to task-irrelevant emotional stimuli is
   reduced. However, it remains unclear whether effects are due to altered
   task demands, or altered perceptual input associated with task demands.
   Here, we present fMRI data from 20 adult males during a novel cognitive
   conflict task in which the requirement to scan emotional information was
   necessary for task performance and held constant across levels of
   cognitive conflict. Response to fearful facial expressions was
   attenuated under high (vs low) conflict conditions, as indexed by both
   slower reaction times and reduced right amygdala response.
   Psychophysiological interaction analysis showed that increased amygdala
   response to fear in the low conflict condition was accompanied by
   increased functional coupling with middle frontal gyrus, a prefrontal
   region previously associated with emotion regulation during cognitive
   task performance. These data suggest that amygdala response to emotion
   is modulated as a function of task demands, even when perceptual inputs
   are closely matched across load conditions. PPI data also show that, in
   particular emotional contexts, increased functional coupling of amygdala
   with prefrontal cortex can paradoxically occur when executive demands
   are lower.}},

Abstract = {{Pleasurable stimuli, including reward, inhibit pain, but the level of
   the neuraxis at which they do so and the cerebral processes involved are
   unknown. Here, we characterized a brain circuitry mediating pain
   inhibition by reward. Twenty-four healthy participants underwent
   functional magnetic resonance imaging while playing a wheel of fortune
   game with simultaneous thermal pain stimuli and monetary wins or losses.
   As expected, winning decreased pain perception compared to losing.
   Inter-individual differences in pain modulation by monetary wins
   relative to losses correlated with activation in the medial
   orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). When pain and reward occured
   simultaneously, mOFCs functional connectivity changed: the signal time
   course in the mOFC condition-dependent correlated negatively with the
   signal time courses in the rostral anterior insula, anterior-dorsal
   cingulate cortex and primary somatosensory cortex, which might signify
   moment-to-moment down-regulation of these regions by the mOFC. Monetary
   wins and losses did not change the magnitude of pain-related activation,
   including in regions that code perceived pain intensity when nociceptive
   input varies and/or receive direct nociceptive input. Pain inhibition by
   reward appears to involve brain regions not typically involved in
   nociceptive intensity coding but likely mediate changes in the
   significance and/or value of pain.}},

Abstract = {{Synchronous movement is a key component of social behavior in several
   species including humans. Recent theories have suggested a link between
   interpersonal synchrony of brain oscillations and interpersonal movement
   synchrony. The present study investigated this link. Using transcranial
   alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied over the left motor
   cortex, we induced beta band (20 Hz) oscillations in pairs of
   individuals who both performed a finger-tapping task with the right
   hand. In-phase or anti-phase oscillations were delivered during a
   preparatory period prior to movement and while the tapping task was
   performed. In-phase 20Hz stimulation enhanced interpersonal movement
   synchrony, compared with anti-phase or sham stimulation, particularly
   for the initial taps following the preparatory period. This was
   confirmed in an analysis comparing real vs pseudo pair surrogate data.
   No enhancement was observed for stimulation frequencies of 2Hz (matching
   the target movement frequency) or 10 Hz (alpha band). Thus,
   phase-coupling of beta band neural oscillations across two individuals'
   (resting) motor cortices supports the interpersonal alignment of
   sensorimotor processes that regulate rhythmic action initiation, thereby
   facilitating the establishment of synchronous movement. Phase-locked
   dual brain stimulation provides a promising method to study causal
   effects of interpersonal brain synchrony on social, sensorimotor and
   cognitive processes.}},

Abstract = {{The five-factor model (FFM) is a widely used taxonomy of human
   personality; yet its neuro anatomical basis remains unclear. This is
   partly because past associations between gray-matter volume and FFM were
   driven by different surface-based morphometry (SBM) indices (i.e.
   cortical thickness, surface area, cortical folding or any combination of
   them). To overcome this limitation, we used Free-Surfer to study how
   variability in SBM measures was related to the FFM in n = 507
   participants from the Human Connectome Project.
   Neuroticismwas associated with thicker cortex and smaller area and
   folding in prefrontal-temporal regions. Extraversion was linked to
   thicker pre-cuneus and smaller superior temporal cortex area. Openness
   was linked to thinner cortex and greater area and folding in
   prefrontal-parietal regions. Agreeableness was correlated to thinner
   prefrontal cortex and smaller fusiform gyrus area. Conscientiousness was
   associated with thicker cortex and smaller area and folding in
   prefrontal regions. These findings demonstrate that anatomical
   variability in prefrontal cortices is linked to individual differences
   in the socio-cognitive dispositions described by the FFM. Cortical
   thickness and surface area/folding were inversely related each others as
   a function of different FFM traits (neuroticism, extraversion and
   consciousness vs openness), which may reflect brain maturational effects
   that predispose or protect against psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Less racially prototypic faces elicit more category competition during
   race categorization. Top-down factors (e.g. stereotypes), however,
   affect categorizations, suggesting racial prototypicality may enhance
   category competition in certain perceivers. Here, we examined how
   prejudice affects race category competition and stabilization when
   perceiving faces varying in racial prototypicality. Prototypically low
   vs high Black relative to White faces elicited more category competition
   and slower response latencies during categorization (Experiment 1),
   suggesting a pronounced racial prototypicality effect on minority race
   categorization. However, prejudice predicted the extent of category
   competition between prototypically low vs high Black faces. Suggesting
   more response conflict toward less prototypic Black vs White faces,
   anterior cingulate cortex activity increased toward Black vs White faces
   as they decreased in racial prototypicality, with prejudice positively
   predicting this difference (Experiment 2). These findings extend the
   literature on racial prototypicality and categorization by showing that
   relative prejudice tempers the extent of category competition and
   response conflict engaged when initially perceiving faces.}},

Abstract = {{Humans have a remarkable capacity for rapid affective learning. For
   instance, using first-order US such as odors or electric shocks,
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies of multi-CS conditioning
   demonstrate enhanced early (<150 ms) and mid-latency (150-300 ms) visual
   evoked responses to affectively conditioned faces, together with changes
   in stimulus evaluation. However, particularly in social contexts, human
   affective learning is often mediated by language, a class of complex
   higher-order US. To elucidate mechanisms of this type of learning, we
   investigate how face processing changes following verbal evaluative
   multi-CS conditioning. Sixty neutral expression male faces were paired
   with phrases about aversive crimes (30) or neutral occupations (30).
   Post conditioning, aversively associated faces evoked stronger magnetic
   fields in a mid-latency interval between 220 and 320 ms, localized
   primarily in left visual cortex. Aversively paired faces were also rated
   as more arousing and more unpleasant, evaluative changes occurring both
   with and without contingency awareness. However, no early MEG effects
   were found, implying that verbal evaluative conditioning may require
   conceptual processing and does not engage rapid, possibly sub-cortical,
   pathways. Results demonstrate the efficacy of verbal evaluative multi-CS
   conditioning and indicate both common and distinct neural mechanisms of
   first-and higher-order multi-CS conditioning, thereby informing theories
   of associative learning.}},

Abstract = {{Dopaminergic reward prediction errors in monkeys reflect inferential
   reward predictions that well-trained animals can make when associative
   rules change. Here, in a new analysis of previously described data, we
   test whether dopaminergic error signals in rats are influenced by
   inferential predictions and whether such effects depend on the
   orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Dopamine neurons were recorded from controls
   or rats with ipsilateral OFC lesions during performance of a choice task
   in which odor cues signaled the availability of sucrose reward in 2
   wells. To induce prediction errors, we manipulated either the timing or
   number of rewards delivered in each well across blocks of trials. Of
   importance, a change in reward at 1 well predicted a change in reward at
   the other on later trials. We compared behavior and neural activity on
   trials when such inference was possible versus trials involving the same
   reward change when inference was not possible. Rats responded faster
   when they could infer an increase in reward compared to when the same
   reward was coming but they could not infer a change. This inferential
   prediction was reflected in the firing of dopamine neurons in controls,
   which changed less to unexpected delivery (or omission) of reward and
   more to the new high-value cue on inference versus noninference trials.
   These effects were absent in dopamine neurons recorded in rats with
   ipsilateral OFC lesions. Thus, dopaminergic error signals recorded in
   rats are influenced by both experiential and inferential reward
   predictions, and the effects of inferential predictions depend on OFC.}},

Abstract = {{Degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in Parkinson's
   disease (PD) causes motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment, but the
   etiology of the cognitive deficits remains unclear. The present study
   investigated the behavioral effects of partial lesions of the

   of either 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or vehicle into the dorsolateral
   striatum and were tested in spatial and procedural learning tasks.
   Compared with intact rats, DA-depleted rats were impaired when the first
   task they learned required egocentric responses. Intact rats that
   received prior training on a spatial task were impaired while learning a
   subsequent body-turn task, suggesting that prior spatial training may
   compete with egocentric learning in intact but not DA-depleted rats.
   Spatial discrimination, reversal learning, and switching between
   allocentric and egocentric strategies were similar in both groups. The
   results suggest that DA loss that is not associated with gross motor
   pathology temporarily impairs egocentric, but not allocentric, learning
   or subsequent behavioral flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined the role of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS)
   in extinction behavior. Male Long-Evans rats were initially trained on
   the straight alley maze, in which they were reinforced to traverse a
   straight runway and retrieve food reward at the opposite end of the
   maze. After initial acquisition, animals were given extinction training
   using 1 of 2 distinct protocols: response extinction or latent
   extinction. For response extinction, the animal was released from the
   same starting position and had the opportunity to perform the originally
   reinforced approach response to the goal end of the maze, which no
   longer contained food. For latent extinction, the animal was confined to
   the original goal location without food, allowing the animal to form a
   new cognitive expectation (i.e., that the goal location is no longer
   reinforced). Immediately before response or latent extinction training,
   animals received bilateral intra-DLS administration of the sodium
   channel blocker bupivacaine or control injections of physiological
   saline. Results indicated that neural inactivation of the DLS with
   bupivacaine impaired response extinction, but did not influence latent
   extinction. The dissociation observed indicates that the DLS selectively
   mediates extinction mechanisms involving suppression of the original
   response, as opposed to cognitive mechanisms involving a change in
   expectation.}},

Abstract = {{The present experiment was designed to determine if the absence of an
   auditory cue (i.e., a ``tone-off{''} cue) would be an effective
   conditioned stimulus (CS) for delay eyeblink conditioning and to test if
   the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) is part of the sensory pathway for
   tone-off conditioning. Rats were given paired or unpaired delay eyeblink
   conditioning to examine if responding to a tone-off CS was due to an
   associative process. An inactivation technique was performed on a
   separate group of rats to determine if the MGN is needed to express
   tone-off conditioning. The results showed that rats given paired
   conditioning acquired robust conditioned eyeblink responses (CRs)
   compared with rats given unpaired conditioning and that expression of
   tone-off elicited CRs was impaired when the MGN was inactivated. The
   findings suggest that tone-on and tone-off eyeblink conditioning may
   share a common neural pathway.}},

Abstract = {{In humans, relapse to unhealthy eating habits following dieting is a
   significant impediment to obesity treatment. Food-associated cues are
   one of the main triggers of relapse to unhealthy eating during
   self-imposed abstinence. Here we report a behavioral method examining
   cue-induced relapse to food seeking following punishment-induced
   suppression of food taking. We trained male rats to lever press for food
   pellets that were delivered after a 10-s conditional stimulus (CS)
   (appetitive). Following training, 25\% of reinforced lever presses
   resulted in the presentation of a compound stimulus consisting of a
   novel CS (aversive) and the appetitive CS followed by a pellet and
   footshock. After punishment-imposed abstinence, we tested the rats in an
   extinction test where lever pressing resulted in the presentation of
   either the appetitive or aversive CS. We then compared activity of
   lateral hypothalamus (LH) and associated extrahypothalamic regions
   following this test. We also assessed Fos expression in LH orexin and
   GABA neurons. We found that cue-induced relapse of food seeking on test
   was higher in rats tested with the appetitive CS compared to the
   aversive CS. Relapse induced by the appetitive CS was associated with
   increased Fos expression in LH, caudal basolateral amygdala (BLA), and
   medial amygdala (MeA). This relapse was also associated with increased
   Fos expression in LH orexin and VGAT-expressing neurons. These data show
   that relapse to food seeking can be induced by food-associated cues
   after punishment-imposed abstinence, and this relapse is associated with
   increased activity in LH, caudal BLA, and MeA.}},

Abstract = {{Research in nonhuman animals reveals threat-sensitive generalization of
   defensive behavior that favors widespread generalization when threat
   intensity is high and limited generalization (i.e., specificity) when
   threat intensity is low. Here, we used Pavlovian fear conditioning to
   systematically investigate whether threat intensity widens behavioral
   generalization gradients to stimuli that decreasingly resemble a learned
   threat cue. Using a between-subjects design, volunteers underwent fear
   conditioning with a tone paired with either a high-intensity or
   low-intensity aversive stimulus prior to a test of fear generalization
   to novel tones. Results showed no effect of threat intensity on initial
   acquisition of conditioned fear. However, volunteers who underwent fear
   conditioning with a high-intensity aversive stimulus exhibited
   widespread generalization of autonomic arousal (skin conductance
   responses) as compared to volunteers who received a low-intensity
   aversive stimulus. These results show a transition from normal
   (selective) to overgeneralized fear as threat intensity increases, and
   have implications for understanding overgeneralization characteristic of
   trauma-and stress-related disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Social signals play a primary role in regulating social relationships
   among male mice. The present series of experiments investigated the
   neural mechanisms underlying an induction of amicable cues that
   facilitate social approach in male mice of the C57BL/6 (B6) and BALB/c
   (BALB) strains. Male mice exhibit approach behavior and suppression of
   territorial scent marking toward amicable counterparts. Exposure of a
   group-housed mouse that maintains an amicable relationship induced
   social approach in B6 recipient mice, as expressed by increased
   preference of stay in proximity and decreased scent marks relevant to
   those of a single-housed mouse. Nasal administration of oxytocin (OT) to
   stimulus mice appeared to enhance social approach in B6 recipient mice.
   Systemic administration of buspirone (5-HT1A agonist) to stimulus mice
   also increased approach in B6 recipient mice, whereas a nasal OT
   antagonist infusion followed by systemic buspirone injection of stimulus
   mice blocked this buspirone-induced approach in B6 recipient mice. BALB
   mice likely possess an intact signaling system as shown in B6 mice, in
   which the 5-HT -> OT pathway is a primary modulator for social amicable
   signals. However, BALB mice could not exhibit signal-dependent change in
   approach behavior. No impairment in olfactory discrimination or approach
   behavior toward social stimuli was found in BALB mice. It is concluded
   that social cues for facilitating social approach are eliminated via the
   5-HT -> OT pathway, and BALB mice as a low social strain have a deficit
   in recognition of specific signals associated with amicability.}},

Abstract = {{The amygdala is an integrator of affective processing, and a key
   component of a network regulating social behavior. While decades of
   lesion studies in nonhuman primates have shown alterations in social
   interactions after amygdala damage, acute manipulations of the amygdala
   in primates have been underexplored. We recently reported (Wellman,
   Forcelli, Aguilar, \& Malkova, 2016) that acute pharmacological
   inhibition of the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) or the
   central nucleus of the amygdala increased affiliative social
   interactions in experimental dyads of macaques; this was achieved
   through microinjection of a GABA-A receptor agonist. Prior studies in
   rodents have shown similar effects achieved by blocking NMDA receptors
   or AMPA receptors within the BLA. Here, we sought to determine the role
   of these receptor systems in the primate BLA in the context of social
   behavior. In familiar dyads, we microinjected the NMDA receptor
   antagonist 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (AP7) or the AMPA receptor
   antagonist
   2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo{[}f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide
   (NBQX) and observed behaviors and social interactions in the immediate
   postinjection period. In striking contrast with our prior report using
   GABA agonists, and in contrast with prior reports in rodents using
   glutamate antagonists, we found that neither NMDA nor AMPA blockade
   increase social interaction. Both treatments, however, were associated
   with decreases in locomotion and manipulation and increases in passive
   behavior. These data suggest that local blockade of glutamatergic
   neurotransmission in BLA is not the functional equivalent of local
   activation of GABAergic signaling, and raise interesting questions
   regarding the functional microcircuitry of the nonhuman primate amygdala
   in the context of social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals differ in their tendency to perceive negativity in ambiguous
   situations or facial expressions. Prior research demonstrates that this
   so-called ``negativity bias{''} is exaggerated in children; for
   instance, when they rate the emotional content of neutral facial
   expressions. However, neutral faces are frequently used as a baseline
   condition in pediatric emotion processing studies, as they are thought
   to be emotionally neutral. Here, we present data that challenge that
   notion. We demonstrate that children and adolescents rate neutral faces,
   particularly of adults, as negative, similar to ratings elicited by
   angry faces. In addition, we found a lack of age-related decrease in
   reaction time for neutral adult faces, suggesting that these stimuli
   remain salient across development. Demonstrating the relevance of
   individual differences, higher negativity bias was associated with lower
   self-reported reward sensitivity and increased functional connectivity
   of the amygdala. Together, these findings indicate that neutral faces
   are not perceived as emotionally neutral in children, thus discouraging
   their use as baseline condition in pediatric research. These data also
   offer a potential neurobiological substrate of the negativity bias in
   children. The link to corticolimbic emotion-processing circuitry and
   affective experience implies that exaggerations in these biases may be
   relevant for the development of emotional psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Parenting styles are robust predictors of offspring outcomes, yet little
   is known about their neural underpinnings. In this study, 44
   parent-adolescent dyads (M-age of adolescent = 12.9) completed a
   laboratory guessing task while EEG was continuously recorded. In the
   task, each pair member received feedback about their own monetary wins
   and losses and also observed the monetary wins and losses of the other
   member of the pair. We examined the association between self-reported
   parenting style and parents' electrophysiological responses to watching
   their adolescent winning and losing money, dubbed the observational
   Reward Positivity (RewP) and observational feedback negativity (FN),
   respectively. Self-reported authoritarian parenting predicted reductions
   in parents' observational RewP but not FN. This predictive relationship
   remained after adjusting for sex of both participants, parents'
   responsiveness to their own wins, and parental psychopathology.
   `Exploratory analyses found that permissive parenting was associated
   with a blunting of the adolescents' response to their parents' losses'.
   These findings suggest that parents' rapid neural responses to their
   child's successes may relate to the harsh parenting behaviors associated
   with authoritarian parenting.}},

Abstract = {{Trust and cooperation often break down across group boundaries,
   contributing to pernicious consequences, from polarized political
   structures to intractable conflict. As such, addressing such conflicts
   require first understanding why trust is reduced in intergroup settings.
   Here, we clarify the structure of intergroup trust using neuroscientific
   and behavioral methods. We found that trusting ingroup members produced
   activity in brain areas associated with reward, whereas trusting
   outgroup members produced activity in areas associated with top-down
   control. Behaviorally, time pressurewhich reduces people's ability to
   exert control-reduced individuals' trust in outgroup, but not ingroup
   members. These data suggest that the exertion of control can help
   recover trust in intergroup settings, offering potential avenues for
   reducing intergroup failures in trust and the consequences of these
   failures.}},

Abstract = {{Our attitudes toward others influence a wide range of everyday behaviors
   and have been the most extensively studied concept in the history of
   social psychology. Yet they remain difficult to measure reliably and
   objectively, since both explicit and implicit measures are typically
   confounded by other psychological processes. We here address the
   feasibility of decoding incidental attitudes based on brain activations.
   Participants were presented with pictures of members of a Japanese idol
   group inside an functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner while
   performing an unrelated detection task, and subsequently (outside the
   scanner) performed an incentive-compatible choice task that revealed
   their attitude toward each celebrity. We used a real-world election
   scheme that exists for this idol group, which confirmed both strongly
   negative and strongly positive attitudes toward specific individuals.
   Whole-brain multivariate analyses (searchlight-based support vector
   regression) showed that activation patterns in the anterior striatum
   predicted each participant's revealed attitudes (choice behavior) using
   leave-one-out (as well as 4-fold) cross-validation across participants.
   In contrast, attitude extremity (unsigned magnitude) could be decoded
   from a distinct region in the posterior striatum. The findings
   demonstrate dissociable striatal representations of valenced attitude
   and attitude extremity and constitute a first step toward an objective
   and process-pure neural measure of attitudes.}},

Abstract = {{There is extensive discussion on whether spontaneous and explicit forms
   of ToM are based on the same cognitive/neural mechanisms or rather
   reflect qualitatively different processes. For the first time, we
   analyzed the BOLD signal for false belief processing by directly
   comparing spontaneous and explicit ToM task versions. In both versions,
   participants watched videos of a scene including an agent who acquires a
   true or false belief about the location of an object (belief formation
   phase). At the end of the movies (outcome phase), participants had to
   react to the presence of the object. During the belief formation phase,
   greater activity was found for false vs true belief trials in the right
   posterior parietal cortex. The ROI analysis of the right
   temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), confirmed this observation. Moreover,
   the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (aMPFC) was active during the
   outcome phase, being sensitive to violation of both the participant's
   and agent's expectations about the location of the object. Activity in
   the TPJ and aMPFC was not modulated by the spontaneous/explicit task.
   Overall, these data show that neural mechanisms for spontaneous and
   explicit ToM overlap. Interestingly, a dissociation between TPJ and
   aMPFC for belief tracking and outcome evaluation, respectively, was also
   found.}},

Abstract = {{Recent behavioral investigations suggest that acute stress can increase
   prosocial behavior. Here, we investigated whether increased empathy
   represents a potential mechanism for this finding. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging, we assessed the effects of acute stress on
   neural responses related to automatic and regulatory components of
   empathy for pain as well as subsequent prosocial behavior. Stress
   increased activation in brain areas associated with the automatic
   sharing of others' pain, such as the anterior insula, the anterior
   midcingulate cortex, and the primary somatosensory cortex. In addition,
   we found increased prosocial behavior under stress. Furthermore,
   activation in the anterior midcingulate cortex mediated the effects of
   stress on prosocial behavior. However, stressed participants also
   displayed stronger and inappropriate other-related responses in
   situations which required them to take the perspective of another
   person, and to regulate their automatic affective responses. Thus, while
   acute stress may increase prosocial behavior by intensifying the sharing
   of others' emotions, this comes at the cost of reduced cognitive
   appraisal abilities. Depending on the contextual constraints, stress may
   therefore affect empathy in ways that are either beneficial or
   detrimental.}},

Abstract = {{Angry expressions of both voices and faces represent disorder-relevant
   stimuli in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Although individuals with SAD
   show greater amygdala activation to angry faces, previous work has
   failed to find comparable effects for angry voices. Here, we
   investigated whether voice sound-intensity, a modulator of a voice's
   threat-relevance, affects brain responses to angry prosody in SAD. We
   used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore
   brain responses to voices varying in sound intensity and emotional
   prosody in SAD patients and healthy controls (HCs). Angry and neutral
   voices were presented either with normal or high sound amplitude, while
   participants had to decide upon the speaker's gender. Loud vs normal
   voices induced greater insula activation, and angry vs neutral prosody
   greater orbitofrontal cortex activation in SAD as compared with HC
   subjects. Importantly, an interaction of sound intensity, prosody and
   group was found in the insula and the amygdala. In particular, the
   amygdala showed greater activation to loud angry voices in SAD as
   compared with HC subjects. This finding demonstrates a modulating role
   of voice sound-intensity on amygdalar hyperresponsivity to angry prosody
   in SAD and suggests that abnormal processing of interpersonal threat
   signals in amygdala extends beyond facial expressions in SAD.}},

Abstract = {{Rewards reliably elicit ventral striatum activity. More recently studies

   striatum responses to rewards for self peak during adolescence. However,
   it is currently not well understood how ventral striatum responses to
   vicarious rewards develop. In this study, we test this question using
   behavioral and fMRI data. A total of 233 participants aged 9-26 years
   old played a gambling game in the scanner in which they could win or
   lose money for themselves, their best friend and mother. Participants
   rated how close they felt to their friend and mother and how much they
   liked winning for them. These ratings were positively correlated. On the
   neural level males showed higher responses to winning for a friend, but
   there were no age differences. In contrast, there was a quadratic effect
   of age when winning for mother, showing heightened ventral striatum
   activity in mid-adolescence. Furthermore, there was an interaction
   between age and sex; for females responses to winning for friends become
   stronger with age relative to winning for mothers. In conclusion, this
   study provided evidence for elevated ventral striatumresponses for
   mothers in mid-adolescence, and a shift in ventral striatum responses

Abstract = {{Rules, whether in the form of norms, taboos or laws, regulate and
   coordinate human life. Some rules, however, are arbitrary and adhering
   to them can be personally costly. Rigidly sticking to such rules can be
   considered maladaptive. Here, we test whether, at the neurobiological
   level, (mal) adaptive rule adherence is reduced by oxytocin-a
   hypothalamic neuropeptide that biases the biobehavioural
   approach-avoidance system. Participants (N = 139) self-administered
   oxytocin or placebo intranasally, and reported their need for structure
   and approach-avoidance sensitivity. Next, participants made binary
   decisions and were given an arbitrary rule that demanded to forgo
   financial benefits. Under oxytocin, participants violated the rule more
   often, especially when they had high need for structure and high
   approach sensitivity. Possibly, oxytocin dampens the need for a highly
   structured environment and enables individuals to flexibly trade-off
   internal desires against external restrictions. Implications for the
   treatment of clinical disorders marked by maladaptive rule adherence are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Adolescence is a period of learning, exploration, and continuous

   adolescence is an important, understudied, and developmentally
   appropriate behavior. The purpose of this study was to identify the
   association between performance on a dynamic risky decision making task
   and white matter microstructure in a sample of 48 adolescents (14-16
   years). Individuals with the greatest response variability on the task
   obtained the widest range of experience with potential outcomes to risky
   choice. When compared with their more behaviorally consistent peers,
   adolescents with greater response variability rated real-world examples
   of risk taking behaviors as less risky via self-report. Tract-Based
   Spatial Statistics (TBSS) were used to examine fractional anisotropy
   (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Greater FA in long-range, late-maturing
   tracts was associated with higher response variability. Greater FA and
   lower MD were associated with lower riskiness ratings of real-world
   risky behaviors. Results suggest that response variability and lower
   perceived risk attitudes of real-world risk are supported by neural

Abstract = {{Cognitive reappraisal and placebo administration constitute two
   different approaches for modulating one's own emotional state. Whereas
   reappraisal is an explicit (effortful) type of self-regulation, placebo
   treatment initiates implicit processes of affective control. The brain
   mechanisms underlying these processes have not been directly compared
   with each other up until now; doing this enables the identification of
   distinct and shared neuronal features. We conducted a functional
   magnetic resonance imaging study with 45 women, who were presented with
   disgusting and neutral images in a block design, at three experimental
   sessions, over 3 consecutive days. They were asked to passively view the
   images in one session, engage in reappraisal in another, and in another
   session they received a placebo pill: a disgust-reducing `anti-nausea
   drug'. Relative to passive viewing, both reappraisal and placebo
   treatment effectively reduced the experienced disgust intensity. In the
   placebo condition, this reduction was associated with decreased
   activation of the insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
   In contrast, reappraisal induced increased activation in both regions.
   Furthermore, both regulation strategies were associated with opposite
   patterns of connectivity in a network encompassing the amygdala, the
   insula and the DLPFC. Only placebo administration led to a reduced
   coupling in this network.}},

Abstract = {{As a personality trait, grit involves the tendency to strive to achieve
   long-termgoals with continual passion and perseverance and plays an
   extremely crucial role in personal achievement. However, the neural
   mechanisms of grit remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to
   explore the association between grit and the fractional amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in 217 healthy adolescent students
   using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). We
   found that an individual's grit was negatively related to the regional
   fALFF in the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), which is
   involved in self-regulation, planning, goal setting and maintenance, and
   counterfactual thinking for reflecting on past failures. The results
   persisted even after the effects of general intelligence and the `big
   five' personality traits were adjusted for. More importantly, the fALFF
   of the right DMPFC played a mediating role in the association between
   grit and academic performance. Overall, these findings reveal regional
   fALFF as a neural basis of grit and highlight the right DMPFC as a
   neural link between grit and academic performance.}},

Abstract = {{Through associative reward learning, arbitrary cues acquire the ability
   to automatically capture visual attention. Previous studies have
   examined the neural correlates of value-driven attentional orienting,
   revealing elevated activity within a network of brain regions
   encompassing the visual corticostriatal loop {[}caudate tail, lateral
   occipital complex (LOC) and early visual cortex] and intraparietal
   sulcus (IPS). Such attentional priority signals raise a broader question
   concerning how visual signals are combined with reward signals during
   learning to create a representation that is sensitive to the confluence
   of the two. This study examines reward signals during the cued reward
   training phase commonly used to generate value-driven attentional
   biases. High, compared with low, reward feedback preferentially
   activated the value-driven attention network, in addition to regions
   typically implicated in reward processing. Further examination of these
   reward signals within the visual system revealed information about the
   identity of the preceding cue in the caudate tail and LOC, and
   information about the location of the preceding cue in IPS, while early
   visual cortex represented both location and identity. The results reveal
   teaching signals within the value-driven attention network during
   associative reward learning, and further suggest functional
   specialization within different regions of this network during the
   acquisition of an integrated representation of stimulus value.}},

Abstract = {{Approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) refers to situations associated with
   both rewarding and threatening outcomes. The AAC task was developed to
   measure AAC decision-making. Approach behavior during this task has been
   linked to self-reported anxiety sensitivity and has elicited anterior
   cingulate, insula, caudate and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   (dlPFC) activity, with right lateral PFC tracking the extent of approach
   behavior. Guided by these results, we used excitatory transcranial
   direct current stimulation (tDCS) to demonstrate the causal involvement
   of right dlPFC in AAC decision-making. Participants received anodal tDCS
   at 1.5mA over either left or right dlPFC or sham stimulation, while
   performing the AAC task and a control short-termmemory task. Analyses of
   variance (ANOVA) revealed that for individuals with high anxiety
   sensitivity excitatory right (but not left or sham) dlPFC stimulation
   elicited measurable decreases in approach behavior during conflict.
   Excitatory left (but not right or sham) dlPFC simulation improved
   performance on the control task. These results support a possible
   asymmetry between the contributions of right and left dlPFC to AAC
   resolution during emotional decision-making. Increased activity in right
   dlPFC may contribute to anxiety-related symptoms and, as such, serve as
   a neurobehavioral target of anxiolytic treatments aiming to decrease
   avoidance behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The rostral-ventral subdivision of the anterior cingulate cortex (rACC)
   plays a key role in the regulation of emotional processing. Although
   rACC has strong anatomical connections with anterior insular cortex
   (AIC), amygdala, prefrontal cortex and striatal brain regions, it is
   unclear whether the functional connectivity of rACC with these regions
   changes when regulating emotional processing. Furthermore, it is not
   known whether this connectivity changes with deficits in emotion
   regulation seen in different kinds of anxiety and depression. To address
   these questions regarding rACC functional connectivity, non-patients
   high in self-reported anxious apprehension (AP), anxious arousal (AR),
   anhedonic depression (AD) or none (CON) indicated the ink color of
   pleasant, neutral and unpleasant words during functional magnetic
   resonance imaging. While ignoring task-irrelevant unpleasant words, AD
   and CON showed an increase in the functional connectivity of rACC with
   AIC, putamen, caudate and ventral pallidum. There was a decrease in this
   connectivity in AP and AR, with AP showing greater reduction than AR.
   These findings provide support for the role of rACC in integrating
   interoceptive, emotional and cognitive functions via interactions with
   insula and striatal regions during effective emotion regulation in
   healthy individuals and a failure of this integration that may be
   specific to anxiety, particularly AP.}},

Abstract = {{The recognition of facial expressions of emotion is adaptive for human
   social interaction, but the ability to do this and the manner in which
   it is achieved differs among individuals. Previous functional
   neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that some brain regions, such as
   the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), are active during the response to
   emotional facial expressions in healthy participants, and lesion studies
   have demonstrated that damage to these structures impairs the
   recognition of facial expressions. However, it remains to be established
   whether individual differences in the structure of these regions could
   be associated with differences in the ability to recognize facial
   expressions. We investigated this issue using acquired structural
   magnetic resonance imaging, and assessed the performance of healthy
   adults with respect to recognition of the facial expressions of six
   basic emotions. The gray matter volume of the right IFG positively
   correlated with the total accuracy of facial expression recognition.
   This suggests that individual differences in the ability to recognize
   facial expressions are associated with differences in the structure of
   the right IFG. Furthermore, the mirror neuron activity of the IFG may be
   important for establishing efficient facial mimicry to facilitate
   emotion recognition.}},

Abstract = {{Oxytocin appears beneficial for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and more
   than 20 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in oxytocin receptor
   (OXTR) are relevant to ASD. However, neither biological functions of
   OXTR SNPs in ASD nor critical OXTR SNPs that determine oxytocin's
   effects on ASD remains known. Here, using a machine-learning algorithm
   that was designed to evaluate collective effects of multiple SNPs and
   automatically identify most informative SNPs, we examined relationships
   between 27 representative OXTR SNPs and six types of behavioral/neural
   response to oxytocin in ASD individuals. The oxytocin effects were
   extracted from our previous placebo-controlled within-participant
   clinical trial administering single-dose intranasal oxytocin to 38
   high-functioning adult Japanese ASD males. Consequently, we identified
   six different SNP sets that could accurately predict the six different
   oxytocin efficacies, and confirmed the robustness of these SNP
   selections against variations of the datasets and analysis parameters.
   Moreover, major alleles of several prominent OXTR SNPs-including rs53576
   and rs2254298-were found to have dissociable effects on the oxytocin
   efficacies. These findings suggest biological functions of the OXTR SNP
   variants on autistic oxytocin responses, and implied that clinical
   oxytocin efficacy may be genetically predicted before its actual
   administration, which would contribute to establishment of future
   precision medicines for ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Most research on ethnicity in neuroscience and social psychology has
   focused on visual cues. However, accents are central social markers of
   ethnicity and strongly influence evaluations of others. Here, we examine
   how varying auditory (vocal accent) and visual (facial appearance)
   information about others affects neural correlates of ethnicity-related
   expectancy violations. Participants listened to standard German and
   Turkish-accented speakers and were subsequently presented with faces
   whose ethnic appearance was either congruent or incongruent to these
   voices. We expected that incongruent targets (e.g. German accent/Turkish
   face) would be paralleled by a more negative N2 event-related brain
   potential (ERP) component. Results confirmed this, suggesting that
   incongruence was related to more effortful processing of both Turkish
   and German target faces. These targets were also subjectively judged as
   surprising. Additionally, varying lateralization of ERP responses for
   Turkish and German faces suggests that the underlying neural generators
   differ, potentially reflecting different emotional reactions to these
   targets. Behavioral responses showed an effect of violated expectations:
   German-accented Turkish-looking targets were evaluated as most competent
   of all targets. We suggest that bringing together neural and behavioral
   measures of expectancy violations, and using both visual and auditory
   information, yields a more complete picture of the processes underlying
   impression formation.}},

Volume = {{131}},

Abstract = {{It has recently been recognized that orbitofrontal cortex has 2
   subdivisions that are anatomically and functionally distinct. Most
   rodent research has focused on the lateral subdivision, leaving the
   medial subdivision (mOFC) relatively unexplored. We recently showed that
   inhibiting mOFC neurons eliminated the differential impact of reward
   probability cues on discrimination accuracy in a sustained attention
   task. In the present study, we tested whether increasing mOFC neuronal
   activity in rats would accelerate acquisition of reward contingencies.
   mOFC neuronal activity was increased using the DREADD (Designer
   Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) method, in which
   clozapine-N-oxide administration leads to neuronal modulation by acting
   on synthetic receptors not normally expressed in the rat brain. We
   predicted that rats with neuronal activation in mOFC would require fewer
   sessions than controls for acquisition of a task in which visual cues
   signal the probability of reward for correct discrimination performance.
   Contrary to this prediction, mOFC neuronal activation impaired task
   acquisition, suggesting mOFC may play a role in learning relationships
   between environmental cues and reward probability or for using that
   information in adaptive decision-making. In addition, disrupted mOFC
   activity may contribute to psychiatric conditions in which learning
   associations between environmental cues and reward probability is
   impaired.}},

Abstract = {{Stroke is one of the most prominent causes of neurological disability,
   and the number of stroke cases worldwide is expected to grow due to
   increases in both average life span and population. As such, new methods
   for both acute treatment and poststroke rehabilitation will be
   increasingly necessary. Although a number of approaches to restoring
   motor function poststroke are in development, there are few methods to
   alleviate the cognitive deficits caused by this disease. As well, there
   are very few preclinical models of stroke with a specific focus on
   higher-order cognitive functions. The goal of the current experiments
   was to examine the effects of bilateral ischemic lesions, produced by
   targeted microinjections of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the medial (mPFC) and
   orbital (oPFC) prefrontal cortices of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n
   = 39) on inhibitory control as measured through a delay discounting
   paradigm. The ET-1 injections to the mPFC and oPFC resulted in average
   lesion volumes of 17.98 mm(3) +/- 2.841 mm(3) (Mean +/- SE) and 26.05
   mm(3) +/- 4.052 mm(3) (Mean +/- SE), respectively. During delay
   discounting testing, wherein animals were offered a small, immediately
   available food reward versus a large, but delayed reward, it was found
   that animals with lesions to the oPFC were more likely to choose the
   immediately available reward as compared to their mPFC or control
   counterparts. We conclude that using ET-1 in the oPFC may be a new and
   viable method to study the effects of ischemic lesions on higher-order
   cognitive dysfunction poststroke.}},

Volume = {{131}},

Abstract = {{Successful response inhibition depends upon the delay between the cues
   that signal a response and its subsequent inhibition. Previous studies
   report activity in the right presupplementary motor area (rPreSMA),
   right anterior insula (rAI), and the right striatum (rSTR) when subjects
   attempt to inhibit responses. Although these regions are anatomically
   connected, how they interact during successful and unsuccessful
   inhibitions has not been studied. In this work, we used a temporal
   prediction task, functional MRI, and dynamic causal modeling to solve
   this question. We found selective direct activation of both the rPreSMA
   and the rAI during successful and unsuccessful inhibitions which also
   were associated with opposite modulatory effects on insular-striatal and
   presupplementary-motor striatal descending connections. Moreover, inputs
   to the rPreSMA during successful inhibitions were propagated to the rAI
   whereas inputs to the rAI during unsuccessful inhibitions were
   propagated to the rPreSMA. We interpret that the direct perturbation in
   the rPreSMA and the modulation of the rPreSMA -> rSTR connections would
   facilitate response inhibition whereas weak insular activity would cause
   response inhibition to fail despite the existence of strong rAI -> rSTR
   modulations. We discuss that descending connections could be nonlinearly
   modulated via activity of either the right inferior frontal gyrus or the
   left anterior cingulate cortex. From a predictive coding perspective,
   rAI activity during successful and unsuccessful inhibition would signal
   interoceptive information when subjects unexpectedly need to change
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{The dorsal hippocampus and dorsal striatum have dissociable roles in
   learning and memory that are related to region-specific changes in
   proteins necessary for neuronal plasticity and memory formation. There
   is additional evidence that the hippocampus and striatum can interact
   during memory formation. Phosphorylation of tyrosine receptor kinase B
   is important for memory formation in the hippocampus, but whether or not
   it has a role in striatum-dependent learning, or in interactions between
   the hippocampus and striatum, has not been examined. In the present
   study, we tested the hypothesis that response training increases pTrkB
   in the dorsal striatum, but decreases pTrkB in dorsal hippocampus, due
   to an interaction between the systems during memory formation. Results
   show a significant decrease in pTrkB levels in the dorsal hippocampus of
   rats trained on the response task compared with swim controls. Response
   training did not increase pTrkB levels in the dorsal striatum. Positive
   correlations were found between response learning and the total area of
   cells expressing pTrkB in the dorsal striatum, while no correlations
   were found in swim controls. Our results partially support our
   hypothesis and indicate that response learning is associated with a
   decrease in hippocampal pTrkB, while phosphorylation of TrkB in the
   dorsal striatum remains constant. This indicates that suppression of
   hippocampal pTrkB during response learning may be involved in
   striatum-dependent memory formation. Additionally, our findings suggest
   that activation of TrkB in a sparse arrangement of cells may be
   associated with faster acquisition of a response task.}},

Abstract = {{Rats with ventral dentate gyrus (DG) lesions, sham lesions, and controls

   the ventral DG subregion of the hippocampus plays a role in pattern

   and control rats displayed a graded decrease in runway velocities,
   supporting a pattern separation process. In contrast, ventral DG
   lesioned rats continued to maintain runway velocities regardless of the
   reward-value shifts. The ventral DG lesion results do not appear to be
   due to hyperactivity but could be based on the idea that the ventral DG
   is part of a decision-making circuitry to predict goal-relevant reward
   outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that contextual fear conditioning can be supported
   by either an elemental system, where individual features of the
   environment are associated with shock, or a configural system, where
   environmental features are bound together and associated with shock.
   Although the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is known to be involved in
   contextual fear conditioning, it is not clear whether it contributes to
   the elemental or configural system. To isolate the role of the RSC in
   contextual fear conditioning, the current experiments examined the
   influence of RSC lesions on the context preexposure facilitation effect,
   a procedure known to produce conditioning to a configural representation
   of context. In Experiment 1, rats that were preexposed to the
   conditioning context froze more compared to rats that were not,
   replicating the context preexposure facilitation effect. Although
   pretraining lesions of the RSC had no impact on the context preexposure
   facilitation effect (Experiment 2a), posttraining lesions attenuated the
   effect (Experiment 2b), suggesting that the RSC normally contributes to
   a configural context representation. Retrohippocampal contributions to
   contextual fear conditioning are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies from our lab have indicated that healthy older adults
   are impaired in their ability to mnemonically discriminate between
   previously viewed objects and similar lure objects in the Mnemonic
   Similarity Task (MST). These studies have used either old/similar/new or
   old/new test formats. The forced-choice test format (e.g., ``Did you see
   object A or object A' during the encoding phase?{''}) relies on
   different assumptions than the old/new test format (e.g., ``Did you see
   this object during the encoding phase?{''}); hence, converging evidence
   from these approaches would bolster the conclusion that healthy aging is
   accompanied by impaired performance on the MST. Consistent with our
   hypothesis, healthy older adults exhibited impaired performance on a
   forced-choice test format that required discriminating between a target
   and a similar lure. We also tested the hypothesis that age-related
   impairments on the MST could be modeled within a global matching
   computational framework. We found that decreasing the probability of
   successful feature encoding in the models caused changes that were
   similar to the empirical data in healthy older adults. Collectively, our
   behavioral results using the forced-choice format extend the finding
   that healthy aging is accompanied by an impaired ability to discriminate
   between targets and similar lures, and our modeling results suggest that
   a diminished probability of encoding stimulus features is a candidate
   mechanism for memory changes in healthy aging. We also discuss the
   ability of global matching models to account for findings in other
   studies that have used variants on mnemonic similarity tasks.}},

Abstract = {{This study continues a longitudinal analysis of rhesus macaque social
   behavior following bilateral neonatal ibotenic acid lesions of the
   amygdala or hippocampus, or sham operations. The social behavior of
   female subjects was evaluated at a critical developmental time point-the
   transition to adulthood. At approximately 4 years of age, female
   subjects were housed in small groups with other female subjects and
   reproductively viable adult males. As compared with neurologically
   intact control animals and animals with early amygdala damage, animals
   with early hippocampal damage were more social with their female peers.
   In contrast, as compared with control animals, animals with early
   amygdala damage spent less time with the males, engaged less frequently
   in behaviors typical of reproductive consortships, had higher
   frequencies of self-directed stereotypies, and became pregnant later.
   Males also generated fewer communicative signals toward animals with
   early amygdala damage than to control animals and animals with early
   hippocampus damage. Rates of sexual behavior were generally low for all
   animals, and there were no lesion-based differences in their
   frequencies. Discriminant function analyses demonstrated that patterns
   of affiliative social behaviors differed across the 3 experimental
   groups, both in terms of the social behaviors directed to the males, and
   the social behaviors generated by the males toward the females. In 4 of
   the 5 social groups, amygdala-lesioned animals were lowest ranked,
   potentially contributing to reduced sociability interactions with males.
   Other potential mechanisms and the experiments needed to elucidate them
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Locus Coeruleus (LC) is a noradrenergic nucleus involved in several
   neuroendocrine and behavioral functions. During the neonatal period, the
   LC is critical for olfactory learning. Full development occurs during
   the early postnatal period. Environmental interventions after birth may
   affect neurogenesis. In rats, the neonatal handling procedure has been
   used as a model to analyze the effects of environmental intervention
   early in life. It has been related to several long-lasting behavioral
   and neuroendocrine changes. The present study analyzed the effects of
   handling on the number of neurons, cellular proliferation, and apoptosis
   in the LC of 11-day-old female rats. Wistar rat pups were submitted to
   brief maternal separation followed by handling (1 min per day from
   postnatal day {[}PND] 1 to 10). On PND 11, the LC was analyzed using
   immunohistochemistry for NeuN and BrdU, TUNEL staining, and electron
   microscopy. The intervention reduced the number of neurons in the LC but
   showed no significant change in the number of apoptotic cells, as
   measured by the TUNEL technique. However, the number of proliferating
   cells was significantly lower in the handled rat pups as compared with
   the nonhandled ones. This study demonstrates that the infant LC is
   sensitive to changes in maternal behavior. A seemingly mild
   environmental intervention during the neonatal period may reprogram the
   development of the LC, altering cell proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{Quipazine is a 5-HT2A-receptor agonist that has been used to induce
   motor activity and promote recovery of function after spinal cord injury
   in neonatal and adult rodents. Sensory stimulation also activates
   sensory and motor circuits and promotes recovery after spinal cord
   injury. In rats, tail pinching is an effective and robust method of
   sacrocaudal sensory afferent stimulation that induces motor activity,
   including alternating stepping. In this study, responsiveness to a tail
   pinch following treatment with quipazine (or saline vehicle control) was
   examined in spinal cord transected (at midthoracic level) and intact
   neonatal rats. Rat pups were secured in the supine posture with limbs
   unrestricted. Quipazine or saline was administered intraperitoneally and
   after a 10-min period, a tail pinch was administered. A 1-min baseline
   period prior to tail-pinch administration and a 1-min response period
   postpinch was observed and hind-limb motor activity, including
   locomotor-like stepping behavior, was recorded and analyzed. Neonatal
   rats showed an immediate and robust response to sensory stimulation
   induced by the tail pinch. Quipazine recovered hind-limb movement and
   step frequency in spinal rats back to intact levels, suggesting a
   synergistic, additive effect of 5-HT-receptor and sensory stimulation in
   spinal rats. Although levels of activity in spinal rats were restored
   with quipazine, movement quality (high vs. low amplitude) was only
   partially restored.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) have increased hospital
   readmission rates and mortality if they are concomitantly diagnosed with
   cognitive decline and memory loss. Accordingly, we developed a
   preclinical model of CHF-induced cognitive impairment with the goal of
   developing novel protective therapies against CHF related cognitive
   decline. CHF was induced by ligation of the left coronary artery to
   instigate a myocardial infarction (MI). By 4- and 8-weeks post-MI, CHF
   mice had approximately a 50\% and 70\% decline in ejection fraction as
   measured by echocardiography. At both 4- and 8-weeks post-MI, spatial
   memory performance in CHF mice as tested using the Morris water task was
   significantly impaired as compared with sham. In addition, CHF mice had
   significantly worse performance on object recognition when compared with
   shams as measured by discrimination ratios during the novel object
   recognition NOR task. At 8-weeks post-MI, a subgroup of CHF mice were
   given Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) (50mcg/kg/hr) subcutaneously for 4 weeks.
   Following 3 weeks treatment with systemic Ang-(1-7), the CHF mice NOR
   discrimination ratios were similar to shams and significantly better
   than the performance of CHF mice treated with saline. Ang-(1-7) also
   improved spatial memory in CHF mice as compared with shams. Ang-(1-7)
   had no effect on cardiac function. Inflammatory biomarker studies from
   plasma revealed a pattern of neuroprotection that may underlie the
   observed improvements in cognition. These results demonstrate a
   preclinical mouse model of CHF that exhibits both spatial memory and
   object recognition dysfunction. Furthermore, this CHF-induced cognitive
   impairment is attenuated by treatment with systemic Ang-(1-7).}},

Abstract = {{Adult rat ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are a valuable tool for
   noninvasively assessing an animal's emotional state. USVs are produced
   in 1 of 2 frequency ranges labeled as 22 kHz or 50 kHz vocalizations.
   One USV subtype within the 50 kHz call category, constant frequency 50
   kHz (CF 50 kHz) calls, is not viewed as signaling an emotional state.
   The current study tested the hypothesis that CF 50 kHz calls are related
   to a mild negative affective state. In Experiment 1, diazepam (1, 2.5,
   or 5 mg/kg), or control injections were administered prior to receiving
   a sequence of mild footshocks (0.5 mA, 0.5 s). Subjects transitioned
   from producing CF 50 to 22 kHz USVs as footshocks were repeated; a
   pattern paralleled by a shift from rearing to increased time freezing.
   USV production was largely absent in the higher diazepam dose groups,
   whereas the 1 mg/kg dose attenuated CF 50 kHz USV production prior to
   and immediately following initial footshocks. The higher doses of
   diazepam similarly reduced rearing activity and overall freezing
   behavior. In Experiment 2, pre-exposure to the testing environment with
   or without access to palatable food elicited CF 50 kHz calls and
   rearing. During re-exposure to the test chamber the following day, CF 50
   kHz USV production was reduced prior to footshock onset compared to the
   prior test day. The pattern of results support an association between CF
   50 kHz USVs and a mild negative affective state; dissociating this call
   type may increase the sensitivity of behavioral measurements of emotion.}},

Abstract = {{Recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies demonstrate that labeling
   one's emotional experiences and perceptions alters those states. Here,
   we used a comprehensive meta-analysis of the neuroimaging literature to
   systematically explore whether the presence of emotion words in
   experimental tasks has an impact on the neural representation of
   emotional experiences and perceptions across studies. Using a database
   of 386 studies, we assessed brain activity when emotionwords (e.g.
   `anger', `disgust') and more general affect words (e.g. `pleasant',
   `unpleasant') were present in experimental tasks vs not present. As
   predicted, when emotion words were present, we observedmore frequent
   activations in regions related to semantic processing. When emotion
   wordswere not present, we observed more frequent activations in the
   amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, bilaterally. The presence of
   affectwords did not have the same effect on the neural representation of
   emotional experiences and perceptions, suggesting that our observed
   effects are specific to emotion words. These findings are consistentwith
   the psychological constructionist prediction that in the absence of
   accessible emotion concepts, the meaning of affective experiences and
   perceptions are ambiguous. Findings are also consistentwith the
   regulatory role of `affect labeling'. Implications of the role of
   language in emotion construction and regulation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Social groups aid human beings in several ways, ranging from the
   fulfillment of complex social and personal needs to the promotion of
   survival. Despite the importance of group affiliation to humans, there
   remains considerable variation in group preferences across development.
   In the current study, children and adolescents completed an explicit
   evaluation task of ingroup and out-group members during functional
   neuroimaging. We found that participants displayed age-related increases
   in bilateral amygdala, fusiformgyrus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
   activation when viewing in-group relative to out-group faces. Moreover,
   we found an indirect effect of age on in-group favoritism via brain
   activation in the amygdala, fusiform and OFC. Finally, with age, youth
   showed greater functional coupling between the amygdala and several
   neural regions when viewing in-group relative to out-group peers,
   suggesting a role of the amygdala in directing attention to
   motivationally relevant cues. Our findings suggest that the motivational
   significance and processing of group membership undergoes important
   changes across development.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the ubiquity of endogenous emotions and their role in both
   resilience and pathology, the processes supporting their generation are
   largely unknown. We propose a neural component processmodel of
   endogenous generation of emotion (EGE) and test it in two functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments (N = 32/293) where
   participants generated and regulated positive and negative emotions
   based on internal representations, usin self-chosen generationmethods.
   EGE activated nodes of salience (SN), defaultmode (DMN) and
   frontoparietal control (FPCN) networks. Component processes implemented
   by these networks were established by investigating their functional
   associations, activation dynamics and integration. SN activation
   correlated with subjective affect, withmidbrain nodes exclusively
   distinguishing between positive and negative affect intensity, showing
   dynamics consistent generation of core affect. Dorsomedial DMN, together
   with ventral anterior insula, formed a pathway supportingmultiple
   generationmethods, with activation dynamics suggesting it is involved in
   the generation of elaborated experiential representations. SN and DMN
   both coupled to left frontal FPCN which in turn was associated with both
   subjective affect and representation formation, consistent with FPCN
   supporting the executive coordination of the generation process. These
   results provide a foundation for research into endogenous emotion in
   normal, pathological and optimal function.}},

Abstract = {{Therapeutic alliance and perceived social support are important
   predictors of treatment response for post-traumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD). Intranasal oxytocin administration may enhance treatment
   response by increasing sensitivity for social reward and thereby
   therapeutic alliance and perceived social support. As a first step to
   investigate this therapeutical potential, we investigated whether
   intranasal oxytocin enhances neural sensitivity to social reward in PTSD
   patients. Male and female police officers with (n = 35) and without PTSD
   (n = 37) were included in a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled
   cross- over fMRI study. After intranasal oxytocin (40 IU) and placebo
   administration, a social incentive delay task was conducted to
   investigate neural responses during social reward and punishment
   anticipation and feedback. Under placebo, PTSD patients showed reduced
   left anterior insula (AI) responses to social rewards (i. e. happy
   faces) compared with controls. Oxytocin administration increased left AI
   responses during social reward in PTSD patients, such that PTSD patients
   no longer differed from controls under placebo. Furthermore, in PTSD
   patients, oxytocin increased responses to social reward in the right
   putamen. By normalizing abberant insula responses and increasing putamen
   responses to social reward, oxytocin administration may enhance
   sensitivity for social support and therapeutic alliance in PTSD
   patients. Future studies are needed to investigate clinical effects of
   oxytocin.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by
   severe deficits in social communication, whereby the nature of their
   impairments in emotional prosody processing have yet to be specified.
   Here, we investigated emotional prosody processing in individuals with
   ASD and controls with novel, lifelike behavioral and neuroimaging
   paradigms. Compared to controls, individuals with ASD showed reduced
   emotional prosody recognition accuracy on a behavioral task. On the
   neural level, individuals with ASD displayed reduced activity of the
   STS, insula and amygdala for complex vs basic emotions compared to
   controls. Moreover, the coupling between the STS and amygdala for
   complex vs basic emotions was reduced in the ASD group. Finally, groups
   differed with respect to the relationship between brain activity and
   behavioral performance. Brain activity during emotional prosody
   processing was more strongly related to prosody recognition accuracy in
   ASD participants. In contrast, the coupling between STS and anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC) activity predicted behavioral task performance
   more strongly in the control group. These results provide evidence for
   aberrant emotional prosody processing of individuals with ASD. They
   suggest that the differences in the relationship between the neural and
   behavioral level of individuals with ASD may account for their observed
   deficits in social communication.}},

Abstract = {{The onset of adolescence is associated with an increased tendency to
   engage in risky behaviors and a developmental shift toward peers that
   contributes to increased prioritization for learning about and achieving
   social status. There is relatively little understanding about the
   specific links between these adolescent-typical phenomena, particularly
   regarding their neural underpinnings. Based on existing models that
   suggest the role of puberty in promoting adolescent status-seeking and
   risk-taking tendencies, we investigated the relation of pubertal
   hormones with behavioral and neural responses to statusrelevant social
   information in the context of risk taking. We used a probabilistic
   decision task in which 11-to 13-year-old girls chose to take a risk, or
   not, while receiving either social rank or monetary performance
   feedback. While feedback type did not differentially influence
   risk-taking behavior, whole-brain imaging results showed that activation
   in the anterior insula was increased for risk taking in the social rank
   feedback condition compared to the monetary feedback condition. This
   heightened activation was more pronounced in girls with higher estradiol
   levels. These findings suggest that brain processes involved in
   adolescent risky decisions may be influenced by the desire for
   social-status enhancement and provide preliminary evidence for the role
   of pubertal hormones in enhancing this adolescent-typical social
   sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive models posit that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated
   with and maintained by attentional bias (AB) for social threat. However,
   over the last years, it has been suggested that AB in SAD may result
   from a decreased activation of the left prefrontal cortex, and
   particularly of its dorsolateral part (dlPFC). Accordingly, a transient
   increase of neural activity within the left dlPFC via non-invasive brain
   stimulation decreases AB in non-anxious control participants. Yet, none
   of these studies focused on SAD. This is especially unfortunate as SAD
   constitutes the main target for which a genuine reduction of AB may be
   most appropriate. In this experiment, we sought to investigate the
   causal influence of left dlPFC neuromodulation on AB among 19 female
   individuals with a DSM-5 diagnosis of SAD. We adopted a double-blind
   within-subject protocol in which we delivered a single-session of anodal
   versus sham transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) over the left
   dlPFC during the completion of a probe discrimination task assessing AB.
   Consistent with our hypothesis, participants demonstrated a significant
   decrease in AB during the anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC relative to
   the sham stimulation. These findings value tDCS as an innovative
   procedure to gain new insight into the underlying mechanisms of SAD.}},

Abstract = {{Childhood family adversity (CFA) increases the risk for conduct disorder
   (CD) and has been associated with alterations in regions of affective
   processing like ventral striatum (VS) and amygdala. However, no study so
   far has demonstrated neural converging effects of CFA and CD in the same
   sample. At age 25 years, functional MRI data during two affective tasks,
   i. e. a reward (N = 171) and a face-matching paradigm (N = 181) and
   anatomical scans (N = 181) were acquired in right-handed currently
   healthy participants of an epidemiological study followed since birth.
   CFA during childhood was determined using a standardized parent
   interview. Disruptive behaviors and CD diagnoses during childhood and
   adolescence were obtained by diagnostic interview (2-19 years),
   temperamental reward dependence was assessed by questionnaire (15 and 19
   years). CFA predicted increased CD and amygdala volume. Both exposure to
   CFA and CD were associated with a decreased VS response during reward
   anticipation and blunted amygdala activity during face-matching. CD
   mediated the effect of CFA on brain activity. Temperamental reward
   dependence was negatively correlated with CFA and CD and positively with
   VS activity. These findings underline the detrimental effects of CFA on
   the offspring's affective processing and support the importance of early
   postnatal intervention programs aiming to reduce childhood adversity
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Next to social problems, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
   often report severe sensory difficulties. Altered processing of touch is
   however a stronger mediator of social symptoms' severity than altered
   processing of for instance vision or audition. Why is this the case? We
   reasoned that sensory difficulties may be linked to social problems in
   ASD through insufficient self-other distinction centred on touch. We
   investigated by means of EEG whether the brain of adults with ASD
   adequately signals when a tactile consequence of an observed action does
   not match own touch, as compared to the brain of matched controls. We
   employed the action-based somatosensory congruency paradigm.
   Participants observed a human or wooden hand touching a surface,
   combined with a tap-like tactile sensation that either matched or
   mismatched the tactile consequence of the observed movement. The ASD
   group showed a diminished congruency effect for human hands only in the
   P3-complex, suggesting difficulties with signalling observed
   action-based touch of others that does not match own touch experiences.
   Crucially, this effect reliably correlated with self-reported social and
   sensory everyday difficulties in ASD. The findings might denote a novel
   theoretical link between sensory and social impairments in the autism
   spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Designing persuasive content is challenging, in part because people can
   be poor predictors of their actions. Medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)
   activation during message exposure reliably predicts downstreambehavior,
   but past work has been largely atheoretical. We replicated past results
   on this relationship and tested two additional framing effects known to
   alter message receptivity. First, we examined gain-vs. loss-framed
   reasons for a health behavior (sunscreen use). Consistent with
   predictions from prospect theory, we observed greater MPFC activity to
   gain-vs. loss-framed messages, and this activity was associated with
   behavior. This relationship was stronger for those who were not
   previously sunscreen users. Second, building on theories of action
   planning, we compared neural activity during messages regarding how vs.
   why to enact the behavior. We observed rostral inferior parietal lobule
   and posterior inferior frontal gyrus activity during action planning
   ({''}how{''} messages), and this activity was associated with behavior;
   this is in contrast to the relationship between MPFC activity during the
   `` why{''} (i. e., gain and loss) messages and behavior. These results
   reinforce that persuasion occurs in part via self-value
   integration-seeing value and incorporating persuasive messages into
   one's self-concept-and extend this work to demonstrate how message
   framing and action planning may influence this process.}},

Abstract = {{Rumination, and particularly ruminative brooding, perpetuates dysphoric
   mood states and contributes to the emergence of depression. Studies of
   adults and older adolescents have characterized the association between
   rumination and intrinsic functional connectivity within default mode
   (DMN), salience (SN) and executive control (ECN) networks; we know
   little, however, about the brain network basis of rumination during
   early puberty, a sensitive period for network reorganization. 112 early
   puberty boys and girls completed resting-state scans, the Ruminative
   Response Scale, and the Youth Self-Report questionnaire. Using
   independent components analysis and dual regression, we quantified
   coherence for each individual in networks of interest (SN, ECN, DMN) and
   in non-relevant networks (motor, visual) in which we predicted no
   correlations with behavioral measures. Boys and girls did not differ in
   levels of rumination or internalizing symptoms, or in coherence for any
   network. The relation between SN network coherence and rumination;
   however, and specifically ruminative brooding, was moderated by sex:
   greater SN coherence was associated with higher levels of brooding in
   girls but not in boys. Further, in girls, brooding mediated the relation
   between SN coherence and internalizing symptoms. These results point to
   coherence within the SN as a potential neurodevelopmental marker of risk
   for depression in early pubertal girls.}},

Abstract = {{Dopamine plays an important role in goal-directed behavior, through its
   modulatory influence on striatal neurons. It is unclear whether tonic
   dopamine levels, which regulate the vigor of acting, interact with the
   phasic dopamine response to reward that drives instrumental behavior. In
   a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy volunteers, we show
   that methylphenidate, a drug that increases tonic dopamine levels,
   systematically reduced striatal phasic BOLD responses to gain and loss
   in a gambling task as measured with fMRI. It also increased response
   vigor and reward expectancy-related BOLD signals in the ventral
   striatum. These findings suggest that striatal tonic dopamine levels
   constitute an average reward expectation signal that modulates the

Abstract = {{Eye contact occurs frequently and voluntarily during face-to-face verbal
   communication. However, the neural mechanisms underlying eye contact
   when it is accompanied by spoken language remain unexplored to date.
   Here we used a novel approach, fixation-based event-related functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to simulate the listener making eye
   contact with a speaker during verbal communication. Participants' eye
   movements and fMRI data were recorded simultaneously while they were
   freely viewing a pre-recorded speaker talking. The eye tracking data
   were then used to define events for the fMRI analyses. The results
   showed that eye contact in contrast to mouth fixation involved visual
   cortical areas (cuneus, calcarine sulcus), brain regions related to
   theory of mind/ intentionality processing (temporoparietal junction,
   posterior superior temporal sulcus, medial prefrontal cortex) and the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, increased effective
   connectivity was found between these regions for eye contact in contrast
   to mouth fixations. The results provide first evidence for neural
   mechanisms underlying eye contact when watching and listening to another
   person talking. The network we found might be well suited for processing
   the intentions of communication partners during eye contact in verbal
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{Today's stressors largely arise from social interactions rather than
   from physical threat. However, the dominant laboratory model of
   emotional learning relies on physical stimuli (e. g. electric shock)
   whereas adequate models of social conditioning are missing, possibly due
   to more subtle and multilayered biobehavioral responses to such stimuli.
   To fill this gap, we acquired a broad set of measures during
   conditioning to negative social unconditioned stimuli, also taking into
   account long-termmaintenance of conditioning and inter-individual
   differences. Fifty-nine healthy participants underwent a classical
   conditioning task with videos of actors expressing disapproving (US-neg)
   or neutral (US-neu) statements. Static images of the corresponding
   actors with a neutral facial expression served as CS+and CS-, predicting
   US-neg and US-neu, respectively. Autonomic and facial-muscular measures
   confirmed differential unconditioned responding whereas experiential CS
   ratings, event-related potentials, and evoked theta oscillations
   confirmed differential conditioned responding. Conditioning was
   maintained at 1 month and 1 year follow-ups on experiential ratings,
   especially in individuals with elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms,
   documenting the efficiency of social conditioning and its clinical
   relevance. This novel, ecologically improved conditioning paradigm
   uncovered}},

Abstract = {{Non-verbal communication plays a major role in social interaction
   understanding. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we explored
   the development of the neural networks involved in social interaction
   recognition based on human motion in children (8-11), adolescents
   (13-17), and adults (20-41). Participants watched point-light videos
   depicting two actors interacting or moving independently and were asked
   whether these agents were interacting or not. All groups successfully
   performed the discrimination task, but children had a lower performance
   and longer response times than the older groups. In all three groups,
   the posterior parts of the superior temporal sulci and middle temporal
   gyri, the inferior frontal gyri and the anterior temporal lobes showed
   greater activation when observing social interactions. In addition,
   adolescents and adults recruited the caudate nucleus and some frontal
   regions that are part of the mirror system. Adults showed greater
   activations in parietal and frontal regions (part of them belonging to
   the social brain) than adolescents. An increased number of regions that
   are part of themirror systemnetwork or the social brain, as well as the
   caudate nucleus, were recruited with age. In conclusion, a shared set of
   brain regions enabling the discrimination of social interactions from
   neutralmovements through humanmotion is already present in 8-year-old
   children. Developmental processes such as refinements in the social
   brain andmirror systemwould help grasping subtle cues in non-verbal
   aspects of social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The tongue holds a unique role in gustatory disgust. However, it is
   unclear whether the tongue representation in themotor cortex (tM1) is
   affected by the sight of distaste-related stimuli. Using
   transcranialmagnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy humans, we recorded
   tonguemotor-evoked potentials (MEPs) as an index of tM1
   cortico-hypoglossal excitability. MEPs were recorded while participants
   viewed pictures associated with gustatory disgust and revulsion (i. e.
   rotten foods and faces expressing distaste), non-oral-related disgusting
   stimuli (i. e. invertebrates like worms) and control stimuli. We found
   that oralrelated disgust pictures suppressed tM1 cortico-hypoglossal
   output. This tM1 suppression was predicted by interindividual
   differences in disgust sensitivity. No similar suppression was found for
   disgusting invertebrates or whenMEPs were recorded froma controlmuscle.
   These findings suggest that revulsion-eliciting food pictures trigger
   anticipatory inhibitionmechanisms, possibly preventing toxin swallowing
   and contamination. A similar suppression is elicited when viewing
   distaste expressions, suggesting vicariousmotor inhibition during social

   ASD, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which
   26 high-functioning adults with ASD and 24 typically developed (TD)
   controls were asked to decide whether an adjective describing a
   personality trait correctly described the participant himself/herself
   ({''}self{''}) or the participant's mother ({''}other{''}) by taking
   either the first (1P) or third person (3P) perspective. We observed that
   functional connectivity between the left sensorimotor cortex and the
   left middle cingulate cortex was enhanced in TD control individuals
   taking the 3P perspective, this enhancement was significantly reduced in
   ASD, and the degree of reduction was significantly correlated with the
   severity of autistic traits. Furthermore, the self-reference effect on
   functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal cortex and
   frontopolar cortices was significantly enhanced in TD control
   individuals taking the 3P perspective, whereas such effect was reversed
   in ASD. These findings indicate altered effects of perspective on the
   functional connectivity, which may underlie the deficits in social
   interaction and communication observed in individuals with ASD.}},

   Schwartz's circumplex model of values predicts a sinusoidal waveform in

   participants, we found the predicted sinusoidal relationship between
   ratings of values types and two measures of white matter (WM), volume
   and myelin volume fraction, as well as for grey matter (GM) parameters
   in several frontal regions. These effects reveal new functional
   associations for structural brain parameters and provide a novel
   cross-validation of Schwartz's model. Moreover, the sinusoidal waveform

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{685-700}},
Abstract = {{To explore how cultural immersion modulates emotion processing, this
   study examined how Chinese immigrants to Canada process multisensory
   emotional expressions, which were compared to existing data from two
   groups, Chinese and North Americans. Stroop and Oddball paradigms were
   employed to examine different stages of emotion processing. The Stroop
   task presented face-voice pairs expressing congruent/incongruent
   emotions and participants actively judged the emotion of one modality
   while ignoring the other. A significant effect of cultural immersion was
   observed in the immigrants' behavioral performance, which showed greater
   interference from to-be-ignored faces, comparable with what was observed
   in North Americans. However, this effect was absent in their N400 data,
   which retained the same pattern as the Chinese. In the Oddball task,
   where immigrants passively viewed facial expressions with/without
   simultaneous vocal emotions, they exhibited a larger visual MMN for
   faces accompanied by voices, again mirroring patterns observed in
   Chinese. Correlation analyses indicated that the immigrants' living
   duration in Canada was associated with neural patterns (N400 and visual
   mismatch negativity) more closely resembling North Americans. Our data
   suggest that in multisensory emotion processing, adopting to a new
   culture first leads to behavioral accommodation followed by alterations
   in brain activities, providing new evidence on human's neurocognitive
   plasticity in communication.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study we investigated the nature and chronometry of
   empathy for pain influences on perceptual and motor processes. Thus,
   event-related brain potentials (ERPs), response force (RF) and
   oscillatory electroencephalography (EEG) activity were measured while
   participants were presented with pictures of body parts in painful or
   neutral situations. Their task consisted in either judging the
   painfulness of the stimuli or counting the body parts displayed. ERP
   results supported the assumption of an early automatic component of
   empathy for pain, as reflected by the early posterior negativity (EPN),
   and of a late controlled component, as reflected by the late posterior
   positivity (P3). RF indicated that empathy-evoking stimuli facilitate
   motor responses if attention is directed toward the pain dimension,
   whereas EEG oscillations in the mu-and beta-band revealed, independent
   of the task, an enhanced activation of the sensorimotor cortex after the
   response to painful compared to neutral stimuli. In conclusion, present
   findings indicate that empathy-evoking stimuli produce automatic and
   controlled effects on both perceptual and motor processing.}},

Abstract = {{The main focus of the current study was to assess whether executive

   enrolled at secondary and higher secondary levels and ranged in age
   between 13-19 years (M = 15.5, SD = 1.3). Participants were assessed on
   a self-report measure of aggression and two punishment measures, in
   addition to a demographic sheet. Then, they were individually assessed
   on four tests taken from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Functions System
   (D-KEFS) namely Trial Making Test (TMT), Design Fluency Test (DFT),
   Color Word Interference Test (CWIT), and Card Sorting Test (CST) to
   assess cognitive flexibility, nonverbal fluency, inhibition, and
   problem-solving ability, respectively. Correlation coefficients
   indicated that all four executive functioning measures and the two
   punishment measures were significantly correlated with aggression.
   Moderation analysis indicated that all EFs moderated the relationship
   between physical punishment and aggression, and only inhibition and
   problem-solving ability, but not cognitive flexibility and nonverbal
   fluency, moderated the relations between symbolic punishment and

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{730-742}},
Abstract = {{False belief (FB) reasoning is a key Theory of Mind (ToM) competence. By
   4 years of age, children understand that a person's behavior can be
   based on a FB about reality. Children cannot understand that a person's
   emotion can also be based on a FB before the age of six. In order to
   generate hypothesis on basic processes distinguishing these two types of
   belief reasoning, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging
   study in adults directly compares functional activity associated with
   these two FB tasks. Both tasks were associated with activity in the ToM
   network including the medial prefrontal cortex and the left
   temporo-parietal junction. Differential activity was observed in the
   anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for FB-based emotion relative to
   behavior attribution. Contrary to FB behavior attribution, FB-based
   emotion attribution requires the processing of two different mental
   states: a belief and an emotion and their relation to each other. The
   activity pattern may reflect the differential demands on cognitive
   processes associated with the two different belief-based attribution
   processes. These results shed new light on the still ongoing debate
   about the nature of the developmental lag between the two FB tasks.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{751-768}},
Abstract = {{The perceptual-attentional limitation hypothesis posits that the
   confusion between emotional facial expressions of fear and surprise may
   be due to their visual similarity, with shared muscle movements. In
   Experiment 1 full face images of fear and surprise varying as a function
   of distinctiveness (mouth index, brow index, or both indices) were
   displayed in a gender oddball task. Experiment 2, in a similar task,
   directed attention toward the eye or mouth region with a blurring
   technique. The current two studies used response time and event-related
   potentials (ERP) to test the perceptual-attentional limitation
   hypothesis. While ERP results for Experiment 1 suggested that
   individuals may not have perceived a difference between the emotional
   expressions in any of the conditions, response time results suggested
   that individuals processed a difference between fear and surprise when a
   distinctive cue was in the mouth. With directed attention in Experiment
   2, ERP results indicated that individuals were capable of detecting a
   difference in all the conditions. In effect, the current two experiments
   suggest that participants display difficulty in distinguishing the
   prototypes of fear and surprise with the eye region, which may be due to
   a lack of attention to that region, providing support for the
   attentional limitation hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{The science of emotion has been using folk psychology categories derived
   from philosophy to search for the brain basis of emotion. The last two
   decades of neuroscience research have brought us to the brink of a
   paradigm shift in understanding the workings of the brain, however,
   setting the stage to revolutionize our understanding of what emotions
   are and how they work. In this article, we begin with the structure and
   function of the brain, and from there deduce what the biological basis
   of emotions might be. The answer is a brain-based, computational account
   called the theory of constructed emotion.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{489-493}},
Abstract = {{There is a long-standing debate on the influence of physiological
   signals on social behavior. Recent studies suggested that heart rate
   variability (HRV) may be a marker of social cognitive processes.
   However, this evidence is preliminary and limited to laboratory studies.
   In this study, 25 participants were assessed with a social cognition
   battery and asked to wear a wearable device measuring HRV for 6
   consecutive days. The results showed that reduced HRV correlated with
   higher hostility attribution bias. However, no relationship was found
   between HRV and other social cognitive measures including facial emotion
   recognition, theory of mind or emotional intelligence. These results
   suggest that HRV may be linked to specific social cognitive processes
   requiring online emotional processing, in particular those related to
   social threat. These findings are discussed in the context of the
   neurovisceral integration model.}},

Title = {{Neural evidence of motivational conflict between social values}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{494-505}},
Abstract = {{Motivational interdependence is an organizing principle in Schwartz's
   circumplex model of social values, which has received abundant
   cross-cultural support. We used fMRI to test whether motivational
   relations between social values predict different brain responses in a
   situation of choice between values. We hypothesized that differences in
   brain responses would become evident when the more important value had
   to be selected in pairs of congruent (e.g., wealth and success) as
   opposed to incongruent (e.g., curiosity and stability) values as they
   are described in Schwartz's model, because the former serve mutually
   facilitating motives, whereas the latter serve mutually inhibiting
   motives. Consistent with the model, choosing between congruent values
   led to longer response times and more activation in conflict-related
   brain regions (e.g., the supplementary motor area, dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex) than selecting between incongruent values. These
   results provide novel neural evidence supporting the circumplex model's
   predictions about motivational interdependence between social values. In
   particular, our results show that the neural networks underlying social
   values are organized in a way that allows activation patterns related to
   motivational similarity between congruent values to be dissociated from
   those related to incongruent values.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{506-518}},
Abstract = {{The mentalizing network is atypically activated in autism and
   schizophrenia spectrum disorders. While these disorders are considered
   diagnostically independent, expressions of both can co-occur in the same
   individual. We examined the concurrent effect of autism traits and
   psychosis proneness on the activity of the mentalizing network in 24
   neurotypical adults while performing a social competitive game.
   Activations were observed in the paracingulate cortex and the right
   temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). Autism traits and psychosis proneness
   did not modulate activity within the paracingulate or the dorsal
   component of the rTPJ. However, diametric modulations of autism traits
   and psychosis proneness were observed in the posterior (rvpTPJ) and
   anterior (rvaTPJ) subdivisions of the ventral rTPJ, which respectively
   constitute core regions within the mentalizing and attention-reorienting
   networks. Within the rvpTPJ, increasing autism tendencies decreased
   activity, and increasing psychosis proneness increased activity. This
   effect was reversed within the rvaTPJ. We suggest that this results from
   an interaction between regions responsible for higher level social
   cognitive processing (rvpTPJ) and regions responsible for domain-general
   attentional processes (rvaTPJ). The observed diametric modulation of
   autism tendencies and psychosis proneness of neuronal activity within
   the mentalizing network highlights the importance of assessing both
   autism and psychosis expressions within the individual.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{519-529}},
Abstract = {{Parental reflective functioning refers to the capacity for a parent to
   understand their own and their infant's mental states, and how these
   mental states relate to behavior. Higher levels of parental reflective
   functioning may be associated with greater sensitivity to infant
   emotional signals in fostering adaptive and responsive caregiving. We
   investigated this hypothesis by examining associations between parental
   reflective functioning and neural correlates of infant face and cry
   perception using event-related potentials (ERPs) in a sample of recent
   mothers. We found both early and late ERPs were associated with
   different components of reflective functioning. These findings suggest
   that parental reflective functioning may be associated with the neural
   correlates of infant cue perception and further support the value of
   enhancing reflective functioning as a mechanism in parenting
   intervention programs.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{530-540}},
Abstract = {{The ultimatum game (UG) is an endowment sharing game in which a proposer
   suggests a division of an asset to a recipient, who must accept or
   reject it. Economic studies showed that despite recipients usually
   rejecting unfair offers, perception and reaction to unfairness are
   highly dependent on who is the proposer. Event-related potentials (ERPs)
   commonly detected in UG games are the medial frontal negativity (MFN), a
   component detected in recipients facing unfair offers, and the P300, a
   component related to attentional and memory processes. Given this, we
   aimed to investigate the behavioral and ERP responses of healthy people
   playing the UG game with Down syndrome (DS) and typical development (TD)
   proposers. Nineteen subjects participated in this study. The UG
   behavioral data were similar to previous studies. ERP analysis showed no
   MFN in participants facing unfair offers. A higher P300 amplitude was
   detected when participants faced fair offers from TD compared to DS fair
   offers. We also found a positive correlation between P300 amplitude for
   TD offers and self-esteem scale score. Together these findings indicate
   that insertion of an atypical player in the UG led to changes in
   participants' perception and expectancy of the game.}},

   to either receive autosuggestion or not. Autosuggestion was recorded in
   a tape to be heard daily for 30 days. Both groups received the standard
   medical therapy. Primary outcome was quality of life by COOP chart.
   Secondary outcomes were serum cortisol level, interleukin-2,
   interleukin-6, interferon-, and N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio in
   limbic/paralimbic system by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The study
   was single blinded due to the nature of the intervention
   studied.Results: Out of 60 subjects, 51 finished the study. The
   autosuggestion group reported better scores than the control one for
   quality of life, COOP chart 1.95 vs. 2.22 (95\% CI, p=0.02). There were
   increments of serum cortisol (p=0.03) and interleukin-6 in the
   autosuggestion group (p=0.04). Interleukin-2, interferon-, and
   N-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio in prefrontal cortex showed a tendency
   to increase in the autosuggestion groups.Conclusion: Autosuggestion is
   associated with improvement of geriatrics' quality of life, serum
   cortisol level, and adaptive immunity. There is a better trend for
   neuroplasticity in prefrontal cortex in the autosuggestion group.}},

Abstract = {{Coding the direction of others' gestures is a fundamental human ability,
   since it allows the observer to attend and react to sources of potential
   interest in the environment. Shifts of attention triggered by action
   observation have been reported to occur early in infancy. Yet, the
   neurophysiological underpinnings of such action priming and the
   properties of gestures that might be crucial for it remain unknown.
   Here, we addressed these issues by recording electroencephalographic
   activity (EEG) from 6-month-old infants cued with spatially
   non-predictive hand grasping toward or away from the position of a
   target object, i.e., valid and invalid trials, respectively. Half of the
   infants were cued with a gesture executable by a human hand (possible
   gesture) and the other half with a gesture impossible to be executed by
   a human hand. Results show that the amplitude enhancement of the
   posterior N290 component in response to targets in valid trials, as
   compared to invalid trials, was present only for infants seeing possible
   gestures, while it was absent for infants seeing impossible gestures.
   These findings suggest that infants detect the biomechanical properties
   of human movements when processing hand gestures, relying on this
   information to orient their visual attention toward the target object.}},

Title = {{An fMRI and effective connectivity study investigating miss errors

Journal = {{SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{570-581}},
Abstract = {{As society becomes more reliant on machines and automation,
   understanding how people utilize advice is a necessary endeavor. Our
   objective was to reveal the underlying neural associations during advice
   utilization from expert human and machine agents with fMRI and
   multivariate Granger causality analysis. During an X-ray
   luggage-screening task, participants accepted or rejected good or bad
   advice from either the human or machine agent framed as experts with
   manipulated reliability (high miss rate). We showed that the
   machine-agent group decreased their advice utilization compared to the
   human-agent group and these differences in behaviors during advice
   utilization could be accounted for by high expectations of reliable
   advice and changes in attention allocation due to miss errors. Brain
   areas involved with the salience and mentalizing networks, as well as
   sensory processing involved with attention, were recruited during the
   task and the advice utilization network consisted of attentional
   modulation of sensory information with the lingual gyrus as the driver
   during the decision phase and the fusiform gyrus as the driver during
   the feedback phase. Our findings expand on the existing literature by
   showing that misses degrade advice utilization, which is represented in
   a neural network involving salience detection and self-processing with
   perceptual integration.}},
